into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations introduction and plan of the work  the annual labor of every nation is the fund which originally supplied it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes and which consist always either in the immediate produce of that labor or in what is purchased with that produce from other nations  according therefore as this produce or what is purchased with it bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it the nation will be better or worse supplied with all the necessaries and conveniences for which it has occasion  but this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances first by the skill dexterity and judgment with which labor is generally applied in it and secondly by the proportion between the number of those who are employed in useful labor and that of those who are not so employed whatever be the soil climate or extent of territory of any particular nation the abundance or scantiness of its annual supply must in that particular situation depend upon those two circumstances  the abundance or scantiness of this supply too seems to depend more upon the former of those two circumstances than upon the latter among the savage nations of hunters and fishers every individual who is able to work is more or less employed in useful labor and endeavors to provide as well as he can the necessaries and conveniences of life for himself and such of his family or tribe as are either too old or too young or too infirm to go a hunting and fishing such nations however are so miserably poor that from mere want they are frequently reduced or at least think themselves reduced to the necessity sometimes of directly destroying and sometimes of abandoning their infants their old people and those afflicted with lingering diseases to perish with hunger or to be devoured by wild beasts among civilized and thriving nations on the contrary though a great number of people do not labor at all many of whom confume the produce of ten times frequently of a hundred times more labor than the greater part of those who work yet the produce of the whole labor of the society is so great that all are often abundantly supplied and a workman even of the lowest and poorest order if he is frugal and industrious may enjoy a greater share of the necessaries and conveniences of life than it is possible for any savage to acquire  the causes of this improvement in the productive powers of labor and the order according to which its produce is naturally distributed among the different ranks and conditions of men in the society make the subject of the first book of this inquiry  whatever be the actual state of the skill dexterity and judgment with which labor is applied in any nation the abundance or scantiness of its annual supply must depend during the continuance of that state upon the proportion between the number of those who are annually employed in useful labor and that of those who are not so employed the number of useful and productive laborers it will hereafter appear is every where in proportion to the quantity of capital stock which is employed in setting them to work and to the particular way in which it is so employed the second book therefore treats of the nature of capital stock of the manner in which it is gradually accumulated and of the different quantities of labor which it puts into motion according to the different ways in which it is employed  nations tolerably well advanced as to skill dexterity and judgment in the application of labor have followed very different plans in the general conduct or direction of it and those plans have not all been equally favorable to the greatness of its produce the policy of some nations has given extraordinary encouragement to the industry of the country that of others to the industry of towns scarce any nation has dealt equally and impartially with every sort of industry since the downfall of the roman empire the policy of europe has been more favorable to arts manufactures and commerce the industry of towns than to agriculture the industry of the country the circumstances which seem to have introduced and established this policy are explained in the third book  though those different plans were perhaps first introduced by the private interests and prejudices of particular orders of men without any regard to or foresight of their consequences upon the general welfare of the society yet they have given occasion to very different theories of political economy of which some magnify the importance of that industry which is carried on in towns others of that which is carried on in the country those theories have had a considerable influence not only upon the opinions of men of learning but upon the public conduct of princes and sovereign states i have endeavored in the fourth book to explain as fully and distinctly as i can those different theories and the principal effects which they have produced in different ages and nations  in what has consisted the revenue of the great body of the people or what is the nature of those funds which in different ages and nations have supplied their annual consumption is treated of in these four first books the fifth and last book treats of the revenue of the sovereign or commonwealth in this book i have endeavored to show first what are the necessary expenses of the sovereign or commonwealth which of those expenses ought to be defrayed by the general contribution of the whole society and which of them by that of some particular part only or of some particular members of the society secondly what are the different methods in which the whole society may be made to contribute toward defraying the expenses incumbent on the whole society and what are the principal advantages and inconveniences of each of those methods and thirdly and lastly what are the reasons and causes which have induced almost all modern governments to mortgage some part of this revenue or to contract debts and what have been the effects of those debts upon the real wealth the annual produce of the land and labor of the society  book i of the causes of improvement in the productive powers of labor and of the order according to which its produce is naturally distributed among the different ranks of the people  chap i of the division of labor the greatest improvements in the productive powers of labor and the greater part of the skill dexterity and judgment with which it is any where directed or applied seem to have been the effects of the division of labor  the effects of the division of labor in the general business of society will be more easily understood by considering in what manner it operates in some particular manufactures it is commonly supposed to be carried furthest in some very trifling ones not perhaps that it really is carried further in them than in others of more importance but in those trifling manufactures which are destined to supply the small wants of but a small number of people the whole number of workmen must necessarily be small and those employed in every different branch of the work can often be collected into the same workhouse and placed at once under the view of the spectator in those great manufactures on the contrary which are destined to supply the great wants of the great body of the people every different branch of the work employs so great a number of workmen that it is impossible to collect them all into the same workhouse we can seldom see more at one time than those employed in one single branch though in them therefore the work may really be divided into a much greater number of parts than in those of a more trifling nature the division is not near so obvious and has accordingly been much less observed  to take an example therefore from a very trifling manufacture but one in which the division of labor has been very often taken notice of the trade of the pinmaker a workman not educated to this business which the division of labor has rendered a distinct trade nor acquainted with the use of the machinery employed in it to the invention of which the same division of labor has probably given occasion could scarce perhaps with his utmost industry make one pin in a day and certainly could not make twenty but in the way in which this business is now carried on not only the whole work is a peculiar trade but it is divided into a number of branches of which the greater part are likewise peculiar trades one man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper and the important business of making a pin is in this manner divided into about eighteen distinct operations which in some manufactories are all performed by distinct hands though in others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them i have seen a small manufactory of this kind where ten men only were employed and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations but though they were very poor and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery they could when they exerted themselves make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day there are in a pound upwards of four thousand pins of a middling size those ten persons therefore could make among them upwards of fortyeight thousand pins in a day each person therefore making a tenth part of fortyeight thousand pins might be considered as making four thousand eight hundred pins in a day but if they had all wrought separately and independently and without any of them having been educated to this peculiar business they certainly could not each of them have made twenty perhaps not one pin in a day that is certainly not the two hundred and fortieth perhaps not the four thousand eight hundredth part of what they are at present capable of performing in consequence of a proper division and combination of their different operations  in every other art and manufacture the effects of the division of labor are similar to what they are in this very trifling one though in many of them the labor can neither be so much subdivided nor reduced to so great a simplicity of operation the division of labor however so far as it can be introduced occasions in every art a proportionable increase of the productive powers of labor the separation of different trades and employments from one another seems to have taken place in consequence of this advantage this separation too is generally carried furthest in those countries which enjoy the highest degree of industry and improvement what is the work of one man in a rude state of society being generally that of several in an improved one in every improved society the farmer is generally nothing but a farmer the manufacturer nothing but a manufacturer the labor too which is necessary to produce any one complete manufacture is almost always divided among a great number of hands how many different trades are employed in each branch of the linen and woollen manufactures from the growers of the flax and the wool to the bleachers and smoothers of the linen or to the dyers and dressers of the cloth the nature of agriculture indeed does not admit of so many subdivisions of labor nor of so complete a separation of one business from another as manufactures it is impossible to separate so entirely the business of the grazier from that of the cornfarmer as the trade of the carpenter is commonly separated from that of the smith the spinner is almost always a distinct person from the weaver but the ploughman the harrower the sower of the seed and the reaper of the corn are often the same the occasions for those different sorts of labor returning with the different seasons of the year it is impossible that one man should be constantly employed in any one of them this impossibility of making so complete and entire a separation of all the different branches of labor employed in agriculture is perhaps the reason why the improvement of the productive powers of labor in this art does not always keep pace with their improvement in manufactures the most opulent nations indeed generally excel all their neighbors in agriculture as well as in manufactures but they are commonly more distinguished by their superiority in the latter than in the former their lands are in general better cultivated and having more labor and expense bestowed upon them produce more in proportion to the extent and natural fertility of the ground but the superiority of produce is seldom much more than in proportion to the superiority of labor and expense in agriculture the labor of the rich country is not always much more productive than that of the poor or at least it is never so much more productive as it commonly is in manufactures the corn of the rich country therefore will not always in the same degree of goodness come cheaper to market than that of the poor the corn of poland in the same degree of goodness is as cheap as that of france notwithstanding the superior opulence and improvement of the latter country the corn of france is in the corn provinces fully as good and in most years nearly about the same price with the corn of england though in opulence and improvement france is perhaps inferior to england the lands of england however are better cultivated than those of france and the lands of france are said to be much better cultivated than those of poland but though the poor country notwithstanding the inferiority of its cultivation can in some measure rival the rich in the cheapness and goodness of its corn it can pretend to no such competition in its manufactures at least if those manufactures suit the soil climate and situation of the rich country the silks of france are better and cheaper than those of england because the silk manufacture does not suit the climate of england but the hardware and the coarse woollens of england are beyond all comparison superior to those of france and much cheaper too in the same degree of goodness in poland there are said to be scarce any manufactures of any kind a few of those coarser household manufactures excepted without which no country can well subsist  this great increase of the quantity of work which the same number of people are capable of performing in consequence of the division of labor is owing to three different circumstances first to the increase of dexterity in every particular workman secondly to the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another and lastly to the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labor and enable one man to do the work of many  first the improvement of the dexterity of the workman necessarily increases the quantity of the work he can perform and the division of labor by reducing every mans business to some one simple operation and by making this operation the sole employment of his life necessarily increases very much the dexterity of the workman a common smith who though accustomed to handle the hammer has never been used to make nails if upon some particular occasion he is obliged to attempt it will scarce i am assured be able to make above two or three hundred nails in a day and those too very bad ones a smith who has been accustomed to make nails but whose sole or principal business has not been that of a nailer can seldom with his utmost diligence make more than eight hundred or a thousand nails in a day i have seen several boys under twenty years of age who had never exercised any other trade but that of making nails and who when they exerted themselves could make each of them upwards of two thousand three hundred nails in a day the making of a nail however is by no means one of the simplest operations the same person blows the bellows stirs or mends the fire as there is occasion heats the iron and forges every part of the nail in forging the head too he is obliged to change his tools the different operations into which the making of a pin or of a metal button is subdivided are all of them much more simple and the dexterity of the person of whose life it has been the sole business to perform them is usually much greater the rapidity with which some of the operations of those manufactures are performed exceeds what the human hand could by those who had never seen them be supposed capable of acquiring  secondly the advantage which is gained by saving the time commonly lost in passing from one sort of work to another is much greater than we should at first view be apt to imagine it it is impossible to pass very quickly from one kind of work to another that is carried on in a different place and with quite different tools a country weaver who cultivates a small farm must lose a good deal of time in passing from his loom to the field and from the field to his loom when the two trades can be carried on in the same workhouse the loss of time is no doubt much less it is even in this case however very considerable a man commonly saunters a little in turning his hand from one sort of employment to another when he first begins the new work he is seldom very keen and hearty his mind as they say does not go to it and for some time he rather trifles than applies to good purpose the habit of sauntering and of indolent careless application which is naturally or rather necessarily acquired by every country workman who is obliged to change his work and his tools every half hour and to apply his hand in twenty different ways almost every day of his life renders him almost always slothful and lazy and incapable of any vigorous application even on the most pressing occasions independent therefore of his deficiency in point of dexterity this cause alone must always reduce considerably the quantity of work which he is capable of performing  thirdly and lastly every body must be sensible how much labor is facilitated and abridged by the application of proper machinery it is unnecessary to give any example i shall therefore only observe that the invention of all those machines by which labor is so much facilitated and abridged seems to have been originally owing to the division of labor men are much more likely to discover easier and readier methods of attaining any object when the whole attention of their minds is directed toward that single object than when it is dissipated among a great variety of things but in consequence of the division of labor the whole of every mans attention comes naturally to be directed toward some one very simple object it is naturally to be expected therefore that some one or other of those who are employed in each particular branch of labor should soon find out easier and readier methods of performing their own particular work wherever the nature of it admits of such improvement a great part of the machines employed in those manufactures in which labor is most subdivided were originally the inventions of common workmen who being each of them employed in some very simple operation naturally turned their thoughts toward finding out easier and readier methods of performing it whoever has been much accustomed to visit such manufactures must frequently have been shown very pretty machines which were the inventions of common workmen in order to facilitate and quicken their own particular part of the work in the first fireengines a boy was constantly employed to open and shut alternately the communication between the boiler and the cylinder according as the piston either ascended or descended one of those boys who loved to play with his companions observed that by tying a string from the handle of the valve which opened this communication to another part of the machine the valve would open and shut without his assistance and leave him at liberty to divert himself with his playfellows one of the greatest improvements that has been made upon this machine since it was first invented was in this manner the discovery of a boy who wanted to save his own labor  all the improvements in machinery however have by no means been the inventions of those who had occasion to use the machines many improvements have been made by the ingenuity of the makers of the machines when to make them became the business of a peculiar trade and some by that of those who are called philosophers or men of speculation whose trade it is not to do any thing but to observe every thing and who upon that account are often capable of combining together the powers of the most distant and dissimilar objects in the progress of society philosophy or speculation becomes like every other employment the principal or sole trade and occupation of a particular class of citizens like every other employment too it is subdivided into a great number of different branches each of which affords occupation to a peculiar tribe or class of philosophers and this subdivision of employment in philosophy as well as in every other business improves dexterity and saves time each individual becomes more expert in his own peculiar branch more work is done upon the whole and the quantity of science is considerably increased by it  it is the great multiplication of the productions of all the different arts in consequence of the division of labor which occasions in a well governed society that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for and every other workman being exactly in the same situation he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity or what comes to the same thing for the price of a great quantity of theirs he supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of the society  observe the accommodation of the most common artificer or daylabourer in a civilized and thriving country and you will perceive that the number of people of whose industry a part though but a small part has been employed in procuring him this accommodation exceeds all computation the woollen coat for example which covers the daylabourer as coarse and rough as it may appear is the produce of the joint labor of a great multitude of workmen the shepherd the sorter of the wool the woolcomber or carder the dyer the scribbler the spinner the weaver the fuller the dresser with many others must all join their different arts in order to complete even this homely production how many merchants and carriers besides must have been employed in transporting the materials from some of those workmen to others who often live in a very distant part of the country how much commerce and navigation in particular how many shipbuilders sailors sailmakers ropemakers must have been employed in order to bring together the different drugs made use of by the dyer which often come from the remotest corners of the world what a variety of labor too is necessary in order to produce the tools of the meanest of those workmen to say nothing of such complicated machines as the ship of the sailor the mill of the fuller or even the loom of the weaver let us consider only what a variety of labor is requisite in order to form that very simple machine the shears with which the shepherd clips the wool the miner the builder of the furnace for smelting the ore the feller of the timber the burner of the charcoal to be made use of in the smelting house the brickmaker the bricklayer the workmen who attend the furnace the millwright the forger the smith must all of them join their different arts in order to produce them were we to examine in the same manner all the different parts of his dress and household furniture the coarse linen shirt which he wears next his skin the shoes which cover his feet the bed which he lies on and all the different parts which compose it the kitchen grate at which he prepares his victuals the coals which he makes use of for that purpose dug from the bowels of the earth and brought to him perhaps by a long sea and a long land carriage all the other utensils of his kitchen all the furniture of his table the knives and forks the earthen or pewter plates upon which he serves up and divides his victuals the different hands employed in preparing his bread and his beer the glass window which lets in the heat and the light and keeps out the wind and the rain with all the knowledge and art requisite for preparing that beautiful and happy invention without which these northern parts of the world could scarce have afforded a very comfortable habitation together with the tools of all the different workmen employed in producing those different conveniences if we examine i say all these things and consider what a variety of labor is employed about each of them we shall be sensible that without the assistance and cooperation of many thousands the very meanest person in a civilized country could not be provided even according to what we very falsely imagine the easy and simple manner in which he is commonly accommodated compared indeed with the more extravagant luxury of the great his accommodation must no doubt appear extremely simple and easy and yet it may be true perhaps that the accommodation of an european prince does not always so much exceed that of an industrious and frugal peasant as the accommodation of the latter exceeds that of many an african king the absolute master of the lives and liberties of ten thousand naked savages  chap ii of the principle which gives occasion to the division of labor this division of labor from which so many advantages are derived is not originally the effect of any human wisdom which foresees and intends that general opulence to which it gives occasion it is the necessary though very slow and gradual consequence of a certain propensity in human nature which has in view no such extensive utility the propensity to truck barter and exchange one thing for another  whether this propensity be one of those original principles in human nature of which no further account can be given or whether as seems more probable it be the necessary consequence of the faculties of reason and speech it belongs not to our present subject to enquire it is common to all men and to be found in no other race of animals which seem to know neither this nor any other species of contracts two greyhounds in running down the same hare have sometimes the appearance of acting in some sort of concert each turns her toward his companion or endeavors to intercept her when his companion turns her toward himself this however is not the effect of any contract but of the accidental concurrence of their passions in the same object at that particular time nobody ever saw a dog make a fair and deliberate exchange of one bone for another with another dog nobody ever saw one animal by its gestures and natural cries signify to another this is mine that yours i am willing to give this for that when an animal wants to obtain something either of a man or of another animal it has no other means of persuasion but to gain the favor of those whose service it requires a puppy fawns upon its dam and a spaniel endeavors by a thousand attractions to engage the attention of its master who is at dinner when it wants to be fed by him man sometimes uses the same arts with his brethren and when he has no other means of engaging them to act according to his inclinations endeavors by every servile and fawning attention to obtain their good will he has not time however to do this upon every occasion in civilized society he stands at all times in need of the cooperation and assistance of great multitudes while his whole life is scarce sufficient to gain the friendship of a few persons in almost every other race of animals each individual when it is grown up to maturity is entirely independent and in its natural state has occasion for the assistance of no other living creature but man has almost constant occasion for the help of his brethren and it is in vain for him to expect it from their benevolence only he will be more likely to prevail if he can interest their selflove in his favor and show them that it is for their own advantage to do for him what he requires of them whoever offers to another a bargain of any kind proposes to do this give me that which i want and you shall have this which you want is the meaning of every such offer and it is in this manner that we obtain from one another the far greater part of those good offices which we stand in need of it is not from the benevolence of the butcher the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner but from their regard to their own interest we address ourselves not to their humanity but to their selflove and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages nobody but a beggar chooses to depend chiefly upon the benevolence of his fellow citizens even a beggar does not depend upon it entirely the charity of well disposed people indeed supplies him with the whole fund of his subsistence but though this principle ultimately provides him with all the necessaries of life which he has occasion for it neither does nor can provide him with them as he has occasion for them the greater part of his occasional wants are supplied in the same manner as those of other people by treaty by barter and by purchase with the money which one man gives him he purchases food the old clothes which another bestows upon him he exchanges for other old clothes which suit him better or for lodging or for food or for money with which he can buy either food clothes or lodging as he has occasion  as it is by treaty by barter and by purchase that we obtain from one another the greater part of those mutual good offices which we stand in need of so it is this same trucking disposition which originally gives occasion to the division of labor in a tribe of hunters or shepherds a particular person makes bows and arrows for example with more readiness and dexterity than any other he frequently exchanges them for cattle or for venison with his companions and he finds at last that he can in this manner get more cattle and venison than if he himself went to the field to catch them from a regard to his own interest therefore the making of bows and arrows grows to be his chief business and he becomes a sort of armourer another excels in making the frames and covers of their little huts or moveable houses he is accustomed to be of use in this way to his neighbors who reward him in the same manner with cattle and with venison till at last he finds it his interest to dedicate himself entirely to this employment and to become a sort of housecarpenter in the same manner a third becomes a smith or a brazier a fourth a tanner or dresser of hides or skins the principal part of the clothing of savages and thus the certainty of being able to exchange all that surplus part of the produce of his own labor which is over and above his own consumption for such parts of the produce of other mens labor as he may have occasion for encourages every man to apply himself to a particular occupation and to cultivate and bring to perfection whatever talent or genius he may possess for that particular species of business  the difference of natural talents in different men is in reality much less than we are aware of and the very different genius which appears to distinguish men of different professions when grown up to maturity is not upon many occasions so much the cause as the effect of the division of labor the difference between the most dissimilar characters between a philosopher and a common street porter for example seems to arise not so much from nature as from habit custom and education when they came into the world and for the first six or eight years of their existence they were perhaps very much alike and neither their parents nor playfellows could perceive any remarkable difference about that age or soon after they come to be employed in very different occupations the difference of talents comes then to be taken notice of and widens by degrees till at last the vanity of the philosopher is willing to acknowledge scarce any resemblance but without the disposition to truck barter and exchange every man must have procured to himself every necessary and convenience of life which he wanted all must have had the same duties to perform and the same work to do and there could have been no such difference of employment as could alone give occasion to any great difference of talents  as it is this disposition which forms that difference of talents so remarkable among men of different professions so it is this same disposition which renders that difference useful many tribes of animals acknowledged to be all of the same species derive from nature a much more remarkable distinction of genius than what antecedent to custom and education appears to take place among men by nature a philosopher is not in genius and disposition half so different from a street porter as a mastiff is from a greyhound or a greyhound from a spaniel or this last from a shepherds dog those different tribes of animals however though all of the same species are of scarce any use to one another the strength of the mastiff is not in the least supported either by the swiftness of the greyhound or by the sagacity of the spaniel or by the docility of the shepherds dog the effects of those different geniuses and talents for want of the power or disposition to barter and exchange cannot be brought into a common stock and do not in the least contribute to the better accommodation and convenience of the species each animal is still obliged to support and defend itself separately and independantly and derives no sort of advantage from that variety of talents with which nature has distinguished its fellows among men on the contrary the most dissimilar geniuses are of use to one another the different produces of their respective talents by the general disposition to truck barter and exchange being brought as it were into a common stock where every man may purchase whatever part of the produce of other mens talents he has occasion for  chap iii that the division of labor is limited by the extent of the market as it is the power of exchanging that gives occasion to the division of labor so the extent of this division must always be limited by the extent of that power or in other words by the extent of the market when the market is very small no person can have any encouragement to dedicate himself entirely to one employment for want of the power to exchange all that surplus part of the produce of his own labor which is over and above his own consumption for such parts of the produce of other mens labor as he has occasion for  there are some sorts of industry even of the lowest kind which can be carried on no where but in a great town a porter for example can find employment and subsistence in no other place a village is by much too narrow a sphere for him even an ordinary market town is scarce large enough to afford him constant occupation in the lone houses and very small villages which are scattered about in so desert a country as the highlands of scotland every farmer must be butcher baker and brewer for his own family in such situations we can scarce expect to find even a smith a carpenter or a mason within less than twenty miles of another of the same trade the scattered families that live at eight or ten miles distance from the nearest of them must learn to perform themselves a great number of little pieces of work for which in more populous countries they would call in the assistance of those workmen country workmen are almost every where obliged to apply themselves to all the different branches of industry that have so much affinity to one another as to be employed about the same sort of materials a country carpenter deals in every sort of work that is made of wood a country smith in every sort of work that is made of iron the former is not only a carpenter but a joiner a cabinetmaker and even a carver in wood as well as a wheelwright a ploughwright a cart and wagon maker the employments of the latter are still more various it is impossible there should be such a trade as even that of a nailer in the remote and inland parts of the highlands of scotland such a workman at the rate of a thousand nails a day and three hundred working days in the year will make three hundred thousand nails in the year but in such a situation it would be impossible to dispose of one thousand that is of one days work in the year  as by means of watercarriage a more extensive market is opened to every sort of industry than what landcarriage alone can afford it so it is upon the sea coast and along the banks of navigable rivers that industry of every kind naturally begins to subdivide and improve itself and it is frequently not till a long time after that those improvements extend themselves to the inland parts of the country a broadwheeled wagon attended by two men and drawn by eight horses in about six weeks time carries and brings back between london and edinburgh near four ton weight of goods in about the same time a ship navigated by six or eight men and sailing between the ports of london and leith frequently carries and brings back two hundred ton weight of goods six or eight men therefore by the help of watercarriage can carry and bring back in the same time the same quantity of goods between london and edinburgh as fifty broadwheeled wagons attended by a hundred men and drawn by four hundred horses upon two hundred tons of goods therefore carried by the cheapest landcarriage from london to edinburgh there must be charged the maintenance of a hundred men for three weeks and both the maintenance and what is nearly equal to the maintenance the wear and tear of four hundred horses as well as of fifty great wagons whereas upon the same quantity of goods carried by water there is to be charged only the maintenance of six or eight men and the wear and tear of a ship of two hundred tons burden together with the value of the superior risk or the difference of the insurance between land and watercarriage were there no other communication between those two places therefore but by landcarriage as no goods could be transported from the one to the other except such whose price was very considerable in proportion to their weight they could carry on but a small part of that commerce which is at present carried on between them and consequently could give but a small part of that encouragement which they at present mutually afford to each others industry there could be little or no commerce of any kind between the distant parts of the world what goods could bear the expense of landcarriage between london and calcutta or if there was any so precious as to be able to support this expense with what safety could they be transported through the territories of so many barbarous nations those two cities however at present carry on together a very considerable commerce and by mutually affording a market give a good deal of encouragement to each others industry  since such therefore are the advantages of water carriage it is natural that the first improvements of art and industry should be made where this convenience opens the whole world for a market to the produce of every sort of labor and that they should always be much later in extending themselves into the inland parts of the country the inland parts of the country can for a long time have no other market for the greater part of their goods but the country which lies round about them and separates them from the sea coast and the great navigable rivers the extent of their market therefore must for a long time be in proportion to the riches and populousness of that country and consequently their improvement must always be posterior to the improvement of that country in our north american colonies the plantations have constantly followed either the sea coast or the banks of the navigable rivers and have scarce any where extended themselves to any considerable distance from both  the nations that according to the best authenticated history appear to have been first civilized were those that dwelt round the coast of the mediterranean sea that sea by far the greatest inlet that is known in the world having no tides nor consequently any waves except such as are caused by the wind only was by the smoothness of its surface as well as by the multitude of its islands and the proximity of its neighboring shores extremely favorable to the infant navigation of the world when from their ignorance of the compass men were afraid to quit the view of the coast and from the imperfection of the art of shipbuilding to abandon themselves to the boisterous waves of the ocean to pass beyond the pillars of hercules that is to sail out of the streights of gibraltar was in the ancient world long considered as a most wonderful and dangerous exploit of navigation it was late before even the phenicians and carthaginians the most skilful navigators and shipbuilders of those old times attempted it and they were for a long time the only nations that did attempt it  of all the countries on the coast of the mediterranean sea egypt seems to have been the first in which either agriculture or manufactures were cultivated and improved to any considerable degree upper egypt extends itself no where above a few miles from the nile and in lower egypt that great river breaks itself into many different canals which with the assistance of a little art soem to have afforded a communication by water carriage not only between all the great towns but between all the considerable villages and even to many farm houses in the country nearly in the same manner as the rhine and the maese do in holland at present the extent and easiness of this inland navigation was probably one of the principal causes of the early improvement of egypt  the improvements in agriculture and manufactures seem likewise to have been of very great antiquity in the provinces of bengal in the east indies and in some of the eastern provinces of china though the great extent of this antiquity is not authenticated by any histories of whose authority we in this part of the world are well assured in bengal the ganges and several other great rivers break themselves into many canals in the same manner as the nile does in egypt in the eastern provinces of china too several great rivers form by their different branches a multitude of canals and by communicating with one another afford an inland navigation much more extensive than that either of the nile or the ganges or perhaps than both of them put together it is remarkable that neither the ancient egyptians nor the indians nor the chinese encouraged foreign commerce but seem all to have derived their great opulence from this inland navigation  all the inland parts of africa and all that part of asia which lies any considerable way north of the euxine and caspian seas the ancient scythia the modern tartary and siberia seem in all ages of the world to have been in the same barbarous and uncivilized state in which we find them at present the sea of tartary is the frozen ocean which admits of no navigation and though some of the greatest rivers in the world run through that country they are at too great a distance from one another to carry commerce and communication through the greater part of it there are in africa none of those great inlets such as the baltic and adriatic seas in europe the mediterranean and euxine seas in both europe and asia and the gulphs of arabia persia india bengal and siam in asia to carry maritime commerce into the interior parts of that great continent and the great rivers of africa are at too great a distance from one another to give occasion to any considerable inland navigation the commerce besides which any nation can carry on by means of a river which does not break itself into any great number of branches or canals and which runs into another territory before it reaches the sea can never be very considerable because it is always in the power of the nations who possess that other territory to obstruct the communication between the upper country and the sea the navigation of the danube is of very little use to the different states of bavaria austria and hungary in comparison of what it would be if any one of them possessed the whole of its course till it falls into the black sea  chap iv of the origin and use of money when the division of labor has been once thoroughly established it is but a very small part of a mans wants which the produce of his own labor can supply he supplies the far greater part of them by exchanging that surplus part of the produce of his own labor which is over and above his own consumption for such parts of the produce of other mens labor as he has occasion for every man thus lives by exchanging or becomes in some measure a merchant and the society itself grows to be what is properly a commercial society  but when the division of labor first began to take place this power of exchanging must frequently have been very much clogged and embarrassed in its operations one man we shall suppose has more of a certain commodity than he himself has occasion for while another has less the former consequently would be glad to dispose of and the latter to purchase a part of this superfluity but if this latter should chance to have nothing that the former stands in need of no exchange can be made between them the butcher has more meat in his shop than he himself can consume and the brewer and the baker would each of them be willing to purchase a part of it but they have nothing to offer in exchange except the different productions of their respective trades and the butcher is already provided with all the bread and beer which he has immediate occasion for no exchange can in this case be made between them he cannot be their merchant nor they his customers and they are all of them thus mutually less serviceable to one another in order to avoid the inconveniency of such situations every prudent man in every period of society after the first establishment of the division of labor must naturally have endeavored to manage his affairs in such a manner as to have at all times by him besides the peculiar produce of his own industry a certain quantity of some one commodity or other such as he imagined few people would be likely to refuse in exchange for the produce of their industry  many different commodities it is probable were successively both thought of and employed for this purpose in the rude ages of society cattle are said to have been the common instrument of commerce and though they must have been a most inconvenient one yet in old times we find things were frequently valued according to the number of cattle which had been given in exchange for them the armor of diomed says homer cost only nine oxen but that of glaucus cost a hundred oxen salt is said to be the common instrument of commerce and exchanges in abyssmia a species of shells in some parts of the coast of india dried cod at newfoundland tobacco in virginia sugar in some of our west india colonies hides or dressed leather in some other countries and there is at this day a village in scotland where it is not uncommon i am told for a workman to carry nails instead of money to the bakers shop or the alehouse  in all countries however men seem at last to have been determined by irresistible reasons to give the preference for this employment to metals above every other commodity metals can not only be kept with as little loss as any other commodity scarce any thing being less perishable than they are but they can likewise without any loss be divided into any number of parts as by fusion those parts can easily be reunited again a quality which no other equally durable commodities possess and which more than any other quality renders them fit to be the instruments of commerce and circulation the man who wanted to buy salt for example and had nothing but cattle to give in exchange for it must have been obliged to buy salt to the value of a whole ox or a whole sheep at a time he could seldom buy less than this because what he was to give for it could seldom be divided without loss and if he had a mind to buy more he must for the same reasons have been obliged to buy double or triple the quantity the value to wit of two or three oxen or of two or three sheep if on the contrary instead of sheep or oxen he had metals to give in exchange for it he could easily proportion the quantity of the metal to the precise quantity of the commodity which he had immediate occasion for  different metals have been made use of by different nations for this purpose iron was the common instrument of commerce among the ancient spartans copper among the ancient romans and gold and silver among all rich and commercial nations  those metals seem originally to have been made use of for this purpose in rude bars without any stamp or coinage thus we are told by pliny upon the authority of one remeus an ancient author that till the time of servius tullius the romans had no coined money but made use of unstamped bars of copper to purchase whatever they had occasion for these rude bars therefore performed at this time the function of money  the use of metals in this rude state was attended with two very considerable inconveniences first with the trouble of weighing them and secondly with the trouble of assaying them in the precious metals where a small difference in the quantity makes a great difference in the value even the business of weighing with proper exactness requires at least very accurate weights and scales the weighing of gold in particular is an operation of some nicety in the coarser metals indeed where a small error would be of little consequence less accuracy would no doubt be necessary yet we should find it excessively troublesome if every time a poor man had occasion either to buy or sell a farthings worth of goods he was obliged to weigh the farthing the operation of assaying is still more difficult still more tedious and unless a part of the metal is fairly melted in the crucible with proper dissolvents any conclusion that can be drawn from it is extremely uncertain before the institution of coined money however unless they went through this tedious and difficult operation people must always have been liable to the grossest frauds and impositions and instead of a pound weight of pure silver or pure copper might receive in exchange for their goods an adulterated composition of the coarsest and cheapest materials which had however in their outward appearance been made to resemble those metals to prevent such abuses to facilitate exchanges and thereby to encourage all sorts of industry and commerce it has been found necessary in all countries that have made any considerable advances toward improvement to affix a public stamp upon certain quantities of such particular metals as were in those countries commonly made use of to purchase goods hence the origin of coined money and of those public offices called mints institutions exactly of the same nature with those of the aulnagers and stampmasters of woollen and linen cloth all of them are equally meant to ascertain by means of a public stamp the quantity and uniform goodness of those different commodities when brought to market  the first public stamps of this kind that were affixed to the current metals seem in many cases to have been intended to ascertain what it was both most difficult and most important to ascertain the goodness or fineness of the metal and to have resembled the sterling mark which is at present affixed to plate and bars of silver or the spanish mark which is sometimes affixed to ingots of gold and which being struck only upon one side of the piece and not covering the whole surface ascertains the fineness but not the weight of the metal abraham weighs to ephron the four hundred shekels of silver which he had agreed to pay for the field of machpelah they are said however to be the current money of the merchant and yet are received by weight and not by tale in the same manner as ingots of gold and bars of silver are at present the revenues of the ancient saxon kings of england are said to have been paid not in money but in kind that is in victuals and provisions of all sorts william the conqueror introduced the custom of paying them in money this money however was for a long time received at the exchequer by weight and not by tale  the inconveniency and difficulty of weighing those metals with exactness gave occasion to the institution of coins of which the stamp covering entirely both sides of the piece and sometimes the edges too was supposed to ascertain not only the fineness but the weight of the metal such coins therefore were received by tale as at present without the trouble of weighing  the denominations of those coins seem originally to have expressed the weight or quantity of metal contained in them in the time of servius tullius who first coined money at rome the roman as or pondo contained a roman pound of good copper it was divided in the same manner as our troyes pound into twelve ounces each of which contained a real ounce of good copper the english pound sterling in the time of edward i contained a pound tower weight of silver of a known fineness the tower pound seems to have been something more than the roman pound and something less than the troyes pound this last was not introduced into the mint of england till the   th of henry viii the french livre contained in the time of charlemagne a pound troyes weight of silver of a known fineness the fair of troyes in champaign was at that time frequented by all the nations of europe and the weights and measures of so famous a market were generally known and esteemed the scots money pound contained from the time of alexander the first to that of robert bruce a pound of silver of the same weight and fineness with the english pound sterling english french and scots pennies too contained all of them originally a real pennyweight of silver the twentieth part of an ounce and the two hundred and fortieth part of a pound the shilling too seems originally to have been the denomination of a weight when wheat is at twelve shillings the quarter says an ancient statute of henry iii then wastel bread of a farthing shall weigh eleven shillings and four pence the proportion however between the shilling and either the penny on the one hand or the pound on the other seems not to have been so constant and uniform as that between the penny and the pound during the first race of the kings of france the french sou or shilling appears upon different occasions to have contained five twelve twenty forty and fortyeight pennies among the ancient saxons a shilling appears at one time to have contained only five pennies and it is not improbable that it may have been as variable among them as among their neighbors the ancient franks from the time of charlemagne among the french and from that of william the conqueror among the english the proportion between the pound the shilling and the penny seems to have been uniformly the same as at present though the value of each has been very different for in every country of the world i believe the avarice and injustice of princes and sovereign states abusing the confidence of their subjects have by degrees diminished the real quantity of metal which had been originally contained in their coins the roman as in the latter ages of the republic was reduced to the twenty fourth part of its original value and instead of weighing a pound came to weigh only half an ounce the english pound and penny contain at present about a third only the scots pound and penny about a thirtysixth and the french pound and penny about a sixtysixth part of their original value by means of those operations the princes and sovereign states which performed them were enabled in appearance to pay their debts and to fulfill their engagements with a smaller quantity of silver than would otherwise have been requisite it was indeed in appearance only for their creditors were really defrauded of a part of what was due to them all other debtors in the state were allowed the same privilege and might pay with the same nominal sum of the new and debased coin whatever they had borrowed in the old such operations therefore have always proved favorable to the debtor and ruinous to the creditor and have sometimes produced a greater and more universal revolution in the fortunes of private persons than could have been occasioned by a very great public calamity  it is in this manner that money has become in all civilized nations the universal instrument of commerce by the intervention of which goods of all kinds are bought and sold or exchanged for one another  what are the rules which men naturally observe in exchanging them either for money or for one another i shall now proceed to examine these rules determine what may be called the relative or exchangeable value of goods  the word value it is to be observed has two different meanings and sometimes expresses the utility of some particular object and sometimes the power of purchasing other goods which the possession of that object conveys the one may be called value in use the other value in exchange the things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no value in exchange and on the contrary those which have the greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use nothing is more useful than water but it will purchase scarce any thing scarce any thing can be had in exchange for it a diamond on the contrary has scarce any value in use but a very great quantity of other goods may frequently be had in exchange for it  in order to investigate the principles which regulate the exchangeable value of commodities i shall endeavor to show  first what is the real measure of this exchangeable value or wherein consists the real price of all commodities  secondly what are the different parts of which this real price is composed or made up  and lastly what are the different circumstances which sometimes raise some or all of these different parts of price above and sometimes sink them below their natural or ordinary rate or what are the causes which sometimes hinder the market price that is the actual price of commodities from coinciding exactly with what may be called their natural price  i shall endeavor to explain as fully and distinctly as i can those three subjects in the three following chapters for which i must very earnestly entreat both the patience and attention of the reader his patience in order to examine a detail which may perhaps in some places appear unnecessarily tedious and his attention in order to understand what may perhaps after the fullest explication which i am capable of giving of it appear still in some degree obscure i am always willing to run some hazard of being tedious in order to be sure that i am perspicuous and after taking the utmost pains that i can to be perspicuous some obscurity may still appear to remain upon a subject which is in its own nature extremely abstracted  chap v of the real and nominal price of commodities or of their price in labor and their price in money every man is rich or poor according to the degree in which he can afford to enjoy the necessaries conveniences and amusements of human life but after the division of labor has once thoroughly taken place it is but a very small part of these with which a mans own labor can supply him the far greater part of them he must derive from the labor of other people and he must be rich or poor according to the quantity of that labor which he can command or which he can afford to purchase the value of any commodity therefore to the person who possesses it and who means not to use or consume it himself but to exchange it for other commodities is equal to the quantity of labor which it enables him to purchase or command labor therefore is the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities  the real price of every thing what every thing really costs to the man who wants to acquire it is the toil and trouble of acquiring it what every thing is really worth to the man who has acquired it and who wants to dispose of it or exchange it for something else is the toil and trouble which it can save to himself and which it can impose upon other people what is bought with money or with goods is purchased by labor as much as what we acquire by the toil of our own body that money or those goods indeed save us this toil they contain the value of a certain quantity of labor which we exchange for what is supposed at the time to contain the value of an equal quantity labor was the first price the original purchase money that was paid for all things it was not by gold or by silver but by labor that all the wealth of the world was originally purchased and its value to those who possess it and who want to exchange it for some new productions is precisely equal to the quantity of labor which it can enable them to purchase or command  but though labor be the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities it is not that by which their value is commonly estimated it is often difficult to ascertain the proportion between two different quantities of labor the time spent in two different sorts of work will not always alone determine this proportion the different degrees of hardship endured and of ingenuity exercised must likewise be taken into account there may be more labor in an hours hard work than in two hours easy business or in an hours application to a trade which it cost ten years labor to learn than in a months industry at an ordinary and obvious employment but it is not easy to find any accurate measure either of hardship or ingenuity in exchanging indeed the different productions of different sorts of labor for one another some allowance is commonly made for both it is adjusted however not by any accurate measure but by the higgling and bargaining of the market according to that sort of rough equality which though not exact is sufficient for carrying on the business of common life  every commodity besides is more frequently exchanged for and thereby compared with other commodities than with labor it is more natural therefore to estimate its exchangeable value by the quantity of some other commodity than by that of the labor which it can purchase the greater part of people too understand better what is meant by a quantity of a particular commodity than by a quantity of labor the one is a plain palpable object the other an abstract notion which though it can be made sufficiently intelligible is not altogether so natural and obvious  but when barter ceases and money has become the common instrument of commerce every particular commodity is more frequently exchanged for money than for any other commodity the butcher seldom carries his beef or his mutton to the baker or the brewer in order to exchange them for bread or for beer but he carries them to the market where he exchanges them for money and afterward exchanges that money for bread and for beer the quantity of money which he gets for them regulates too the quantity of bread and beer which he can afterward purchase it is more natural and obvious to him therefore to estimate their value by the quantity of money the commodity for which he immediately exchanges them than by that of bread and beer the commodities for which he can exchange them only by the intervention of another commodity and rather to say that his butchers meat is worth threepence or fourpence a pound than that it is worth three or four pounds of bread or three or four quarts of small beer hence it comes to pass that the exchangeable value of every commodity is more frequently estimated by the quantity of money than by the quantity either of labor or of any other commodity which can be had in exchange for it  gold and silver however like every other commodity vary in their value are sometimes cheaper and sometimes dearer sometimes of easier and sometimes of more difficult purchase the quantity of labor which any particular quantity of them can purchase or command or the quantity of other goods which it will exchange for depends always upon the fertility or barrenness of the mines which happen to be known about the time when such exchanges are made the discovery of the abundant mines of america reduced in the sixteenth century the value of gold and silver in europe to about a third of what it had been before as it cost less labor to bring those metals from the mine to the market so when they were brought there they could purchase or command less labor and this revolution in their value though perhaps the greatest is by no means the only one of which history gives some account but as a measure of quantity such as the natural foot fathom or handful which is continually varying in its own quantity can never be an accurate measure of the quantity of other things so a commodity which is itself continually varying in its own value can never be an accurate measure of the value of other commodities equal quantities of labor must at all times and places be of equal value to the labourer he must always lay down the same portion of his ease his liberty and his happiness the price which he pays must always be the same whatever may be the quantity of goods which he receives in return for it of these indeed it may sometimes purchase a greater and sometimes a smaller quantity but it is their value which varies not that of the labor which purchases them at all times and places that is dear which it is difficult to come at or which it costs much labor to acquire and that cheap which is to be had easily or with very little labor labor alone therefore never varying in its own value is alone the ultimate and real standard by which the value of all commodities can at all times and places be estimated and compared it is their real price money is their nominal price only  but though equal quantities of labor are always of equal value to the labourer yet to the person who employs him they appear sometimes to be of greater and sometimes of smaller value he purchases them sometimes with a greater and sometimes with a smaller quantity of goods and to him the price of labor seems to vary like that of all other things it appears to him dear in the one case and cheap in the other in reality however it is the goods which are cheap in the one case and dear in the other  in this popular sense therefore labor like commodities may be said to have a real and a nominal price its real price may be said to consist in the quantity of the necessaries and conveniences of life which are given for it its nominal price in the quantity of money the labourer is rich or poor is well or ill rewarded in proportion to the real not to the nominal price of his labor  the distinction between the real and the nominal price of commodities and labor is not a matter of mere speculation but may sometimes be of considerable use in practice the same real price is always of the same value but on account of the variations in the value of gold and silver the same nominal price is sometimes of very different values when a landed estate therefore is sold with a reservation of a perpetual rent if it is intended that this rent should always be of the same value it is of importance to the family in whose favor it is reserved that it should not consist in a particular sum of money its value would in this case be liable to variations of two different kinds first to those which arise from the different quantities of gold and silver which are contained at different times in coin of the same denomination and secondly to those which arise from the different values of equal quantities of gold and silver at different times  princes and sovereign states have frequently fancied that they had a temporary interest to diminish the quantity of pure metal contained in their coins but they seldom have fancied that they had any to augment it the quantity of metal contained in the coins i believe of all nations has accordingly been almost continually diminishing and hardly ever augmenting such variations therefore tend almost always to diminish the value of a money rent  the discovery of the mines of america diminished the value of gold and silver in europe this diminution it is commonly supposed though i apprehend without any certain proof is still going on gradually and is likely to continue to do so far a long time upon this supposition therefore such variations are more likely to diminish than to augment the value of a money rent even though it should be stipulated to be paid not in such a quantity of coined money of such a denomination in so many pounds sterling for example but in so many ounces either of pure silver or of silver of a certain standard  the rents which have been reserved in corn have preserved their value much better than those which have been reserved in money even where the denomination of the coin has not been altered by the   th of elizabeth it was enacted that a third of the rent of all college leases should be reserved in corn to be paid either in kind or according to the current prices at the nearest public market the money arising from this corn rent though originally but a third of the whole is in the present times according to doctor blackstone commonly near double of what arises from the other twothirds the old money rents of colleges must according to this account have sunk almost to a fourth part of their ancient value or are worth little more than a fourth part of the corn which they were formerly worth but since the reign of philip and mary the denomination of the english coin has undergone little or no alteration and the same number of pounds shillings and pence have contained very nearly the same quantity of pure silver this degradation therefore in the value of the money rents of colleges has arisen altogether from the degradation in the value of silver  when the degradation in the value of silver is combined with the diminution of the quantity of it contained in the coin of the same denomination the loss is frequently still greater in scotland where the denomination of the coin has undergone much greater alterations than it ever did in england and in france where it has undergone still greater than it ever did in scotland some ancient rents originally of considerable value have in this manner been reduced almost to nothing  equal quantities of labor will at distant times be purchased more nearly with equal quantities of corn the subsistence of the labourer than with equal quantities of gold and silver or perhaps of any other commodity equal quantities of corn therefore will at distant times be more nearly of the same real value or enable the possessor to purchase or command more nearly the same quantity of the labor of other people they will do this i say more nearly than equal quantities of almost any other commodity for even equal quantities of corn will not do it exactly the subsistence of the labourer or the real price of labor as i shall endeavor to show hereafter is very different upon different occasions more liberal in a society advancing to opulence than in one that is standing still and in one that is standing still than in one that is going backwards every other commodity however will at any particular time purchase a greater or smaller quantity of labor in proportion to the quantity of subsistence which it can purchase at that time a rent therefore reserved in corn is liable only to the variations in the quantity of labor which a certain quantity of corn can purchase but a rent reserved in any other commodity is liable not only to the variations in the quantity of labor which any particular quantity of corn can purchase but to the variations in the quantity of corn which can be purchased by any particular quantity of that commodity  though the real value of a corn rent it is to be observed however varies much less from century to century than that of a money rent it varies much more from year to year the money price of labor as i shall endeavor to show hereafter does not fluctuate from year to year with the money price of corn but seems to be every where accommodated not to the temporary or occasional but to the average or ordinary price of that necessary of life the average or ordinary price of corn again is regulated as i shall likewise endeavor to show hereafter by the value of silver by the richness or barrenness of the mines which supply the market with that metal or by the quantity of labor which must be employed and consequently of corn which must be consumed in order to bring any particular quantity of it from the mine to the market but the value of silver though it sometimes varies greatly from century to century seldom varies much from year to year but frequently continues the same or very nearly the same for half a century or a century together the ordinary or average money price of corn therefore may during so long a period continue the same or very nearly the same too and along with it the money price of labor provided at least the society continues in other respects in the same or nearly in the same condition in the mean time the temporary and occasional price of corn may frequently be double one year of what it had been the year before or fluctuate from five and twenty to fifty shillings the quarter for example but when corn is at the latter price not only the nominal but the real value of a corn rent will be double of what it is when at the former or will command double the quantity either of labor or of the greater part of other commodities the money price of labor and along with it that of most other things continuing the same during all these fluctuations  labor therefore it appears evidently is the only universal as well as the only accurate measure of value or the only standard by which we can compare the values of different commodities at all times and at all places we cannot estimate it is allowed the real value of different commodities from century to century by the quantities of silver which were given for them we cannot estimate it from year to year by the quantities of corn by the quantities of labor we can with the greatest accuracy estimate it both from century to century and from year to year from century to century corn is a better measure than silver because from century to century equal quantities of corn will command the same quantity of labor more nearly than equal quantities of silver from year to year on the contrary silver is a better measure than corn because equal quantities of it will more nearly command the same quantity of labor  but though in establishing perpetual rents or even in letting very long leases it may be of use to distinguish between real and nominal price it is of none in buying and selling the more common and ordinary transactions of human life  at the same time and place the real and the nominal price of all commodities are exactly in proportion to one another the more or less money you get for any commodity in the london market for example the more or less labor it will at that time and place enable you to purchase or command at the same time and place therefore money is the exact measure of the real exchangeable value of all commodities it is so however at the same time and place only  though at distant places there is no regular proportion between the real and the money price of commodities yet the merchant who carries goods from the one to the other has nothing to consider but their money price or the difference between the quantity of silver for which he buys them and that for which he is likely to sell them half an ounce of silver at canton in china may command a greater quantity both of labor and of the necessaries and conveniences of life than an ounce at london a commodity therefore which sells for half an ounce of silver at canton may there be really dearer of more real importance to the man who possesses it there than one which sells for an ounce at london to the man who possesses it at london if a london merchant however can buy at canton for half an ounce of silver a commodity which he can afterward sell at london for an ounce he gains a hundred per cent by the bargain just as much as if an ounce of silver was at london exactly of the same value as at canton it is of no importance to him that half an ounce of silver at canton would have given him the command of more labor and of a greater quantity of the necessaries and conveniences of life than an ounce can do at london an ounce at london will always give him the command of double the quantity of all these which half an ounce could have done there and this is precisely what he wants  as it is the nominal or money price of goods therefore which finally determines the prudence or imprudence of all purchases and fales and thereby regulates almost the whole business of common life in which price is concerned we cannot wonder that it should have been so much more attended to than the real price  in such a work as this however it may sometimes be of use to compare the different real values of a particular commodity at different times and places or the different degrees of power over the labor of other people which it may upon different occasions have given to those who possessed it we must in this case compare not so much the different quantities of silver for which it was commonly sold as the different quantities of labor which those different quantities of silver could have purchased but the current prices of labor at distant times and places can scarce ever be known with any degree of exactness those of corn though they have in few places been regularly recorded are in general better known and have been more frequently taken notice of by historians and other writers we must generally therefore content ourselves with them not as being always exactly in the same proportion as the current prices of labor but as being the nearest approximation which can commonly be had to that proportion i shall hereafter have occasion to make several comparisons of this kind  in the progress of industry commercial nations have found it convenient to coin several different metals into money gold for larger payments silver for purchases of moderate value and copper or some other coarse metal for those of still smaller consideration they have always however considered one of those metals as more peculiarly the measure of value than any of the other two and this preference seems generally to have been given to the metal which they happened first to make use of as the instrument of commerce having once begun to use it as their standard which they must have done when they had no other money they have generally continued to do so even when the necessity was not the same  the romans are said to have had nothing but copper money till within five years before the first punic war when they first began to coin silver copper therefore appears to have continued always the measure of value in that republic at rome all accounts appear to have been kept and the value of all estates to have been computed either in asses or in sestertii the as was always the denomination of a copper coin the word sestertius signifies two asses and a half though the sestertius therefore was always a silver coin its value was estimated in copper at rome one who owed a great deal of money was said to have a great deal of other peoples copper  the northern nations who established themselves upon the ruins of the roman empire seem to have had silver money from the first beginning of their settlements and not to have known either gold or copper coins for several ages thereafter there were silver coins in england in the time of the saxons but there was little gold coined till the time of edward iii nor any copper till that of james i of great britain in england therefore and for the same reason i believe in all other modern nations of europe all accounts are kept and the value of all goods and of all estates is generally computed in silver and when we mean to express the amount of a persons fortune we seldom mention the number of guineas but the number of pounds which we suppose would be given for it  in all countries i believe a legal tender of payment could originally be made in the coin of that metal only which was peculiarly considered as the standard or measure of value in england gold was not considered as a legal tender for a long time after it was coined into money the proportion between the values of gold and silver money was not fixed by any public law or proclamation but was left to be settled by the market if a debtor offered payment in gold the creditor might either reject such payment altogether or accept of it at such a valuation of the gold as he and his debtor could agree upon copper is not at present a legal tender except in the change of the smaller silver coins in this state of things the distinction between the metal which was the standard and that which was not the standard was something more than a nominal distinction  in process of time and as people became gradually more familiar with the use of the different metals in coin and consequently better acquainted with the proportion between their respective values it has in most countries i believe been found convenient to ascertain this proportion and to declare by a public law that a guinea for example of such a weight and fineness should exchange for one and twenty shillings or be a legal tender for a debt of that sum in this state of things and during the continuance of any one regulated proportion of this kind the distinction between the metal which is the standard and that which is not the standard becomes little more than a nominal distinction  in consequence of any change however in this regulated proportion this distinction becomes or at least seems to become something more than nominal again if the regulated value of a guinea for example was either reduced to twenty or raised to two and twenty shillings all accounts being kept and almost all obligations for debt being expressed in silver money the greater part of payments could in either case be made with the same quantity of silver money as before but would require very different quantities of gold money a greater in the one case and a smaller in the other silver would appear to be more invariable in its value than gold silver would appear to measure the value of gold and gold would not appear to measure the value of silver the value of gold would seem to depend upon the quantity of silver which it would exchange for and the value of silver would not seem to depend upon the quantity of gold which it would exchange for this difference however would be altogether owing to the custom of keeping accounts and of expressing the amount of all great and small sums rather in silver than in gold money one of mr drummonds notes for five and twenty or fifty guineas would after an alteration of this kind be still payable with five and twenty or fifty guineas in the same manner as before it would after such an alteration be payable with the same quantity of gold as before but with very different quantities of silver in the payment of such a note gold would appear to be more invariable in its value than silver gold would appear to measure the value of silver and silver would not appear to measure the value of gold if the custom of keeping accounts and of expressing promissory notes and other obligations for money in this manner should ever become general gold and not silver would be considered as the metal which was peculiarly the standard or measure of value  in reality during the continuance of any one regulated proportion between the respective values of the different metals in coin the value of the most precious metal regulates the value of the whole coin twelve copper pence contain half a pound avoirdupois of copper of not the best quality which before it is coined is seldom worth sevenpence in silver but as by the regulation twelve such pence are ordered to exchange for a shilling they are in the market considered as worth a shilling and a shilling can at any time be had for them even before the late reformation of the gold coin of great britain the gold that part of it at least which circulated in london and its neighborhood was in general less degraded below its standard weight than the greater part of the silver one and twenty worn and defaced shillings however were considered as equivalent to a guinea which perhaps indeed was worn and defaced too but seldom so much so the late regulations have brought the gold coin as near perhaps to its standard weight as it is possible to bring the current coin of any nation and the order to receive no gold at the public offices but by weight is likely to preserve it so as long as that order is enforced the silver coin still continues in the same worn and degraded state as before the reformation of the gold coin in the market however one and twenty shillings of this degraded silver coin are still considered as worth a guinea of this excellent gold coin  the reformation of the gold coin has evidently raised the value of the silver coin which can be exchanged for it  in the english mint a pound weight of gold is coined into fortyfour guineas and a half which at one and twenty shillings the guinea is equal to fortysix pounds fourteen shillings and sixpence an ounce of such gold coin therefore is worth   l    s  0 d in silver in england no duty or seignorage is paid upon the coinage and he who carries a pound weight or an ounce weight of standard gold bullion to the mint gets back a pound weight or an ounce weight of gold in coin without any deduction three pounds seventeen shillings and tenpence halfpenny an ounce therefore is said to be the mint price of gold in england or the quantity of gold coin which the mint gives in return for standard gold bullion  before the reformation of the gold coin the price of standard gold bullion in the market had for many years been upwards of   l    s sometimes   l    s and very frequently   l an ounce that sum it is probable in the worn and degraded gold coin seldom containing more than an ounce of standard gold since the reformation of the gold coin the market price of standard gold bullion seldom exceeds   l    s   d an ounce before the reformation of the gold coin the market price was always more or less above the mint price since that reformation the market price has been constantly below the mint price but that market price is the same whether it is paid in gold or in silver coin the late reformation of the gold coin therefore has raised not only the value of the gold coin but likewise that of the silver coin in proportion to gold bullion and probably too in proportion to all other commodities though the price of the greater part of other commodities being influenced by so many other causes the rise in the value either of gold or silver coin in proportion to them may not be so distinct and sensible  in the english mint a pound weight of standard silver bullion is coined into sixtytwo shillings containing in the same manner a pound weight of standard silver five shillings and twopence an ounce therefore is said to be the mint price of silver in england or the quantity of silver coin which the mint gives in return for standard silver bullion before the reformation of the gold coin the market price of standard silver bullion was upon different occasions five shillings and fourpence five shillings and fivepence five shillings and sixpence five shillings and sevenpence and very often five shillings and eightpence an ounce five shillings and sevenpence however seems to have been the most common price since the reformation of the gold coin the market price of standard silver bullion has fallen occasionally to five shillings and threepence five shillings and fourpence and five shillings and fivepence an ounce which last price it has scarce ever exceeded though the market price of silver bullion has fallen considerably since the reformation of the gold coin it has not fallen so low as the mint price  in the proportion between the different metals in the english coin as copper is rated very much above its real value so silver is rated somewhat below it in the market of europe in the french coin and in the dutch coin an ounce of fine gold exchanges for about fourteen ounces of fine silver in the english coin it exchanges for about fifteen ounces that is for more silver than it is worth according to the common estimation of europe but as the price of copper in bars is not even in england raised by the high price of copper in english coin so the price of silver in bullion is not sunk by the low rate of silver in english coin silver in bullion still preserves its proper proportion to gold for the same reason that copper in bars preserves its proper proportion to silver  upon the reformation of the silver coin in the reign of william iii the price of silver bullion still continued to be somewhat above the mint price mr lock imputed this high price to the permission of exporting silver bullion and to the prohibition of exporting silver coin this permission of exporting he said rendered the demand for silver bullion greater than the demand for silver coin but the number of people who want silver coin for the common uses of buying and selling at home is surely much greater than that of those who want silver bullion either for the use of exportation or for any other use there subsists at present a like permission of exporting gold bullion and a like prohibition of exporting gold coin and yet the price of gold bullion has fallen below the mint price but in the english coin silver was then in the same manner as now underrated in proportion to gold and the gold coin which at that time too was not supposed to require any reformation regulated then as well as now the real value of the whole coin as the reformation of the silver coin did not then reduce the price of silver bullion to the mint price it is not very probable that a like reformation will do so now  were the silver coin brought back as near to its standard weight as the gold a guinea it is probable would according to the present proportion exchange for more silver in coin than it would purchase in bullion the silver coin containing its full standard weight there would in this case be a profit in melting it down in order first to sell the bullion for gold coin and afterward to exchange this gold coin for silver coin to be melted down in the same manner some alteration in the present proportion seems to be the only method of preventing this inconveniency  the inconveniency perhaps would be less if silver was rated in the coin as much above its proper proportion to gold as it is at present rated below it provided it was at the same time enacted that silver should not be a legal tender for more than the change of a guinea in the same manner as copper is not a legal tender for more than the change of a shilling no creditor could in this case be cheated in consequence of the high valuation of silver in coin as no creditor can at present be cheated in consequence of the high valuation of copper the bankers only would suffer by this regulation when a run comes upon them they sometimes endeavor to gain time by paying in sixpences and they would be precluded by this regulation from this discreditable method of evading immediate payment they would be obliged in consequence to keep at all times in their coffers a greater quantity of cash than at present and though this might no doubt be a considerable inconveniency to them it would at the same time be a considerable security to their creditors  three pounds seventeen shillings and tenpence halfpenny the mint price of gold certainly does not contain even in our present excellent gold coin more than an ounce of standard gold and it may be thought therefore should not purchase more standard bullion but gold in coin is more convenient than gold in bullion and though in england the coinage is free yet the gold which is carried in bullion to the mint can seldom be returned in coin to the owner till after a delay of several weeks in the present hurry of the mint it could not be returned till after a delay of several months this delay is equivalent to a small duty and renders gold in coin somewhat more valuable than an equal quantity of gold in bullion if in the english coin silver was rated according to its proper proportion to gold the price of silver bullion would probably fall below the mint price even without any reformation of the silver coin the value even of the present worn and defaced silver coin being regulated by the value of the excellent gold coin for which it can be changed  a small seignorage or duty upon the coinage of both gold and silver would probably increase still more the superiority of those metals in coin above an equal quantity of either of them in bullion the coinage would in this case increase the value of the metal coined in proportion to the extent of this small duty for the same reason that the fashion increases the value of plate in proportion to the price of that fashion the superiority of coin above bullion would prevent the melting down of the coin and would discourage its exportation if upon any public exigency it should become necessary to export the coin the greater part of it would soon return again of its own accord abroad it could sell only for its weight in bullion at home it would buy more than that weight there would be a profit therefore in bringing it home again in france a seignorage of about eight per cent is imposed upon the coinage and the french coin when exported is said to return home again of its own accord  the occasional fluctuations in the market price of gold and silver bullion arise from the same causes as the like fluctuations in that of all other commodities the frequent loss of those metals from various accidents by sea and by land the continual waste of them in gilding and plating in lace and embroidery in the tear and wear of coin and in the tear and wear of plate require in all countries which possess no mines of their own a continual importation in order to repair this loss and this waste the merchant importers like all other merchants we may believe endeavor as well as they can to suit their occasional importations to what they judge is likely to be the immediate demand with all their attention however they sometimes overdo the business and sometimes underdo it when they import more bullion than is wanted rather than incur the risk and trouble of exporting it again they are sometimes willing to sell a part of it for something less than the ordinary or average price when on the other hand they import less than is wanted they get something more than this price but when under all those occasional fluctuations the market price either of gold or silver bullion continues for several years together steadily and constantly either more or less above or more or less below the mint price we may be assured that this steady and constant either superiority or inferiority of price is the effect of something in the state of the coin which at that time renders a certain quantity of coin either of more value or of less value than the precise quantity of bullion which it ought to contain the constancy and steadiness of the effect supposes a proportionable constancy and steadiness in the cause  the money of any particular country is at any particular time and place more or less an accurate measure of value according as the current coin is more or less exactly agreeable to its standard or contains more or less exactly the precise quantity of pure gold or pure silver which it ought to contain if in england for example fortyfour guineas and a half contained exactly a pound weight of standard gold or eleven ounces of fine gold and one ounce of alloy the gold coin of england would be as accurate a measure of the actual value of goods at any particular time and place as the nature of the thing would admit but if by rubbing and wearing fortyfour guineas and a half generally contain less than a pound weight of standard gold the diminution however being greater in some pieces than in others the measure of value comes to be liable to the same sort of uncertainly to which all other weights and measures are commonly exposed as it rarely happens that these are exactly agreeable to their standard the merchant adjusts the price of his goods as well as he can not to what those weights and measures ought to be but to what upon an average he finds by experience they actually are in consequence of a like disorder in the coin the price of goods comes in the same manner to be adjusted not to the quantity of pure gold or silver which the coin ought to contain but to that which upon an average it is found by experience it actually does contain  by the money price of goods it is to be observed i understand always the quantity of pure gold or silver for which they are sold without any regard to the denomination of the coin six shillings and eightpence for example in the time of edward i i consider as the same money price with a pound sterling in the present times because it contained as nearly as we can judge the same quantity of pure silver  chap vi of the component parts of the price of commodities in that early and rude state of society which preceeds both the accumulation of stock and the appropriation of land the proportion between the quantities of labor necessary for acquiring different objects seems to be the only circumstance which can afford any rule for exchanging them for one another if among a nation of hunters for example it usually costs twice the labor to kill a beaver which it does to kill a deer one beaver should naturally exchange for or be worth two deer it is natural that what is usually the produce of two days or two hours labor should be worth double of what is usually the produce of one days or one hours labor  if the one species of labor should be more severe than the other some allowance will naturally be made for this superior hardship and the produce of one hours labor in the one way may frequently exchange for that of two hours labor in the other  or if the one species of labor requires an uncommon degree of dexterity and ingenuity the esteem which men have for such talents will naturally give a value to their produce superior to what would be due to the time employed about it such talents can seldom be acquired but in consequence of long application and the superior value of their produce may frequently be no more than a reasonable compensation for the time and labor which must be spent in acquiring them in the advanced state of society allowances of this kind for superior hardship and superior skill are commonly made in the wages of labor and something of the same kind must probably have taken place in its earliest and rudest period  in this state of things the quantity of labor commonly employed in acquiring or producing any commodity is the only circumstance which can regulate the quantity of labor which it ought commonly to purchase command or exchange for  as soon as stock has accumulated in the hands of particular persons some of them will naturally employ it in setting to work industrious people whom they will supply with materials and subsistence in order to make a profit by the sale of their work or by what their labor adds to the value of the materials in exchanging the complete manufacture either for money for labor or for other goods over and above what may be sufficient to pay the price of the materials and the wages of the workmen something must be given for the profits of the undertaker of the work who hazards his stock in this adventure the value which the workmen add to the materials therefore resolves itself in this case into two parts of which the one pays their wages the other the profits of their employer upon the whole stock of materials and wages which he advanced he could have no interest to employ them unless he expected from the sale of their work something more than what was sufficient to replace his stock to him and he could have no interest to employ a great stock rather than a small one unless his profits were to bear some proportion to the extent of his stock  the profits of stock it may perhaps be thought are only a different name for the wages of a particular sort of labor the labor of inspection and direction they are however altogether different are regulated by quite different principles and bear no proportion to the quantity the hardship or the ingenuity of this supposed labor of inspection and direction they are regulated altogether by the value of the stock employed and are greater or smaller in proportion to the extent of this stock let us suppose for example that in some particular place where the common annual profits of manufacturing stock are ten per cent there are two different manufactures in each of which twenty workmen are employed at the rate of fifteen pounds a year each or at the expense of three hundred a year in each manufactory let us suppose too that the coarse materials annually wrought up in the one cost only seven hundred pounds while the finer materials in the other cost seven thousand the capital annually employed in the one will in this case amount only to one thousand pounds whereas that employed in the other will amount to seven thousand three hundred pounds at the rate of ten per cent therefore the undertaker of the one will expect an yearly profit of about one hundred pounds only while that of the other will expect about seven hundred and thirty pounds but though their profits are so very different their labor of inspection and direction may be either altogether or very nearly the same in many great works almost the whole labor of this kind is frequently committed to some principal clerk his wages properly express the value of this labor of inspection and direction though in settling them some regard is had commonly not only to his labor and skill but to the trust which is reposed in him yet they never bear any regular proportion to the capital of which he oversees the management and the owner of this capital though he is thus discharged of almost all labor still expects that his profits should bear a regular proportion to it in the price of commodities therefore the profits of stock are a source of value altogether different from the wages of labor and regulated by quite different principles  in this state of things therefore the quantity of labor commonly employed in acquiring or producing any commodity is by no means the only circumstance which can regulate the quantity which it ought commonly to purchase command or exchange for an additional quantity it is evident must be due for the profits of the stock which advanced the wages and furnished the materials of that labor  as soon as the land of any country has all become private property the landlords like all other men love to reap where they never sowed and demand a rent even for its natural produce the wood of the forest the grass of the field and all the natural fruits of the earth which when land was in common cost only the trouble of gathering them come to have an additional price fixed upon them men must then pay for the license to gather them and in exchanging them either for money for labor or for other goods over and above what is due both for the labor of gathering them and for the profits of the stock which employs that labor some allowance must be made for the price of the license which constitutes the first rent of land in the price therefore of the greater part of commodities the rent of land comes in this manner to constitute a third source of value  in this state of things neither the quantity of labor commonly employed in acquiring or producing any commodity nor the profits of the stock which advanced the wages and furnished the materials of that labor are the only circumstances which can regulate the quantity of labor which it ought commonly to purchase command or exchange for a third circumstance must likewise be taken into consideration the rent of the land and the commodity must commonly purchase command or exchange for an additional quantity of labor in order to enable the person who brings it to market to pay this rent  the real value of all the different component parts of price is in this manner measured by the quantity of labor which they can each of them purchase or command labor measures the value not only of that part of price which resolves itself into labor but of that which resolves itself into rent and of that which resolves itself into profit  in every society the price of every commodity finally resolves itself into some one or other or all of those three parts and in every improved society all the three enter more or less as component parts into the price of the far greater part of commodities  in the price of corn for example one part pays the rent of the landlord another pays the wages or maintenance of the laborers and laboring cattle employed in producing it and the third pays the profit of the farmer these three parts seem either immediately or ultimately to make up the whole price of corn a fourth part it may perhaps be thought is necessary for replacing the stock of the farmer or for compensating the tear and wear of his laboring cattle and other instruments of husbandry but it must be considered that the price of any instrument of husbandry such as a laboring horse is itself made up of the same three parts the rent of the land upon which he is reared the labor of tending and rearing him and the profits of the farmer who advances both the rent of this land and the wages of this labor though the price of the corn therefore may pay the price as well as the maintenance of the horse the whole price still resolves itself either immediately or ultimately into the same three parts of rent labor and profit  in the price of flour or meal we must add to the price of the corn the profits of the miller and the wages of his servants in the price of bread the profits of the baker and the wages of his servants and in the price of both the labor of transporting the corn from the house of the farmer to that of the miller and from that of the miller to that of the baker together with the profits of those who advance the wages of that labor  the price of flax resolves itself into the same three parts as that of corn in the price of linen we must add to this price the wages of the flaxdresser of the spinner of the weaver of the bleacher etc together with the profits of their respective employers  as any particular commodity comes to be more manufactured that part of the price which resolves itself into wages and profit comes to be greater in proportion to that which resolves itself into rent in the progress of the manufacture not only the number of profits increase but every subsequent profit is greater than the foregoing because the capital from which it is derived must always be greater the capital which employs the weavers for example must be greater than that which employs the spinngers because it not only replaces that capital with its profits but pays besides the wages of the weavers and the profits must always bear some proportion to the capital  in the most improved societies however there are always a few commodities of which the price resolves itself into two parts only the wages of labor and the profits of stock and a still smaller number in which it consists altogether in the wages of labor in the price of seafish for example one part pays the labor of the fishermen and the other the profits of the capital employed in the fishery rent very seldom makes any part of it though it does sometimes as i shall show hereafter it is otherwise at least through the greater part of europe in river fisheries a salmon fishery pays a rent and rent though it cannot well be called the rent of land makes a part of the price of a salmon as well as wages and profit in some parts of scotland a few poor people make a trade of gathering along the sea shore those little variegated stones commonly known by the name of scotch pebbles the price which is paid to them by the stonecutter is altogether the wages of their labor neither rent nor profit make any part of it  but the whole price of every commodity must still finally resolve itself into some one or other or all of those three parts as whatever part of it remains after paying the rent of the land and the price of the whole labor employed in raising manufacturing and bringing it to market must necessarily be profit to somebody  as the price or exchangeable value of every particular commodity taken separately resolves itself into some one or other or all of those three parts so that of all the commodities which compose the whole annual produce of the labor of every country taken complexly must resolve itself into the same three parts and be parcelled out among different inhabitants of the country either as the wages of their labor the profits of their stock or the rent of their land the whole of what is annually either collected or produced by the labor of every society or what comes to the same thing the whole price of it is in this manner originally distributed among some of its different members wages profit and rent are the three original sources of all revenue as well as of all exchangeable value all other revenue is ultimately derived from some one or other of these  whoever derives his revenue from a fund which is his own must draw it either from his labor from his stock or from his land the revenue derived from labor is called wages that derived from stock by the person who manages or employs it is called profit that derived from it by the person who does not employ it himself but lends it to another is called the interest or the use of money it is the compensation which the borrower pays to the lender for the profit which he has an opportunity of making by the use of the money part of that profit naturally belongs to the borrower who runs the risk and takes the trouble of employing it and part to the lender who affords him the opportunity of making this profit the interest of money is always a derivative revenue which if it is not paid from the profit which is made by the use of the money must be paid from some other source of revenue unless perhaps the borrower is a spendthrift who contracts a second debt in order to pay the interest of the first the revenue which proceeds altogether from land is called rent and belongs to the landlord the revenue of the farmer is derived partly from his labor and partly from his stock to him land is only the instrument which enables him to earn the wages of this labor and to make the profits of this stock all taxes and all the revenue which is founded upon them all salaries pensions and annuities of every kind are ultimately derived from some one or other of those three original sources of revenue and are paid either immediately or mediately from the wages of labor the profits of stock or the rent of land  when those three different sorts of revenue belong to different persons they are readily distinguished but when they belong to the same they are sometimes confounded with one another at least in common language  a gentleman who farms a part of his own estate after paying the expense of cultivation should gain both the rent of the landlord and the profit of the farmer he is apt to denominate however his whole gain profit and thus confounds rent with profit at least in common language the greater part of our north american and west indian planters are in this situation they farm the greater part of them their own estates and accordingly we seldom hear of the rent of a plantation but frequently of its profit  common farmers seldom employ any overseer to direct the general operations of the farm they generally too work a good deal with their own hands as ploughmen harrowers etc what remains of the crop after paying the rent therefore should not only replace to them their stock employed in cultivation together with its ordinary profits but pay them the wages which are due to them both as laborers and overseers whatever remains however after paying the rent and keeping up the stock is called profit but wages evidently make a part of it the farmer by saving these wages must necessarily gain them wages therefore are in this case confounded with profit  an independent manufacturer who has stock enough both to purchase materials and to maintain himself till he can carry his work to market should gain both the wages of a journeyman who works under a master and the profit which that master makes by the sale of his work his whole gains however are commonly called profit and wages are in this case too confounded with profit  a gardener who cultivates his own garden with his own hands unites in his own person the three different characters of landlord farmer and labourer his produce therefore should pay him the rent of the first the profit of the second and the wages of the third the whole however is commonly considered as the earnings of his labor both rent and profit are in this case confounded with wages  as in a civilized country there are but few commodities of which the exchangeable value arises from labor only rent and profit contributing largely to that of the far greater part of them so the annual produce of its labor will always be sufficient to purchase or command a much greater quantity of labor than what was employed in raising preparing and bringing that produce to market if the society was annually to employ all the labor which it can annually purchase as the quantity of labor would increase greatly every year so the produce of every succeeding year would be of vastly greater value than that of the foregoing but there is no country in which the whole annual produce is employed in maintaining the industrious the idle every where consume a great part of it and according to the different proportions in which it is annually divided between those two different orders of people its ordinary or average value must either annually increase or diminish or continue the same from one year to another  chap vii of the natural and market price of commodities there is in every society or neighborhood an ordinary or average rate both of wages and profit in every different employment of labor and stock this rate is naturally regulated as i shall show hereafter partly by the general circumstances of the society their riches or poverty their advancing stationary or declining condition and partly by the particular nature of each employment  there is likewise in every society or neighborhood an ordinary or average rate of rent which is regulated too as i shall show hereafter partly by the general circumstances of the society or neighborhood in which the land is situated and partly by the natural or improved fertility of the land  these ordinary or average rates may be called the natural rates of wages profit and rent at the time and place in which they commonly prevail  when the price of any commodity is neither more nor less than what is sufficient to pay the rent of the land the wages of the labor and the profits of the stock employed in raising preparing and bringing it to market according to their natural rates the commodity is then sold for what may be called its natural price  the commodity is then sold precisely for what it is worth or for what it really costs the person who brings it to market for though in common language what is called the prime cost of any commodity does not comprehend the profit of the person who is to sell it again yet if he sells it at a price which does not allow him the ordinary rate of profit in his neighborhood he is evidently a loser by the trade since by employing his stock in some other way he might have made that profit his profit besides is his revenue the proper fund of his subsistence as while he is preparing and bringing the goods to market he advances to his workmen their wages or their subsistence so he advances to himself in the same manner his own subsistence which is generally suitable to the profit which he may reasonably expect from the sale of his goods unless they yield him this profit therefore they do not repay him what they may very properly be said to have really cost him  though the price therefore which leaves him this profit is not always the lowest at which a dealer may sometimes sell his goods it is the lowest at which he is likely to sell them for any considerable time at least where there is perfect liberty or where he may change his trade as often as he pleases  the actual price at which any commodity is commonly sold is called its market price it may either be above or below or exactly the same with its natural price  the market price of every particular commodity is regulated by the proportion between the quantity which is actually brought to market and the demand of those who are willing to pay the natural price of the commodity or the whole value of the rent labor and profit which must be paid in order to bring it thither such people may be called the effectual demanders and their demand the effectual demand since it may be sufficient to effectuate the bringing of the commodity to market it is different from the absolute demand a very poor man may be said in some sense to have a demand for a coach and six he might like to have it but his demand is not an effectual demand as the commodity can never be brought to market in order to satisfy it  when the quantity of any commodity which is brought to market falls short of the effectual demand all those who are willing to pay the whole value of the rent wages and profit which must be paid in order to bring it thither cannot be supplied with the quantity which they want rather than want it altogether some of them will be willing to give more a competition will immediately begin among them and the market price will rise more or less above the natural price according as the greatness of the deficiency increases more or less the eagerness of this competition the same deficiency will generally occasion a more or less eager competition according as the acquisition of the commodity happens to be of more or less importance to the competitors hence the exorbitant price of the necessaries of life during the blockade of a town or in a famine  when the quantity brought to market exceeds the effectual demand it cannot be all sold to those who are willing to pay the whole value of the rent wages and profit which must be paid in order to bring it thither some part must be sold to those who are willing to pay less and the low price which they give for it must reduce the price of the whole the market price will sink more or less below the natural price according as the greatness of the excess increases more or less the competition of the sellers or according as it happens to be more or less important to them to get immediately rid of the commodity the same excess in the importation of perishable will occasion a much greater competition than in that of durable commodities in the importation of oranges for example than in that of old iron  when the quantity brought to market is just sufficient to supply the effectual demand and no more the market price naturally comes to be either exactly or as nearly as can be judged of the same with the natural price the whole quantity upon hand can be disposed of for this price and cannot be disposed of for more the competition of the different dealers obliges them all to accept of this price but does not oblige them to accept of less  the quantity of every commodity brought to market naturally suits itself to the effectual demand it is the interest of all those who employ their land labor or stock in bringing any commodity to market that the quantity never should exceed the effectual demand and it is the interest of all other people that it never should fall short of it  if at any time it exceeds the effectual demand some of the component parts of its price must be paid below their natural rate if it is rent the interest of the landlords will immediately prompt them to withdraw a part of their land and if it is wages or profit the interest of the laborers in the one case and of their employers in the other will prompt them to withdraw a part of their labor or stock from this employment the quantity brought to market will soon be no more than sufficient to supply the effectual demand all the different parts of its price will rise to their natural rate and the whole price to its natural price  if on the contrary the quantity brought to market should at any time fall short of the effectual demand some of the component parts of its price must rise above their natural rate if it is rent the interest of all other landlords will naturally prompt them to prepare more land for the raising of this commodity if it is wages or profit the interest of all other laborers and dealers will soon prompt them to employ more labor and stock in preparing and bringing it to market the quantity brought thither will soon be sufficient to supply the effectual demand all the different parts of its price will soon sink to their natural rate and the whole price to its natural price  the natural price therefore is as it were the central price to which the prices of all commodities are continually gravitating different accidents may sometimes keep them suspended a good deal above it and sometimes force them down even somewhat below it but whatever may be the obstacles which hinder them from settling in this center of repose and continuance they are constantly tending toward it  the whole quantity of industry annually employed in order to bring any commodity to market naturally suits itself in this manner to the effectual demand it naturally aims at bringing always that precise quantity thither which may be sufficient to supply and no more than supply that demand  but in some employments the same quantity of industry will in different years produce very different quantities of commodities while in others it will produce always the same or very nearly the same the same number of laborers in husbandry will in different years produce very different quantities of corn wine oil hops etc but the same number of spinners and weavers will every year produce the same or very nearly the same quantity of linen and woollen cloth it is only the average produce of the one species of industry which can be suited in any respect to the effectual demand and as its actual produce is frequently much greater and frequently much less than its average produce the quantity of the commodities brought to market will sometimes exceed a good deal and sometimes fall short a good deal of the effectual demand even though that demand therefore should continue always the same their market price will be liable to great fluctuations will sometimes fall a good deal below and sometimes rise a good deal above their natural price in the other species of industry the produce of equal quantities of labor being always the same or very nearly the same it can be more exactly suited to the effectual demand while that demand continues the same therefore the market price of the commodities is likely to do so too and to be either altogether or as nearly as can be judged of the same with the natural price that the price of linen and woollen cloth is liable neither to such frequent nor to such great variations as the price of corn every mans experience will inform him the price of the one species of commodities varies only with the variations in the demand that of the other varies not only with the variations in the demand but with the much greater and more frequent variations in the quantity of what is brought to market in order to supply that demand  the occasional and temporary fluctuations in the market price of any commodity fall chiefly upon those parts of its price which resolve themselves into wages and profit that part which resolves itself into rent is less affected by them a rent certain in money is not in the least affected by them either in its rate or in its value a rent which consists either in a certain proportion or in a certain quantity of the rude produce is no doubt affected in its yearly value by all the occasional and temporary fluctuations in the market price of that rude produce but it is seldom affected by them in its yearly rate in settling the terms of the lease the landlord and farmer endeavor according to their best judgment to adjust that rate not to the temporary and occasional but to the average and ordinary price of the produce  such fluctuations affect both the value and the rate either of wages or of profit according as the market happens to be either overstocked or understocked with commodities or with labor with work done or with work to be done a public mourning raises the price of black cloth with which the market is almost always understocked upon such occasions and augments the profits of the merchants who possess any considerable quantity of it it has no effect upon the wages of the weavers the market is understocked with commodities not with labor with work done not with work to be done it raises the wages of journeymen tailors the market is here understocked with labor there is an effectual demand for labor for more work to be done than can be had it sinks the price of colored silks and cloths and thereby reduces the profits of the merchants who have any considerable quantity of them upon hand it sinks too the wages of the workmen employed in preparing such commodities for which all demand is stopped for six months perhaps for a twelvemonth the market is here overstocked both with commodities and with labor  but though the market price of every particular commodity is in this manner continually gravitating if one may say so toward the natural price yet sometimes particular accidents sometimes natural causes and sometimes particular regulations of police may in many commodities keep up the market price for a long time together a good deal above the natural price  when by an increase in the effectual demand the market price of some particular commodity happens to rise a good deal above the natural price those who employ their stocks in supplying that market are generally careful to conceal this change if it was commonly known their great profit would tempt so many new rivals to employ their stocks in the same way that the effectual demand being fully supplied the market price would soon be reduced to the natural price and perhaps for some time even below it if the market is at a great distance from the residence of those who supply it they may sometimes be able to keep the secret for several years together and may so long enjoy their extraordinary profits without any new rivals secrets of this kind however it must be acknowledged can seldom be long kept and the extraordinary profit can last very little longer than they are kept  secrets in manufactures are capable of being longer kept than secrets in trade a dyer who has found the means of producing a particular color with materials which cost only half the price of those commonly made use of may with good management enjoy the advantage of his discovery as long as he lives and even leave it as a legacy to his posterity his extraordinary gains arise from the high price which is paid for his private labor they properly consist in the high wages of that labor but as they are repeated upon every part of his stock and as their whole amount bears upon that account a regular proportion to it they are commonly considered as extraordinary profits of stock  such enhancements of the market price are evidently the effects of particular accidents of which however the operation may sometimes last for many years together  some natural productions require such a singularity of soil and situation that all the land in a great country which is fit for producing them may not be sufficient to supply the effectual demand the whole quantity brought to market therefore may be disposed of to those who are willing to give more than what is sufficient to pay the rent of the land which produced them together with the wages of the labor and the profits of the stock which were employed in preparing and bringing them to market according to their natural rates such commodities may continue to be sold at this high price for whole centuries together and that part of it which resolves itself into the rent of land is in this case the part which is generally paid above its natural rate the rent of the land which affords such singular and esteemed productions like the rent of some vineyards in france of a peculiarly happy soil and situation bears no regular proportion to the rent of other equally fertile and equally well cultivated land in its neighborhood the wages of the labor and the profits of the stock employed in bringing such commodities to market on the contrary are seldom out of their natural proportion to those of the other employments of labor and stock in their neighborhood  such enhancements of the market price are evidently the effect of natural causes which may hinder the effectual demand from ever being fully supplied and which may continue therefore to operate forever  a monopoly granted either to an individual or to a trading company has the same effect as a secret in trade or manufactures the monopolists by keeping the market constantly understocked by never fully supplying the effectual demand sell their commodities much above the natural price and raise their emoluments whether they consist in wages or profit greatly above their natural rate  the price of monopoly is upon every occasion the highest which can be got the natural price or the price of free competition on the contrary is the lowest which can be taken not upon every occasion indeed but for any considerable time together the one is upon every occasion the highest which can be squeezed out of the buyers or which it is supposed they will consent to give the other is the lowest which the sellers can commonly afford to take and at the same time continue their business  the exclusive privileges of corporations statutes of apprenticeship and all those laws which restrain in particular employments the competition to a smaller number than might otherwise go into them have the same tendency though in a less degree they are a sort of enlarged monopolies and may frequently for ages together and in whole classes of employments keep up the market price of particular commodities above the natural price and maintain both the wages of the labor and the profits of the stock employed about them somewhat above their natural rate  such enhancements of the market price may last as long as the regulations of police which give occasion to them  the market price of any particular commodity though it may continue long above can seldom continue long below its natural price whatever part of it was paid below the natural rate the persons whose interest it affected would immediately feel the loss and would immediately withdraw either so much land or so much labor or so much stock from being employed about it that the quantity brought to market would soon be no more than sufficient to supply the effectual demand its market price therefore would soon rise to the natural price this at least would be the case where there was perfect liberty  the same statutes of apprenticeship and other corporation laws indeed which when a manufacture is in prosperity enable the workman to raise his wages a good deal above their natural rate sometimes oblige him when it decays to let them down a good deal below it as in the one case they exclude many people from his employment so in the other they exclude him from many employments the effect of such regulations however is not near so durable in sinking the workmans wages below as in raising them above their natural rate their operation in the one way may endure for many centuries but in the other it can last no longer than the lives of some of the workmen who were bred to the business in the time of its prosperity when they are gone the number of those who are afterward educated to the trade will naturally suit itself to the effectual demand the police must be as violent as that of indostan or ancient egypt where every man was bound by a principle of religion to follow the occupation of his father and was supposed to commit the most horrid sacrilege if he changed it for another which can in any particular employment and for several generations together sink either the wages of labor or the profits of stock below their natural rate  this is all that i think necessary to be observed at present concerning the deviations whether occasional or permanent of the market price of commodities from the natural price  the natural price itself varies with the natural rate of each of its component parts of wages profit and rent and in every society this rate varies according to their circumstances according to their riches or poverty their advancing stationary or declining condition i shall in the four following chapters endeavor to explain as fully and distinctly as i can the causes of those different variations  first i shall endeavor to explain what are the circumstances which naturally determine the rate of wages and in what manner those circumstances are affected by the riches or poverty by the advancing stationary or declining state of the society  secondly i shall endeavor to show what are the circumstances which naturally determine the rate of profit and in what manner too those circumstances are affected by the like variations in the state of the society  though pecuniary wages and profit are very different in the different employments of labor and stock yet a certain proportion seems commonly to take place between both the pecuniary wages in all the different employments of labor and the pecuniary profits in all the different employments of stock this proportion it will appear hereafter depends partly upon the nature of the different employments and partly upon the different laws and policy of the society in which they are carried on but though in many respects dependant upon the laws and policy this proportion seems to be little affected by the riches or poverty of that society by its advancing stationary or declining condition but to remain the same or very nearly the same in all those different states i shall in the third place endeavor to explain all the different circumstances which regulate this proportion  in the fourth and last place i shall endeavor to show what are the circumstances which regulate the rent of land and which either raise or lower the real price of all the different substances which it produces  chap viii of the wages of labor the produce of labor constitutes the natural recompense or wages of labor  in that original state of things which precedes both the appropriation of land and the accumulation of stock the whole produce of labor belongs to the labourer he has neither landlord nor master to share with him  had this state continued the wages of labor would have augmented with all those improvements in its productive powers to which the division of labor gives occasion all things would gradually have become cheaper they would have been produced by a smaller quantity of labor and as the commodities produced by equal quantities of labor would naturally in this state of things be exchanged for one another they would have been purchased likewise with the produce of a smaller quantity  but though all things would have become cheaper in reality in appearance many things might have become dearer than before or have been exchanged for a greater quantity of other goods let us suppose for example that in the greater part of employments the productive powers of labor had been improved to tenfold or that a days labor could produce ten times the quantity of work which it had done originally but that in a particular employment they had been improved only to double or that a days labor could produce only twice the quantity of work which it had done before in exchanging the produce of a days labor in the greater part of employments for that of a days labor in this particular one ten times the original quantity of work in them would purchase only twice the original quantity in it any particular quantity in it therefore a pound weight for example would appear to be five times dearer than before in reality however it would be twice as cheap though it required five times the quantity of other goods to purchase it it would require only half the quantity of labor either to purchase or to produce it the acquisition therefore would be twice as easy as before  but this original state of things in which the labourer enjoyed the whole produce of his own labor could not last beyond the first introduction of the appropriation of land and the accumulation of stock it was at an end therefore long before the most considerable improvements were made in the productive powers of labor and it would be to no purpose to trace further what might have been its effects upon the recompense or wages of labor  as soon as land becomes private property the landlord demands a share of whatever produce te labourer can either raise or collect from it his rent makes the first deduction from the produce of the labor which is employed upon land  it seldom happens that the person who tills the ground has wherewithal to maintain himself till he reaps the harvest his maintenance is generally advanced to him from the stock of a master the farmer who employs him and who would have no interest to employ him unless he was to share in the produce of his labor or unless his stock was to be replaced to him with a profit this profit makes a second deduction from the produce of the labor which is employed upon land  the produce of almost all other labor is liable to the like deduction of profit in all arts and manufactures the greater part of the workmen stand in need of a master to advance them the materials of their work and their wages and maintenance till it be completed he shares in the produce of their labor or in the value which it adds to the materials upon which it is bestowed and in this share consists his profit  it sometimes happens indeed that a single independent workman has stock sufficient both to purchase the materials of his work and to maintain himself till it be completed he is both master and workman and enjoys the whole produce of his own labor or the whole value which it adds to the materials upon which it is bestowed it includes what are usually two distinct revenues belonging to two distinct persons the profits of stock and the wages of labor  such cases however are not very frequent and in every part of europe twenty workmen serve under a master for one that is independent and the wages of labor are every where understood to be what they usually are when the labourer is one person and the owner of the stock which employs him another  what are the common wages of labor depends every where upon the contract usually made between those two parties whose interests are by no means the same the workmen desire to get as much the masters to give as little as possible the former are disposed to combine in order to raise the latter in order to lower the wages of labor  it is not however difficult to foresee which of the two parties must upon all ordinary occasions have the advantage in the dispute and force the other into a compliance with their terms the masters being fewer in number cannot only combine more easily but the law authorizes their combinations or at least does not prohibit them while it prohibits those of the workmen we have no acts of parliament against combining to lower the price of work but many against combining to raise it in all such disputes the masters can hold out much longer a landlord a farmer a master manufacturer or merchant though they did not employ a single workman could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired many workmen could not subsist a week few could subsist a month and scarce any a year without employment in the longrun the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him but the necessity is not so immediate  we rarely hear it has been said of the combinations of masters though frequently of those of workmen but whoever imagines upon this account that masters rarely combine is as ignorant of the world as of the subject masters are always and every where in a sort of tacit but constant and uniform combination not to raise the wages of labor above their actual rate to violate this combination is every where a most unpopular action and a sort of reproach to a master among his neighbors and equals we seldom indeed hear of this combination because it is the usual and one may say the natural state of things which nobody ever hears of masters too sometimes enter into particular combinations to sink the wages of labor even below this rate these are always conducted with the utmost silence and secrecy till the moment of execution and when the workmen yield as they sometimes do without resistance though severely felt by them they are never heard of by other people such combinations however are frequently resisted by a contrary defensive combination of the workmen who sometimes too without any provocation of this kind combine of their own accord to raise the price of their labor their usual pretenses are sometimes the high price of provisions sometimes the great profit which their masters make by their work but whether their combinations be offensive or defensive they are always abundantly heard of in order to bring the point to a speedy decision they have always recourse to the loudest clamor and sometimes to the most shocking violence and outrage they are desperate and act with the folly and extravagance of desperate men who must starve or frighten their masters into an immediate compliance with their demands the masters upon these occasions are just as clamorous upon the other side and never cease to call aloud for the assistance of the civil magistrate and the rigorous execution of those laws which have been enacted with so much severity against the combinations of servants laborers and journeymen the workmen accordingly very seldom derive any advantage from the violence of those tumultuous combinations which partly from the interposition of the civil magistrate partly from the superior steadiness of the masters partly from the necessity which the greater part of the workmen are under of submitting for the sake of present subsistence generally end in nothing but the punishment or ruin of the ringleaders  but though in disputes with their workmen masters must generally have the advantage there is however a certain rate below which it seems impossible to reduce for any considerable time the ordinary wages even of the lowest species of labor  a man must always live by his work and his wages must at least be sufficient to maintain him they must even upon most occasions be somewhat more otherwise it would be impossible to bring up a family and the race of such workmen could not last beyond the first generation mr cantillon seems upon this account to suppose that the lowest species of common laborers must every where earn at least double their own maintenance in order that one with another they may be enabled to bring up two children the labor of the wife on account of her necessary attendance on the children being supposed no more than sufficient to provide for herself but onehalf the children born it is computed die before the age of manhood the poorest laborers therefore according to this account must one with another attempt to rear at least four children in order that two may have an equal chance of living to that age but the necessary maintenance of four children it is supposed may be nearly equal to that of one man the labor of an ablebodied slave the same author adds is computed to be worth double his maintenance and that of the meanest labourer he thinks cannot be worth less than that of an ablebodied slave thus far at least seems certain that in order to bring up a family the labor of the husband and wife together must even in the lowest species of common labor be able to earn something more than what is precisely necessary for their own maintenance but in what proportion whether in that above mentioned or in any other i shall not take upon me to determine  there are certain circumstances however which sometimes give the laborers an advantage and enable them to raise their wages considerably above this rate evidently the lowest which is consistent with common humanity  when in any country the demand for those who live by wages laborers journeymen servants of every kind is continually increasing when every year furnishes employment for a greater number than had been employed the year before the workmen have no occasion to combine in order to raise their wages the scarcity of hands occasions a competition among masters who bid against one another in order to get them and thus voluntarily break through the natural combination of masters not to raise wages  the demand for those who live by wages it is evident cannot increase but in proportion to the increase of the funds which are destined for the payment of wages these funds are of two kinds first the revenue which is over and above what is necessary for the maintenance and secondly the stock which is over and above what is necessary for the employment of their masters  when the landlord annuitant or monied man has a greater revenue than what he judges sufficient to maintain his own family he employs either the whole or a part of the surplus in maintaining one or more menial servants increase this surplus and he will naturally increase the number of those servants  when an independent workman such as a weaver or shoemaker has got more stock than what is sufficient to purchase the materials of his own work and to maintain himself till he can dispose of it he naturally employs one or more journeymen with the surplus in order to make a profit by their work increase this surplus and he will naturally increase the number of his journeymen  the demand for those who live by wages therefore necessarily increases with the increase of the revenue and stock of every country and cannot possibly increase without it the increase of revenue and stock is the increase of national wealth the demand for those who live by wages therefore naturally increases with the increase of national wealth and cannot possibly increase without it  it is not the actual greatness of national wealth but its continual increase which occasions a rise in the wages of labor it is not accordingly in the richest countries but in the most thriving or in those which are growing rich the fastest that the wages of labor are highest england is certainly in the present times a much richer country than any part of north america the wages of labor however are much higher in north america than in any part of england in the province of new york common laborers earn three shillings and sixpence currency equal to two shillings sterling a day ship carpenters ten shillings and sixpence currency with a pint of rum worth sixpence sterling equal in all to six shillings and sixpence sterling house carpenters and bricklayers eight shillings currency equal to four shillings and sixpence sterling journeymen tailors five shillings currency equal to about two shillings and tenpence sterling these prices are all above the london price and wages are said to be as high in the other colonies as in new york the price of provisions is every where in north america much lower than in england a dearth has never been known there in the worst seasons they have always had a sufficiency for themselves though less for exportation if the money price of labor therefore be higher than it is any where in the mother country its real price the real command of the necessaries and conveniences of life which it conveys to the labourer must be higher in a still greater proportion  but though north america is not yet so rich as england it is much more thriving and advancing with much greater rapidity to the further acquisition of riches the most decisive mark of the prosperity of any country is the increase of the number of its inhabitants in great britain and most other european countries they are not supposed to double in less than five hundred years in the british colonies in north america it has been found that they double in twenty or five and twenty years nor in the present times is this increase principally owing to the continual importation of new inhabitants but to the great multiplication of the species those who live to old age it is said frequently see there from fifty to a hundred and sometimes many more descendants from their own body labor is there so well rewarded that a numerous family of children instead of being a burden is a source of opulence and prosperity to the parents the labor of each child before it can leave their house is computed to be worth a hundred pounds clear gain to them a young widow with four or five young children who among the middling or inferior ranks of people in europe would have so little chance for a second husband is there frequently courted as a sort of fortune the value of children is the greatest of all encouragements to marriage we cannot therefore wonder that the people in north america should generally marry very young notwithstanding the great increase occasioned by such early marriages there is a continual complaint of the scarcity of hands in north america the demand for laborers the funds destined for maintaining them increase it seems still faster than they can find laborers to employ  though the wealth of a country should be very great yet if it has been long stationary we must not expect to find the wages of labor very high in it the funds destined for the payment of wages the revenue and stock of its inhabitants may be of the greatest extent but if they have continued for several centuries of the same or very nearly of the same extent the number of laborers employed every year could easily supply and even more than supply the number wanted the following year there could seldom be any scarcity of hands nor could the masters be obliged to bid against one another in order to get them the hands on the contrary would in this case naturally multiply beyond their employment there would be a constant scarcity of employment and the laborers would be obliged to bid against one another in order to get it if in such a country the wages of labor had ever been more than sufficient to maintain the labourer and to enable him to bring up a family the competition of the laborers and the interest of the masters would soon reduce them to this lowest rate which is consistent with common humanity china has been long one of the richest that is one of the most fertile best cultivated most industrious and most populous countries in the world it seems however to have been long stationary marco polo who visited it more than five hundred years ago describes its cultivation industry and populousness almost in the same terms in which they are described by travelers in the present times it had perhaps even long before his time acquired that full complement of riches which the nature of its laws and institutions permits it to acquire the accounts of all travelers inconsistent in many other respects agree in the low wages of labor and in the difficulty which a labourer finds in bringing up a family in china if by digging the ground a whole day he can get what will purchase a small quantity of rice in the evening he is contented the condition of artificers is if possible still worse instead of waiting indolently in their workhouses for the calls of their customers as in europe they are continually running about the streets with the tools of their respective trades offering their service and as it were begging employment the poverty of the lower ranks of people in china far surpasses that of the most beggarly nations in europe in the neighborhood of canton many hundred it is commonly said many thousand families have no habitation on the land but live constantly in little fishing boats upon the rivers and canals the subsistence which they find there is so scanty that they are eager to fish up the nastiest garbage thrown overboard from any european ship any carrion the carcass of a dead dog or cat for example though half putrid and stinking is as welcome to them as the most wholesome food to the people of other countries marriage is encouraged in china not by the profitableness of children but by the liberty of destroying them in all great towns several are every night exposed in the street or drowned like puppies in the water the performance of this horrid office is even said to be the avowed business by which some people earn their subsistence  china however though it may perhaps stand still does not seem to go backwards its towns are nowhere deserted by their inhabitants the lands which had once been cultivated are nowhere neglected the same or very nearly the same annual labor must therefore continue to be performed and the funds destined for maintaining it must not consequently be sensibly diminished the lowest class of laborers therefore notwithstanding their scanty subsistence must some way or another make shift to continue their race so far as to keep up their usual numbers  but it would be otherwise in a country where the funds destined for the maintenance of labor were sensibly decaying every year the demand for servants and laborers would in all the different classes of employments be less than it had been the year before many who had been bred in the superior classes not being able to find employment in their own business would be glad to seek it in the lowest the lowest class being not only overstocked with its own workmen but with the overflowings of all the other classes the competition for employment would be so great in it as to reduce the wages of labor to the most miserable and scanty subsistence of the labourer many would not be able to find employment even upon these hard terms but would either starve or be driven to seek a subsistence either by begging or by the perpetration perhaps of the greatest enormities want famine and mortality would immediately prevail in that class and from thence extend themselves to all the superior classes till the number of inhabitants in the country was reduced to what could easily be maintained by the revenue and stock which remained in it and which had escaped either the tyranny or calamity which had destroyed the rest this perhaps is nearly the present state of bengal and of some other of the english settlements in the east indies in a fertile country which had before been much depopulated where subsistence consequently should not be very difficult and where notwithstanding three or four hundred thousand people die of hunger in one year we may be assured that the funds destined for the maintenance of the laboring poor are fast decaying the difference between the genius of the british constitution which protects and governs north america and that of the mercantile company which oppresses and domineers in the east indies cannot perhaps be better illustrated than by the different state of those countries  the liberal reward of labor therefore as it is the necessary effect so it is the natural symptom of increasing national wealth the scanty maintenance of the laboring poor on the other hand is the natural symptom that things are at a stand and their starving condition that they are going fast backwards  in great britain the wages of labor seem in the present times to be evidently more than what is precisely necessary to enable the labourer to bring up a family in order to satisfy ourselves upon this point it will not be necessary to enter into any tedious or doubtful calculation of what may be the lowest sum upon which it is possible to do this there are many plain symptoms that the wages of labor are nowhere in this country regulated by this lowest rate which is consistent with common humanity  first in almost every part of great britain there is a distinction even in the lowest species of labor between summer and winter wages summer wages are always highest but on account of the extraordinary expense of fuel the maintenance of a family is most expensive in winter wages therefore being highest when this expense is lowest it seems evident that they are not regulated by what is necessary for this expense but by the quantity and supposed value of the work a labourer it may be said indeed ought to save part of his summer wages in order to defray his winter expense and that through the whole year they do not exceed what is necessary to maintain his family through the whole year a slave however or one absolutely dependent on us for immediate subsistence would not be treated in this manner his daily subsistence would be proportioned to his daily necessities  secondly the wages of labor do not in great britain fluctuate with the price of provisions these vary everywhere from year to year frequently from month to month but in many places the money price of labor remains uniformly the same sometimes for half a century together if in these places therefore the laboring poor can maintain their families in dear years they must be at their ease in times of moderate plenty and in affluence in those of extraordinary cheapness the high price of provisions during these ten years past has not in many parts of the kingdom been accompanied with any sensible rise in the money price of labor it has indeed in some owing probably more to the increase of the demand for labor than to that of the price of provisions  thirdly as the price of provisions varies more from year to year than the wages of labor so on the other hand the wages of labor vary more from place to place than the price of provisions the prices of bread and butchers meat are generally the same or very nearly the same through the greater part of the united kingdom these and most other things which are sold by retail the way in which the laboring poor buy all things are generally fully as cheap or cheaper in great towns than in the remoter parts of the country for reasons which i shall have occasion to explain hereafter but the wages of labor in a great town and its neighborhood are frequently a fourth or a fifth part twenty or five and twenty per cent higher than at a few miles distance eighteen pence a day may be reckoned the common price of labor in london and its neighborhood at a few miles distance it falls to fourteen and fifteen pence tenpence may be reckoned its price in edinburgh and its neighborhood at a few miles distance it falls to eight pence the usual price of common labor through the greater part of the low country of scotland where it varies a good deal less than in england such a difference of prices which it seems is not always sufficient to transport a man from one parish to another would necessarily occasion so great a transportation of the most bulky commodities not only from one parish to another but from one end of the kingdom almost from one end of the world to the other as would soon reduce them more nearly to a level after all that has been said of the levity and inconstancy of human nature it appears evidently from experience that a man is of all sorts of luggage the most difficult to be transported if the laboring poor therefore can maintain their families in those parts of the kingdom where the price of labor is lowest they must be in affluence where it is highest  fourthly the variations in the price of labor not only do not correspond either in place or time with those in the price of provisions but they are frequently quite opposite  grain the food of the common people is dearer in scotland than in england whence scotland receives almost every year very large supplies but english corn must be sold dearer in scotland the country to which it is brought than in england the country from which it comes and in proportion to its quality it cannot be sold dearer in scotland than the scotch corn that comes to the same market in competition with it the quality of grain depends chiefly upon the quantity of flour or meal which it yields at the mill and in this respect english grain is so much superior to the scotch that though often dearer in appearance or in proportion to the measure of its bulk it is generally cheaper in reality or in proportion to its quality or even to the measure of its weight the price of labor on the contrary is dearer in england than in scotland if the laboring poor therefore can maintain their families in the one part of the united kingdom they must be in affluence in the other oatmeal indeed supplies the common people in scotland with the greatest and the best part of their food which is in general much inferior to that of their neighbors of the same rank in england this difference however in the mode of their subsistence is not the cause but the effect of the difference in their wages though by a strange misapprehension i have frequently heard it represented as the cause it is not because one man keeps a coach while his neighbor walks afoot that the one is rich and the other poor but because the one is rich he keeps a coach and because the other is poor he walks afoot  during the course of the last century taking one year with another grain was dearer in both parts of the united kingdom than during that of the present this is a matter of fact which cannot now admit of any reasonable doubt and the proof of it is if possible still more decisive with regard to scotland than with regard to england it is in scotland supported by the evidence of the public fiars annual valuations made upon oath according to the actual state of the markets of all the different sorts of grain in every different county of scotland if such direct proof could require any collateral evidence to confirm it i would observe that this has likewise been the case in france and probably in most other parts of europe with regard to france there is the clearest proof but though it is certain that in both parts of the united kingdom grain was somewhat dearer in the last century than in the present it is equally certain that labor was much cheaper if the laboring poor therefore could bring up their families then they must be much more at their ease now in the last century the most usual daywages of common labor through the greater part of scotland were sixpence in summer and fivepence in winter three shillings a week the same price very nearly still continues to be paid in some parts of the highlands and western islands through the greater part of the low country the most usual wages of common labor are now eightpence a day tenpence sometimes a shilling about edinburgh in the countries which border upon england probably on account of that neighborhood and in a few other places where there has lately been a considerable rise in the demand for labor about glasgow carron ayrshire etc in england the improvements of agriculture manufactures and commerce began much earlier than in scotland the demand for labor and consequently its price must necessarily have increased with those improvements in the last century accordingly as well as in the present the wages of labor were higher in england than in scotland they have risen too considerably since that time though on account of the greater variety of wages paid there in different places it is more difficult to ascertain how much in      the pay of a foot soldier was the same as in the present times eight pence a day when it was first established it would naturally be regulated by the usual wages of common laborers the rank of people from which foot soldiers are commonly drawn lord chief justice hales who wrote in the time of charles ii computes the necessary expense of a labourers family consisting of six persons the father and mother two children able to do something and two not able at ten shillings a week or twentysix pounds a year if they cannot earn this by their labor they must make it up he supposes either by begging or stealing he appears to have enquired very carefully into this subject in      mr gregory king whose skill in political arithmetic is so much extolled by doctor davenant computed the ordinary income of laborers and outservants to be fifteen pounds a year to a family which he supposed to consist one with another of three and a half persons his calculation therefore though different in appearance corresponds very nearly at bottom with that of judge hales both suppose the weekly expense of such families to be about twentypence a head both the pecuniary income and expense of such families have increased considerably since that time through the greater part of the kingdom in some places more and in some less though perhaps scarce any where so much as some exaggerated accounts of the present wages of labor have lately represented them to the public the price of labor it must be observed cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labor not only according to the different abilities of the workmen but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters where wages are not regulated by law all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly though it has often pretended to do so  the real recompense of labor the real quantity of the necessaries and conveniences of life which it can procure to the labourer has during the course of the present century increased perhaps in a still greater proportion than its money price not only grain has become somewhat cheaper but many other things from which the industrious poor derive an agreeable and wholesome variety of food have become a great deal cheaper potatoes for example do not at present through the greater part of the kingdom cost half the price which they used to do thirty or forty years ago the same thing may be said of turnips carrots cabbages things which were formerly never raised but by the spade but which are now commonly raised by the plough all sort of garden stuff too has become cheaper the greater part of the apples and even of the onions consumed in great britain were in the last century imported from flanders the great improvements in the coarser manufactures of both linen and woollen cloth furnish the laborers with cheaper and better clothing and those in the manufactures of the coarser metals with cheaper and better instruments of trade as well as with many agreeable and convenient pieces of household furniture soap salt candles leather and fermented liquors have indeed become a good deal dearer chiefly from the taxes which have been laid upon them the quantity of these however which the laboring poor are under any necessity of consuming is so very small that the increase in their price does not compensate the diminution in that of so many other things the common complaint that luxury extends itself even to the lowest ranks of the people and that the laboring poor will not now be contented with the same food clothing and lodging which satisfied them in former times may convince us that it is not the money price of labor only but its real recompense which has augmented  is this improvement in the circumstances of the lower ranks of the people to be regarded as an advantage or as an inconveniency to the society the answer seems at first sight abundantly plain servants laborers and workmen of different kinds make up the far greater part of every great political society but what improves the circumstances of the greater part can never be regarded as an inconveniency to the whole no society can surely be flourishing and happy of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable it is but equity besides that they who feed cloth and lodge the whole body of the people should have such a share of the produce of their own labor as to be themselves tolerably well fed clothed and lodged  poverty though it no doubt discourages does not always prevent marriage it seems even to be favorable to generation a half starved highland woman frequently bears more than twenty children while a pampered fine lady is often incapable of bearing any and is generally exhausted by two or three barrenness so frequent among women of fashion is very rare among those of inferior station luxury in the fair sex while it enflames perhaps the passion for enjoyment seems always to weaken and frequently to destroy altogether the powers of generation  but poverty though it does not prevent the generation is extremely unfavourable to the rearing of children the tender plant is produced but in so cold a soil and so severe a climate soon withers and dies it is not uncommon i have been frequently told in the highlands of scotland for a mother who has borne twenty children not to have two alive several officers of great experience have assured me that so far from recruiting their regiment they have never been able to supply it with drums and fifes from all the soldiers children that were born in it a greater number of fine children however is seldom seen anywhere than about a barrack of soldiers very few of them it seems arrive at the age of thirteen or fourteen in some places one half the children born die before they are four years of age in many places before they are seven and in almost all places before they are nine or ten this great mortality however will every where be found chiefly among the children of the common people who cannot afford to tend them with the same care as those of better station though their marriages are generally more fruitful than those of people of fashion a smaller proportion of their children arrive at maturity in foundling hospitals and among the children brought up by parish charities the mortality is still greater than among those of the common people  every species of animals naturally multiplies in proportion to the means of their subsistence and no species can ever multiply beyond it but in civilized society it is only among the inferior ranks of people that the scantiness of subsistence can set limits to the further multiplication of the human species and it can do so in no other way than by destroying a great part of the children which their fruitful marriages produce  the liberal reward of labor by enabling them to provide better for their children and consequently to bring up a greater number naturally tends to widen and extend those limits it deserves to be remarked too that it necessarily does this as nearly as possible in the proportion which the demand for labor requires if this demand is continually increasing the reward of labor must necessarily encourage in such a manner the marriage and multiplication of laborers as may enable them to supply that continually increasing demand by a continually increasing population if it should at any time be less than what was requisite for this purpose the deficiency of hands would soon raise it and if it should at any time be more their excessive multiplication would soon lower it to this necessary rate the market would be so much understocked with labor in the one case and so much overstocked in the other as would soon force back its price to that proper rate which the circumstances of the society required it is in this manner that the demand for men like that for any other commodity necessarily regulates the production of men quickens it when it goes on too slowly and stops it when it advances too fast it is this demand which regulates and determines the state of propagation in all the different countries of the world in north america in europe and in china which renders it rapidly progressive in the first slow and gradual in the second and altogether stationary in the last  the tear and wear of a slave it has been said is at the expense of his master but that of a free servant is at his own expense the tear and wear of the latter however is in reality as much at the expense of his master as that of the former the wages paid to journeymen and servants of every kind must be such as may enable them one with another to continue the race of journeymen and servants according as the increasing diminishing or stationary demand of the society may happen to require but though the tear and wear of a free servant be equally at the expense of his master it generally costs him much less than that of a slave the fund destined for replacing or repairing if i may say so the tear and wear of the slave is commonly managed by a negligent master or careless overseer that destined for performing the same office with regard to the free man is managed by the free man himself the disorders which generally prevail in the economy of the rich naturally introduce themselves into the management of the former the strict frugality and parsimonious attention of the poor as naturally establish themselves in that of the latter under such different management the same purpose must require very different degrees of expense to execute it it appears accordingly from the experience of all ages and nations i believe that the work done by freemen comes cheaper in the end than that performed by slaves it is found to do so even at boston new york and philadelphia where the wages of common labor are so very high  the liberal reward of labor therefore as it is the effect of increasing wealth so it is the cause of increasing population to complain of it is to lament over the necessary effect and cause of the greatest public prosperity  it deserves to be remarked perhaps that it is in the progressive state while the society is advancing to the further acquisition rather than when it has acquired its full complement of riches that the condition of the laboring poor of the great body of the people seems to be the happiest and the most comfortable it is hard in the stationary and miserable in the declining state the progressive state is in reality the cheerful and the hearty state to all the different orders of the society the stationary is dull the declining melancholy  the liberal reward of labor as it encourages the propagation so it increases the industry of the common people the wages of labor are the encouragement of industry which like every other human quality improves in proportion to the encouragement it receives a plentiful subsistence increases the bodily strength of the labourer and the comfortable hope of bettering his condition and of ending his days perhaps in ease and plenty animates him to exert that strength to the utmost where wages are high accordingly we shall always find the workmen more active diligent and expeditions than where they are low in england for example than in scotland in the neighborhood of great towns than in remote country places some workmen indeed when they can earn in four days what will maintain them through the week will be idle the other three this however is by no means the case with the greater part workmen on the contrary when they are liberally paid by the piece are very apt to overwork themselves and to ruin their health and constitution in a few years a carpenter in london and in some other places is not supposed to last in his utmost vigor above eight years something of the same kind happens in many other trades in which the workmen are paid by the piece as they generally are in manufactures and even in country labor wherever wages are higher than ordinary almost every class of artificers is subject to some peculiar infirmity occasioned by excessive application to their peculiar species of work ramuzzini an eminent italian physician has written a particular book concerning such diseases we do not reckon our soldiers the most industrious set of people among us yet when soldiers have been employed in some particular sorts of work and liberally paid by the piece their officers have frequently been obliged to stipulate with the undertaker that they should not be allowed to earn above a certain sum every day according to the rate at which they were paid till this stipulation was made mutual emulation and the desire of greater gain frequently prompted them to overwork themselves and to hurt their health by excessive labor excessive application during four days of the week is frequently the real cause of the idleness of the other three so much and so loudly complained of great labor either of mind or body continued for several days together is in most men naturally followed by a great desire of relaxation which if not restrained by force or by some strong necessity is almost irresistible it is the call of nature which requires to be relieved by some indulgence sometimes of ease only but sometimes too of dissipation and diversion if it is not complied with the consequences are often dangerous and sometimes fatal and such as almost always sooner or later bring on the peculiar infirmity of the trade if masters would always listen to the dictates of reason and humanity they have frequently occasion rather to moderate than to animate the application of many of their workmen it will be found i believe in every sort of trade that the man who works so moderately as to be able to work constantly not only preserves his health the longest but in the course of the year executes the greatest quantity of work  in cheap years it is pretended workmen are generally more idle and in dear ones more industrious than ordinary a plentiful subsistence therefore it has been concluded relaxes and a scanty one quickens their industry that a little more plenty than ordinary may render some workmen idle cannot well be doubted but that it should have this effect upon the greater part or that men in general should work better when they are ill fed than when they are well fed when they are disheartened than when they are in good spirits when they are frequently sick than when they are generally in good health seems not very probable years of dearth it is to be observed are generally among the common people years of sickness and mortality which cannot fail to diminish the produce of their industry  in years of plenty servants frequently leave their masters and trust their subsistence to what they can make by their own industry but the same cheapness of provisions by increasing the fund which is destined for the maintenance of servants encourages masters farmers especially to employ a greater number farmers upon such occasions expect more profit from their corn by maintaining a few more laboring servants than by selling it at a low price in the market the demand for servants increases while the number of those who offer to supply that demand diminishes the price of labor therefore frequently rises in cheap years  in years of scarcity the difficulty and uncertainty of subsistence make all such people eager to return to service but the high price of provisions by diminishing the funds destined for the maintenance of servants disposes masters rather to diminish than to increase the number of those they have in dear years too poor independent workmen frequently consume the little stocks with which they had used to supply themselves with the materials of their work and are obliged to become journeymen for subsistence more people want employment than can easily get it many are willing to take it upon lower terms than ordinary and the wages of both servants and journeymen frequently sink in dear years  masters of all sorts therefore frequently make better bargains with their servants in dear than in cheap years and find them more humble and dependant in the former than in the latter they naturally therefore commend the former as more favorable to industry landlords and farmers besides two of the largest classes of masters have another reason for being pleased with dear years the rents of the one and the profits of the other depend very much upon the price of provisions nothing can be more absurd however than to imagine that men in general should work less when they work for themselves than when they work for other people a poor independent workman will generally be more industrious than even a journeyman who works by the piece the one enjoys the whole produce of his own industry the other shares it with his master the one in his separate independent state is less liable to the temptations of bad company which in large manufactories so frequently ruin the morals of the other the superiority of the independent workman over those servants who are hired by the month or by the year and whose wages and maintenance are the same whether they do much or do little is likely to be still greater cheap years tend to increase the proportion of independent workmen to journeymen and servants of all kinds and dear years to diminish it  a french author of great knowledge and ingenuity mr messance receiver of the tailles in the election of st etienne endeavors to show that the poor do more work in cheap than in dear years by comparing the quantity and value of the goods made upon those different occasions in three different manufactures one of coarse woollens carried on at elbeuf one of linen and another of silk both which extend through the whole generality of rouen it appears from his account which is copied from the registers of the public offices that the quantity and value of the goods made in all those three manufactures has generally been greater in cheap than in dear years and that it has always been greatest in the cheapest and least in the dearest years all the three seem to be stationary manufactures or which though their produce may vary somewhat from year to year are upon the whole neither going backwards nor forwards  the manufacture of linen in scotland and that of coarse woollens in the west riding of yorkshire are growing manufactures of which the produce is generally though with some variations increasing both in quantity and value upon examining however the accounts which have been published of their annual produce i have not been able to observe that its variations have had any sensible connection with the dearness or cheapness of the seasons in    0 a year of great scarcity both manufactures indeed appear to have declined very considerably but in      another year of great scarcity the scotch manufacture made more than ordinary advances the yorkshire manufacture indeed declined and its produce did not rise to what it had been in      till      after the repeal of the american stamp act in that and the following year it greatly exceeded what it had ever been before and it has continued to do so ever since  the produce of all great manufactures for distant sale must necessarily depend not so much upon the dearness or cheapness of the seasons in the countries where they are carried on as upon the circumstances which affect the demand in the countries where they are consumed upon peace or war upon the prosperity or declension of other rival manufactures and upon the good or bad humor of their principal customers a great part of the extraordinary work besides which is probably done in cheap years never enters the public registers of manufactures the menservants who leave their masters become independent laborers the women return to their parents and commonly spin in order to make clothes for themselves and their families even the independent workmen do not always work for public sale but are employed by some of their neighbors in manufactures for family use the produce of their labor therefore frequently makes no figure in those public registers of which the records are sometimes published with so much parade and from which our merchants and manufacturers would often vainly pretend to anounce the prosperity or declension of the greatest empires  though the variations in the price of labor not only do not always correspond with those in the price of provisions but are frequently quite opposite we must not upon this account imagine that the price of provisions has no influence upon that of labor the money price of labor is necessarily regulated by two circumstances the demand for labor and the price of the necessaries and conveniences of life the demand for labor according as it happens to be increasing stationary or declining or to require an increasing stationary or declining population determines the quantity of the necessaries and conveniences of life which must be given to the labourer and the money price of labor is determined by what is requisite for purchasing this quantity though the money price of labor therefore is sometimes high where the price of provisions is low it would be still higher the demand continuing the same if the price of provisions was high  it is because the demand for labor increases in years of sudden and extraordinary plenty and diminishes in those of sudden and extraordinary scarcity that the money price of labor sometimes rises in the one and sinks in the other  in a year of sudden and extraordinary plenty there are funds in the hands of many of the employers of industry sufficient to maintain and employ a greater number of industrious people than had been employed the year before and this extraordinary number cannot always be had those masters therefore who want more workmen bid against one another in order to get them which sometimes raises both the real and the money price of their labor  the contrary of this happens in a year of sudden and extraordinary scarcity the funds destined for employing industry are less than they had been the year before a considerable number of people are thrown out of employment who bid against one another in order to get it which sometimes lowers both the real and the money price of labor in    0 a year of extraordinary scarcity many people were willing to work for bare subsistence in the succeeding years of plenty it was more difficult to get laborers and servants  the scarcity of a dear year by diminishing the demand for labor tends to lower its price as the high price of provisions tends to raise it the plenty of a cheap year on the contrary by increasing the demand tends to raise the price of labor as the cheapness of provisions tends to lower it in the ordinary variations of the price of provisions those two opposite causes seem to counterbalance one another which is probably in part the reason why the wages of labor are every where so much more steady and permanent than the price of provisions  the increase in the wages of labor necessarily increases the price of many commodities by increasing that part of it which resolves itself into wages and so far tends to diminish their consumption both at home and abroad the same cause however which raises the wages of labor the increase of stock tends to increase its productive powers and to make a smaller quantity of labor produce a greater quantity of work the owner of the stock which employs a great number of laborers necessarily endeavors for his own advantage to make such a proper division and distribution of employment that they may be enabled to produce the greatest quantity of work possible for the same reason he endeavors to supply them with the best machinery which either he or they can think of what takes place among the laborers in a particular workhouse takes place for the same reason among those of a great society the greater their number the more they naturally divide themselves into different classes and subdivisions of employment more heads are occupied in inventing the most proper machinery for executing the work of each and it is therefore more likely to be invented there are many commodities therefore which in consequence of these improvements come to be produced by so much less labor than before that the increase of its price does not compensate the diminution of its quantity  chap ix of the profits of stock the rise and fall in the profits of stock depend upon the same causes with the rise and fall in the wages of labor the increasing or declining state of the wealth of the society but those causes affect the one and the other very differently  the increase of stock which raises wages tends to lower profit when the stocks of many rich merchants are turned into the same trade their mutual competition naturally tends to lower its profit and when there is a like increase of stock in all the different trades carried on in the same society the same competition must produce the same effect in them all  it is not easy it has already been observed to ascertain what are the average wages of labor even in a particular place and at a particular time we can even in this case seldom determine more than what are the most usual wages but even this can seldom be done with regard to the profits of stock profit is so very fluctuating that the person who carries on a particular trade cannot always tell you himself what is the average of his annual profit it is affected not only by every variation of price in the commodities which he deals in but by the good or bad fortune both of his rivals and of his customers and by a thousand other accidents to which goods when carried either by sea or by land or even when stored in a warehouse are liable it varies therefore not only from year to year but from day to day and almost from hour to hour to ascertain what is the average profit of all the different trades carried on in a great kingdom must be much more difficult and to judge of what it may have been formerly or in remote periods of time with any degree of precision must be altogether impossible  but though it may be impossible to determine with any degree of precision what are or were the average profits of stock either in the present or in ancient times some notion may be formed of them from the interest of money it may be laid down as a maxim that wherever a great deal can be made by the use of money a great deal will commonly be given for the use of it and that wherever little can be made by it less will commonly be given for it according therefore as the usual market rate of interest varies in any country we may be assured that the ordinary profits of stock must vary with it must sink as it sinks and rise as it rises the progress of interest therefore may lead us to form some notion of the progress of profit  by the   th of henry viii all interest above ten per cent was declared unlawful more it seems had sometimes been taken before that in the reign of edward vi religious zeal prohibited all interest this prohibition however like all others of the same kind is said to have produced no effect and probably rather increased than diminished the evil of usury the statute of henry viii was revived by the   th of elizabeth cap   and ten per cent continued to be the legal rate of interest till the   st of james i when it was restricted to eight per cent it was reduced to six per cent soon after the restoration and by the   th of queen anne to five per cent all these different statutary regulations seem to have been made with great propriety they seem to have followed and not to have gone before the market rate of interest or the rate at which people of good credit usually borrowed since the time of queen anne five per cent seems to have been rather above than below the market rate before the late war the government borrowed at three per cent and people of good credit in the capital and in many other parts of the kingdom at three and a half four and four and a half per cent  since the time of henry viii the wealth and revenue of the country have been continually advancing and in the course of their progress their pace seems rather to have been gradually accelerated than retarded they seem not only to have been going on but to have been going on faster and faster the wages of labor have been continually increasing during the same period and in the greater part of the different branches of trade and manufactures the profits of stock have been diminishing  it generally requires a greater stock to carry on any sort of trade in a great town than in a country village the great stocks employed in every branch of trade and the number of rich competitors generally reduce the rate of profit in the former below what it is in the latter but the wages of labor are generally higher in a great town than in a country village in a thriving town the people who have great stocks to employ frequently cannot get the number of workmen they want and therefore bid against one another in order to get as many as they can which raises the wages of labor and lowers the profits of stock in the remote parts of the country there is frequently not stock sufficient to employ all the people who therefore bid against one another in order to get employment which lowers the wages of labor and raises the profits of stock  in scotland though the legal rate of interest is the same as in england the market rate is rather higher people of the best credit there seldom borrow under five per cent even private bankers in edinburgh give four per cent upon their promissory notes of which payment either in whole or in part may be demanded at pleasure private bankers in london give no interest for the money which is deposited with them there are few trades which cannot be carried on with a smaller stock in scotland than in england the common rate of profit therefore must be somewhat greater the wages of labor it has already been observed are lower in scotland than in england the country too is not only much poorer but the steps by which it advances to a better condition for it is evidently advancing seem to be much slower and more tardy  the legal rate of interest in france has not during the course of the present century been always regulated by the market rate in    0 interest was reduced from the twentieth to the fiftieth penny or from five to two per cent in      it was raised to the thirtieth penny or to   per cent in      it was again raised to the twentieth penny or to five per cent in      during the administration of mr laverdy it was reduced to the twentyfifth penny or to four per cent the abbe terray raised it afterward to the old rate of five per cent the supposed purpose of many of those violent reductions of interest was to prepare the way for reducing that of the public debts a purpose which has sometimes been executed france is perhaps in the present times not so rich a country as england and though the legal rate of interest has in france frequently been lower than in england the market rate has generally been higher for there as in other countries they have several very safe and easy methods of evading the law the profits of trade i have been assured by british merchants who had traded in both countries are higher in france than in england and it is no doubt upon this account that many british subjects choose rather to employ their capitals in a country where trade is in disgrace than in one where it is highly respected the wages of labor are lower in france than in england when you go from scotland to england the difference which you may remark between the dress and countenance of the common people in the one country and in the other sufficiently indicates the difference in their condition the contrast is still greater when you return from france france though no doubt a richer country than scotland seems not to be going forward so fast it is a common and even a popular opinion in the country that it is going backwards an opinion which i apprehend is ill founded even with regard to france but which nobody can possibly entertain with regard to scotland who sees the country now and who saw it twenty or thirty years ago  the province of holland on the other hand in proportion to the extent of its territory and the number of its people is a richer country than england the government there borrow at two per cent and private people of good credit at three the wages of labor are said to be higher in holland than in england and the dutch it is well known trade upon lower profits than any people in europe the trade of holland it has been pretended by some people is decaying and it may perhaps be true that some particular branches of it are so but these symptoms seem to indicate sufficiently that there is no general decay when profit diminishes merchants are very apt to complain that trade decays though the diminution of profit is the natural effect of its prosperity or of a greater stock being employed in it than before during the late war the dutch gained the whole carrying trade of france of which they still retain a very large share the great property which they possess both in the french and english funds about forty millions it is said in the latter in which i suspect however there is a considerable exaggeration the great sums which they lend to private people in countries where the rate of interest is higher than in their own are circumstances which no doubt demonstrate the redundancy of their stock or that it has increased beyond what they can employ with tolerable profit in the proper business of their own country but they do not demonstrate that that business has decreased as the capital of a private man though acquired by a particular trade may increase beyond what he can employ in it and yet that trade continue to increase too so may likewise the capital of a great nation  in our north american and west indian colonies not only the wages of labor but the interest of money and consequently the profits of stock are higher than in england in the different colonies both the legal and the market rate of interest run from six to eight per cent high wages of labor and high profits of stock however are things perhaps which scarce ever go together except in the peculiar circumstances of new colonies a new colony must always for some time be more understocked in proportion to the extent of its territory and more underpeopled in proportion to the extent of its stock than the greater part of other countries they have more land than they have stock to cultivate what they have therefore is applied to the cultivation only of what is most fertile and most favorably situated the lands near the sea shore and along the banks of navigable rivers such land too is frequently purchased at a price below the value even of its natural produce stock employed in the purchase and improvement of such lands must yield a very large profit and consequently afford to pay a very large interest its rapid accumulation in so profitable an employment enables the planter to increase the number of his hands faster than he can find them in a new settlement those whom he can find therefore are very liberally rewarded as the colony increases the profits of stock gradually diminish when the most fertile and best situated lands have been all occupied less profit can be made by the cultivation of what is inferior both in soil and situation and less interest can be afforded for the stock which is so employed in the greater part of our colonies accordingly both the legal and the market rate of interest have been considerably reduced during the course of the present century as riches improvement and population have increased interest has declined the wages of labor do not sink with the profits of stock the demand for labor increases with the increase of stock whatever be its profits and after these are diminished stock may not only continue to increase but to increase much faster than before it is with industrious nations who are advancing in the acquisition of riches as with industrious individuals a great stock though with small profits generally increases faster than a small stock with great profits money says the proverb makes money when you have got a little it is often easy to get more the great difficulty is to get that little the connection between the increase of stock and that of industry or of the demand for useful labor has partly been explained already but will be explained more fully hereafter in treating of the accumulation of stock  the acquisition of new territory or of new branches of trade may sometimes raise the profits of stock and with them the interest of money even in a country which is fast advancing in the acquisition of riches the stock of the country not being sufficient for the whole accession of business which such acquisitions present to the different people among whom it is divided is applied to those particular branches only which afford the greatest profit part of what had before been employed in other trades is necessarily withdrawn from them and turned into some of the new and more profitable ones in all those old trades therefore the competition comes to be less than before the market comes to be less fully supplied with many different sorts of goods their price necessarily rises more or less and yields a greater profit to those who deal in them who can therefore afford to borrow at a higher interest for some time after the conclusion of the late war not only private people of the best credit but some of the greatest companies in london commonly borrowed at five per cent who before that had not been used to pay more than four and four and a half per cent the great accession both of territory and trade by our acquisitions in north america and the west indies will sufficiently account for this without supposing any diminution in the capital stock of the society so great an accession of new business to be carried on by the old stock must necessarily have diminished the quantity employed in a great number of particular branches in which the competition being less the profits must have been greater i shall hereafter have occasion to mention the reasons which dispose me to believe that the capital stock of great britain was not diminished even by the enormous expense of the late war  the diminution of the capital stock of the society or of the funds destined for the maintenance of industry however as it lowers the wages of labor so it raises the profits of stock and consequently the interest of money by the wages of labor being lowered the owners of what stock remains in the society can bring their goods cheaper to market than before and less stock being employed in supplying the market than before they can sell them dearer their goods cost them less and they get more for them their profits therefore being augmented at both ends can well afford a large interest the great fortunes so suddenly and so easily acquired in bengal and the other british settlements in the east indies may satisfy us that as the wages of labor are very low so the profits of stock are very high in those ruined countries the interest of money is proportionably so in bengal money is frequently lent to the farmers at forty fifty and sixty per cent and the succeeding crop is mortgaged for the payment as the profits which can afford such an interest must eat up almost the whole rent of the landlord so such enormous usury must in its turn eat up the greater part of those profits before the fall of the roman republic a usury of the same kind seems to have been common in the provinces under the ruinous administration of their proconsuls the virtuous brutus lent money in cyprus at five and forty per cent as we learn from the letters of cicero  in a country which had acquired that full complement of riches which the nature of its soil and climate and its situation with respect to other countries allowed it to acquire which could therefore advance no further and which was not going backwards both the wages of labor and the profits of stock would probably be very low in a country fully peopled in proportion to what either its territory could maintain or its stock employ the competition for employment would necessarily be so great as to reduce the wages of labor to what was barely sufficient to keep up the number of laborers and the country being already fully peopled that number could never be augmented in a country fully stocked in proportion to all the business it had to transact as great a quantity of stock would be employed in every particular branch as the nature and extent of the trade would admit the competition therefore would everywhere be as great and consequently the ordinary profit as low as possible  but perhaps no country has ever yet arrived at this degree of opulence china seems to have been long stationary and had probably long ago acquired that full complement of riches which is consistent with the nature of its laws and institutions but this complement may be much inferior to what with other laws and institutions the nature of its soil climate and situation might admit of a country which neglects or despises foreign commerce and which admits the vessels of foreign nations into one or two of its ports only cannot transact the same quantity of business which it might do with different laws and institutions in a country too where though the rich or the owners of large capitals enjoy a good deal of security the poor or the owners of small capitals enjoy scarce any but are liable under the pretense of justice to be pillaged and plundered at any time by the inferior mandarines the quantity of stock employed in all the different branches of business transacted within it can never be equal to what the nature and extent of that business might admit in every different branch the oppression of the poor must establish the monopoly of the rich who by engrossing the whole trade to themselves will be able to make very large profits twelve per cent accordingly is said to be the common interest of money in china and the ordinary profits of stock must be sufficient to afford this large interest  a defect in the law may sometimes raise the rate of interest considerably above what the condition of the country as to wealth or poverty would require when the law does not enforce the performance of contracts it puts all borrowers nearly upon the same footing with bankrupts or people of doubtful credit in better regulated countries the uncertainty of recovering his money makes the lender exact the same usurious interest which is usually required from bankrupts among the barbarous nations who overrun the western provinces of the roman empire the performance of contracts was left for many ages to the faith of the contracting parties the courts of justice of their kings seldom intermeddled in it the high rate of interest which took place in those ancient times may perhaps be partly accounted for from this cause  when the law prohibits interest altogether it does not prevent it many people must borrow and nobody will lend without such a consideration for the use of their money as is suitable not only to what can be made by the use of it but to the difficulty and danger of evading the law the high rate of interest among all mohammedan nations is accounted for by mr montesquieu not from their poverty but partly from this and partly from the difficulty of recovering the money  the lowest ordinary rate of profit must always be something more than what is sufficient to compensate the occasional losses to which every employment of stock is exposed it is this surplus only which is neat or clear profit what is called gross profit comprehends frequently not only this surplus but what is retained for compensating such extraordinary losses the interest which the borrower can afford to pay is in proportion to the clear profit only  the lowest ordinary rate of interest must in the same manner be something more than sufficient to compensate the occasional losses to which lending even with tolerable prudence is exposed were it not more charity or friendship could be the only motives for lending  in a country which had acquired its full complement of riches where in every particular branch of business there was the greatest quantity of stock that could be employed in it as the ordinary rate of clear profit would be very small so the usual market rate of interest which could be afforded out of it would be so low as to render it impossible for any but the very wealthiest people to live upon the interest of their money all people of small or middling fortunes would be obliged to superintend themselves the employment of their own stocks it would be necessary that almost every man should be a man of business or engage in some sort of trade the province of holland seems to be approaching near to this state it is there unfashionable not to be a man of business necessity makes it usual for almost every man to be so and custom every where regulates fashion as it is ridiculous not to dress so is it in some measure not to be employed like other people as a man of a civil profession seems awkward in a camp or a garrison and is even in some danger of being despised there so does an idle man among men of business  the highest ordinary rate of profit may be such as in the price of the greater part of commodities eats up the whole of what should go to the rent of the land and leaves only what is sufficient to pay the labor of preparing and bringing them to market according to the lowest rate at which labor can any where be paid the bare subsistence of the labourer the workman must always have been fed in some way or other while he was about the work but the landlord may not always have been paid the profits of the trade which the servants of the east india company carry on in bengal may not perhaps be very far from this rate  the proportion which the usual market rate of interest ought to bear to the ordinary rate of clear profit necessarily varies as profit rises or falls double interest is in great britain reckoned what the merchants call a good moderate reasonable profit terms which i apprehend mean no more than a common and usual profit in a country where the ordinary rate of clear profit is eight or ten per cent it may be reasonable that one half of it should go to interest wherever business is carried on with borrowed money the stock is at the risk of the borrower who as it were insures it to the lender and four or five per cent may in the greater part of trades be both a sufficient profit upon the risk of this insurance and a sufficient recompense for the trouble of employing the stock but the proportion between interest and clear profit might not be the same in countries where the ordinary rate of profit was either a good deal lower or a good deal higher if it were a good deal lower one half of it perhaps could not be afforded for interest and more might be afforded if it were a good deal higher  in countries which are fast advancing to riches the low rate of profit may in the price of many commodities compensate the high wages of labor and enable those countries to sell as cheap as their less thriving neighbors among whom the wages of labor may be lower  chap x of wages and profit in the different employments of labor and stock the whole of the advantages and disadvantages of the different employments of labor and stock must in the same neighborhood be either perfectly equal or continually tending to equality if in the same neighborhood there was any employment either evidently more or less advantageous than the rest so many people would crowd into it in the one case and so many would desert it in the other that its advantages would soon return to the level of other employments this at least would be the case in a society where things were left to follow their natural course where there was perfect liberty and where every man was perfectly free both to choose what occupation he thought proper and to change it as often as he thought proper every mans interest would prompt him to seek the advantageous and to shun the disadvantageous employment  pecuniary wages and profit indeed are every where in europe extremely different according to the different employments of labor and stock but this difference arises partly from certain circumstances in the employments themselves which either really or at least in the imaginations of men make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others and partly from the policy of europe which nowhere leaves things at perfect liberty  the particular consideration of those circumstances and of that policy will divide this chapter into two parts  part i inequalities arising from the nature of the employments themselves the five following are the principal circumstances which sofar as i have been able to observe make up for a small pecuniary gain in some employments and counterbalance a great one in others first the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves secondly the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning them thirdly the constancy or inconstancy of employment in them fourthly the small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise them and fifthly the probability or improbability of success in them  first the wages of labor vary with the ease or hardship the cleanliness or dirtiness the honourableness or dishonourableness of the employment thus in most places take the year round a journeyman tailor earns less than a journeyman weaver his work is much easier a journeyman weaver earns less than a journeyman smith his work is not always easier but it is much cleanlier a journeyman blacksmith though an artificer seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier who is only a labourer does in eight his work is not quite so dirty is less dangerous and is carried on in daylight and above ground honor makes a great part of the reward of all honorable professions in point of pecuniary gain all things considered they are generally underrecompensed as i shall endeavor to show by and by disgrace has the contrary effect the trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades the most detestable of all employments that of public executioner is in proportion to the quantity of work done better paid than any common trade whatever  hunting and fishing the most important employments of mankind in the rude state of society become in its advanced state their most agreeable amusements and they pursue for pleasure what they once followed from necessity in the advanced state of society therefore they are all very poor people who follow as a trade what other people pursue as a pastime fishermen have been so since the time of theocritus a poacher is every where a very poor man in great britain in countries where the rigor of the law suffers no poachers the licensed hunter is not in a much better condition the natural taste for those employments makes more people follow them than can live comfortably by them and the produce of their labor in proportion to its quantity comes always too cheap to market to afford any thing but the most scanty subsistence to the laborers  disagreeableness and disgrace affect the profits of stock in the same manner as the wages of labor the keeper of an inn or tavern who is never master of his own house and who is exposed to the brutality of every drunkard exercises neither a very agreeable nor a very creditable business but there is scarce any common trade in which a small stock yields so great a profit  secondly the wages of labor vary with the easiness and cheapness or the difficulty and expense of learning the business  when any expensive machine is erected the extraordinary work to be performed by it before it is worn out it must be expected will replace the capital laid out upon it with at least its ordinary profits a man educated at the expense of much labor and time to any of those employments which require extraordinary dexterity and skill may be compared to one of those expensive machines the work which he learns to perform it must be expected over and above the usual wages of common labor will replace to him the whole expense of his education with at least the ordinary profits of an equally valuable capital it must do this too in a reasonable time regard being had to the very uncertain duration of human life in the same manner as to the more certain duration of the machine  the difference between the wages of skilled labor and those of common labor is founded upon this principle  the policy of europe considers the labor of all mechanics artificers and manufacturers as skilled labor and that of all country laborers as common labor it seems to suppose that of the former to be of a more nice and delicate nature than that of the latter it is so perhaps in some cases but in the greater part it is quite otherwise as i shall endeavor to show by and by the laws and customs of europe therefore in order to qualify any person for exercising the one species of labor impose the necessity of an apprenticeship though with different degrees of rigor in different places they leave the other free and open to every body during the continuance of the apprenticeship the whole labor of the apprentice belongs to his master in the mean time he must in many cases be maintained by his parents or relations and in almost all cases must be clothed by them some money too is commonly given to the master for teaching him his trade they who cannot give money give time or become bound for more than the usual number of years a consideration which though it is not always advantageous to the master on account of the usual idleness of apprentices is always disadvantageous to the apprentice in country labor on the contrary the labourer while he is employed about the easier learns the more difficult parts of his business and his own labor maintains him through all the different stages of his employment it is reasonable therefore that in europe the wages of mechanics artificers and manufacturers should be somewhat higher than those of common laborers they are so accordingly and their superior gains make them in most places be considered as a superior rank of people this superiority however is generally very small the daily or weekly earnings of journeymen in the more common sorts of manufactures such as those of plain linen and woollen cloth computed at an average are in most places very little more than the day wages of common laborers their employment indeed is more steady and uniform and the superiority of their earnings taking the whole year together may be somewhat greater it seems evidently however to be no greater than what is sufficient to compensate the superior expense of their education  education in the ingenious arts and in the liberal professions is still more tedious and expensive the pecuniary recompense therefore of painters and sculptors of lawyers and physicians ought to be much more liberal and it is so accordingly  the profits of stock seem to be very little affected by the easiness or difficulty of learning the trade in which it is employed all the different ways in which stock is commonly employed in great towns seem in reality to be almost equally easy and equally difficult to learn one branch either of foreign or domestic trade cannot well be a much more intricate business than another  thirdly the wages of labor in different occupations vary with the constancy or inconstancy of employment  employment is much more constant in some trades than in others in the greater part of manufactures a journeyman may be pretty sure of employment almost every day in the year that he is able to work a mason or bricklayer on the contrary can work neither in hard frost nor in foul weather and his employment at all other times depends upon the occasional calls of his customers he is liable in consequence to be frequently without any what he earns therefore while he is employed must not only maintain him while he is idle but make him some compensation for those anxious and desponding moments which the thought of so precarious a situation must sometimes occasion where the computed earnings of the greater part of manufacturers accordingly are nearly upon a level with the day wages of common laborers those of masons and bricklayers are generally from onehalf more to double those wages where common laborers earn four and five shillings a week masons and bricklayers frequently earn seven and eight where the former earn six the latter often earn nine and ten and where the former earn nine and ten as in london the latter commonly earn fifteen and eighteen no species of skilled labor however seems more easy to learn than that of masons and bricklayers chairmen in london during the summer season are said sometimes to be employed as bricklayers the high wages of those workmen therefore are not so much the recompense of their skill as the compensation for the inconstancy of their employment  a house carpenter seems to exercise rather a nicer and more ingenious trade than a mason in most places however for it is not universally so his daywages are somewhat lower his employment though it depends much does not depend so entirely upon the occasional calls of his customers and it is not liable to be interrupted by the weather  when the trades which generally afford constant employment happen in a particular place not to do so the wages of the workmen always rise a good deal above their ordinary proportion to those of common labor in london almost all journeymen artificers are liable to be called upon and dismissed by their masters from day to day and from week to week in the same manner as daylabourers in other places the lowest order of artificers journeymen tailors accordingly earn there half a crown a day though eighteenpence may be reckoned the wages of common labor in small towns and country villages the wages of journeymen tailors frequently scarce equal those of common labor but in london they are often many weeks without employment particularly during the summer  when the inconstancy of employment is combined with the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of the work it sometimes raises the wages of the most common labor above those of the most skilful artificers a collier working by the piece is supposed at newcastle to earn commonly about double and in many parts of scotland about three times the wages of common labor his high wages arise altogether from the hardship disagreeableness and dirtiness of his work his employment may upon most occasions be as constant as he pleases the coalheavers in london exercise a trade which in hardship dirtiness and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal ships the employment of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant if colliers therefore commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor it ought not to seem unreasonable that coalheavers should sometimes earn four and five times those wages in the enquiry made into their condition a few years ago it was found that at the rate at which they were then paid they could earn from six to ten shillings a day six shillings are about four times the wages of common labor in london and in every particular trade the lowest common earnings may always be considered as those of the far greater number how extravagant soever those earnings may appear if they were more than sufficient to compensate all the disagreeable circumstances of the business there would soon be so great a number of competitors as in a trade which has no exclusive privilege would quickly reduce them to a lower rate  the constancy or inconstancy of employment cannot affect the ordinary profits of stock in any particular trade whether the stock is or is not constantly employed depends not upon the trade but the trader  fourthly the wages of labor vary according to the small or great trust which must be reposed in the workmen  the wages of goldsmiths and jewellers are every where superior to those of many other workmen not only of equal but of much superior ingenuity on account of the precious materials with which they are entrusted  we trust our health to the physician our fortune and sometimes our life and reputation to the lawyer and attorney such confidence could not safely be reposed in people of a very mean or low condition their reward must be such therefore as may give them that rank in the society which so important a trust requires the long time and the great expense which must be laid out in their education when combined with this circumstance necessarily enhance still further the price of their labor  when a person employs only his own stock in trade there is no trust and the credit which he may get from other people depends not upon the nature of his trade but upon their opinion of his fortune probity and prudence the different rates of profit therefore in the different branches of trade cannot arise from the different degrees of trust reposed in the traders  fifthly the wages of labor in different employments vary according to the probability or improbability of success in them  the probability that any particular person shall ever be qualified for the employment to which he is educated is very different in different occupations in the greater part of mechanic trades success is almost certain but very uncertain in the liberal professions put your son apprentice to a shoemaker there is little doubt of his learning to make a pair of shoes but send him to study the law it is at least twenty to one if ever he makes such proficiency as will enable him to live by the business in a perfectly fair lottery those who draw the prizes ought to gain all that is lost by those who draw the blanks in a profession where twenty fail for one that succeeds that one ought to gain all that should have been gained by the unsuccessful twenty the counselor at law who perhaps at near forty years of age begins to make something by his profession ought to receive the retribution not only of his own so tedious and expensive education but of that of more than twenty others who are never likely to make any thing by it how extravagant soever the fees of counselors at law may sometimes appear their real retribution is never equal to this compute in any particular place what is likely to be annually gained and what is likely to be annually spent by all the different workmen in any common trade such as that of shoemakers or weavers and you will find that the former sum will generally exceed the latter but make the same computation with regard to all the counselors and students of law in all the different inns of court and you will find that their annual gains bear but a very small proportion to their annual expense even though you rate the former as high and the latter as low as can well be done the lottery of the law therefore is very far from being a perfectly fair lottery and that as well as many other liberal and honorable professions are in point of pecuniary gain evidently underrecompenced  those professions keep their level however with other occupations and notwithstanding these discouragements all the most generous and liberal spirits are eager to crowd into them two different causes contribute to recommend them first the desire of the reputation which attends upon superior excellence in any of them and secondly the natural confidence which every man has more or less not only in his own abilities but in his own good fortune  to excel in any profession in which but few arrive at mediocrity is the most decisive mark of what is called genius or superior talents the public admiration which attends upon such distinguished abilities makes always a part of their reward a greater or smaller in proportion as it is higher or lower in degree it makes a considerable part of it in the profession of physic a still greater perhaps in that of law in poetry and philosophy it makes almost the whole  there are some very agreeable and beautiful talents of which the possession commands a certain sort of admiration but of which the exercise for the sake of gain is considered whether from reason or prejudice as a sort of public prostitution the pecuniary recompense therefore of those who exercise them in this manner must be sufficient not only to pay for the time labor and expense of acquiring the talents but for the discredit which attends the employment of them as the means of subsistence the exorbitant rewards of players operasingers operadancers etc are founded upon those two principles the rarity and beauty of the talents and the discredit of employing them in this manner it seems absurd at first sight that we should despise their persons and yet reward their talents with the most profuse liberality while we do the one however we must of necessity do the other should the public opinion or prejudice ever alter with regard to such occupations their pecuniary recompense would quickly diminish more people would apply to them and the competition would quickly reduce the price of their labor such talents though far from being common are by no means so rare as is imagined many people possess them in great perfection who disdain to make this use of them and many more are capable of acquiring them if any thing could be made honorably by them  the overweening conceit which the greater part of men have of their own abilities is an ancient evil remarked by the philosophers and moralists of all ages their absurd presumption in their own good fortune has been less taken notice of it is however if possible still more universal there is no man living who when in tolerable health and spirits has not some share of it the chance of gain is by every man more or less overvalued and the chance of loss is by most men undervalued and by scarce any man who is in tolerable health and spirits valued more than it is worth  that the chance of gain is naturally overvalued we may learn from the universal success of lotteries the world neither ever saw nor ever will see a perfectly fair lottery or one in which the whole gain compensated the whole loss because the undertaker could make nothing by it in the state lotteries the tickets are really not worth the price which is paid by the original subscribers and yet commonly sell in the market for twenty thirty and sometimes forty per cent advance the vain hope of gaining some of the great prizes is the sole cause of this demand the soberest people scarce look upon it as a folly to pay a small sum for the chance of gaining ten or twenty thousand pounds though they know that even that small sum is perhaps twenty or thirty per cent more than the chance is worth in a lottery in which no prize exceeded twenty pounds though in other respects it approached much nearer to a perfectly fair one than the common state lotteries there would not be the same demand for tickets in order to have a better chance for some of the great prizes some people purchase several tickets and others small shares in a still greater number there is not however a more certain proposition in mathematics than that the more tickets you adventure upon the more likely you are to be a loser adventure upon all the tickets in the lottery and you lose for certain and the greater the number of your tickets the nearer you approach to this certainty  that the chance of loss is frequently undervalued and scarce ever valued more than it is worth we may learn from the very moderate profit of insurers in order to make insurance either from fire or sea risk a trade at all the common premium must be sufficient to compensate the common losses to pay the expense of management and to afford such a profit as might have been drawn from an equal capital employed in any common trade the person who pays no more than this evidently pays no more than the real value of the risk or the lowest price at which he can reasonably expect to insure it but though many people have made a little money by insurance very few have made a great fortune and from this consideration alone it seems evident enough that the ordinary balance of profit and loss is not more advantageous in this than in other common trades by which so many people make fortunes moderate however as the premium of insurance commonly is many people despise the risk too much to care to pay it taking the whole kingdom at an average nineteen houses in twenty or rather perhaps ninetynine in a hundred are not insured from fire sea risk is more alarming to the greater part of people and the proportion of ships insured to those not insured is much greater many sail however at all seasons and even in time of war without any insurance this may sometimes perhaps be done without any imprudence when a great company or even a great merchant has twenty or thirty ships at sea they may as it were insure one another the premium saved upon them all may more than compensate such losses as they are likely to meet with in the common course of chances the neglect of insurance upon shipping however in the same manner as upon houses is in most cases the effect of no such nice calculation but of mere thoughtless rashness and presumptuous contempt of the risk  the contempt of risk and the presumptuous hope of success are in no period of life more active than at the age at which young people choose their professions how little the fear of misfortune is then capable of balancing the hope of good luck appears still more evidently in the readiness of the common people to enlist as soldiers or to go to sea than in the eagerness of those of better fashion to enter into what are called the liberal professions  what a common soldier may lose is obvious enough without regarding the danger however young volunteers never enlist so readily as at the beginning of a new war and though they have scarce any chance of preferment they figure to themselves in their youthful fancies a thousand occasions of acquiring honor and distinction which never occur these romantic hopes make the whole price of their blood their pay is less than that of common laborers and in actual service their fatigues are much greater  the lottery of the sea is not altogether so disadvantageous as that of the army the son of a creditable labourer or artificer may frequently go to sea with his fathers consent but if he enlists as a soldier it is always without it other people see some chance of his making something by the one trade nobody but himself sees any of his making any thing by the other the great admiral is less the object of public admiration than the great general and the highest success in the sea service promises a less brilliant fortune and reputation than equal success in the land the same difference runs through all the inferior degrees of preferment in both by the rules of precedence a captain in the navy ranks with a colonel in the army but he does not rank with him in the common estimation as the great prizes in the lottery are less the smaller ones must be more numerous common sailors therefore more frequently get some fortune and preferment than common soldiers and the hope of those prizes is what principally recommends the trade though their skill and dexterity are much superior to that of almost any artificers and though their whole life is one continual scene of hardship and danger yet for all this dexterity and skill for all those hardships and dangers while they remain in the condition of common sailors they receive scarce any other recompense but the pleasure of exercising the one and of surmounting the other their wages are not greater than those of common laborers at the port which regulates the rate of seamens wages as they are continually going from port to port the monthly pay of those who sail from all the different ports of great britain is more nearly upon a level than that of any other workmen in those different places and the rate of the port to and from which the greatest number sail that is the port of london regulates that of all the rest at london the wages of the greater part of the different classes of workmen are about double those of the same classes at edinburgh but the sailors who sail from the port of london seldom earn above three or four shillings a month more than those who sail from the port of leith and the difference is frequently not so great in time of peace and in the merchant service the london price is from a guinea to about seven and twenty shillings the calendar month a common labourer in london at the rate of nine or ten shillings a week may earn in the calendar month from forty to five and forty shillings the sailor indeed over and above his pay is supplied with provisions their value however may not perhaps always exceed the difference between his pay and that of the common labourer and though it sometimes should the excess will not be clear gain to the sailor because he cannot share it with his wife and family whom he must maintain out of his wages at home  the dangers and hairbreadth escapes of a life of adventures instead of disheartening young people seem frequently to recommend a trade to them a tender mother among the inferior ranks of people is often afraid to send her son to school at a seaport town lest the sight of the ships and the conversation and adventures of the sailors should entice him to go to sea the distant prospect of hazards from which we can hope to extricate ourselves by courage and address is not disagreeable to us and does not raise the wages of labor in any employment it is otherwise with those in which courage and address can be of no avail in trades which are known to be very unwholesome the wages of labor are always remarkably high unwholesomeness is a species of disagreeableness and its effects upon the wages of labor are to be ranked under that general head  in all the different employments of stock the ordinary rate of profit varies more or less with the certainty or uncertainty of the returns these are in general less uncertain in the inland than in the foreign trade and in some branches of foreign trade than in others in the trade to north america for example than in that to jamaica the ordinary rate of profit always rises more or less with the risk it does not however seem to rise in proportion to it or so as to compensate it completely bankruptcies are most frequent in the most hazardous trades the most hazardous of all trades that of a smuggler though when the adventure succeeds it is likewise the most profitable is the infallible road to bankruptcy the presumptuous hope of success seems to act here as upon all other occasions and to entice so many adventurers into those hazardous trades that their competition reduces the profit below what is sufficient to compensate the risk to compensate it completely the common returns ought over and above the ordinary profits of stock not only to make up for all occasional losses but to afford a surplus profit to the adventurers of the same nature with the profit of insurers but if the common returns were sufficient for all this bankruptcies would not be more frequent in these than in other trades  of the five circumstances therefore which vary the wages of labor two only affect the profits of stock the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the business and the risk or security with which it is attended in point of agreeableness or disagreeableness there is little or no difference in the far greater part of the different employments of stock but a great deal in those of labor and the ordinary profit of stock though it rises with the risk does not always seem to rise in proportion to it it should follow from all this that in the same society or neighborhood the average and ordinary rates of profit in the different employments of stock should be more nearly upon a level than the pecuniary wages of the different sorts of labor they are so accordingly the difference between the earnings of a common labourer and those of a well employed lawyer or physician is evidently much greater than that between the ordinary profits in any two different branches of trade the apparent difference besides in the profits of different trades is generally a deception arising from our not always distinguishing what ought to be considered as wages from what ought to be considered as profit  apothecaries profit is become a byeword denoting something uncommonly extravagant this great apparent profit however is frequently no more than the reasonable wages of labor the skill of an apothecary is a much nicer and more delicate matter than that of any artificer whatever and the trust which is reposed in him is of much greater importance he is the physician of the poor in all cases and of the rich when the distress or danger is not very great his reward therefore ought to be suitable to his skill and his trust and it arises generally from the price at which he sells his drugs but the whole drugs which the best employed apothecary in a large market town will sell in a year may not perhaps cost him above thirty or forty pounds though he should sell them therefore for three or four hundred or at a thousand per cent profit this may frequently be no more than the reasonable wages of his labor charged in the only way in which he can charge them upon the price of his drugs the greater part of the apparent profit is real wages disguised in the garb of profit  in a small seaport town a little grocer will make forty or fifty per cent upon a stock of a single hundred pounds while a considerable wholesale merchant in the same place will scarce make eight or ten per cent upon a stock of ten thousand the trade of the grocer may be necessary for the convenience of the inhabitants and the narrowness of the market may not admit the employment of a larger capital in the business the man however must not only live by his trade but live by it suitably to the qualifications which it requires besides possessing a little capital he must be able to read write and account and must be a tolerable judge too of perhaps fifty or sixty different sorts of goods their prices qualities and the markets where they are to be had cheapest he must have all the knowledge in short that is necessary for a great merchant which nothing hinders him from becoming but the want of a sufficient capital thirty or forty pounds a year cannot be considered as too great a recompense for the labor of a person so accomplished deduct this from the seemingly great profits of his capital and little more will remain perhaps than the ordinary profits of stock the greater part of the apparent profit is in this case too real wages  the difference between the apparent profit of the retail and that of the wholesale trade is much less in the capital than in small towns and country villages where ten thousand pounds can be employed in the grocery trade the wages of the grocers labor make but a very trifling addition to the real profits of so great a stock the apparent profits of the wealthy retailer therefore are there more nearly upon a level with those of the wholesale merchant it is upon this account that goods sold by retail are generally as cheap and frequently much cheaper in the capital than in small towns and country villages grocery goods for example are generally much cheaper bread and butchersmeat frequently as cheap it costs no more to bring grocery goods to the great town than to the country village but it costs a great deal more to bring corn and cattle as the greater part of them must be brought from a much greater distance the prime cost of grocery goods therefore being the same in both places they are cheapest where the least profit is charged upon them the prime cost of bread and butchersmeat is greater in the great town than in the country village and though the profit is less therefore they are not always cheaper there but often equally cheap in such articles as bread and butchersmeat the same cause which diminishes apparent profit increases prime cost the extent of the market by giving employment to greater stocks diminishes apparent profit but by requiring supplies from a greater distance it increases prime cost this diminution of the one and increase of the other seem in most cases nearly to counterbalance one another which is probably the reason that though the prices of corn and cattle are commonly very different in different parts of the kingdom those of bread and butchersmeat are generally very nearly the same through the greater part of it  though the profits of stock both in the wholesale and retail trade are generally less in the capital than in small towns and country villages yet great fortunes are frequently acquired from small beginnings in the former and scarce ever in the latter in small towns and country villages on account of the narrowness of the market trade cannot always be extended as stock extends in such places therefore though the rate of a particular persons profits may be very high the sum or amount of them can never be very great nor consequently that of his annual accumulation in great towns on the contrary trade can be extended as stock increases and the credit of a frugal and thriving man increases much saster than his stock his trade is extended in proportion to the amount of both and the sum or amount of his profits is in proportion to the extent of his trade and his annual accumulation in proportion to the amount of his profits it seldom happens however that great fortunes are made even in great towns by any one regular established and well known branch of business but in consequence of a long life of industry frugality and attention sudden fortunes indeed are sometimes made in such places by what is called the trade of speculation the speculative merchant exercises no one regular established or well known branch of business he is a corn merchant this year and a wine merchant the next and a sugar tobacco or tea merchant the year after he enters into every trade when he foresees that it is likely to be more than commonly profitable and he quits it when he foresees that its profits are likely to return to the level of other trades his profits and losses therefore can bear no regular proportion to those of any one established and well known branch of business a bold adventurer may sometimes acquire a considerable fortune by two or three successful speculations but is just as likely to lose one by two or three unsuccessful ones this trade can be carried on no where but in great towns it is only in places of the most extensive commerce and correspondence that the intelligence requisite for it can be had  the five circumstances above mentioned though they occasion considerable inequalities in the wages of labor and profits of stock occasion none in the whole of the advantages and disadvantages real or imaginary of the different employments of either the nature of those circumstances is such that they make up for a small pecuniary gain in some and counterbalance a great one in others  in order however that this equality may take place in the whole of their advantages or disadvantages three things are requisite even where there is the most perfect freedom first the employments must be well known and long established in the neighborhood secondly they must be in their ordinary or what may be called their natural state and thirdly they must be the sole or principal employments of those who occupy them  first this equality can take place only in those employments which are well known and have been long established in the neighborhood  where all other circumstances are equal wages are generally higher in new than in old trades when a projector attempts to establish a new manufacture he must at first entice his workmen from other employments by higher wages than they can either earn in their own trades or than the nature of his work would otherwise require and a considerable time must pass away before he can venture to reduce them to the common level manufactures for which the demand arises altogether from fashion and fancy are continually changing and seldom last long enough to be considered as old established manufactures those on the contrary for which the demand arises chiefly from use or necessity are less liable to change and the same form or fabric may continue in demand for whole centuries together the wages of labor therefore are likely to be higher in manufactures of the former than in those of the latter kind birmingham deals chiefly in manufactures of the former kind sheffield in those of the latter and the wages of labor in those two different places are said to be suitable to this difference in the nature of their manufactures  the establishment of any new manufacture of any new branch of commerce or of any new practice in agriculture is always a speculation from which the projector promises himself extraordinary profits these profits sometimes are very great and sometimes more frequently perhaps they are quite otherwise but in general they bear no regular proportion to those of other old trades in the neighborhood if the project succeeds they are commonly at first very high when the trade or practice becomes thoroughly established and well known the competition reduces them to the level of other trades  secondly this equality in the whole of the advantages and disadvantages of the different employments of labor and stock can take place only in the ordinary or what may be called the natural state of those employments  the demand for almost every different species of labor is sometimes greater and sometimes less than usual in the one case the advantages of the employment rise above in the other they fall below the common level the demand for country labor is greater at haytime and harvest than during the greater part of the year and wages rise with the demand in time of war when forty or fifty thousand sailors are forced from the merchant service into that of the king the demand for sailors to merchant ships necessarily rises with their scarcity and their wages upon such occasions commonly rise from a guinea and seven and twenty shillings to forty shillings and three pounds a month in a decaying manufacture on the contrary many workmen rather than quit their old trade are contented with smaller wages than would otherwise be suitable to the nature of their employment  the profits of stock vary with the price of the commodities in which it is employed as the price of any commodity rises above the ordinary or average rate the profits of at least some part of the stock that is employed in bringing it to market rise above their proper level and as it falls they sink below it all commodities are more or less liable to variations of price but some are much more so than others in all commodities which are produced by human industry the quantity of industry annually employed is necessarily regulated by the annual demand in such a manner that the average annual produce may as nearly as possible be equal to the average annual consumption in some employments it has already been observed the same quantity of industry will always produce the same or very nearly the same quantity of commodities in the linen or woollen manufactures for example the same number of hands will annually work up very nearly the same quantity of linen and woollen cloth the variations in the market price of such commodities therefore can arise only from some accidental variation in the demand a public mourning raises the price of black cloth but as the demand for most sorts of plain linen and woollen cloth is pretty uniform so is likewise the price but there are other employments in which the same quantity of industry will not always produce the same quantity of commodities the same quantity of industry for example will in different years produce very different quantities of corn wine hops sugar tobacco etc the price of such commodities therefore varies not only with the variations of demand but with the much greater and more frequent variations of quantity and is consequently extremely fluctuating but the profit of some of the dealers must necessarily fluctuate with the price of the commodities the operations of the speculative merchant are principally employed about such commodities he endeavors to buy them up when he foresees that their price is likely to rise and to sell them when it is likely to fall  thirdly this equality in the whole of the advantages and disadvantages of the different employments of labor and stock can take place only in such as are the sole or principal employments of those who occupy them  when a person derives his subsistence from one employment which does not occupy the greater part of his time in the intervals of his leisure he is often willing to work at another for less wages than would otherwise suit the nature of the employment  there still subsists in many parts of scotland a set of people called cotters or cottagers though they were more frequent some years ago than they are now they are a sort of outservants of the landlords and farmers the usual reward which they receive from their masters is a house a small garden for pot herbs as much grass as will feed a cow and perhaps an acre or two of bad arable land when their master has occasion for their labor he gives them besides two pecks of oatmeal a week worth about sixteenpence sterling during a great part of the year he has little or no occasion for their labor and the cultivation of their own little possession is not sufficient to occupy the time which is left at their own disposal when such occupiers were more numerous than they are at present they are said to have been willing to give their spare time for a very small recompense to any body and to have wrought for less wages than other laborers in ancient times they seem to have been common all over europe in countries ill cultivated and worse inhabited the greater part of landlords and farmers could not otherwise provide themselves with the extraordinary number of hands which country labor requires at certain seasons the daily or weekly recompense which such laborers occasionally received from their masters was evidently not the whole price of their labor their small tenement made a considerable part of it this daily or weekly recompense however seems to have been considered as the whole of it by many writers who have collected the prices of labor and provisions in ancient times and who have taken pleasure in representing both as wonderfully low  the produce of such labor comes frequently cheaper to market than would otherwise be suitable to its nature stockings in many parts of scotland are knit much cheaper than they can any where be wrought upon the loom they are the work of servants and laborers who derive the principal part of their subsistence from some other employment more than a thousand pair of shetland stockings are annually imported into leith of which the price is from fivepence to sevenpence a pair at learwick the small capital of the shetland islands tenpence a day i have been assured is a common price of common labor in the same islands they knit worsted stockings to the value of a guinea a pair and upwards  the spinning of linen yarn is carried on in scotland nearly in the same way as the knitting of stockings by servants who are chiefly hired for other purposes they earn but a very scanty subsistence who endeavor to get their whole livelihood by either of those trades in most parts of scotland she is a good spinner who can earn twentypence a week  in opulent countries the market is generally so extensive that any one trade is sufficient to employ the whole labor and stock of those who occupy it instances of peoples living by one employment and at the same time deriving some little advantage from another occur chiefly in poor countries the following instance however of something of the same kind is to be found in the capital of a very rich one there is no city in europe i believe in which houserent is dearer than in london and yet i know no capital in which a furnished apartment can be hired so cheap lodging is not only much cheaper in london than in paris it is much cheaper than in edinburgh of the same degree of goodness and what may seem extraordinary the dearness of houserent is the cause of the cheapness of lodging the dearness of houserent in london arises not only from those causes which render it dear in all great capitals the dearness of labor the dearness of all the materials of building which must generally be brought from a great distance and above all the dearness of groundrent every landlord acting the part of a monopolist and frequently exacting a higher rent for a single acre of bad land in a town than can be had for a hundred of the best in the country but it arises in part from the peculiar manners and customs of the people which oblige every master of a family to hire a whole house from top to bottom a dwelling house in england means every thing that is contained under the same roof in france scotland and many other parts of europe it frequently means no more than a single story a tradesman in london is obliged to hire a whole house in that part of the town where his customers live his shop is upon the groundfloor and he and his family sleep in the garret and he endeavors to pay a part of his houserent by letting the two middle stories to lodgers he expects to maintain his family by his trade and not by his lodgers whereas at paris and edinburgh the people who let lodgings have commonly no other means of subsistence and the price of the lodging must pay not only the rent of the house but the whole expense of the family  part ii inequalities occasioned by the policy of europe such are the inequalities in the whole of the advantages and disadvantages of the different employments of labor and stock which the defect of any of the three requisites above mentioned must occasion even where there is the most perfect liberty but the policy of europe by not leaving things at perfect liberty occasions other inequalities of much greater importance  it does this chiefly in the three following ways first by restraining the competition in some employments to a smaller number than would otherwise be disposed to enter into them secondly by increasing it in others beyond what it naturally would be and thirdly by obstructing the free circulation of labor and stock both from employment to employment and from place to place  first the policy of europe occasions a very important inequality in the whole of the advantages and disadvantages of the different employments of labor and stock by restraining the competition in some employments to a smaller number than might otherwise be disposed to enter into them  the exclusive privileges of corporations are the principal means it makes use of for this purpose  the exclusive privilege of an incorporated trade necessarily restrains the competition in the town where it is established to those who are free of the trade to have served an apprenticeship in the town under a master properly qualified is commonly the necessary requisite for obtaining this freedom the byelaws of the corporation regulate sometimes the number of apprentices which any master is allowed to have and almost always the number of years which each apprentice is obliged to serve the intention of both regulations is to restrain the competition to a much smaller number than might otherwise be disposed to enter into the trade the limitation of the number of apprentices restrains it directly a long term of apprenticeship restrains it more indirectly but as effectually by increasing the expense of education  in sheffield no master cutler can have more than one apprentice at a time by a byelaw of the corporation in norfolk and norwich no master weaver can have more than two apprentices under pain of forfeiting five pounds a month to the king no master hatter can have more than two apprentices any where in england or in the english plantations under pain of forfeiting five pounds a month half to the king and half to him who shall sue in any court of record both these regulations though they have been confirmed by a public law of the kingdom are evidently dictated by the same corporation spirit which enacted the byelaw of sheffield the silk weavers in london had scarce been incorporated a year when they enacted a byelaw restraining any master from having more than two apprentices at a time it required a particular act of parliament to rescind this byelaw  seven years seem anciently to have been all over europe the usual term established for the duration of apprenticeships in the greater part of incorporated trades all such incorporations were anciently called universities which indeed is the proper latin name for any incorporation whatever the university of smiths the university of tailors etc are expressions which we commonly meet with in the old charters of ancient towns when those particular incorporations which are now peculiarly called universities were first established the term of years which it was necessary to study in order to obtain the degree of master of arts appears evidently to have been copied from the term of apprenticeship in common trades of which the incorporations were much more ancient as to have wrought seven years under a master properly qualified was necessary in order to entitle any person to become a master and to have himself apprentices in a common trade so to have studied seven years under a master properly qualified was necessary to entitle him to become a master teacher or doctor words anciently synonimous in the liberal arts and to have scholars or apprentices words likewise originally synonimous to study under him  by the  th of elizabeth commonly called the statute of apprenticeship it was enacted that no person should for the future exercise any trade craft or mystery at that time exercised in england unless he had previously served to it an apprenticeship of seven years at least and what before had been the byelaw of many particular corporations became in england the general and public law of all trades carried on in market towns for though the words of the statute are very general and seem plainly to include the whole kingdom by interpretation its operation has been limited to market towns it having been held that in country villages a person may exercise several different trades though he has not served a seven years apprenticeship to each they being necessary for the convenience of the inhabitants and the number of people frequently not being sufficient to supply each with a particular set of hands  by a strict interpretation of the words too the operation of this statute has been limited to those trades which were established in england before the  th of elizabeth and has never been extended to such as have been introduced since that time this limitation has given occasion to several distinctions which considered as rules of police appear as foolish as can well be imagined it has been adjudged for example that a coachmaker can neither himself make nor employ journeymen to make his coachwheels but must buy them of a master wheelwright this latter trade having been exercised in england before the  th of elizabeth but a wheelwright though he has never served an apprenticeship to a coachmaker may either himself make or employ journeymen to make coaches the trade of a coachmaker not being within the statute because not exercised in england at the time when it was made the manufactures of manchester birmingham and wolverhampton are many of them upon this account not within the statute not having been exercised in england before the  th of elizabeth  in france the duration of apprenticeships is different in different towns and in different trades in paris five years is the term required in a great number but before any person can be qualified to exercise the trade as a master he must in many of them serve five years more as a journeyman during this latter term he is called the companion of his master and the term itself is called his companionship  in scotland there is no general law which regulates universally the duration of apprenticeships the term is different in different corporations where it is long a part of it may generally be redeemed by paying a small fine in most towns too a very small fine is sufficient to purchase the freedom of any corporation the weavers of linen and hempen cloth the principal manufactures of the country as well as all other artificers subservient to them wheelmakers reelmakers etc may exercise their trades in any town corporate without paying any fine in all towns corporate all persons are free to sell butchersmeat upon any lawful day of the week three years is in scotland a common term of apprenticeship even in some very nice trades and in general i know of no country in europe in which corporation laws are so little oppressive  the property which every man has in his own labor as it is the original foundation of all other property so it is the most sacred and inviolable the patrimony of a poor man lies in the strength and dexterity of his hands and to hinder him from employing this strength and dexterity in what manner he thinks proper without injury to his neighbor is a plain violation of this most sacred property it is a manifest encroachment upon the just liberty both of the workman and of those who might be disposed to employ him as it hinders the one from working at what he thinks proper so it hinders the other from employing whom they think proper to judge whether he is fit to be employed may surely be trusted to the discretion of the employers whose interest it so much concerns the affected anxiety of the lawgiver lest they should employ an improper person is evidently as impertinent as it is oppressive  the institution of long apprenticeships can give no security that insufficient workmanship shall not frequently be exposed to public sale when this is done it is generally the effect of fraud and not of inability and the longest apprenticeship can give no security against fraud quite different regulations are necessary to prevent this abuse the sterling mark upon plate and the stamps upon linen and woollen cloth give the purchaser much greater security than any statute of apprenticeship he generally looks at these but never thinks it worth while to enquire whether the workman had served a seven years apprenticeship  the institution of long apprenticeships has no tendency to form young people to industry a journeyman who works by the piece is likely to be industrious because he derives a benefit from every exertion of his industry an apprentice is likely to be idle and almost always is so because he has no immediate interest to be otherwise in the inferior employments the sweets of labor consist altogether in the recompense of labor they who are soonest in a condition to enjoy the sweets of it are likely soonest to conceive a relish for it and to acquire the early habit of industry a young man naturally conceives an aversion to labor when for a long time he receives no benefit from it the boys who are put out apprentices from public charities are generally bound for more than the usual number of years and they generally turn out very idle and worthless  apprenticeships were altogether unknown to the ancients the reciprocal duties of master and apprentice make a considerable article in every modern code the roman law is perfectly silent with regard to them i know no greek or latin word i might venture i believe to assert that there is none which expresses the idea we now annex to the word apprentice a servant bound to work at a particular trade for the benefit of a master during a term of years upon condition that the master shall teach him that trade  long apprenticeships are altogether unnecessary the arts which are much superior to common trades such as those of making clocks and watches contain no such mystery as to require a long course of instruction the first invention of such beautiful machines indeed and even that of some of the instruments employed in making them must no doubt have been the work of deep thought and long time and may justly be considered as among the happiest efforts of human ingenuity but when both have been fairly invented and are well understood to explain to any young man in the compleatest manner how to apply the instruments and how to construct the machines cannot well require more than the lessons of a few weeks perhaps those of a few days might be sufficient in the common mechanic trades those of a few days might certainly be sufficient the dexterity of hand indeed even in common trades cannot be acquired without much practice and experience but a young man would practice with much more diligence and attention if from the beginning he wrought as a journeyman being paid in proportion to the little work which he could execute and paying in his turn for the materials which he might sometimes spoil through aukwardness and inexperience his education would generally in this way be more effectual and always less tedious and expensive the master indeed would be a loser he would lose all the wages of the apprentice which he now saves for seven years together in the end perhaps the apprentice himself would be a loser in a trade so easily learnt he would have more competitors and his wages when he came to be a complete workman would be much less than at present the same increase of competition would reduce the profits of the masters as well as the wages of the workmen the trades the crafts the mysteries would all be losers but the public would be a gainer the work of all artificers coming in this way much cheaper to market  it is to prevent this reduction of price and consequently of wages and profit by restraining that free competition which would most certainly occasion it that all corporations and the greater part of corporation laws have been established in order to erect a corporation no other authority in ancient times was requisite in many parts of europe but that of the town corporate in which it was established in england indeed a charter from the king was likewise necessary but this prerogative of the crown seems to have been reserved rather for extorting money from the subject than for the defense of the common liberty against such oppressive monopolies upon paying a fine to the king the charter seems generally to have been readily granted and when any particular class of artificers or traders thought proper to act as a corporation without a charter such adulterine guilds as they were called were not always disfranchised upon that account but obliged to fine annually to the king for permission to exercise their usurped privileges the immediate inspection of all corporations and of the byelaws which they might think proper to enact for their own government belonged to the town corporate in which they were established and whatever discipline was exercised over them proceeded commonly not from the king but from that greater incorporation of which those subordinate ones were only parts or members  the government of towns corporate was altogether in the hands of traders and artificers and it was the manifest interest of every particular class of them to prevent the market from being overstocked as they commonly express it with their own particular species of industry which is in reality to keep it always understocked each class was eager to establish regulations proper for this purpose and provided it was allowed to do so was willing to consent that every other class should do the same in consequence of such regulations indeed each class was obliged to buy the goods they had occasion for from every other within the town somewhat dearer than they otherwise might have done but in recompense they were enabled to sell their own just as much dearer so that so far it was as broad as long as they say and in the dealings of the different classes within the town with one another none of them were losers by these regulations but in their dealings with the country they were all great gainers and in these latter dealings consists the whole trade which supports and enriches every town  every town draws its whole subsistence and all the materials of its industry from the country it pays for these chiefly in two ways first by sending back to the country a part of those materials wrought up and manufactured in which case their price is augmented by the wages of the workmen and the profits of their masters or immediate employers secondly by sending to it a part both of the rude and manufactured produce either of other countries or of distant parts of the same country imported into the town in which case too the original price of those goods is augmented by the wages of the carriers of sailors and by the profits of the merchants who employ them in what is gained upon the first of those two branches of commerce consists the advantage which the town makes by its manufactures in what is gained upon the second the advantage of its inland and foreign trade the wages of the workmen and the profits of their different employers make up the whole of what is gained upon both whatever regulations therefore tend to increase those wages and profits beyond what they otherwise would be tend to enable the town to purchase with a smaller quantity of its labor the produce of a greater quantity of the labor of the country they give the traders and artificers in the town an advantage over the landlords farmers and laborers in the country and break down that natural equality which would otherwise take place in the commerce which is carried on between them the whole annual produce of the labor of the society is annually divided between those two different setts of people by means of those regulations a greater share of it is given to the inhabitants of the town than would otherwise fall to them and a less to those of the country  the price which the town really pays for the provisions and materials annually imported into it is the quantity of manufactures and other goods annually exported from it the dearer the latter are sold the cheaper the former are bought the industry of the town becomes more and that of the country less advantageous  that the industry which is carried on in towns is every where in europe more advantageous than that which is carried on in the country without entering into any very nice computations we may satisfy ourselves by one very simple and obvious observation in every country of europe we find at least a hundred people who have acquired great fortunes from small beginnings by trade and manufactures the industry which properly belongs to towns for one who has done so by that which properly belongs to the country the raising of rude produce by the improvement and cultivation of land industry therefore must be better rewarded the wages of labor and the profits of stock must evidently be greater in the one situation than in the other but stock and labor naturally seek the most advantageous employment they naturally therefore resort as much as they can to the town and desert the country  the inhabitants of a town being collected into one place can easily combine together the most insignificant trades carried on in towns have accordingly in some place or other been incorporated and even where they have never been incorporated yet the corporation spirit the jealousy of strangers the aversion to take apprentices or to communicate the secret of their trade generally prevail in them and often teach them by voluntary associations and agreements to prevent that free competition which they cannot prohibit by byelaws the trades which employ but a small number of hands run most easily into such combinations half a dozen woolcombers perhaps are necessary to keep a thousand spinners and weavers at work by combining not to take apprentices they can not only engross the employment but reduce the whole manufacture into a sort of slavery to themselves and raise the price of their labor much above what is due to the nature of their work  the inhabitants of the country dispersed in distant places cannot easily combine together they have not only never been incorporated but the corporation spirit never has prevailed among them no apprenticeship has ever been thought necessary to qualify for husbandry the great trade of the country after what are called the fine arts and the liberal professions however there is perhaps no trade which requires so great a variety of knowledge and experience the innumerable volumes which have been written upon it in all languages may satisfy us that among the wisest and most learned nations it has never been regarded as a matter very easily understood and from all those volumes we shall in vain attempt to collect that knowledge of its various and complicated operations which is commonly possessed even by the common farmer how contemptuously soever the very contemptible authors of some of them may sometimes affect to speak of him there is scarce any common mechanic trade on the contrary of which all the operations may not be as completely and distinctly explained in a pamphlet of a very few pages as it is possible for words illustrated by figures to explain them in the history of the arts now publishing by the french academy of sciences several of them are actually explained in this manner the direction of operations besides which must be varied with every change of the weather as well as with many other accidents requires much more judgment and discretion than that of those which are always the same or very nearly the same  not only the art of the farmer the general direction of the operations of husbandry but many inferior branches of country labor require much more skill and experience than the greater part of mechanic trades the man who works upon brass and iron works with instruments and upon materials of which the temper is always the same or very nearly the same but the man who ploughs the ground with a team of horses or oxen works with instruments of which the health strength and temper are very different upon different occasions the condition of the materials which he works upon too is as variable as that of the instruments which he works with and both require to be managed with much judgment and discretion the common ploughman though generally regarded as the pattern of stupidity and ignorance is seldom defective in this judgment and discretion he is less accustomed indeed to social intercourse than the mechanic who lives in a town his voice and language are more uncouth and more difficult to be understood by those who are not used to them his understanding however being accustomed to consider a greater variety of objects is generally much superior to that of the other whose whole attention from morning till night is commonly occupied in performing one or two very simple operations how much the lower ranks of people in the country are really superior to those of the town is well known to every man whom either business or curiosity has led to converse much with both in china and indostan accordingly both the rank and the wages of country laborers are said to be superior to those of the greater part of artificers and manufacturers they would probably be so every where if corporation laws and the corporation spirit did not prevent it  the superiority which the industry of the towns has every where in europe over that of the country is not altogether owing to corporations and corporation laws it is supported by many other regulations the high duties upon foreign manufactures and upon all goods imported by alien merchants all tend to the same purpose corporation laws enable the inhabitants of towns to raise their prices without fearing to be undersold by the free competition of their own countrymen those other regulations secure them equally against that of foreigners the enhancement of price occasioned by both is every where finally paid by the landlords farmers and laborers of the country who have seldom opposed the establishment of such monopolies they have commonly neither inclination nor fitness to enter into combinations and the clamor and sophistry of merchants and manufacturers easily persuade them that the private interest of a part and of a subordinate part of the society is the general interest of the whole  in great britain the superiority of the industry of the towns over that of the country seems to have been greater formerly than in the present times the wages of country labor approach nearer to those of manufacturing labor and the profits of stock employed in agriculture to those of trading and manufacturing stock than they are said to have done in the last century or in the beginning of the present this change may be regarded as the necessary though very late consequence of the extraordinary encouragement given to the industry of the towns the stock accumulated in them comes in time to be so great that it can no longer be employed with the ancient profit in that species of industry which is peculiar to them that industry has its limits like every other and the increase of stock by increasing the competition necessarily reduces the profit the lowering of profit in the town forces out stock to the country where by creating a new demand for country labor it necessarily raises its wages it then spreads itself if i may say so over the face of the land and by being employed in agriculture is in part restored to the country at the expense of which in a great measure it had originally been accumulated in the town that every where in europe the greatest improvements of the country have been owing to such overflowings of the stock originally accumulated in the towns i shall endeavor to show hereafter and at the same time to demonstrate that though some countries have by this course attained to a considerable degree of opulence it is in itself necessarily slow uncertain liable to be disturbed and interrupted by innumerable accidents and in every respect contrary to the order of nature and of reason the interests prejudices laws and customs which have given occasion to it i shall endeavor to explain as fully and distinctly as i can in the third and fourth books of this enquiry  people of the same trade seldom meet together even for merriment and diversion but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public or in some contrivance to raise prices it is impossible indeed to prevent such meetings by any law which either could be executed or would be consistent with liberty and justice but though the law cannot hinder people of the same trade from sometimes assembling together it ought to do nothing to facilitate such assemblies much less to render them necessary  a regulation which obliges all those of the same trade in a particular town to enter their names and places of abode in a public register facilitates such assemblies it connects individuals who might never otherwise be known to one another and gives every man of the trade a direction where to find every other man of it  a regulation which enables those of the same trade to tax themselves in order to provide for their poor their sick their widows and orphans by giving them a common interest to manage renders such assemblies necessary  an incorporation not only renders them necessary but makes the act of the majority binding upon the whole in a free trade an effectual combination cannot be established but by the unanimous consent of every single member of it and it cannot last longer than every single member of it continues of the same mind the majority of a corporation can enact a byelaw with proper penalties which will limit the competition more effectually and more durably than any voluntary combination whatever  the pretense that corporations are necessary for the better government of the trade is without any foundation the real and effectual discipline which is exercised over a workman is not that of his corporation but that of his customers it is the fear of losing their employment which restrains his frauds and corrects his negligence an exclusive corporation necessarily weakens the force of this discipline a particular set of workmen must then be employed let them behave well or ill it is upon this account that in many large incorporated towns no tolerable workmen are to be found even in some of the most necessary trades if you would have your work tolerably executed it must be done in the suburbs where the workmen having no exclusive privilege have nothing but their character to depend upon and you must then smuggle it into the town as well as you can  it is in this manner that the policy of europe by restraining the competition in some employments to a smaller number than would otherwise be disposed to enter into them occasions a very important inequality in the whole of the advantages and disadvantages of the different employments of labor and stock  secondly the policy of europe by increasing the competition in some employments beyond what it naturally would be occasions another inequality of an opposite kind in the whole of the advantages and disadvantages of the different employments of labor and stock  it has been considered as of so much importance that a proper number of young people should be educated for certain professions that sometimes the public and sometimes the piety of private founders have established many pensions scholarships exhibitions bursaries etc for this purpose which draw many more people into those trades than could otherwise pretend to follow them in all christian countries i believe the education of the greater part of churchmen is paid for in this manner very few of them are educated altogether at their own expense the long tedious and expensive education therefore of those who are will not always procure them a suitable reward the church being crowded with people who in order to get employment are willing to accept of a much smaller recompense than what such an education would otherwise have entitled them to and in this manner the competition of the poor takes away the reward of the rich it would be indecent no doubt to compare either a curate or a chaplain with a journeyman in any common trade the pay of a curate or chaplain however may very properly be considered as of the same nature with the wages of a journeyman they are all three paid for their work according to the contract which they may happen to make with their respective superiors till after the middle of the fourteenth century five merks containing about as much silver as ten pounds of our present money was in england the usual pay of a curate or stipendiary parish priest as we find it regulated by the decrees of several different national councils at the same period fourpence a day containing the same quantity of silver as a shilling of our present money was declared to be the pay of a master mason and threepence a day equal to ninepence of our present money that of a journeyman mason the wages of both these laborers therefore supposing them to have been constantly employed were much superior to those of the curate the wages of the master mason supposing him to have been without employment onethird of the year would have fully equalled them by the   th of queen anne c    it is declared that whereas for want of sufficient maintenance and encouragement to curates the cures have in several places been meanly supplied the bishop is therefore empowered to appoint by writing under his hand and seal a sufficient certain stipend or allowance not exceeding fifty and not less than twenty pounds a year forty pounds a year is reckoned at present very good pay for a curate and notwithstanding this act of parliament there are many curacies under twenty pounds a year there are journeymen shoemakers in london who earn forty pounds a year and there is scarce an industrious workman of any kind in that metropolis who does not earn more than twenty this last sum indeed does not exceed what is frequently earned by common laborers in many country parishes whenever the law has attempted to regulate the wages of workmen it has always been rather to lower them than to raise them but the law has upon many occasions attempted to raise the wages of curates and for the dignity of the church to oblige the rectors of parishes to give them more than the wretched maintenance which they themselves might be willing to accept of and in both cases the law seems to have been equally ineffectual and has never either been able to raise the wages of curates or to sink those of laborers to the degree that was intended because it has never been able to hinder either the one from being willing to accept of less than the legal allowance on account of the indigence of their situation and the multitude of their competitors or the other from receiving more on account of the contrary competition of those who expected to derive either profit or pleasure from employing them  the great benefices and other ecclesiastical dignities support the honor of the church notwithstanding the mean circumstances of some of its inferior members the respect paid to the profession too makes some compensation even to them for the meanness of their pecuniary recompense in england and in all roman catholic countries the lottery of the church is in reality much more advantageous than is necessary the example of the churches of scotland of geneva and of several other protestant churches may satisfy us that in so creditable a profession in which education is so easily procured the hopes of much more moderate benefices will draw a sufficient number of learned decent and respectable men into holy orders  in professions in which there are no benefices such as law and physic if an equal proportion of people were educated at the public expense the competition would soon be so great as to sink very much their pecuniary reward it might then not be worth any mans while to educate his son to either of those professions at his own expense they would be entirely abandoned to such as had been educated by those public charities whose numbers and necessities would oblige them in general to content themselves with a very miserable recompense to the entire degradation of the now respectable professions of law and physic  that unprosperous race of men commonly called men of letters are pretty much in the situation which lawyers and physicians probably would be in upon the foregoing supposition in every part of europe the greater part of them have been educated for the church but have been hindered by different reasons from entering into holy orders they have generally therefore been educated at the public expense and their numbers are every where so great as commonly to reduce the price of their labor to a very paultry recompense  before the invention of the art of printing the only employment by which a man of letters could make any thing by his talents was that of a public teacher or by communicating to other people the curious and useful knowledge which he had acquired himself and this is still surely a more honorable a more useful and in general even a more profitable employment than that other of writing for a bookseller to which the art of printing has given occasion the time and study the genius knowledge and application requisite to qualify an eminent teacher of the sciences are at least equal to what is necessary for the greatest practitioners in law and physic but the usual reward of the eminent teacher bears no proportion to that of the lawyer or physician because the trade of the one is crowded with indigent people who have been brought up to it at the public expense whereas those of the other two are incumbered with very few who have not been educated at their own the usual recompense however of public and private teachers small as it may appear would undoubtedly be less than it is if the competition of those yet more indigent men of letters who write for bread was not taken out of the market before the invention of the art of printing a scholar and a beggar seem to have been terms very nearly synonymous the different governors of the universities before that time appear to have often granted licenses to their scholars to beg  in ancient times before any charities of this kind had been established for the education of indigent people to the learned professions the rewards of eminent teachers appear to have been much more considerable isocrates in what is called his discourse against the sophists reproaches the teachers of his own times with inconsistency they make the most magnificent promises to their scholars says he and undertake to teach them to be wise to be happy and to be just and in return for so important a service they stipulate the paultry reward of four or five minae they who teach wisdom continues he ought certainly to be wise themselves but if any man was to sell such a price he would be convicted of the most evident folly he certainly does not mean here to exaggerate the reward and we may be assured that it was not less than he represents it four minae were equal to thirteen pounds six shillings and eight pence five minae to sixteen pounds thirteen shillings and four pence something not less than the largest of those two sums therefore must at that time have been usually paid to the most eminent teachers at athens isocrates himself demanded ten minae or thirtythree pounds six shillings and eight pence from each scholar when he taught at athens he is said to have had an hundred scholars i understand this to be the number whom he taught at one time or who attended what we would call one course of lectures a number which will not appear extraordinary from so great a city to so famous a teacher who taught too what was at that time the most fashionable of all sciences rhetoric he must have made therefore by each course of lectures a thousand minae or      l   s   d a thousand minae accordingly is said by plutarch in another place to have been his didactron or usual price of teaching many other eminent teachers in those times appear to have acquired great fortunes gorgias made a present to the temple of delphi of his own statue in solid gold we must not i presume suppose that it was as large as the life his way of living as well as that of hippias and protagoras two other eminent teachers of those times is represented by plato as splendid even to ostentation plato himself is said to have lived with a good deal of magnificence aristotle after having been tutor to alexander and most munificently rewarded as it is universally agreed both by him and his father philip thought it worth while notwithstanding to return to athens in order to resume the teaching of his school teachers of the sciences were probably in those times less common than they came to be in an age or two afterward when the competition had probably somewhat reduced both the price of their labor and the admiration for their persons the most eminent of them however appear always to have enjoyed a degree of consideration much superior to any of the like profession in the present times the athenians sent carneades the academick and diogenes the stoic upon a solemn embassy to rome and though their city had then declined from its former grandeur it was still an independent and considerable republic carneades too was a babylonian by birth and as there never was a people more jealous of admitting foreigners to public offices than the athenians their consideration for him must have been very great  this inequality is upon the whole perhaps rather advantageous than hurtful to the public it may somewhat degrade the profession of a public teacher but the cheapness of literary education is surely an advantage which greatly overbalances this trifling inconveniency the public too might derive still greater benefit from it if the constitution of those schools and colleges in which education is carried on was more reasonable than it is at present through the greater part of europe  thirdly the policy of europe by obstructing the free circulation of labor and stock both from employment to employment and from place to place occasions in some cases a very inconvenient inequality in the whole of the advantages and disadvantages of their different employments  the statute of apprenticeship obstructs the free circulation of labor from one employment to another even in the same place the exclusive privileges of corporations obstruct it from one place to another even in the same employment  it frequently happens that while high wages are given to the workmen in one manufacture those in another are obliged to content themselves with bare subsistence the one is in an advancing state and has therefore a continual demand for new hands the other is in a declining state and the superabundance of hands is continually increasing those two manufactures may sometimes be in the same town and sometimes in the same neighborhood without being able to lend the least assistance to one another the statute of apprenticeship may oppose it in the one case and both that and an exclusive corporation in the other in many different manufactures however the operations are so much alike that the workmen could easily change trades with one another if those absurd laws did not hinder them the arts of weaving plain linen and plain silk for example are almost entirely the same that of weaving plain woollen is somewhat different but the difference is so insignificant that either a linen or a silk weaver might become a tolerable workman in a very few days if any of those three capital manufactures therefore were decaying the workmen might find a resource in one of the other two which was in a more prosperous condition and their wages would neither rise too high in the thriving nor sink too low in the decaying manufacture the linen manufacture indeed is in england by a particular statute open to every body but as it is not much cultivated through the greater part of the country it can afford no general resource to the workmen of other decaying manufactures who wherever the statute of apprenticeship takes place have no other choice but either to come upon the parish or to work as common laborers for which by their habits they are much worse qualified than for any sort of manufacture that bears any resemblance to their own they generally therefore choose to come upon the parish  whatever obstructs the free circulation of labor from one employment to another obstructs that of stock likewise the quantity of stock which can be employed in any branch of business depending very much upon that of labor which can be employed in it corporation laws however give less obstruction to the free circulation of stock from one place to another than to that of labor it is every where much easier for a wealthy merchant to obtain the privilege of trading in a town corporate than for a poor artificer to obtain that of working in it  the obstruction which corporation laws give to the free circulation of labor is common i believe to every part of europe that which is given to it by the poor laws so far as i know is peculiar to england it consists in the difficulty which a poor man finds in obtaining a settlement or even in being allowed to exercise his industry in any parish but that to which he belongs it is the labor of artificers and manufacturers only of which the free circulation is obstructed by corporation laws the difficulty of obtaining settlements obstructs even that of common labor it may be worth while to give some account of the rise progress and present state of this disorder the greatest perhaps of any in the police of england  when by the destruction of monasteries the poor had been deprived of the charity of those religious houses after some other ineffectual attempts for their relief it was enacted by the   d of elizabeth c   that every parish should be bound to provide for its own poor and that overseers of the poor should be annually appointed who with the churchwardens should raise by a parish rate competent sums for this purpose  by this statute the necessity of providing for their own poor was indispensibly imposed upon every parish who were to be considered as the poor of each parish therefore became a question of some importance this question after some variation was at last determined by the   th and   th of charles ii when it was enacted that forty days undisturbed residence should gain any person a settlement in any parish but that within that time it should be lawful for two justices of the peace upon complaint made by the churchwardens or overseers of the poor to remove any new inhabitant to the parish where he was last legally settled unless he either rented a tenement of ten pounds a year or could give such security for the discharge of the parish where he was then living as those justices should judge sufficient  some frauds it is said were committed in consequence of this statute parish officers sometimes bribing their own poor to go clandestinely to another parish and by keeping themselves concealed for forty days to gain a settlement there to the discharge of that to which they properly belonged it was enacted therefore by the  st of james ii that the forty days undisturbed residence of any person necessary to gain a settlement should be accounted only from the time of his delivering notice in writing of the place of his abode and the number of his family to one of the churchwardens or overseers of the parish where he came to dwell  but parish officers it seems were not always more honest with regard to their own than they had been with regard to other parishes and sometimes connived at such intrusions receiving the notice and taking no proper steps in consequence of it as every person in a parish therefore was supposed to have an interest to prevent as much as possible their being burdened by such intruders it was further enacted by the  d of william iii that the forty days residence should be accounted only from the publication of such notice in writing on sunday in the church immediately after divine service  after all says doctor burn this kind of settlement by continuing forty days after publication of notice in writing is very seldom obtained and the design of the acts is not so much for gaining of settlements as for the avoiding of them by persons coming into a parish clandestinely for the giving of notice is only putting a force upon the parish to remove but if a persons situation is such that it is doubtful whether he is actually removeable or not he shall by giving of notice compel the parish either to allow him a settlement uncontested by suffering him to continue forty days or by removing him to try the right  this statute therefore rendered it almost impracticable for a poor man to gain a new settlement in the old way by forty days inhabitancy but that it might not appear to preclude altogether the common people of one parish from ever establishing themselves with security in another it appointed four other ways by which a settlement might be gained without any notice delivered or published the first was by being taxed to parish rates and paying them the second by being elected into an annual parish office and serving in it a year the third by serving an apprenticeship in the parish the fourth by being hired into service there for a year and continuing in the same service during the whole of it  nobody can gain a settlement by either of the two first ways but by the public deed of the whole parish who are too well aware of the consequences to adopt any new comer who has nothing but his labor to support him either by taxing him to parish rates or by electing him into a parish office  no married man can well gain any settlement in either of the two last ways an apprentice is scarce ever married and it is expressly enacted that no married servant shall gain any settlement by being hired for a year the principal effect of introducing settlement by service has been to put out in a great measure the old fashion of hiring for a year which before had been so customary in england that even at this day if no particular term is agreed upon the law intends that every servant is hired for a year but masters are not always willing to give their servants a settlement by hiring them in this manner and servants are not always willing to be so hired because as every last settlement discharges all the foregoing they might thereby lose their original settlement in the places of their nativity the habitation of their parents and relations  no independent workman it is evident whether labourer or artificer is likely to gain any new settlement either by apprenticeship or by service when such a person therefore carried his industry to a new parish he was liable to be removed how healthy and industrious soever at the caprice of any churchwarden or overseer unless he either rented a tenement of ten pounds a year a thing impossible for one who has nothing but his labor to live by or could give such security for the discharge of the parish as two justices of the peace should judge sufficient what security they shall require indeed is left altogether to their discretion but they cannot well require less than thirty pounds it having been enacted that the purchase even of a freehold estate of less than thirty pounds value shall not gain any person a settlement as not being sufficient for the discharge of the parish but this is a security which scarce any man who lives by labor can give and much greater security is frequently demanded  in order to restore in some measure that free circulation of labor which those different statutes had almost entirely taken away the invention of certificates was fallen upon by the  th and  th of william iii it was enacted that if any person should bring a certificate from the parish where he was last legally settled subscribed by the churchwardens and overseers of the poor and allowed by two justices of the peace that every other parish should be obliged to receive him that he should not be removable merely upon account of his being likely to become chargeable but only upon his becoming actually chargeable and that then the parish which granted the certificate should be obliged to pay the expense both of his maintenance and of his removal and in order to give the most perfect security to the parish where such certificated man should come to reside it was further enacted by the same statute that he should gain no settlement there by any means whatever except either by renting a tenement of ten pounds a year or by serving upon his own account in an annual parish office for one whole year and consequently neither by notice nor by service nor by apprenticeship nor by paying parish rates by the   th of queen anne too stat   c    it was further enacted that neither the servants nor apprentices of such certificated man should gain any settlement in the parish where he resided under such certificate  how far this invention has restored that free circulation of labor which the preceding statutes had almost entirely taken away we may learn from the following very judicious observation of doctor burn it is obvious says he that there are diverse good reasons for requiring certificates with persons coming to settle in any place namely that persons residing under them can gain no settlement neither by apprenticeship nor by service nor by giving notice nor by paying parish rates that they can settle neither apprentices nor servants that if they become chargeable it is certainly known whither to remove them and the parish shall be paid for the removal and for their maintenance in the mean time and that if they fall sick and cannot be removed the parish which gave the certificate must maintain them none of all which can be without a certificate which reasons will hold proportionably for parishes not granting certificates in ordinary cases for it is far more than an equal chance but that they will have the certificated persons again and in a worse condition the moral of this observation seems to be that certificates ought always to be required by the parish where any poor man comes to reside and that they ought very seldom to be granted by that which he proposes to leave there is somewhat of hardship in this matter of certificates says the same very intelligent author in his history of the poor laws by putting it in the power of a parish officer to imprison a man as it were for life however inconvenient it may be for him to continue at that place where he has had the misfortune to acquire what is called a settlement or whatever advantage he may propose to himself by living elsewhere  though a certificate carries along with it no testimonial of good behavior and certifies nothing but that the person belongs to the parish to which he really does belong it is altogether discretionary in the parish officers either to grant or to refuse it a mandamus was once moved for says doctor burn to compel the churchwardens and overseers to sign a certificate but the court of kings bench rejected the motion as a very strange attempt  the very unequal price of labor which we frequently find in england in places at no great distance from one another is probably owing to the obstruction which the law of settlements gives to a poor man who would carry his industry from one parish to another without a certificate a single man indeed who is healthy and industrious may sometimes reside by sufferance without one but a man with a wife and family who should attempt to do so would in most parishes be sure of being removed and if the single man should afterward marry he would generally be removed likewise the scarcity of hands in one parish therefore cannot always be relieved by their superabundance in another as it is constantly in scotland and i believe in all other countries where there is no difficulty of settlement in such countries though wages may sometimes rise a little in the neighborhood of a great town or wherever else there is an extraordinary demand for labor and sink gradually as the distance from such places increases till they fall back to the common rate of the country yet we never meet with those sudden and unaccountable differences in the wages of neighboring places which we sometimes find in england where it is often more difficult for a poor man to pass the artificial boundary of a parish than an arm of the sea or a ridge of high mountains natural boundaries which sometimes separate very distinctly different rates of wages in other countries  to remove a man who has committed no misdemeanour from the parish where he chooses to reside is an evident violation of natural liberty and justice the common people of england however so jealous of their liberty but like the common people of most other countries never rightly understanding wherein it consists have now for more than a century together suffered themselves to be exposed to this oppression without a remedy though men of reflection too have sometimes complained of the law of settlements as a public grievance yet it has never been the object of any general popular clamor such as that against general warrants an abusive practice undoubtedly but such a one as was not likely to occasion any general oppression there is scarce a poor man in england of forty years of age i will venture to say who has not in some part of his life felt himself most cruelly oppressed by this ill contrived law of settlements  i shall conclude this long chapter with observing that though anciently it was usual to rate wages first by general laws extending over the whole kingdom and afterward by particular orders of the justices of peace in every particular country both these practices have now gone entirely into disuse by the experience of above four hundred years says doctor burn it seems time to lay aside all endeavors to bring under strict regulations what in its own nature seems incapable of minute limitation for if all persons in the same kind of work were to receive equal wages there would be no emulation and no room left for industry or ingenuity  particular acts of parliament however still attempt sometimes to regulate wages in particular trades and in particular places thus the  th of george iii prohibits under heavy penalties all master tailors in london and five miles round it from giving and their workmen from accepting more than two shillings and sevenpence halfpenny a day except in the case of a general mourning whenever the legislature attempts to regulate the differences between masters and their workmen its counselors are always the masters when the regulation therefore is in favor of the workmen it is always just and equitable but it is sometimes otherwise when in favor of the masters thus the law which obliges the masters in several different trades to pay their workmen in money and not in goods is quite just and equitable it imposes no real hardship upon the masters it only obliges them to pay that value in money which they pretended to pay but did not always really pay in goods this law is in favor of the workmen but the  th of george iii is in favor of the masters when masters combine together in order to reduce the wages of their workmen they commonly enter into a private bond or agreement not to give more than a certain wage under a certain penalty were the workmen to enter into a contrary combination of the same kind not to accept of a certain wage under a certain penalty the law would punish them very severely and if it dealt impartially it would treat the masters in the same manner but the  th of george iii enforces by law that very regulation which masters sometimes attempt to establish by such combinations the complaint of the workmen that it puts the ablest and most industrious upon the same footing with an ordinary workman seems perfectly well founded  in ancient times too it was usual to attempt to regulate the profits of merchants and other dealers by rating the price both of provisions and other goods the assize of bread is so far as i know the only remnant of this ancient usage where there is an exclusive corporation it may perhaps be proper to regulate the price of the first necessary of life but where there is none the competition will regulate it much better than any assize the method of fixing the assize of bread established by the   st of george ii could not be put in practice in scotland on account of a defect in the law its execution depending upon the office of clerk of the market which does not exist there this defect was not remedied till the  d of george iii the want of an assize occasioned no sensible inconveniency and the establishment of one in the few places where it has yet taken place has produced no sensible advantage in the greater part of the towns of scotland however there is an incorporation of bakers who claim exclusive privileges though they are not very strictly guarded  the proportion between the different rates both of wages and profit in the different employments of labor and stock seems not to be much affected as has already been observed by the riches or poverty the advancing stationary or declining state of the society such revolutions in the public welfare though they affect the general rates both of wages and profit must in the end affect them equally in all different employments the proportion between them therefore must remain the same and cannot well be altered at least for any considerable time by any such revolutions  chap xi of the rent of land rent considered as the price paid for the use of land is naturally the highest which the tenant can afford to pay in the actual circumstances of the land in adjusting the terms of the lease the landlord endeavors to leave him no greater share of the produce than what is sufficient to keep up the stock from which he furnishes the seed pays the labor and purchases and maintains the cattle and other instruments of husbandry together with the ordinary profits of farming stock in the neighborhood this is evidently the smallest share with which the tenant can content himself without being a loser and the landlord seldom means to leave him any more whatever part of the produce or what is the same thing whatever part of its price is over and above this share he naturally endeavors to reserve to himself as the rent of his land which is evidently the highest the tenant can afford to pay in the actual circumstances of the land sometimes indeed the liberality more frequently the ignorance of the landlord makes him accept of somewhat less than this portion and sometimes too though more rarely the ignorance of the tenant makes him undertake to pay somewhat more or to content himself with somewhat less than the ordinary profits of farming stock in the neighborhood this portion however may still be considered as the natural rent of land or the rent for which it is naturally meant that land should for the most part be let  the rent of land it may be thought is frequently no more than a reasonable profit or interest for the stock laid out by the landlord upon its improvement this no doubt may be partly the case upon some occasions for it can scarce ever be more than partly the case the landlord demands a rent even for unimproved land and the supposed interest or profit upon the expense of improvement is generally an addition to this original rent those improvements besides are not always made by the stock of the landlord but sometimes by that of the tenant when the lease comes to be renewed however the landlord commonly demands the same augmentation of rent as if they had been all made by his own  he sometimes demands rent for what is altogether incapable of human improvement kelp is a species of seaweed which when burnt yields an alkaline salt useful for making glass soap and for several other purposes it grows in several parts of great britain particularly in scotland upon such rocks only as lie within the high water mark which are twice every day covered with the sea and of which the produce therefore was never augmented by human industry the landlord however whose estate is bounded by a kelp shore of this kind demands a rent for it as much as for his corn fields  the sea in the neighborhood of the islands of shetland is more than commonly abundant in fish which make a great part of the subsistence of their inhabitants but in order to profit by the produce of the water they must have a habitation upon the neighboring land the rent of the landlord is in proportion not to what the farmer can make by the land but to what he can make both by the land and the water it is partly paid in sea fish and one of the very few instances in which rent makes a part of the priceof that commodity is to be found in that country  the rent of land therefore considered as the price paid for the use of the land is naturally a monopoly price it is not at all proportioned to what the landlord may have laid out upon the improvement of the land or to what he can afford to take but to what the farmer can afford to give  such parts only of the produce of land can commonly be brought to market of which the ordinary price is sufficient to replace the stock which must be employed in bringing them thither together with its ordinary profits if the ordinary price is more than this the surplus part of it will naturally go to the rent of the land if it is not more though the commodity may be brought to market it can afford no rent to the landlord whether the price is or is not more depends upon the demand  there are some parts of the produce of land for which the demand must always be such as to afford a greater price than what is sufficient to bring them to market and there are others for which it either may or may not be such as to afford this greater price the former must always afford a rent to the landlord the latter sometimes may and sometimes may not according to different circumstances  rent it is to be observed therefore enters into the composition of the price of commodities in a different way from wages and profit high or low wages and profit are the causes of high or low price high or low rent is the effect of it it is because high or low wages and profit must be paid in order to bring a particular commodity to market that its price is high or low but it is because its price is high or low a great deal more or very little more or no more than what is sufficient to pay those wages and profit that it affords a high rent or a low rent or no rent at all  the particular consideration first of those parts of the produce of land which always afford some rent secondly of those which sometimes may and sometimes may not afford rent and thirdly of the variations which in the different periods of improvement naturally take place in the relative value of those two different sorts of rude produce when compared both with one another and with manufactured commodities will divide this chapter into three parts  part i of the produce of land which always affords rent as men like all other animals naturally multiply in proportion to the means of their subsistence food is always more or less in demand it can always purchase or command a greater or smaller quantity of labor and somebody can always be found who is willing to do something in order to obtain it the quantity of labor indeed which it can purchase is not always equal to what it could maintain if managed in the most oeconomical manner on account of the high wages which are sometimes given to labor but it can always purchase such a quantity of labor as it can maintain according to the rate at which that sort of labor is commonly maintained in the neighborhood  but land in almost any situation produces a greater quantity of food than what is sufficient to maintain all the labor necessary for bringing it to market in the most liberal way in which that labor is ever maintained the surplus too is always more than sufficient to replace the stock which employed that labor together with its profits something therefore always remains for a rent to the landlord  the most desert moors in norway and scotland produce some sort of pasture for cattle of which the milk and the increase are always more than sufficient not only to maintain all the labor necessary for tending them and to pay the ordinary profit to the farmer or owner of the herd or flock but to afford some small rent to the landlord the rent increases in proportion to the goodness of the pasture the same extent of ground not only maintains a greater number of cattle but as they are brought within a smaller compass less labor becomes requisite to tend them and to collect their produce the landlord gains both ways by the increase of the produce and by the diminution of the labor which must be maintained out of it  the rent of land varies with its fertility whatever be its produce and with its situation whatever be its fertility land in the neighborhood of a town gives a greater rent than land equally fertile in a distant part of the country though it may cost no more labor to cultivate the one than the other it must always cost more to bring the produce of the distant land to market a greater quantity of labor therefore must be maintained out of it and the surplus from which are drawn both the profit of the farmer and the rent of the landlord must be diminished but in remote parts of the country the rate of profit as has already been shown is generally higher than in the neighborhood of a large town a smaller proportion of this diminished surplus therefore must belong to the landlord  good roads canals and navigable rivers by diminishing the expense of carriage put the remote parts of the country more nearly upon a level with those in the neighborhood of the town they are upon that account the greatest of all improvements they encourage the cultivation of the remote which must always be the most extensive circle of the country they are advantageous to the town by breaking down the monopoly of the country in its neighborhood they are advantageous even to that part of the country though they introduce some rival commodities into the old market they open many new markets to its produce monopoly besides is a great enemy to good management which can never be universally established but in consequence of that free and universal competition which forces every body to have recourse to it for the sake of selfdefence it is not more than fifty years ago that some of the counties in the neighborhood of london petitioned the parliament against the extension of the turnpike roads into the remoter counties those remoter counties they pretended from the cheapness of labor would be able to sell their grass and corn cheaper in the london market than themselves and would thereby reduce their rents and ruin their cultivation their rents however have risen and their cultivation has been improved since that time  a corn field of moderate fertility produces a much greater quantity of food for man than the best pasture of equal extent though its cultivation requires much more labor yet the surplus which remains after replacing the seed and maintaining all that labor is likewise much greater if a pound of butchers meat therefore was never supposed to be worth more than a pound of bread this greater surplus would every where be of greater value and constitute a greater fund both for the profit of the farmer and the rent of the landlord it seems to have done so universally in the rude beginnings of agriculture  but the relative values of those two different species of food bread and butchersmeat are very different in the different periods of agriculture in its rude beginnings the unimproved wilds which then occupy the far greater part of the country are all abandoned to cattle there is more butchersmeat than bread and bread therefore is the food for which there is the greatest competition and which consequently brings the greatest price at buenos airs we are told by ulloa four reals one and twenty pence halfpenny sterling was forty or fifty years ago the ordinary price of an ox chosen from a herd of two or three hundred he says nothing of the price of bread probably because he found nothing remarkable about it an ox there he says costs little more than the labor of catching him but corn can no where be raised without a great deal of labor and in a country which lies upon the river plate at that time the direct road from europe to the silver mines of potosi the money price of labor could not be very cheap it is otherwise when cultivation is extended over the greater part of the country there is then more bread than butchersmeat the competition changes its direction and the price of butchersmeat becomes greater than the price of bread  by the extension besides of cultivation the unimproved wilds become insufficient to supply the demand for butchersmeat a great part of the cultivated lands must be employed in rearing and fattening cattle of which the price therefore must be sufficient to pay not only the labor necessary for tending them but the rent which the landlord and the profit which the farmer could have drawn from such land employed in tillage the cattle bred upon the most uncultivated moors when brought to the same market are in proportion to their weight or goodness sold at the same price as those which are reared upon the most improved land the proprietors of those moors profit by it and raise the rent of their land in proportion to the price of their cattle it is not more than a century ago that in many parts of the highlands of scotland butchersmeat was as cheap or cheaper than even bread made of oatmeal the union opened the market of england to the highland cattle their ordinary price is at present about three times greater than at the beginning of the century and the rents of many highland estates have been tripled and quadrupled in the same time in almost every part of great britain a pound of the best butchersmeat is in the present times generally worth more than two pounds of the best white bread and in plentiful years it is sometimes worth three or four pounds  it is thus that in the progress of improvement the rent and profit of unimproved pasture come to be regulated in some measure by the rent and profit of what is improved and these again by the rent and profit of corn corn is an annual crop butchersmeat a crop which requires four or five years to grow as an acre of land therefore will produce a much smaller quantity of the one species of food than of the other the inferiority of the quantity must be compensated by the superiority of the price if it was more than compensated more corn land would be turned into pasture and if it was not compensated part of what was in pasture would be brought back into corn  this equality however between the rent and profit of grass and those of corn of the land of which the immediate produce is food for cattle and of that of which the immediate produce is food for men must be understood to take place only through the greater part of the improved lands of a great country in some particular local situations it is quite otherwise and the rent and profit of grass are much superior to what can be made by corn  thus in the neighborhood of a great town the demand for milk and for forage to horses frequently contribute along with the high price of butchersmeat to raise the value of grass above what may be called its natural proportion to that of corn this local advantage it is evident cannot be communicated to the lands at a distance  particular circumstances have sometimes rendered some countries so populous that the whole territory like the lands in the neighborhood of a great town has not been sufficient to produce both the grass and the corn necessary for the subsistence of their inhabitants their lands therefore have been principally employed in the production of grass the more bulky commodity and which cannot be so easily brought from a great distance and corn the food of the great body of the people has been chiefly imported from foreign countries holland is at present in this situation and a considerable part of ancient italy seems to have been so during the prosperity of the romans to feed well old cato said as we are told by cicero was the first and most profitable thing in the management of a private estate to feed tolerably well the second and to feed ill the third to plough he ranked only in the fourth place of profit and advantage tillage indeed in that part of ancient italy which lay in the neighborhood of rome must have been very much discouraged by the distributions of corn which were frequently made to the people either gratuitously or at a very low price this corn was brought from the conquered provinces of which several instead of taxes were obliged to furnish a tenth part of their produce at a stated price about sixpence a peck to the republic the low price at which this corn was distributed to the people must necessarily have sunk the price of what could be brought to the roman market from latium or the ancient territory of rome and must have discouraged its cultivation in that country  in an open country too of which the principal produce is corn a well enclosed piece of grass will frequently rent higher than any corn field in its neighborhood it is convenient for the maintenance of the cattle employed in the cultivation of the corn and its high rent is in this case not so properly paid from the value of its own produce as from that of the corn lands which are cultivated by means of it it is likely to fall if ever the neighboring lands are completely enclosed the present high rent of enclosed land in scotland seems owing to the scarcity of enclosure and will probably last no longer than that scarcity the advantage of enclosure is greater for pasture than for corn it saves the labor of guarding the cattle which feed better too when they are not liable to be disturbed by their keeper or his dog  but where there is no local advantage of this kind the rent and profit of corn or whatever else is the common vegetable food of the people must naturally regulate upon the land which is fit for producing it the rent and profit of pasture  the use of the artificial grasses of turnips carrots cabbages and the other expedients which have been fallen upon to make an equal quantity of land feed a greater number of cattle than when in natural grass should somewhat reduce it might be expected the superiority which in an improved country the price of butchersmeat naturally has over that of bread it seems accordingly to have done so and there is some reason for believing that at least in the london market the price of butchers meat in proportion to the price of bread is a good deal lower in the present times than it was in the beginning of the last century  in the appendix to the life of prince henry doctor birch has given us an account of the prices of butchers meat as commonly paid by that prince it is there said that the four quarters of an ox weighing six hundred pounds usually cost him nine pounds ten shillings or thereabouts that is thirtyone shillings and eight pence per hundred pounds weight prince henry died on the  th of november      in the nineteenth year of his age  in march      there was a parliamentary enquiry into the causes of the high price of provisions at that time it was then among other proof to the same purpose given in evidence by a virginia merchant that in march      he had victualled his ships for twentyfour or twentyfive shillings the hundred weight of beef which he considered as the ordinary price whereas in that dear year he had paid twentyseven shillings for the same weight and sort this high price in      is however four shillings and eightpence cheaper than the ordinary price paid by prince henry and it is the best beef only it must be observed which is fit to be salted for those distant voyages  the price paid by prince henry amounts to   d per pound weight of the whole carcass coarse and choice pieces taken together and at that rate the choice pieces could not have been sold by retail for less than   d or   d the pound  in the parliamentary enquiry in      the witnesses stated the price of the choice pieces of the best beef to be to the consumer   d and   d the pound and the coarse pieces in general to be from seven farthings to   d and   d and this they said was in general one halfpenny dearer than the same sort of pieces had usually been sold in the month of march but even this high price is still a good deal cheaper than what we can well suppose the ordinary retail price to have been in the time of prince henry  during the twelve first years of the last century the average price of the best wheat at the windsor market was   l    s   d the quarter of nine winchester bushels  but in the twelve years preceding      including that year the average price of the same measure of the best wheat at the same market was   l   s   d  in the twelve first years of the last century therefore wheat appears to have been a good deal cheaper and butchers meat a good deal dearer than in the twelve years preceding      including that year  in all great countries the greater part of the cultivated lands are employed in producing either food for men or food for cattle the rent and profit of these regulate the rent and profit of all other cultivated land if any particular produce afforded less the land would soon be turned into corn or pasture and if any afforded more some part of the lands in corn or pasture would soon be turned to that produce  those productions indeed which require either a greater original expense of improvement or a greater annual expense of cultivation in order to fit the land for them appear commonly to afford the one a greater rent the other a greater profit than corn or pasture this superiority however will seldom be found to amount to more than a reasonable interest or compensation for this superior expense  in a hop garden a fruit garden a kitchen garden both the rent of the landlord and the profit of the farmer are generally greater than in a corn or grass field but to bring the ground into this condition requires more expense hence a greater rent becomes due to the landlord it requires too a more attentive and skilful management hence a greater profit becomes due to the farmer the crop too at least in the hop and fruit garden is more precarious its price therefore besides compensating all occasional losses must afford something like the profit of insurance the circumstances of gardeners generally mean and always moderate may satisfy us that their great ingenuity is not commonly overrecompensed their delightful art is practiced by so many rich people for amusement that little advantage is to be made by those who practice it for profit because the persons who should naturally be their best customers supply themselves with all their most precious productions  the advantage which the landlord derives from such improvements seems at no time to have been greater than what was sufficient to compensate the original expense of making them in the ancient husbandry after the vineyard a well watered kitchen garden seems to have been the part of the farm which was supposed to yield the most valuable produce but democritus who wrote upon husbandry about two thousand years ago and who was regarded by the ancients as one of the fathers of the art thought they did not act wisely who enclosed a kitchen garden the profit he said would not compensate the expense of a stone wall and bricks he meant i suppose bricks baked in the sun mouldered with the rain and the winter storm and required continual repairs columella who reports this judgment of democritus does not controvert it but proposes a very frugal method of enclosing with a hedge of thorns and briars which he says he had found by experience to be both a lasting and an impenetrable fence but which it seems was not commonly known in the time of democritus palladius adopts the opinion of columella which had before been recommended by varro in the judgment of those ancient improvers the produce of a kitchen garden had it seems been little more than sufficient to pay the extraordinary culture and the expense of watering for in countries so near the sun it was thought proper in those times as in the present to have the command of a stream of water which could be conducted to every bed in the garden through the greater part of europe a kitchen garden is not at present supposed to deserve a better enclosure than that recommended by columella in great britain and some other northern countries the finer fruits cannot be brought to perfection but by the assistance of a wall their price therefore in such countries must be sufficient to pay the expense of building and maintaining what they cannot be had without the fruitwall frequently surrounds the kitchen garden which thus enjoys the benefit of an enclosure which its own produce could seldom pay for  that the vineyard when properly planted and brought to perfection was the most valuable part of the farm seems to have been an undoubted maxim in the ancient agriculture as it is in the modern through all the wine countries but whether it was advantageous to plant a new vineyard was a matter of dispute among the ancient italian husbandmen as we learn from columella he decides like a true lover of all curious cultivation in favor of the vineyard and endeavors to show by a comparison of the profit and expense that it was a most advantageous improvement such comparisons however between the profit and expense of new projects are commonly very fallacious and in nothing more so than in agriculture had the gain actually made by such plantations been commonly as great as he imagined it might have been there could have been no dispute about it the same point is frequently at this day a matter of controversy in the wine countries their writers on agriculture indeed the lovers and promoters of high cultivation seem generally disposed to decide with columella in favor of the vineyard in france the anxiety of the proprietors of the old vineyards to prevent the planting of any new ones seems to favor their opinion and to indicate a consciousness in those who must have the experience that this species of cultivation is at present in that country more profitable than any other it seems at the same time however to indicate another opinion that this superior profit can last no longer than the laws which at present restrain the free cultivation of the vine in      they obtained an order of council prohibiting both the planting of new vineyards and the renewal of those old ones of which the cultivation had been interrupted for two years without a particular permission from the king to be granted only in consequence of an information from the intendant of the province certifying that he had examined the land and that it was incapable of any other culture the pretense of this order was the scarcity of corn and pasture and the superabundance of wine but had this superabundance been real it would without any order of council have effectually prevented the plantation of new vineyards by reducing the profits of this species of cultivation below their natural proportion to those of corn and pasture with regard to the supposed scarcity of corn occasioned by the multiplication of vineyards corn is no where in france more carefully cultivated than in the wine provinces where the land is fit for producing it as in burgundy guienne and the upper languedoc the numerous hands employed in the one species of cultivation necessarily encourage the other by affording a ready market for its produce to diminish the number of those who are capable of paying for it is surely a most unpromising expedient for encouraging the cultivation of corn it is like the policy which would promote agriculture by discouraging manufactures  the rent and profit of those productions therefore which require either a greater original expense of improvement in order to fit the land for them or a greater annual expense of cultivation though often much superior to those of corn and pasture yet when they do no more than compensate such extraordinary expense are in reality regulated by the rent and profit of those common crops  it sometimes happens indeed that the quantity of land which can be fitted for some particular produce is too small to supply the effectual demand the whole produce can be disposed of to those who are willing to give somewhat more than what is sufficient to pay the whole rent wages and profit necessary for raising and bringing it to market according to their natural rates or according to the rates at which they are paid in the greater part of other cultivated land the surplus part of the price which remains after defraying the whole expense of improvement and cultivation may commonly in this case and in this case only bear no regular proportion to the like surplus in corn or pasture but may exceed it in almost any degree and the greater part of this excess naturally goes to the rent of the landlord  the usual and natural proportion for example between the rent and profit of wine and those of corn and pasture must be understood to take place only with regard to those vineyards which produce nothing but good common wine such as can be raised almost any where upon any light gravelly or sandy soil and which has nothing to recommend it but its strength and wholesomness it is with such vineyards only that the common land of the country can be brought into competition for with those of a peculiar quality it is evident that it cannot  the vine is more affected by the difference of soils than any other fruit tree from some it derives a flavor which no culture or management can equal it is supposed upon any other this flavor real or imaginary is sometimes peculiar to the produce of a few vineyards sometimes it extends through the greater part of a small district and sometimes through a considerable part of a large province the whole quantity of such wines that is brought to market falls short of the effectual demand or the demand of those who would be willing to pay the whole rent profit and wages necessary for preparing and bringing them thither according to the ordinary rate or according to the rate at which they are paid in common vineyards the whole quantity therefore can be disposed of to those who are willing to pay more which necessarily raises their price above that of common wine the difference is greater or less according as the fashionableness and scarcity of the wine render the competition of the buyers more or less eager whatever it be the greater part of it goes to the rent of the landlord for though such vineyards are in general more carefully cultivated than most others the high price of the wine seems to be not so much the effect as the cause of this careful cultivation in so valuable a produce the loss occasioned by negligence is so great as to force even the most careless to attention a small part of this high price therefore is sufficient to pay the wages of the extraordinary labor bestowed upon their cultivation and the profits of the extraordinary stock which puts that labor into motion  the sugar colonies possessed by the european nations in the west indies may be compared to those precious vineyards their whole produce falls short of the effectual demand of europe and can be disposed of to those who are willing to give more than what is sufficient to pay the whole rent profit and wages necessary for preparing and bringing it to market according to the rate at which they are commonly paid by any other produce in cochinchina the finest white sugar commonly sells for three piastres the quintal about thirteen shillings and sixpence of our money as we are told by mr poivre a very careful observer of the agriculture of that country what is there called the quintal weighs from a hundred and fifty to two hundred paris pounds or a hundred and seventyfive paris pounds at a medium which reduces the price of the hundred weight english to about eight shillings sterling not a fourth part of what is commonly paid for the brown or muskavada sugars imported from our colonies and not a sixth part of what is paid for the finest white sugar the greater part of the cultivated lands in cochinchina are employed in producing corn and rice the food of the great body of the people the respective prices of corn rice and sugar are there probably in the natural proportion or in that which naturally takes place in the different crops of the greater part of cultivated land and which recompenses the landlord and farmer as nearly as can be computed according to what is usually the original expense of improvement and the annual expense of cultivation but in our sugar colonies the price of sugar bears no such proportion to that of the produce of a rice or corn field either in europe or in america it is commonly said that a sugar planter expects that the rum and the molasses should defray the whole expense of his cultivation and that his sugar should be all clear profit if this be true for i pretend not to affirm it it is as if a corn farmer expected to defray the expense of his cultivation with the chaff and the straw and that the grain should be all clear profit we see frequently societies of merchants in london and other trading towns purchase waste lands in our sugar colonies which they expect to improve and cultivate with profit by means of factors and agents notwithstanding the great distance and the uncertain returns from the defective administration of justice in those countries nobody will attempt to improve and cultivate in the same manner the most fertile lands of scotland ireland or the corn provinces of north america though from the more exact administration of justice in these countries more regular returns might be expected  in virginia and maryland the cultivation of tobacco is preferred as more profitable to that of corn tobacco might be cultivated with advantage through the greater part of europe but in almost every part of europe it has become a principal subject of taxation and to collect a tax from every different farm in the country where this plant might happen to be cultivated would be more diffioult it has been supposed than to levy one upon its importation at the customhouse the cultivation of tobacco has upon this account been most absurdly prohibited through the greater part of europe which necessarily gives a sort of monopoly to the countries where it is allowed and as virginia and maryland produce the greatest quantity of it they share largely though with some competitors in the advantage of this monopoly the cultivation of tobacco however seems not to be so advantageous as that of sugar i have never even heard of any tobacco plantation that was improved and cultivated by the capital of merchants who resided in great britain and our tobacco colonies send us home no such wealthy planters as we see frequently arrive from our sugar islands though from the preference given in those colonies to the cultivation of tobacco above that of corn it would appear that the effectual demand of europe for tobacco is not completely supplied it probably is more nearly so than that for sugar and though the present price of tobacco is probably more than sufficient to pay the whole rent wages and profit necessary for preparing and bringing it to market according to the rate at which they are commonly paid in corn land it must not be so much more as the present price of sugar our tobacco planters accordingly have shown the same fear of the superabundance of tobacco which the proprietors of the old vineyards in france have of the superabundance of wine by act of assembly they have restrained its cultivation to six thousand plants supposed to yield a thousand weight of tobacco for every negro between sixteen and sixty years of age such a negro over and above this quantity of tobacco can manage they reckon four acres of indian corn to prevent the market from being overstocked too they have sometimes in plentiful years we are told by dr douglass i suspect he has been ill informed burnt a certain quantity of tobacco for every negro in the same manner as the dutch are said to do of spices if such violent methods are necessary to keep up the present price of tobacco the superior advantage of its culture over that of corn if it still has any will not probably be of long continuance  it is in this manner that the rent of the cultivated land of which the produce is human food regulates the rent of the greater part of other cultivated land no particular produce can long afford less because the land would immediately be turned to another use and if any particular produce commonly affords more it is because the quantity of land which can be fitted for it is too small to supply the effectual demand  in europe corn is the principal produce of land which serves immediately for human food except in particular situations therefore the rent of corn land regulates in europe that of all other cultivated land britain need envy neither the vineyards of france nor the olive plantations of italy except in particular situations the value of these is regulated by that of corn in which the fertility of britain is not much inferior to that of either of those two countries  if in any country the common and favorite vegetable food of the people should be drawn from a plant of which the most common land with the same or nearly the same culture produced a much greater quantity than the most fertile does of corn the rent of the landlord or the surplus quantity of food which would remain to him after paying the labor and replacing the stock of the farmer together with its ordinary profits would necessarily be much greater whatever was the rate at which labor was commonly maintained in that country this greater surplus could always maintain a greater quantity of it and consequently enable the landlord to purchase or command a greater quantity of it the real value of his rent his real power and authority his command of the necessaries and conveniences of life with which the labor of other people could supply him would necessarily be much greater  a rice field produces a much greater quantity of food than the most fertile corn field two crops in the year from thirty to sixty bushels each are said to be the ordinary produce of an acre though its cultivation therefore requires more labor a much greater surplus remains after maintaining all that labor in those rice countries therefore where rice is the common and favorite vegetable food of the people and where the cultivators are chiefly maintained with it a greater share of this greater surplus should belong to the landlord than in corn countries in carolina where the planters as in other british colonies are generally both farmers and landlords and where rent consequently is confounded with profit tho cultivation of rice is found to be more profitable than that of corn though their fields produce only one crop in the year and though from the prevalence of the customs of europe rice is not there the common and favorite vegetable food of the people  a good rice field is a bog at all seasons and at one season a bog covered with water it is unfit either for corn or pasture or vineyard or indeed for any other vegetable produce that is very useful to men and the lands which are fit for those purposes are not fit for rice even in the rice countries therefore the rent of rice lands cannot regulate the rent of the other cultivated land which can never be turned to that produce  the food produced by a field of potatoes is not inferior in quantity to that produced by a field of rice and much superior to what is produced by a field of wheat twelve thousand weight of potatoes from an acre of land is not a greater produce than two thousand weight of wheat the food or solid nourishment indeed which can be drawn from each of those two plants is not altogether in proportion to their weight on account of the watery nature of potatoes allowing however half the weight of this root to go to water a very large allowance such an acre of potatoes will still produce six thousand weight of solid nourishment three times the quantity produced by the acre of wheat an acre of potatoes is cultivated with less expense than an acre of wheat the fallow which generally preceeds the sowing of wheat more than compensating the hoeing and other extraordinary culture which is always given to potatoes should this root ever become in any part of europe like rice in some rice countries the common and favorite vegetable food of the people so as to occupy the same proportion of the lands in tillage which wheat and other sorts of grain for human food do at present the same quantity of cultivated land would maintain a much greater number of people and the laborers being generally fed with potatoes a greater surplus would remain after replacing all the stock and maintaining all the labor employed in cultivation a greater share of this surplus too would belong to the landlord population would increase and rents would rise much beyond what they are at present  the land which is fit for potatoes is fit for almost every other useful vegetable if they occupied the same proportion of cultivated land which corn does at present they would regulate in the same manner the rent of the greater part of other cultivated land  in some parts of lancashire it is pretended i have been told that bread of oatmeal is a heartier food for laboring people than wheaten bread and i have frequently heard the same doctrine held in scotland i am however somewhat doubtful of the truth of it the common people in scotland who are fed with oatmeal are in general neither so strong nor so handsome as the same rank of people in england who are fed with wheaten bread they neither work so well nor look so well and as there is not the same difference between the people of fashion in the two countries experience would seem to show that the food of the common people in scotland is not so suitable to the human constitution as that of their neighbors of the same rank in england but it seems to be otherwise with potatoes the chairmen porters and coalheavers in london and those unfortunate women who live by prostitution the strongest men and the most beautiful women perhaps in the british dominions are said to be the greater part of them from the lowest rank of people in ireland who are generally fed with this root no food can afford a more decisive proof of its nourishing quality or of its being peculiarly suitable to the health of the human constitution  it is difficult to preserve potatoes through the year and impossible to store them like corn for two or three years together the fear of not being able to sell them before they rot discourages their cultivation and is perhaps the chief obstacle to their ever becoming in any great country like bread the principal vegetable food of all the different ranks of the people  part ii of the produce of land which sometimes does and sometimes does not afford rent human food seems to be the only produce of land which always and necessarily affords some rent to the landlord other sorts of produce sometimes may and sometimes may not according to different circumstances  after food clothing and lodging are the two great wants of mankind  land in its original rude state can afford the materials of clothing and lodging to a much greater number of people than it can feed in its improved state it can sometimes feed a greater number of people than it can supply with those materials at least in the way in which they require them and are willing to pay for them in the one state therefore there is always a superabundance of those materials which are frequently upon that account of little or no value in the other there is often a scarcity which necessarily augments their value in the one state a great part of them is thrown away as useless and the price of what is used is considered as equal only to the labor and expense of fitting it for use and can therefore afford no rent to the landlord in the other they are all made use of and there is frequently a demand for more than can be had somebody is always willing to give more for every part of them than what is sufficient to pay the expense of bringing them to market their price therefore can always afford some rent to the landlord  the skins of the larger animals were the original materials of clothing among nations of hunters and shepherds therefore whose food consists chiefly in the flesh of those animals every man by providing himself with food provides himself with the materials of more clothing than he can wear if there was no foreign commerce the greater part of them would be thrown away as things of no value this was probably the case among the hunting nations of north america before their country was discovered by the europeans with whom they now exchange their surplus peltry for blankets firearms and brandy which gives it some value in the present commercial state of the known world the most barbarous nations i believe among whom land property is established have some foreign commerce of this kind and find among their wealthier neighbors such a demand for all the materials of clothing which their land produces and which can neither be wrought up nor consumed at home as raises their price above what it costs to send them thither it affords therefore some rent to the landlord when the greater part of the highland cattle were consumed on their own hills the exportation of their hides made the most considerable article of the commerce of that country and what they were exchanged for afforded some addition to the rent of the highland estates the wool of england which in old times could neither be consumed nor wrought up at home found a market in the then wealthier and more industrious country of flanders and its price afforded something to the rent of the land which produced it in countries not better cultivated than england was then or than the highlands of scotland are now and which had no foreign commerce the materials of clothing would evidently be so superabundant that a great part of them would be thrown away as useless and no part could afford any rent to the landlord  the materials of lodging cannot always be transported to so great a distance as those of clothing and do not so readily become an object of foreign commerce when they are superabundant in the country which produces them it frequently happens even in the present commercial state of the world that they are of no value to the landlord a good stone quarry in the neighborhood of london would afford a considerable rent in many parts of scotland and wales it affords none barren timber for building is of great value in a populous and wellcultivated country and the land which produces it affords a considerable rent but in many parts of north america the landlord would be much obliged to any body who would carry away the greater part of his large trees in some parts of the highlands of scotland the bark is the only part of the wood which for want of roads and watercarriage can be sent to market the timber is left to rot upon the ground when the materials of lodging are so superabundant the part made use of is worth only the labor and expense of fitting it for that use it affords no rent to the landlord who generally grants the use of it to whoever takes the trouble of asking it the demand of wealthier nations however sometimes enables him to get a rent for it the paving of the streets of london has enabled the owners of some barren rocks on the coast of scotland to draw a rent from what never afforded any before the woods of norway and of the coasts of the baltic find a market in many parts of great britain which they could not find at home and thereby afford some rent to their proprietors  countries are populous not in proportion to the number of people whom their produce can cloth and lodge but in proportion to that of those whom it can feed when food is provided it is easy to find the necessary clothing and lodging but though these are at hand it may often be difficult to find food in some parts even of the british dominions what is called a house may be built by one days labor of one man the simplest species of clothing the skins of animals requires somewhat more labor to dress and prepare them for use they do not however require a great deal among savage and barbarous nations a hundredth or little more than a hundredth part of the labor of the whole year will be sufficient to provide them with such clothing and lodging as satisfy the greater part of the people all the other ninetynine parts are frequently no more than enough to provide them with food  but when by the improvement and cultivation of land the labor of one family can provide food for two the labor of half the society becomes sufficient to provide food for the whole the other half therefore or at least the greater part of them can be employed in providing other things or in satisfying the other wants and fancies of mankind clothing and lodging household furniture and what is called equipage are the principal objects of the greater part of those wants and fancies the rich man consumes no more food than his poor neighbor in quality it may be very different and to select and prepare it may require more labor and art but in quantity it is very nearly the same but compare the spacious palace and great wardrobe of the one with the hovel and the few rags of the other and you will be sensible that the difference between their clothing lodging and household furniture is almost as great in quantity as it is in quality the desire of food is limited in every man by the narrow capacity of the human stomach but the desire of the conveniences and ornaments of building dress equipage and household furniture seems to have no limit or certain boundary those therefore who have the command of more food than they themselves can consume are always willing to exchange the surplus or what is the same thing the price of it for gratifications of this other kind what is over and above satisfying the limited desire is given for the amusement of those desires which cannot be satisfied but seem to be altogether endless the poor in order to obtain food exert themseves to gratify those fancies of the rich and to obtain it more certainly they vie with one another in the cheapness and perfection of their work the number of workmen increases with the increasing quantity of food or with the growing improvement and cultivation of the lands and as the nature of their business admits of the utmost subdivisions of labor the quantity of materials which they can work up increases in a much greater proportion than their numbers hence arises a demand for every sort of material which human invention can employ either usefully or ornamentally in building dress equipage or household furniture for the fossils and minerals contained in the bowels of the earth the precious metals and the precious stones  food is in this manner not only the original source of rent but every other part of the produce of land which afterward affords rent derives that part of its value from the improvement of the powers of labor in producing food by means of the improvement and cultivation of land  those other parts of the produce of land however which afterward afford rent do not afford it always even in improved and cultivated countries the demand for them is not always such as to afford a greater price than what is sufficient to pay the labor and replace together with its ordinary profits the stock which must be employed in bringing them to market whether it is or is not such depends upon different circumstances  whether a coalmine for example can afford any rent depends partly upon its fertility and partly upon its situation  a mine of any kind may be said to be either fertile or barren according as the quantity of mineral which can be brought from it by a certain quantity of labor is greater or less than what can be brought by an equal quantity from the greater part of other mines of the same kind  some coalmines advantageously situated cannot be wrought on account of their barrenness the produce does not pay the expense they can afford neither profit nor rent  there are some of which the produce is barely sufficient to pay the labor and replace together with its ordinary profits the stock employed in working them they afford some profit to the undertaker of the work but no rent to the landlord they can be wrought advantageously by nobody but the landlord who being himself undertaker of the work gets the ordinary profit of the capital which he employs in it many coalmines in scotland are wrought in this manner and can be wrought in no other the landlord will allow no body else to work them without paying some rent and no body can afford to pay any  other coalmines in the same country sufficiently fertile cannot be wrought on account of their situation a quantity of mineral sufficient to defray the expense of working could be brought from the mine by the ordinary or even less than the ordinary quantity of labor but in an inland country thinly inhabited and without either good roads or watercarriage this quantity could not be sold  coals are a less agreeable fuel than wood they are said too to be less wholesome the expense of coals therefore at the place where they are consumed must generally be somewhat less than that of wood  the price of wood again varies with the state of agriculture nearly in the same manner and exactly for the same reason as the price of cattle in its rude beginnings the greater part of every country is covered with wood which is then a mere encumbrance of no value to the landlord who would gladly give it to any body for the cutting as agriculture advances the woods are partly cleared by the progress of tillage and partly go to decay in consequence of the increased number of cattle these though they do not increase in the same proportion as corn which is altogether the acquisition of human industry yet multiply under the care and protection of men who store up in the season of plenty what may maintain them in that of scarcity who through the whole year furnish them with a greater quantity of food than uncultivated nature provides for them and who by destroying and extirpating their enemies secure them in the free enjoyment of all that she provides numerous herds of cattle when allowed to wander through the woods though they do not destroy the old trees hinder any young ones from coming up so that in the course of a century or two the whole forest goes to ruin the scarcity of wood then raises its price it affords a good rent and the landlord sometimes finds that he can scarce employ his best lands more advantageously than in growing barren timber of which the greatness of the profit often compensates the lateness of the returns this seems in the present times to be nearly the state of things in several parts of great britain where the profit of planting is found to be equal to that of either corn or pasture the advantage which the landlord derives from planting can no where exceed at least for any considerable time the rent which these could afford him and in an inland country which is highly cultivated it will frequently not fall much short of this rent upon the seacoast of a well improved country indeed if it can conveniently get coals for fuel it may sometimes be cheaper to bring barren timber for building from less cultivated foreign countries than to raise it at home in the new town of edinburgh built within these few years there is not perhaps a single stick of scotch timber  whatever may be the price of wood if that of coals is such that the expense of a coalfire is nearly equal to that of a wood one we may be assured that at that place and in these circumstances the price of coals is as high as it can be it seems to be so in some of the inland parts of england particularly in oxfordshire where it is usual even in the fires of the common people to mix coals and wood together and where the difference in the expense of those two sorts of fuel cannot therefore be very great  coals in the coal countries are every where much below this highest price if they were not they could not bear the expense of a distant carriage either by land or by water a small quantity only could be sold and the coal masters and coal proprietors find it more for their interest to sell a great quantity at a price somewhat above the lowest than a small quantity at the highest the most fertile coalmine too regulates the price of coals at all the other mines in its neighborhood both the proprietor and the undertaker of the work find the one that he can get a greater rent the other that he can get a greater profit by somewhat underselling all their neighbors their neighbors are soon obliged to sell at the same price though they cannot so well afford it and though it always diminishes and sometimes takes away altogether both their rent and their profit some works are abandoned altogether others can afford no rent and can be wrought only by the proprietor  the lowest price at which coals can be sold for any considerable time is like that of all other commodities the price which is barely sufficient to replace together with its ordinary profits the stock which must be employed in bringing them to market at a coalmine for which the landlord can get no rent but which he must either work himself or let it alone altogether the price of coals must generally be nearly about this price  rent even where coals afford one has generally a smaller share in their price than in that of most other parts of the rude produce of land the rent of an estate above ground commonly amounts to what is supposed to be a third of the gross produce and it is generally a rent certain and independent of the occasional variations in the crop in coalmines a fifth of the gross produce is a very great rent a tenth the common rent and it is seldom a rent certain but depends upon the occasional variations in the produce these are so great that in a country where thirty years purchase is considered as a moderate price for the property of a landed estate ten years purchase is regarded as a good price for that of a coalmine  the value of a coalmine to the proprietor depends frequently as much upon its situation as upon its fertility that of a metallic mine depends more upon its fertility and less upon its situation the coarse and still more the precious metals when separated from the ore are so valuable that they can generally bear the expense of a very long land and of the most distant seacarriage their market is not confined to the countries in the neighborhood of the mine but extends to the whole world the copper of japan makes an article in the commerce of europe the iron of spain in that of chili and peru the silver of peru finds its way not only to europe but from europe to china  the price of coals in westmoreland or shropshire can have little effect on their price at newcastle and their price in the lionnois can have none at all the productions of such distant coalmines can never be brought into competition with one another but the productions of the most distant metallic mines frequently may and in fact commonly are the price therefore of the coarse and still more that of the precious metals at the most fertile mines in the world must necessarily more or less affect their price at every other in it the price of copper in japan must have some influence upon its price at the copper mines in europe the price of silver in peru or the quantity either of labor or of other goods which it will purchase there must have some influence on its price not only at the silver mines of europe but at those of china after the discovery of the mines of peru the silver mines of europe were the greater part of them abandoned the value of silver was so much reduced that their produce could no longer pay the expense of working them or replace with a profit the food clothes lodging and other necessaries which were consumed in that operation this was the case too with the mines of cuba and st domingo and even with the ancient mines of peru after the discovery of those of potosi  the price of every metal at every mine therefore being regulated in some measure by its price at the most fertile mine in the world that is actually wrought it can at the greater part of mines do very little more than pay the expense of working and can seldom afford a very high rent to the landlord rent accordingly seems at the greater part of mines to have but a small share in the price of the coarse and a still smaller in that of the precious metals labor and profit make up the greater part of both  a sixth part of the gross produce may be reckoned the average rent of the tin mines of cornwall the most fertile that are known in the world as we are told by the reverend mr borlace vicewarden of the stannaries some he says afford more and some do not afford so much a sixth part of the gross produce is the rent too of several very fertile lead mines in scotland  in the silver mines of peru we are told by frezier and ulloa the proprietor frequently exacts no other acknowledgement from the undertaker of the mine but that he will grind the ore at his mill paying him the ordinary multure or price of grinding the tax of the king of spain indeed amounts to onefifth of the standard silver which may be considered as the real rent of the greater part of the silver mines of peru the richest which are known in the world if there was no tax this fifth would naturally belong to the landlord and many mines might be wrought which cannot be wrought at present because they cannot afford this tax the tax of the duke of cornwall upon tin is supposed to amount to more than five per cent or one twentieth part of the value and whatever may be his proportion it would naturally too belong to the proprietor of the mine if tin was duty free but if you add onetwentieth to one sixth you will find that the whole average rent of the tin mines of cornwall is to the whole average rent of the silver mines of peru as thirteen to twelve the high tax upon silver too gives much greater temptation to smuggling than the low tax upon tin and smuggling must be much easier in the precious than in the bulky commodity the tax of the king of spain accordingly is said to be very ill paid and that of the duke of cornwall very well rent therefore it is probable makes a greater part of the price of tin at the most fertile tin mines than it does of silver at the most fertile silver mines in the world after replacing the stock employed in working those different mines together with its ordinary profits the residue which remains to the proprietor is greater it seems in the coarse than in the precious metal  neither are the profits of the undertakers of silver mines commonly very great in peru the same most respectable and well informed authors acquaint us that when any person undertakes to work a new mine in peru he is universally looked upon as a man destined to bankruptcy and ruin and is upon that account shunned and avoided by every body mining it seems is considered there in the same light as here as a lottery in which the prizes do not compensate the blanks though the greatness of some tempts many adventurers to throw away their fortunes in such unprosperous projects  as the sovereign however derives a considerable part of his revenue from the produce of silver mines the law in peru gives every possible encouragement to the discovery and working of new ones whoever discovers a new mine is entitled to measure off two hundred and fortysix feet in length according to what he supposes to be the direction of the vein and half as much in breadth he becomes proprietor of this portion of the mine and can work it without paying any acknowledgement to the landlord the interest of the duke of cornwall has given occasion to a regulation nearly of the same kind in that ancient duchy in waste and uninclosed lands any person who discovers a tin mine may mark out its limits to a certain extent which is called bounding a mine the bounder becomes the real proprietor of the mine and may either work it himself or give it in lease to another without the consent of the owner of the land to whom however a very small acknowledgement must be paid upon working it in both regulations the sacred rights of private property are sacrificed to the supposed interests of public revenue  the same encouragement is given in peru to the discovery and working of new gold mines and in gold the kings tax amounts only to a twentieth part of the standard metal it was once a fifth as in silver but it was found the work could not bear it if it is rare however say the same authors frezier and ulloa to find a person who has made his fortune by a silver it is still much rarer to find one who has done so by a gold mine this twentieth part seems to be the whole rent which is paid by the greater part of the gold mines in chili and peru gold too is much more liable to be smuggled than even silver not only on account of the superior value of the metal in proportion to its bulk but on account of the peculiar way in which nature produces it silver is very seldom found virgin but like most other metals is generally mineralized with some other body from which it is impossible to separate it in such quantities as will pay for the expense but by a very laborious and tedious operation which cannot well be carried on but in workhouses erected for the purpose and therefore exposed to the inspection of the kings officers gold on the contrary is almost always found virgin it is sometimes found in pieces of some bulk and even when mixed in small and almost insensible particles with sand earth and other extraneous bodies it can be separated from them by a very short and simple operation which can be carried on in any private house by any body who is possessed of a small quantity of mercury if the kings tax therefore is but ill paid upon silver it is likely to be much worse paid upon gold and rent must make a much smaller part of the price of gold than even of that of silver  the lowest price at which the precious metals can be sold or the smallest quantity of other goods for which they can be exchanged during any considerable time is regulated by the same principles which fix the lowest ordinary price of all other goods the stock which must commonly be employed the food clothes and lodging which must commonly be consumed in bringing them from the mine to the market determine it it must at least be sufficient to replace that stock with the ordinary profits  their highest price however seems not to be necessarily determined by any thing but the actual scarcity or plenty of those metals themselves it is not determined by that of any other commodity in the same manner as the price of coals is by that of wood beyond which no scarcity can ever raise it increase the scarcity of gold to a certain degree and the smallest bit of it may become more precious than a diamond and exchange for a greater quantity of other goods  the demand for those metals arises partly from their utility and partly from their beauty if you except iron they are more useful than perhaps any other metal as they are less liable to rust and impurity they can more easily be kept clean and the utensils either of the table or the kitchen are often upon that account more agreeable when made of them a silver boiler is more cleanly than a lead copper or tin one and the same quality would render a gold boiler still better than a silver one their principal merit however arises from their beauty which renders them peculiarly fit for the ornaments of dress and furniture no paint or dye can give so splendid a color as gilding the merit of their beauty is greatly enhanced by their scarcity with the greater part of rich people the chief enjoyment of riches consists in the parade of riches which in their eyes is never so complete as when they appear to possess those decisive marks of opulence which nobody can possess but themselves in their eyes the merit of an object which is in any degree either useful or beautiful is greatly enhanced by its scarcity or by the great labor which it requires to collect any considerable quantity of it a labor which no body can afford to pay but themselves such objects they are willing to purchase at a higher price than things much more beautiful and useful but more common these qualities of utility beauty and scarcity are the original foundation of the high price of those metals or of the great quantity of other goods for which they can every where be exchanged this value was antecedent to and independent of their being employed as coin and was the quality which fitted them for that employment that employment however by occasioning a new demand and by diminishing the quantity which could be employed in any other way may have afterward contributed to keep up or increase their value  the demand for the precious stones arises altogether from their beauty they are of no use but as ornaments and the merit of their beauty is greatly enhanced by their scarcity or by the difficulty and expense of getting them from the mine wages and profit accordingly make up upon most occasions almost the whole of their high price rent comes in but for a very small share frequently for no share and the most fertile mines only afford any considerable rent when tavernier a jeweller visited the diamond mines of golconda and visiapour he was informed that the sovereign of the country for whose benefit they were wrought had ordered all of them to be shut up except those which yielded the largest and finest stones the others it seems were to the proprietor not worth the working  as the price both of the precious metals and of the precious stones is regulated all over the world by their price at the most fertile mine in it the rent which a mine of either can afford to its proprietor is in proportion not to its absolute but to what may be called its relative fertility or to its superiority over other mines of the same kind if new mines were discovered as much superior to those of potosi as they were superior to those of europe the value of silver might be so much degraded as to render even the mines of potosi not worth the working before the discovery of the spanish west indies the most fertile mines in europe may have afforded as great a rent to their proprietor as the richest mines in peru do at present though the quantity of silver was much less it might have exchanged for an equal quantity of other goods and the proprietors share might have enabled him to purchase or command an equal quantity either of labor or of commodities the value both of the produce and of the rent the real revenue which they afforded both to the public and to the proprietor might have been the same  the most abundant mines either of the precious metals or of the precious stones could add little to the wealth of the world a produce of which the value is principally derived from its scarcity is necessarily degraded by its abundance a service of plate and the other frivolous ornaments of dress and furniture could be purchased for a smaller quantity of labor or for a smaller quantity of commodities and in this would consist the sole advantage which the world could derive from that abundance  it is otherwise in estates above ground the value both of their produce and of their rent is in proportion to their absolute and not to their relative fertility the land which produces a certain quantity of food clothes and lodging can always feed cloth and lodge a certain number of people and whatever may be the proportion of the landlord it will always give him a proportionable command of the labor of those people and of the commodities with which that labor can supply him the value of the most barren lands is not diminished by the neighborhood of the most fertile on the contrary it is generally increased by it the great number of people maintained by the fertile lands afford a market to many parts of the produce of the barren which they could never have found among those whom their own produce could maintain  whatever increases the fertility of land in producing food increases not only the value of the lands upon which the improvement is bestowed but contributes likewise to increase that of many other lands by creating a new demand for their produce that abundance of food of which in consequence of the improvement of land many people have the disposal beyond what they themselves can consume is the great cause of the demand both for the precious metals and the precious stones as well as for every other convenience and ornament of dress lodging household furniture and equipage food not only constitutes the principal part of the riches of the world but it is the abundance of food which gives the principal part of their value to many other sorts of riches the poor inhabitants of cuba and st domingo when they were first discovered by the spaniards used to wear little bits of gold as ornaments in their hair and other parts of their dress they seemed to value them as we would do any little pebbles of somewhat more than ordinary beauty and to consider them as just worth the picking up but not worth the refusing to any body who asked them they gave them to their new guests at the first request without seeming to think that they had made them any very valuable present they were astonished to observe the rage of the spaniards to obtain them and had no notion that there could any where be a country in which many people had the disposal of so great a superfluity of food so scanty always among themselves that for a very small quantity of those glittering baubles they would willingly give as much as might maintain a whole family for many years could they have been made to understand this the passion of the spaniards would not have surprised them  part iii of the variations in the proportion between the respective values of that sort of produce which always affords rent and of that which sometimes does and sometimes does not afford rent the increasing abundance of food in consequence of increasing improvement and cultivation must necessarily increase the demand for every part of the produce of land which is not food and which can be applied either to use or to ornament in the whole progress of improvement it might therefore be expected there should be only one variation in the comparative values of those two different sorts of produce the value of that sort which sometimes does and sometimes does not afford rent should constantly rise in proportion to that which always affords some rent as art and industry advance the materials of clothing and lodging the useful fossils and minerals of the earth the precious metals and the precious stones should gradually come to be more and more in demand should gradually exchange for a greater and a greater quantity of food or in other words should gradually become dearer and dearer this accordingly has been the case with most of these things upon most occasions and would have been the case with all of them upon all occasions if particular accidents had not upon some occasions increased the supply of some of them in a still greater proportion than the demand  the value of a freestone quarry for example will necessarily increase with the increasing improvement and population of the country round about it especially if it should be the only one in the neighborhood but the value of a silver mine even though there should not be another within a thousand miles of it will not necessarily increase with the improvement of the country in which it is situated the market for the produce of a freestone quarry can seldom extend more than a few miles round about it and the demand must generally be in proportion to the improvement and population of that small district but the market for the produce of a silver mine may extend over the whole known world unless the world in general therefore be advancing in improvement and population the demand for silver might not be at all increased by the improvement even of a large country in the neighborhood of the mine even though the world in general were improving yet if in the course of its improvement new mines should be discovered much more fertile than any which had been known before though the demand for silver would necessarily increase yet the supply might increase in so much a greater proportion that the real price of that metal might gradually fall that is any given quantity a pound weight of it for example might gradually purchase or command a smaller and a smaller quantity of labor or exchange for a smaller and a smaller quantity of corn the principal part of the subsistence of the labourer  the great market for silver is the commercial and civilzed part of the world  if by the general progress of improvement the demand of this market should increase while at the same time the supply did not increase in the same proportion the value of silver would gradually rise in proportion to that of corn any given quantity of silver would exchange for a greater and a greater quantity of corn or in other words the average money price of corn would gradually become cheaper and cheaper  if on the contrary the supply by some accident should increase for many years together in a greater proportion than the demand that metal would gradually become cheaper and cheaper or in other words the average money price of corn would in spite of all improvements gradually become dearer and dearer  but if on the other hand the supply of that metal should increase nearly in the same proportion as the demand it would continue to purchase or exchange for nearly the same quantity of corn and the average money price of corn would in spite of all improvements continue very nearly the same  these three seem to exhaust all the possible combinations of events which can happen in the progress of improvement and during the course of the four centuries preceding the present if we may judge by what has happened both in france and great britain each of those three different combinations seems to have taken place in the european market and nearly in the same order too in which i have here set them down  digression concerning the variations in the value of silver during the course of the four last centuries first period in    0 and for some time before the average price of the quarter of wheat in england seems not to have been estimated lower than four ounces of silver towerweight equal to about twenty shillings of our present money from this price it seems to have fallen gradually to two ounces of silver equal to about ten shillings of our present money the price at which we find it estimated in the beginning of the sixteenth century and at which it seems to have continued to be estimated till about    0  in    0 being the   th of edward iii was enacted what is called the statute of laborers in the preamble it complains much of the insolence of servants who endeavored to raise their wages upon their masters it therefore ordains that all servants and laborers should for the future be contented with the same wages and liveries liveries in those times signified not only clothes but provisions which they had been accustomed to receive in the  0th year of the king and the four preceding years that upon this account their livery wheat should no where be estimated higher than tenpence a bushel and that it should always be in the option of the master to deliver them either the wheat or the money tenpence a bushel therefore had in the   th of edward iii been reckoned a very moderate price of wheat since it required a particular statute to oblige servants to accept of it in exchange for their usual livery of provisions and it had been reckoned a reasonable price ten years before that or in the   th year of the king the term to which the statute refers but in the   th year of edward iii tenpence contained about half an ounce of silver towerweight and was nearly equal to half a crown of our present money four ounces of silver towerweight therefore equal to six shillings and eightpence of the money of those times and to near twenty shillings of that of the present must have been reckoned a moderate price for the quarter of eight bushels  this statute is surely a better evidence of what was reckoned in those times a moderate price of grain than the prices of some particular years which have generally been recorded by historians and other writers on account of their extraordinary dearness or cheapness and from which therefore it is difficult to form any judgment concerning what may have been the ordinary price there are besides other reasons for believing that in the beginning of the fourteenth century and for some time before the common price of wheat was not less than four ounces of silver the quarter and that of other grain in proportion  in   0  ralph de born prior of st augustines canterbury gave a feast upon his installation day of which william thorn has preserved not only the bill of fare but the prices of many particulars in that feast were consumed  st fiftythree quarters of wheat which cost nineteen pounds or seven shillings and twopence a quarter equal to about one and twenty shillings and sixpence of our present money  dly fiftyeight quarters of malt which cost seventeen pounds ten shillings or six shillings a quarter equal to about eighteen shillings of our present money  dly twenty quarters of oats which cost four pounds or four shillings a quarter equal to about twelve shillings of our present money the prices of malt and oats seem here to be higher than their ordinary proportion to the price of wheat  these prices are not recorded on account of their extraordinary dearness or cheapness but are mentioned accidentally as the prices actually paid for large quantities of grain consumed at a feast which was famous for its magnificence  in      being the   st of henry iii was revived an ancient statute called the assize of bread and ale which the king says in the preamble had been made in the times of his progenitors sometime kings of england it is probably therefore as old at least as the time of his grandfather henry ii and may have been as old as the conquest it regulates the price of bread according as the prices of wheat may happen to be from one shilling to twenty shillings the quarter of the money of those times but statutes of this kind are generally presumed to provide with equal care for all deviations from the middle price for those below it as well as for those above it ten shillings therefore containing six ounces of silver towerweight and equal to about thirty shillings of our present money must upon this supposition have been reckoned the middle price of the quarter of wheat when this statute was first enacted and must have continued to be so in the   st of henry iii we cannot therefore be very far wrong in supposing that the middle price was not less than onethird of the highest price at which this statute regulates the price of bread or than six shillings and eightpence of the money of those times containing four ounces of silver towerweight  from these different facts therefore we seem to have some reason to conclude that about the middle of the fourteenth century and for a considerable time before the average or ordinary price of the quarter of wheat was not supposed to be less than four ounces of silver towerweight  from about the middle of the fourteenth to the beginning of the sixteenth century what was reckoned the reasonable and moderate that is the ordinary or average price of wheat seems to have sunk gradually to about onehalf of this price so as at last to have fallen to about two ounces of silver towerweight equal to about ten shillings of our present money it continued to be estimated at this price till about    0  in the household book of henry the fifth earl of northumberland drawn up in      there are two different estimations of wheat in one of them it is computed at six shillings and eightpence the quarter in the other at five shillings and eightpence only in      six shillings and eightpence contained only two ounces of silver towerweight and were equal to about ten shillings of our present money  from the   th of edward iii to the beginning of the reign of elizabeth during the space of more than two hundred years six shillings and eightpence it appears from several different statutes had continued to be considered as what is called the moderate and reasonable that is the ordinary or average price of wheat the quantity of silver however contained in that nominal sum was during the course of this period continually diminishing in consequence of some alterations which were made in the coin but the increase of the value of silver had it seems so far compensated the diminution of the quantity of it contained in the same nominal sum that the legislature did not think it worth while to attend to this circumstance  thus in      it was enacted that wheat might be exported without a license when the price was so low as six shillings and eightpence and in      it was enacted that no wheat should be imported if the price was not above six shillings and eightpence the quarter the legislature had imagined that when the price was so low there could be no inconveniency in exportation but that when it rose higher it became prudent to allow of importation six shillings and eightpence therefore containing about the same quantity of silver as thirteen shillings and fourpence of our present money onethird part less than the same nominal sum contained in the time of edward iii had in those times been considered as what is called the moderate and reasonable price of wheat  in      by the  st and  d of philip and mary and in      by the  st of elizabeth the exportation of wheat was in the same manner prohibited whenever the price of the quarter should exceed six shillings and eightpence which did not then contain two penny worth more silver than the same nominal sum does at present but it had soon been found that to restrain the exportation of wheat till the price was so very low was in reality to prohibit it altogether in      therefore by the  th of elizabeth the exportation of wheat was allowed from certain ports whenever the price of the quarter should not exceed ten shillings containing nearly the same quantity of silver as the like nominal sum does at present this price had at this time therefore been considered as what is called the moderate and reasonable price of wheat it agrees nearly with the estimation of the northumberland book in       that in france the average price of grain was in the same manner much lower in the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth century than in the two centuries preceding has been observed both by mr dupre de st maur and by the elegant author of the essay on the police of grain its price during the same period had probably sunk in the same manner through the greater part of europe  this rise in the value of silver in proportion to that of corn may either have been owing altogether to the increase of the demand for that metal in consequence of increasing improvement and cultivation the supply in the mean time continuing the same as before or the demand continuing the same as before it may have been owing altogether to the gradual diminution of the supply the greater part of the mines which were then known in the world being much exhausted and consequently the expense of working them much increased or it may have been owing partly to the one and partly to the other of those two circumstances in the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth centuries the greater part of europe was approaching toward a more settled form of government than it had enjoyed for several ages before the increase of security would naturally increase industry and improvement and the demand for the precious metals as well as for every other luxury and ornament would naturally increase with the increase of riches a greater annual produce would require a greater quantity of coin to circulate it and a greater number of rich people would require a greater quantity of plate and other ornaments of silver it is natural to suppose too that the greater part of the mines which then supplied the european market with silver might be a good deal exhausted and have become more expensive in the working they had been wrought many of them from the time of the romans  it has been the opinion however of the greater part of those who have written upon the prices of commodities in ancient times that from the conquest perhaps from the invasion of julius caesar till the discovery of the mines of america the value of silver was continually diminishing this opinion they seem to have been led into partly by the observations which they had occasion to make upon the prices both of corn and of some other parts of the rude produce of land and partly by the popular notion that as the quantity of silver naturally increases in every country with the increase of wealth so its value diminishes as its quantity increases  in their observations upon the prices of corn three different circumstances seem frequently to have misled them  first in ancient times almost all rents were paid in kind in a certain quantity of corn cattle poultry etc it sometimes happened however that the landlord would stipulate with the tenant that he should be at liberty to demand either the annual payment in kind or a certain sum of money instead of it the price at which the payment in kind was in this manner exchanged for a certain sum of money is in scotland called the conversion price as the option is always in the landlord to take either the substance or the price it is necessary for the safety of the tenant that the conversion price should rather be below than above the average market price in many places accordingly it is not much above onehalf of this price through the greater part of scotland this custom still continues with regard to poultry and in some places with regard to cattle it might probably have continued to take place too with regard to corn had not the institution of the public fiars put an end to it these are annual valuations according to the judgment of an assize of the average price of all the different sorts of grain and of all the different qualities of each according to the actual market price in every different county this institution rendered it sufficiently safe for the tenant and much more convenient for the landlord to convert as they call it the corn rent at the price of the fiars of each year rather than at any certain fixed price but the writers who have collected the prices of corn in ancient times seem frequently to have mistaken what is called in scotland the conversion price for the actual market price fleetwood acknowledges upon one occasion that he had made this mistake as he wrote his book however for a particular purpose he does not think proper to make this acknowledgement till after transcribing this conversion price fifteen times the price is eight shillings the quarter of wheat this sum in      the year at which he begins with it contained the same quantity of silver as sixteen shillings of our present money but in      the year at which he ends with it it contained no more than the same nominal sum does at present  secondly they have been misled by the slovenly manner in which some ancient statutes of assize had been sometimes transcribed by lazy copiers and sometimes perhaps actually composed by the legislature  the ancient statutes of assize seem to have begun always with determining what ought to be the price of bread and ale when the price of wheat and barley were at the lowest and to have proceeded gradually to determine what it ought to be according as the prices of those two sorts of grain should gradually rise above this lowest price but the transcribers of those statutes seem frequently to have though it sufficient to copy the regulation as far as the three or four first and lowest prices saving in this manner their own labor and judging i suppose that this was enough to show what proportion ought to be observed in all higher prices  thus in the assize of bread and ale of the   st of henry iii the price of bread was regulated according to the different prices of wheat from one shilling to twenty shillings the quarter of the money of those times but in the manuscripts from which all the different editions of the statutes preceding that of mr ruffhead were printed the copiers had never transcribed this regulation beyond the price of twelve shillings several writers therefore being misled by this faulty transcription very naturally concluded that the middle price or six shillings the quarter equal to about eighteen shillings of our present money was the ordinary or average price of wheat at that time  in the statute of tumbrel and pillory enacted nearly about the same time the price of ale is regulated according to every sixpence rise in the price of barley from two shillings to four shillings the quarter that four shillings however was not considered as the highest price to which barley might frequently rise in those times and that these prices were only given as an example of the proportion which ought to be observed in all other prices whether higher or lower we may infer from the last words of the statute et sic deinceps crescetur vel diminuetur per sex denarios the expression is very slovenly but the meaning is plain enough that the price of ale is in this manner to be increased or diminished according to every sixpence rise or fall in the price of barley in the composition of this statute the legislature itself seems to have been as negligent as the copiers were in the transcription of the other  in an ancient manuscript of the regiam majestatem an old scotch law book there is a statute of assize in which the price of bread is regulated according to all the different prices of wheat from tenpence to three shillings the scotch boll equal to about half an english quarter three shillings scotch at the time when this assize is supposed to have been enacted were equal to about nine shillings sterling of our present money mr rudiman seems to conclude from this that three shillings was the highest price to which wheat ever rose in those times and that tenpence a shilling or at most two shillings were the ordinary prices upon consulting the manuscript however it appears evidently that all these prices are only set down as examples of the proportion which ought to be observed between the respective prices of wheat and bread the last words of the statute are reliqua judicabis secundum praescripta habendo respectum ad pretium bladi you shall judge of the remaining cases according to what is above written having a respect to the price of corn  thirdly they seem to have been misled too by the very low price at which wheat was sometimes sold in very ancient times and to have imagined that as its lowest price was then much lower than in later times its ordinary price must likewise have been much lower they might have found however that in those ancient times its highest price was fully as much above as its lowest price was below any thing that had ever been known in later times thus in    0 fleetwood gives us two prices of the quarter of wheat the one is four pounds sixteen shillings of the money of those times equal to fourteen pounds eight shillings of that of the present the other is six pounds eight shillings equal to nineteen pounds four shillings of our present money no price can be found in the end of the fifteenth or beginning of the sixteenth century which approaches to the extravagance of these the price of corn though at all times liable to variations varies most in those turbulent and disorderly societies in which the interruption of all commerce and communication hinders the plenty of one part of the country from relieving the scarcity of another in the disorderly state of england under the plantagenets who governed it from about the middle of the twelfth till toward the end of the fifteenth century one district might be in plenty while another at no great distance by having its crop destroyed either by some accident of the seasons or by the incursion of some neighboring baron might be suffering all the horrors of a famine and yet if the lands of some hostile lord were interposed between them the one might not be able to give the least assistance to the other under the vigorous administration of the tudors who governed england during the latter part of the fifteenth and through the whole of the sixteenth century no baron was powerful enough to dare to disturb the public security  the reader will find at the end of this chapter all the prices of wheat which have been collected by fleetwood from   0  to      both inclusive reduced to the money of the present times and digested according to the order of time into seven divisions of twelve years each at the end of each division too he will find the average price of the twelve years of which it consists in that long period of time fleetwood has been able to collect the prices of no more than eighty years so that four years are wanting to make out the last twelve years i have added therefore from the accounts of eton college the prices of             00 and   0  it is the only addition which i have made the reader will see that from the beginning of the thirteenth till after the middle of the sixteenth century the average price of each twelve years grows gradually lower and lower and that toward the end of the sixteenth century it begins to rise again the prices indeed which fleetwood has been able to collect seem to have been those chiefly which were remarkable for extraordinary dearness or cheapness and i do not pretend that any very certain conclusion can be drawn from them so far however as they prove any thing at all they confirm the account which i have been endeavoring to give fleetwood himself however seems with most other writers to have believed that during all this period the value of silver in consequence of its increasing abundance was continually diminishing the prices of corn which he himself has collected certainly do not agree with this opinion they agree perfectly with that of mr dupre de st maur and with that which i have been endeavoring to explain bishop fleetwood and mr dupre de st maur are the two authors who seem to have collected with the greatest diligence and fidelity the prices of things in ancient times it is somewhat curious that though their opinions are so very different their facts so far as they relate to the price of corn at least should coincide so very exactly  it is not however so much from the low price of corn as from that of some other parts of the rude produce of land that the most judicious writers have inferred the great value of silver in those very ancient times corn it has been said being a sort of manufacture was in those rude ages much dearer in proportion than the greater part of other commodities it is meant i suppose than the greater part of unmanufactured commodities such as cattle poultry game of all kinds etc that in those times of poverty and barbarism these were proportionably much cheaper than corn is undoubtedly true but this cheapness was not the effect of the high value of silver but of the low value of those commodities it was not that silver would in such times purchase or represent a greater quantity of labor but that such commodities would purchase or represent a much smaller quantity than in times of more opulence and improvement silver must certainly be cheaper in spanish america than in europe in the country where it is produced than in the country to which it is brought at the expense of a long carriage both by land and by sea of a freight and an insurance one and twenty pence halfpenny sterling however we are told by ulloa was not many years ago at buenos airs the price of an ox chosen from a herd of three or four hundred sixteen shillings sterling we are told by mr byron was the price of a good horse in the capital of chili in a country naturally fertile but of which the far greater part is altogether uncultivated cattle poultry game of all kinds etc as they can be acquired with a very small quantity of labor so they will purchase or command but a very small quantity the low money price for which they may be sold is no proof that the real value of silver is there very high but that the real value of those commodities is very low  labor it must always be remembered and not any particular commodity or set of commodities is the real measure of the value both of silver and of all other commodities  but in countries almost waste or but thinly inhabited cattle poultry game of all kinds etc as they are the spontaneous productions of nature so she frequently produces them in much greater quantities than the consumption of the inhabitants requires in such a state of things the supply commonly exceeds the demand in different states of society in different stages of improvement therefore such commodities will represent or be equivalent to very different quantities of labor  in every state of society in every stage of improvement corn is the production of human industry but the average produce of every sort of industry is always suited more or less exactly to the average consumption the average supply to the average demand in every different stage of improvement besides the raising of equal quantities of corn in the same soil and climate will at an average require nearly equal quantities of labor or what comes to the same thing the price of nearly equal quantities the continual increase of the productive powers of labor in an improving state of cultivation being more or less counterbalanced by the continually increasing price of cattle the principal instruments of agriculture upon all these accounts therefore we may rest assured that equal quantities of corn will in every state of society in every stage of improvement more nearly represent or be equivalent to equal quantities of labor than equal quantities of any other part of the rude produce of land corn accordingly it has already been observed is in all the different stages of wealth and improvement a more accurate measure of value than any other commodity or set of commodities in all those different stages therefore we can judge better of the real value of silver by comparing it with corn than by comparing it with any other commodity or set of commodities  corn besides or whatever else is the common and favorite vegetable food of the people constitutes in every civilized country the principal part of the subsistence of the labourer in consequence of the extension of agriculture the land of every country produces a much greater quantity of vegetable than of animal food and the labourer every where lives chiefly upon the wholesome food that is cheapest and most abundant butchersmeat except in the most thriving countries or where labor is most highly rewarded makes but an insignificant part of his subsistence poultry makes a still smaller part of it and game no part of it in france and even in scotland where labor is somewhat better rewarded than in france the laboring poor seldom eat butchersmeat except upon holidays and other extraordinary occasions the money price of labor therefore depends much more upon the average money price of corn the subsistence of the labourer than upon that of butchersmeat or of any other part of the rude produce of land the real value of gold and silver therefore the real quantity of labor which they can purchase or command depends much more upon the quantity of corn which they can purchase or command than upon that of butchersmeat or any other part of the rude produce of land  such slight observations however upon the prices either of corn or of other commodities would not probably have misled so many intelligent authors had they not been agreeable to the popular notion that as the quantity of silver naturally increases in every country with the increase of wealth so its value diminishes as its quantity increases this notion however seems to be altogether groundless  the quantity of the precious metals may increase in any country from two different causes either first from the increased abundance of the mines which supply it or secondly from the increased wealth of the people from the increased produce of their annual labor the first of these causes is no doubt necessarily connected with the diminution of the value of the precious metals but the second is not  when more abundant mines are discovered a greater quantity of the precious metals is brought to market and the quantity of the necessaries and conveniences of life for which they must be exchanged being the same as before equal quantities of the metals must be exchanged for smaller quantities of commodities so far therefore as the increase of the quantity of the precious metals in any country arises from the increased abundance of the mines it is necessarily connected with some diminution of their value  when on the contrary the wealth of any country increases when the annual produce of its labor becomes gradually greater and greater a greater quantity of coin becomes necessary in order to circulate a greater quantity of commodities and the people as they can afford it as they have more commodities to give for it will naturally purchase a greater and a greater quantity of plate the quantity of their coin will increase from necessity the quantity of their plate from vanity and ostentation or from the same reason that the quantity of fine statues pictures and of every other luxury and curiosity is likely to increase among them but as statuaries and painters are not likely to be worse rewarded in times of wealth and prosperity than in times of poverty and depression so gold and silver are not likely to be worse paid for  the price of gold and silver when the accidental discovery of more abundant mines does not keep it down as it naturally rises with the wealth of every country so whatever be the state of the mines it is at all times naturally higher in a rich than in a poor country gold and silver like all other commodities naturally seek the market where the best price is given for them and the best price is commonly given for every thing in the country which can best afford it labor it must be remembered is the ultimate price which is paid for every thing and in countries where labor is equally well rewarded the money price of labor will be in proportion to that of the subsistence of the labourer but gold and silver will naturally exchange for a greater quantity of subsistence in a rich than in a poor country in a country which abounds with subsistence than in one which is but indifferently supplied with it if the two countries are at a great distance the difference may be very great because though the metals naturally fly from the worse to the better market yet it may be difficult to transport them in such quantities as to bring their price nearly to a level in both if the countries are near the difference will be smaller and may sometimes be scarce perceptible because in this case the transportation will be easy china is a much richer country than any part of europe and the difference between the price of subsistence in china and in europe is very great rice in china is much cheaper than wheat is any where in europe england is a much richer country than scotland but the difference between the money price of corn in those two countries is much smaller and is but just perceptible in proportion to the quantity or measure scotch corn generally appears to be a good deal cheaper than english but in proportion to its quality it is certainly somewhat dearer scotland receives almost every year very large supplies from england and every commodity must commonly be somewhat dearer in the country to which it is brought than in that from which it comes english corn therefore must be dearer in scotland than in england and yet in proportion to its quality or to the quantity and goodness of the flour or meal which can be made from it it cannot commonly be sold higher there than the scotch corn which comes to market in competition with it  the difference between the money price of labor in china and in europe is still greater than that between the money price of subsistence because the real recompense of labor is higher in europe than in china the greater part of europe being in an improving state while china seems to be standing still the money price of labor is lower in scotland than in england because the real recompense of labor is much lower scotland though advancing to greater wealth advancing much more slowly than england the proportion between the real recompense of labor in different countries it must be remembered is naturally regulated not by their actual wealth or poverty but by their advancing stationary or declining condition  gold and silver as they are naturally of the greatest value among the richest so they are naturally of least value among the poorest nations among savages the poorest of all nations they are of scarce any value  in great towns corn is always dearer than in remote parts of the country this however is the effect not of the real cheapness of silver but of the real dearness of corn it does not cost less labor to bring silver to the great town than to the remote parts of the country but it costs a great deal more to bring corn  in some very rich and commercial countries such as holland and the territory of genoa corn is dear for the same reason that it is dear in great towns they do not produce enough to maintain their inhabitants they are rich in the industry and skill of their artificers and manufacturers in every sort of machinery which can facilitate and abridge labor in shipping and in all the other instruments and means of carriage and commerce but they are poor in corn which as it must be brought to them from distant countries must by an addition to its price pay for the carriage from those countries it does not cost less labor to bring silver to amsterdam than to dantzick but it costs a great deal more to bring corn the real cost of silver must be nearly the same in both places but that of corn must be very different diminish the real opulence either of holland or of the territory of genoa while the number of their inhabitants remains the same diminish their power of supplying themselves from distant countries and the price of corn instead of sinking with that diminution in the quantity of their silver which must necessarily accompany this declension either as its cause or as its effect will rise to the price of a famine when we are in want of necessaries we must part with all superfluities of which the value as it rises in times of opulence and prosperity so it sinks in times of poverty and distress it is otherwise with necessaries their real price the quantity of labor which they can purchase or command rises in times of poverty and distress and sinks in times of opulence and prosperity which are always times of great abundance for they could not otherwise be times of opulence and prosperity corn is a necessary silver is only a superfluity  whatever therefore may have been the increase in the quantity of the precious metals which during the period between the middle of the fourteenth and that of the sixteenth century arose from the increase of wealth and improvement it could have no tendency to diminish their value either in great britain or in any other part of europe if those who have collected the prices of things in ancient times therefore had during this period no reason to infer the diminution of the value of silver from any observations which they had made upon the prices either of corn or of other commodities they had still less reason to infer it from any supposed increase of wealth and improvement  second period but how various soever may have been the opinions of the learned concerning the progress of the value of silver during this first period they are unanimous concerning it during the second  from about    0 to about    0 during a period of about seventy years the variation in the proportion between the value of silver and that of corn held a quite opposite course silver sunk in its real value or would exchange for a smaller quantity of labor than before and corn rose in its nominal price and instead of being commonly sold for about two ounces of silver the quarter or about ten shillings of our present money came to be sold for six and eight ounces of silver the quarter or about thirty and forty shillings of our present money  the discovery of the abundant mines of america seems to have been the sole cause of this diminution in the value of silver in proportion to that of corn it is accounted for accordingly in the same manner by every body and there never has been any dispute either about the fact or about the cause of it the greater part of europe was during this period advancing in industry and improvement and the demand for silver must consequently have been increasing but the increase of the supply had it seems so far exceeded that of the demand that the value of that metal sunk considerably the discovery of the mines of america it is to be observed does not seem to have had any very sensible effect upon the prices of things in england till after    0 though even the mines of potosi had been discovered more than thirty years before  from      to    0 both inclusive the average price of the quarter of nine bushels of the best wheat at windsor market appears from the accounts of eton college to have been  l  s  d     from which sum neglecting the fraction and deducting a ninth or  s  d the price of the quarter of eight bushels comes out to have been  l   s  0d and from this sum neglecting likewise the fraction and deducting a ninth or  s  d    for the difference between the price of the best wheat and that of the middle wheat the price of the middle wheat comes out to have been about  l   s  d    or about six ounces and onethird of an ounce of silver  from      to      both inclusive the average price of the same measure of the best wheat at the same market appears from the same accounts to have been   l  0 s from which making the like deductions as in the foregoing case the average price of the quarter of eight bushels of middle wheat comes out to have been   l    s   d or about seven ounces and twothirds of an ounce of silver  third period between    0 and    0 or about      the effect of the discovery of the mines of america in reducing the value of silver appears to have been completed and the value of that metal seems never to have sunk lower in proportion to that of corn than it was about that time it seems to have risen somewhat in the course of the present century and it had probably begun to do so even some time before the end of the last  from      to   00 both inclusive being the sixtyfour last years of the last century the average price of the quarter of nine bushels of the best wheat at windsor market appears from the same accounts to have been   l    s od which is only   s od dearer than it had been during the sixteen years before but in the course of these sixtyfour years there happened two events which must have produced a much greater scarcity of corn than what the course of the seasons would otherwise have occasioned and which therefore without supposing any further reduction in the value of silver will much more than account for this very small enhancement of price  the first of these events was the civil war which by discouraging tillage and interrupting commerce must have raised the price of corn much above what the course of the seasons would otherwise have occasioned it must have had this effect more or less at all the different markets in the kingdom but particularly at those in the neighborhood of london which require to be supplied from the greatest distance in      accordingly the price of the best wheat at windsor market appears from the same accounts to have been   l   s and in      to have been   l the quarter of nine bushels the excess of those two years above   l  0 s the average price of the sixteen years preceding      is   l   s which divided among the sixtyfour last years of the last century will alone very nearly account for that small enhancement of price which seems to have taken place in them these however though the highest are by no means the only high prices which seem to have been occasioned by the civil wars  the second event was the bounty upon the exportation of corn granted in      the bounty it has been thought by many people by encouraging tillage may in a long course of years have occasioned a greater abundance and consequently a greater cheapness of corn in the homemarket than what would otherwise have taken place there but between      and   00 it had no time to produce this effect during this short period its only effect must have been by encouraging the exportation of the surplus produce of every year and thereby hindering the abundance of one year from compensating the scarcity of another to raise the price in the homemarket the scarcity which prevailed in england from      to      both inclusive though no doubt principally owing to the badness of the seasons and therefore extending through a considerable part of europe must have been somewhat enhanced by the bounty in      accordingly the further exportation of corn was prohibited for nine months  there was a third event which occurred in the course of the same period and which though it could not occasion any scarcity of corn nor perhaps any augmentation in the real quantity of silver which was usually paid for it must necessarily have occasioned some augmentation in the nominal sum this event was the great degradation of the silver coin by clipping and wearing this evil had begun in the reign of charles ii and had gone on continually increasing till      at which time as we may learn from mr lowndes the current silver coin was at an average near five and twenty per cent below its standard value but the nominal sum which constitutes the market price of every commodity is necessarily regulated not so much by the quantity of silver which according to the standard ought to be contained in it as by that which it is found by experience actually is contained in it this nominal sum therefore is necessarily higher when the coin is much degraded by clipping and wearing than when near to its standard value  in the course of the present century the silver coin has not at any time been more below its standard weight than it is at present but though very much defaced its value has been kept up by that of the gold coin for which it is exchanged for though before the late recoinage the gold coin was a good deal defaced too it was less so than the silver in      on the contrary the value of the silver coin was not kept up by the gold coin a guinea then commonly exchanging for thirty shillings of the worn and clipped silver before the late recoinage of the gold the price of silver bullion was seldom higher than five shillings and sevenpence an ounce which is but fivepence above the mint price but in      the common price of silver bullion was six shillings and fivepence an ounce which is fifteenpence above the mint price even before the late recoinage of the gold therefore the coin gold and silver together when compared with silver bullion was not supposed to be more than eight per cent below its standard value in      on the contrary it had been supposed to be near five and twenty per cent below that value but in the beginning of the present century that is immediately after the great recoinage in king williams time the greater part of the current silver coin must have been still nearer to its standard weight than it is at present in the course of the present century too there has been no great public calamity such as the civil war which could either discourage tillage or interrupt the interior commerce of the country and though the bounty which has taken place through the greater part of this century must always raise the price of corn somewhat higher than it otherwise would be in the actual state of tillage yet as in the course of this century the bounty has had full time to produce all the good effects commonly imputed to it to encourage tillage and thereby to increase the quantity of corn in the home market it may be supposed to have done something to lower the price of that commodity the one way as well as to raise it the other it is by many people supposed to have done more a notion which i shall examine hereafter in the sixtyfour first years of the present century accordingly the average price of the quarter of nine bushels of the best wheat at windsor market appears by the accounts of eton college to have been  l 0s  d  0   which is about ten shillings and sixpence or more than five and twenty per cent cheaper than it had been during the sixtyfour last years of the last century and about nine shillings and sixpence cheaper than it had been during the sixteen years preceding      when the discovery of the abundant mines of america may be supposed to have produced its full effect and about one shilling cheaper than it had been in the twentysix years preceding    0 before that discovery can well be supposed to have produced its full effect according to this account the average price of middle wheat during these sixtyfour first years of the present century comes out to have been about thirtytwo shillings the quarter of eight bushels  the value of silver therefore seems to have risen somewhat in proportion to that of corn during the course of the present century and it had probably begun to do so even some time before the end of the last  in      the price of the quarter of nine bushels of the best wheat at windsor market was  l  s  d the lowest price at which it had ever been from       in      mr gregory king a man famous for his knowledge in matters of this kind estimated the average price of wheat in years of moderate plenty to be to the grower  s  d the bushel or eight and twenty shillings the quarter the growers price i understand to be the same with what is sometimes called the contract price or the price at which a farmer contracts for a certain number of years to deliver a certain quantity of corn to a dealer as a contract of this kind saves the farmer the expense and trouble of marketing the contract price is generally lower than what is supposed to be the average market price mr king had judged eight and twenty shillings the quarter to be at that time the ordinary contract price in years of moderate plenty before the scarcity occasioned by the late extraordinary course of bad seasons it was the ordinary contract price in all common years  in      was granted the parliamentary bounty upon the exportation of corn the country gentlemen who then composed a still greater proportion of the legislature than they do at present had felt that the money price of corn was falling the bounty was an expedient to raise it artificially to the high price at which it had frequently been sold in the times of charles i and ii it was to take place therefore till wheat was so high as fortyeight shillings the quarter that is twenty shillings or   ths dearer than mr king had in that very year estimated the growers price to be in times of moderate plenty if his calculations deserve any part of the reputation which they have obtained very universally eight and forty shillings the quarter was a price which without some such expedient as the bounty could not at that time be expected except in years of extraordinary scarcity but the government of king william was not then fully settled it was in no condition to refuse any thing to the country gentlemen from whom it was at that very time soliciting the first establishment of the annual land tax  the value of silver therefore in proportion to that of corn had probably risen somewhat before the end of the last century and it seems to have continued to do so during the course of the greater part of the present though the necessary operation of the bounty must have hindered that rise from being so sensible as it otherwise would have been in the actual state of tillage  in plentiful years the bounty by occasioning an extraordinary exportation necessarily raises the price of corn above what it otherwise would be in those years to encourage tillage by keeping up the price of corn even in the most plentiful years was the avowed end of the institution  in years of great scarcity indeed the bounty has generally been suspended it must however have had some effect event upon the prices of many of those years by the extraordinary exportation which it occasions in years of plenty it must frequently hinder the plenty of one year from compensating the scarcity of another  both in years of plenty and in years of scarcity therefore the bounty raises the price of corn above what it naturally would be in the actual state of tillage if during the sixtyfour first years of the present century therefore the average price has been lower than during the sixtyfour last years of the last century it must in the same state of tillage have been much more so had it not been for this operation of the bounty  but without the bounty it may be said the state of tillage would not have been the same what may have been the effects of this institution upon the agriculture of the country i shall endeavor to explain hereafter when i come to treat particularly of bounties i shall only observe at present that this rise in the value of silver in proportion to that of corn has not been peculiar to england it has been observed to have taken place in france during the same period and nearly in the same proportion too by three very faithful diligent and laborious collectors of the prices of corn mr dupre de st maur mr messance and the author of the essay on the police of grain but in france till      the exportation of grain was by law prohibited and it is somewhat difficult to suppose that nearly the same diminution of price which took place in one country notwithstanding this prohibition should in another be owing to the extraordinary encouragement given to exportation  it would be more proper perhaps to consider this variation in the average money price of corn as the effect rather of some gradual rise in the real value of silver in the european market than of any fall in the real average value of corn corn it has already been observed is at distant periods of time a more accurate measure of value than either silver or perhaps any other commodity when after the discovery of the abundant mines of america corn rose to three and four times its former money price this change was universally ascribed not to any rise in the real value of corn but to a fall in the real value of silver if during the sixtyfour first years of the present century therefore the average money price of corn has fallen somewhat below what it had been during the greater part of the last century we should in the same manner impute this change not to any fall in the real value of corn but to some rise in the real value of silver in the european market  the high price of corn during these ten or twelve years past indeed has occasioned a suspicion that the real value of silver still continues to fall in the european market this high price of corn however seems evidently to have been the effect of the extraordinary unfavourableness of the seasons and ought therefore to be regarded not as a permanent but as a transitory and occasional event the seasons for these ten or twelve years past have been unfavourable through the greater part of europe and the disorders of poland have very much increased the scarcity in all those countries which in dear years used to be supplied from that market so long a course of bad seasons though not a very common event is by no means a singular one and whoever has enquired much into the history of the prices of corn in former times will be at no loss to recollect several other examples of the same kind ten years of extraordinary scarcity besides are not more wonderful than ten years of extraordinary plenty the low price of corn from      to    0 both inclusive may very well be set in opposition to its high price during these last eight or ten years from      to    0 the average price of the quarter of nine bushels of the best wheat at windsor market it appears from the accounts of eton college was only  l      d which is nearly  s  d below the average price of the sixtyfour first years of the present century the average price of the quarter of eight bushels of middle wheat comes out according to this account to have been during these ten years only  l  s  d  between      and    0 however the bounty must have hindered the price of corn from falling so low in the home market as it naturally would have done during these ten years the quantity of all sorts of grain exported it appears from the customhouse books amounted to no less than eight millions twentynine thousand one hundred and fiftysix quarters one bushel the bounty paid for this amounted to            s  d in      accordingly mr pelham at that time prime minister observed to the house of commons that for the three years preceding a very extraordinary sum had been paid as bounty for the exportation of corn he had good reason to make this observation and in the following year he might have had still better in that single year the bounty paid amounted to no less than          0s  d it is unnecessary to observe how much this forced exportation must have raised the price of corn above what it otherwise would have been in the home market  at the end of the accounts annexed to this chapter the reader will find the particular account of those ten years separated from the rest he will find there too the particular account of the preceding ten years of which the average is likewise below though not so much below the general average of the sixtyfour first years of the century the year    0 however was a year of extraordinary scarcity these twenty years preceding    0 may very well be set in opposition to the twenty preceding    0 as the former were a good deal below the general average of the century notwithstanding the intervention of one or two dear years so the latter have been a good deal above it notwithstanding the intervention of one or two cheap ones of      for example if the former have not been as much below the general average as the latter have been above it we ought probably to impute it to the bounty the change has evidently been too sudden to be ascribed to any change in the value of silver which is always slow and gradual the suddenness of the effect can be accounted for only by a cause which can operate suddenly the accidental variation of the seasons  the money price of labor in great britain has indeed risen during the course of the present century this however seems to be the effect not so much of any diminution in the value of silver in the european market as of an increase in the demand for labor in great britain arising from the great and almost universal prosperity of the country in france a country not altogether so prosperous the money price of labor has since the middle of the last century been observed to sink gradually with the average money price of corn both in the last century and in the present the daywages of common labor are there said to have been pretty uniformly about the twentieth part of the average price of the septier of wheat a measure which contains a little more than four winchester bushels in great britain the real recompense of labor it has already been shown the real quantity of the necessaries and conveniences of life which are given to the labourer has increased considerably during the course of the present century the rise in its money price seems to have been the effect not of any diminution of the value of silver in the general market of europe but of a rise in the real price of labor in the particular market of great britain owing to the peculiarly happy circumstances of the country  for some time after the first discovery of america silver would continue to sell at its former or not much below its former price the profits of mining would for some time be very great and much above their natural rate those who imported that metal into europe however would soon find that the whole annual importation could not be disposed of at this high price silver would gradually exchange for a smaller and a smaller quantity of goods its price would sink gradually lower and lower till it fell to its natural price or to what was just sufficient to pay according to their natural rates the wages of the labor the profits of the stock and the rent of the land which must be paid in order to bring it from the mine to the market in the greater part of the silver mines of peru the tax of the king of spain amounting to a fifth of the gross produce eats up it has already been observed the whole rent of the land this tax was originally a half it soon afterward fell to a third and then to a fifth at which rate it still continues in the greater part of the silver mines of peru this it seems is all that remains after replacing the stock of the undertaker of the work together with its ordinary profits and it seems to be universally acknowledged that these profits which were once very high are now as low as they can well be consistently with carrying on the works  the tax of the king of spain was reduced to a fifth part of the registered silver in   0  one and thirty years before      the date of the discovery of the mines of potosi in the course of a century or before      these mines the most fertile in all america had time sufficient to produce their full effect or to reduce the value of silver in the european market as low as it could well fall while it continued to pay this tax to the king of spain a hundred years is time sufficient to reduce any commodity of which there is no monopoly to its natural price or to the lowest price at which while it pays a particular tax it can continue to be sold for any considerable time together  the price of silver in the european market might perhaps have fallen still lower and it might have become necessary either to lower the tax upon it in the same manner as that upon gold or to give up working the greater part of the american mines which are now wrought the gradual increase of the demand for silver or the gradual enlargement of the market for the produce of the silver mines of america is probably the cause which has prevented this from happening and which has not only kept up the value of silver in the european market but has perhaps even raised it somewhat higher than it was about the middle of the last century  since the first discovery of america the market for the produce of its silver mines has been growing gradually more and more extensive  first the market of europe has become gradually more and more extensive since the discovery of america the greater part of europe has been much improved england holland france and germany even sweden denmark and russia have all advanced considerably both in agriculture and in manufactures italy seems not to have gone backwards the fall of italy preceeded the conquest of peru since that time it seems rather to have recovered a little spain and portugal indeed are supposed to have gone backwards portugal however is but a very small part of europe and the declension of spain is not perhaps so great as is commonly imagined in the beginning of the sixteenth century spain was a very poor country even in comparison with france which has been so much improved since that time it was the well known remark of the emperor charles v who had traveled so frequently through both countries that every thing abounded in france but that every thing was wanting in spain the increasing produce of the agriculture and manufactures of europe must necessarily have required a gradual increase in the quantity of silver coin to circulate it and the increasing number of wealthy individuals must have required the like increase in the quantity of their plate and other ornaments of silver  secondly america is itself a new market for the produce of its own silver mines and as its advances in agriculture industry and population are much more rapid than those of the most thriving countries in europe its demand must increase much more rapidly the english colonies are altogether a new market which partly for coin and partly for plate requires a continually augmenting supply of silver through a great continent where there never was any demand before the greater part too of the spanish and portuguese colonies are altogether new markets new granada the yucatan paraguay and the brazils were before discovered by the europeans inhabited by savage nations who had neither arts nor agriculture a considerable degree of both has now been introduced into all of them even mexico and peru though they cannot be considered as altogether new markets are certainly much more extensive ones than they ever were before after all the wonderful tales which have been published concerning the splendid state of those countries in ancient times whoever reads with any degree of sober judgment the history of their first discovery and conquest will evidently discern that in arts agriculture and commerce their inhabitants were much more ignorant than the tartars of the ukraine are at present even the peruvians the more civilized nation of the two though they made use of gold and silver as ornaments had no coined money of any kind their whole commerce was carried on by barter and there was accordingly scarce any division of labor among them those who cultivated the ground were obliged to build their own houses to make their own household furniture their own clothes shoes and instruments of agriculture the few artificers among them are said to have been all maintained by the sovereign the nobles and the priests and were probably their servants or slaves all the ancient arts of mexico and peru have never furnished one single manufacture to europe the spanish armies though they scarce ever exceeded five hundred men and frequently did not amount to half that number found almost every where great difficulty in procuring subsistence the famines which they are said to have occasioned almost wherever they went in countries too which at the same time are represented as very populous and well cultivated sufficiently demonstrate that the story of this populousness and high cultivation is in a great measure fabulous the spanish colonies are under a government in many respects less favorable to agriculture improvement and population than that of the english colonies they seem however to be advancing in all these much more rapidly than any country in europe in a fertile soil and happy climate the great abundance and cheapness of land a circumstance common to all new colonies is it seems so great an advantage as to compensate many defects in civil government frezier who visited peru in      represents lima as containing between twentyfive and twentyeight thousand inhabitants ulloa who resided in the same country between    0 and      represents it as containing more than fifty thousand the difference in their accounts of the populousness of several other principal towns in chili and peru is nearly the same and as there seems to be no reason to doubt of the good information of either it marks an increase which is scarce inferior to that of the english colonies america therefore is a new market for the produce of its own silver mines of which the demand must increase much more rapidly than that of the most thriving country in europe  thirdly the east indies is another market for the produce of the silver mines of america and a market which from the time of the first discovery of those mines has been continually taking off a greater and a greater quantity of silver since that time the direct trade between america and the east indies which is carried on by means of the acapulco ships has been continually augmenting and the indirect intercourse by the way of europe has been augmenting in a still greater proportion during the sixteenth century the portuguese were the only european nation who carried on any regular trade to the east indies in the last years of that century the dutch began to encroach upon this monopoly and in a few years expelled them from their principal settlements in india during the greater part of the last century those two nations divided the most considerable part of the east india trade between them the trade of the dutch continually augmenting in a still greater proportion than that of the portuguese declined the english and french carried on some trade with india in the last century but it has been greatly augmented in the course of the present the east india trade of the swedes and danes began in the course of the present century even the muscovites now trade regularly with china by a sort of caravans which go over land through siberia and tartary to pekin the east india trade of all these nations if we except that of the french which the last war had well nigh annihilated has been almost continually augmenting the increasing consumption of east india goods in europe is it seems so great as to afford a gradual increase of employment to them all tea for example was a drug very little used in europe before the middle of the last century at present the value of the tea annually imported by the english east india company for the use of their own countrymen amounts to more than a million and a half a year and even this is not enough a great deal more being constantly smuggled into the country from the ports of holland from gottenburg in sweden and from the coast of france too as long as the french east india company was in prosperity the consumption of the porcelain of china of the spiceries of the moluccas of the piece goods of bengal and of innumerable other articles has increased very nearly in a like proportion the tunnage accordingly of all the european shipping employed in the east india trade at any one time during the last century was not perhaps much greater than that of the english east india company before the late reduction of their shipping  but in the east indies particularly in china and indostan the value of the precious metals when the europeans first began to trade to those countries was much higher than in europe and it still continues to be so in rice countries which generally yield two sometimes three crops in the year each of them more plentiful than any common crop of corn the abundance of food must be much greater than in any corn country of equal extent such countries are accordingly much more populous in them too the rich having a greater superabundance of food to dispose of beyond what they themselves can consume have the means of purchasing a much greater quantity of the labor of other people the retinue of a grandee in china or indostan accordingly is by all accounts much more numerous and splendid than that of the richest subjects in europe the same superabundance of food of which they have the disposal enables them to give a greater quantity of it for all those singular and rare productions which nature furnishes but in very small quantities such as the precious metals and the precious stones the great objects of the competition of the rich though the mines therefore which supplied the indian market had been as abundant as those which supplied the european such commodities would naturally exchange for a greater quantity of food in india than in europe but the mines which supplied the indian market with the precious metals seem to have been a good deal less abundant and those which supplied it with the precious stones a good deal more so than the mines which supplied the european the precious metals therefore would naturally exchange for somewhat a greater quantity of the precious stones and for a much greater quantity of food in india than in europe the money price of diamonds the greatest of all superfluities would be somewhat lower and that of food the first of all necessaries a great deal lower in the one country than in the other but the real price of labor the real quantity of the necessaries of life which is given to the labourer it has already been observed is lower both in china and indostan the two great markets of india than it is through the greater part of europe the wages of the labourer will there purchase a smaller quantity of food and as the money price of food is much lower in india than in europe the money price of labor is there lower upon a double account upon accout both of the small quantity of food which it will purchase and of the low price of that food but in countries of equal art and industry the money price of the greater part of manufactures will be in proportion to the money price of labor and in manufacturing art and industry china and indostan though inferior seem not to be much inferior to any part of europe the money price of the greater part of manufactures therefore will naturally be much lower in those great empires than it is any where in europe through the greater part of europe too the expense of landcarriage increases very much both the real and nominal price of most manufactures it costs more labor and therefore more money to bring first the materials and afterward the complete manufacture to market in china and indostan the extent and variety of inland navigations save the greater part of this labor and consequently of this money and thereby reduce still lower both the real and the nominal price of the greater part of their manufactures upon all these accounts the precious metals are a commodity which it always has been and still continues to be extremely advantageous to carry from europe to india there is scarce any commodity which brings a better price there or which in proportion to the quantity of labor and commodities which it costs in europe will purchase or command a greater quantity of labor and commodities in india it is more advantageous too to carry silver thither than gold because in china and the greater part of the other markets of india the proportion between fine silver and fine gold is but as ten to one whereas in europe it is as fourteen or fifteen to one in china and the greater part of the other markets of india ten ounces of silver will purchase an ounce of gold in europe it requires from fourteen to fifteen ounces in the cargoes therefore of the greater part of european ships which sail to india silver has generally been one of the most valuable articles it is the most valuable article in the acapulco ships which sail to manilla the silver of the new continent seems in this manner to be the principal commodity by which the commerce between the two extremities of the old one is carried on and it is by means of it chiefly that those distant parts of the world are connected with one another  in order to supply so very widely extended a market the quantity of silver annually brought from the mines must not only be sufficient to support that continual increase both of coin and of plate which is required in all thriving countries but to repair that continual waste and consumption of silver which takes place in all countries where that metal is used  the continual consumption of the precious metals in coin by wearing and in plate both by wearing and cleaning is very sensible and in commodities of which the use is so very widely extended would alone require a very great annual supply the consumption of those metals in some particular manufactures though it may not perhaps be greater upon the whole than this gradual consumption is however much more sensible as it is much more rapid in the manufactures of birmingham alone the quantity of gold and silver annually employed in gilding and plating and thereby disqualified from ever afterward appearing in the shape of those metals is said to amount to more than fifty thousand pounds sterling we may from thence form some notion how great must be the annual consumption in all the different parts of the world either in manufactures of the same kind with those of birmingham or in laces embroideries gold and silver stuffs the gilding of books furniture etc a considerable quantity too must be annually lost in transporting those metals from one place to another both by sea and by land in the greater part of the governments of asia besides the almost universal custom of concealing treasures in the bowels of the earth of which the knowledge frequently dies with the person who makes the concealment must occasion the loss of a still greater quantity  the quantity of gold and silver imported at both cadiz and lisbon including not only what comes under register but what may be supposed to be smuggled amounts according to the best accounts to about six millions sterling a year  according to mr meggens the annual importation of the precious metals into spain at an average of six years viz from      to      both inclusive and into portugal at an average of seven years viz from      to      both inclusive amounted in silver to   0  0  pounds weight and in gold to     0 pounds weight the silver at sixtytwo shillings the pound troy amounts to         l  0s sterling the gold at fortyfour guineas and a half the pound troy amounts to        l   s sterling both together amount to        l  s sterling the account of what was imported under register he assures us is exact he gives us the detail of the particular places from which the gold and silver were brought and of the particular quantity of each metal which according to the register each of them afforded he makes an allowance too for the quantity of each metal which he supposes may have been smuggled the great experience of this judicious merchant renders his opinion of considerable weight  according to the eloquent and sometimes well informed author of the philosophical and political history of the establishment of the europeans in the two indies the annual importation of registered gold and silver into spain at an average of eleven years viz from      to      both inclusive amounted to          piastres of ten reals on account of what may have been smuggled however the whole annual importation he supposes may have amounted to seventeen millions of piastres which at  s  d the piastre is equal to     000l sterling he gives the detail too of the particular places from which the gold and silver were brought and of the particular quantities of each metal which according to the register each of them afforded he informs us too that if we were to judge of the quantity of gold annually imported from the brazils into lisbon by the amount of the tax paid to the king of portugal which it seems is onefifth of the standard metal we might value it at eighteen millions of cruzadoes or fortyfive millions of french livres equal to about two millions sterling on account of what may have been smuggled however we may safely he says add to this sum an eighth more or   0000l sterling so that the whole will amount to    0000l sterling according to this account therefore the whole annual importation of the precious metals into both spain and portugal amounts to about  0  000l sterling  several other very well authenticated accounts i have been assured agree in making this whole annual importation amount at an average to about six millions sterling sometimes a little more sometimes a little less  the annual importation of the precious metals into cadiz and lisbon indeed is not equal to the whole annual produce of the mines of america some part is sent annually by the acapulco ships to manilla some part is employed in the contraband trade which the spanish colonies carry on with those of other european nations and some part no doubt remains in the country the mines of america besides are by no means the only gold and silver mines in the world they are however by far the most abundant the produce of all the other mines which are known is insignificant it is acknowledged in comparison with theirs and the far greater part of their produce it is likewise acknowledged is annually imported into cadiz and lisbon but the consumption of birmingham alone at the rate of fifty thousand pounds a year is equal to the hundred and twentieth part of this annual importation at the rate of six millions a year the whole annual consumption of gold and silver therefore in all the different countries of the would where those metals are used may perhaps be nearly equal to the whole annual produce the remainder may be no more than sufficient to supply the increasing demand of all thriving countries it may even have fallen so far short of this demand as somewhat to raise the price of those metals in the european market  the quantity of brass and iron annually brought from the mine to the market is out of all proportion greater than that of gold and silver we do not however upon this account imagine that those coarse metals are likely to multiply beyond the demand or to become gradually cheaper and cheaper why should we imagine that the precious metals are likely to do so the coarse metals indeed though harder are put to much harder uses and as they are of less value less care is employed in their preservation the precious metals however are not necessarily immortal any more than they but are liable too to be lost wasted and consumed in a great variety of ways  the price of all metals though liable to slow and gradual variations varies less from year to year than that of almost any other part of the rude produce of land and the price of the precious metals is even less liable to sudden variations than that of the coarse ones the durableness of metals is the foundation of this extraordinary steadiness of price the corn which was brought to market last year will be all or almost all consumed long before the end of this year but some part of the iron which was brought from the mine two or three hundred years ago may be still in use and perhaps some part of the gold which was brought from it two or three thousand years ago the different masses of corn which in different years must supply the consumption of the world will always be nearly in proportion to the respective produce of those different years but the proportion between the different masses of iron which may be in use in two different years will be very little affected by any accidental difference in the produce of the iron mines of those two years and the proportion between the masses of gold will be still less affected by any such difference in the produce of the gold mines though the produce of the greater part of metallic mines therefore varies perhaps still more from year to year than that of the greater part of corn fields those variations have not the same effect upon the price of the one species of commodities as upon that of the other  variations in the proportion between the respective values of gold and silver before the discovery of the mines of america the value of fine gold to fine silver was regulated in the different mints of europe between the proportions of one to ten and one to twelve that is an ounce of fine gold was supposed to be worth from ten to twelve ounces of fine silver about the middle of the last century it came to be regulated between the proportions of one to fourteen and one to fifteen that is an ounce of fine gold came to be supposed worth between fourteen and fifteen ounces of fine silver gold rose in its nominal value or in the quantity of silver which was given for it both metals sunk in their real value or in the quantity of labor which they could purchase but silver sunk more than gold though both the gold and silver mines of america exceeded in fertility all those which had ever been known before the fertility of the silver mines had it seems been proportionably still greater than that of the gold ones  the great quantities of silver carried annually from europe to india have in some of the english settlements gradually reduced the value of that metal in proportion to gold in the mint of calcutta an ounce of fine gold is supposed to be worth fifteen ounces of fine silver in the same manner as in europe it is in the mint perhaps rated too high for the value which it bears in the market of bengal in china the proportion of gold to silver still continues as one to ten in japan it is said to be as one to eight  the proportion between the quantities of gold and silver annually imported into europe according to mr meggenss account is as one to twentytwo nearly that is for one ounce of gold there are imported a little more than twentytwo ounces of silver the great quantity of silver sent annually to the east indies reduces he supposes the quantities of those metals which remain in europe to the proportion of one to fourteen or fifteen the proportion of their values the proportion between their values he seems to think must necessarily be the same as that between their quantities and would therefore be as one to twentytwo were it not for this greater exportation of silver  but the ordinary proportion between the respective values of two commodities is not necessarily the same as that between the quantities of them which are commonly in the market the price of an ox reckoned at ten guineas is about threescore times the price of a lamb reckoned at   s   d it would be absurd however to infer from thence that there are commonly in the market threescore lambs for one ox and it would be just as absurd to infer because an ounce of gold will commonly purchase from fourteen to fifteen ounces of silver that there are commonly in the market only fourteen or fifteen ounces of silver for one ounce of gold  the quantity of silver commonly in the market it is probable is much greater in proportion to that of gold than the value of a certain quantity of gold is to that of an equal quantity of silver the whole quantity of a cheap commodity brought to market is commonly not only greater but of greater value than the whole quantity of a dear one the whole quantity of bread annually brought to market is not only greater but of greater value than the whole quantity of butchersmeat the whole quantity of butchersmeat than the whole quantity of poultry and the whole quantity of poultry than the whole quantity of wild fowl there are so many more purchasers for the cheap than for the dear commodity that not only a greater quantity of it but a greater value can commonly be disposed of the whole quantity therefore of the cheap commodity must commonly be greater in proportion to the whole quantity of the dear one than the value of a certain quantity of the dear one is to the value of an equal quantity of the cheap one when we compare the precious metals with one another silver is a cheap and gold a dear commodity we ought naturally to expect therefore that there should always be in the market not only a greater quantity but a greater value of silver than of gold let any man who has a little of both compare his own silver with his gold plate and he will probably find that not only the quantity but the value of the former greatly exceeds that of the latter many people besides have a good deal of silver who have no gold plate which even with those who have it is generally confined to watch cases snuffboxes and such like trinkets of which the whole amount is seldom of great value in the british coin indeed the value of the gold preponderates greatly but it is not so in that of all countries in the coin of some countries the value of the two metals is nearly equal in the scotch coin before the union with england the gold preponderated very little though it did somewhat as it appears by the accounts of the mint in the coin of many countries the silver preponderates in france the largest sums are commonly paid in that metal and it is there difficult to get more gold than what it is necessary to carry about in your pocket the superior value however of the silver plate above that of the gold which takes place in all countries will much more than compensate the preponderancy of the gold coin above the silver which takes place only in some countries  though in one sense of the word silver always has been and probably always will be much cheaper than gold yet in another sense gold may perhaps in the present state of the european market be said to be somewhat cheaper than silver a commodity may be said to be dear or cheap not only according to the absolute greatness or smallness of its usual price but according as that price is more or less above the lowest for which it is possible to bring it to market for any considerable time together this lowest price is that which barely replaces with a moderate profit the stock which must be employed in bringing the commodity thither it is the price which affords nothing to the landlord of which rent makes not any component part but which resolves itself altogether into wages and profit but in the present state of the european market gold is certainly somewhat nearer to this lowest price than silver the tax of the king of spain upon gold is only onetwentieth part of the standard metal or five per cent whereas his tax upon silver amounts to onefifth part of it or to twenty per cent in these taxes too it has already been observed consists the whole rent of the greater part of the gold and silver mines of spanish america and that upon gold is still worse paid than that upon silver the profits of the undertakers of gold mines too as they more rarely make a fortune must in general be still more moderate than those of the undertakers of silver mines the price of spanish gold therefore as it affords both less rent and less profit must in the european market be somewhat nearer to the lowest price for which it is possible to bring it thither than the price of spanish silver the tax of the king of portugal indeed upon the gold of the brazils is the same with that of the king of spain upon the silver of mexico and peru or onefifth part of the standard metal it must still be true however that the whole mass of american gold comes to the european market at a price nearer to the lowest for which it is possible to bring it thither than the whole mass of american silver when all expenses are computed it would seem the whole quantity of the one metal cannot be disposed of so advantageously as the whole quantity of the other  the price of diamonds and other precious stones may perhaps be still nearer to the lowest price at which it is possible to bring them to market than even the price of gold  were the king of spain to give up his tax upon silver the price of that metal might not upon that account sink immediately in the european market as long as the quantity brought thither continued the same as before it would still continue to sell at the same price the first and immediate effect of this change would be to increase the profits of mining the undertaker of the mine now gaining all that he had been used to pay to the king these great profits would soon tempt a greater number of people to undertake the working of new mines many mines would be wrought which cannot be wrought at present because they cannot afford to pay this tax and the quantity of silver brought to market would in a few years be so much augmented probably as to sink its price about onefifth below its present standard this diminution in the value of silver would again reduce the profits of mining nearly to their present rate  it is not indeed very probable that any part of a tax which affords so important a revenue and which is imposed too upon one of the most proper subjects of taxation will ever be given up as long as it is possible to pay it the impossibility of paying it however may in time make it necessary to diminish it in the same manner as it made it necessary to diminish the tax upon gold that the silver mines of spanish america like all other mines become gradually more expensive in the working on account of the greater depths at which it is necessary to carry on the works and of the greater expense of drawing out the water and of supplying them with fresh air at those depths is acknowledged by every body who has enquired into the state of those mines  these causes which are equivalent to a growing scarcity of silver for a commodity may be said to grow scarcer when it becomes more difficult and expensive to collect a certain quantity of it must in time produce one or other of the three following events the increase of the expense must either first be compensated altogether by a proportionable increase in the price of the metal or secondly it must be compensated altogether by a proportionable diminution of the tax upon silver or thirdly it must be compensated partly by the one and partly by the other of those two expedients this third event is very possible as gold rose in its price in proportion to silver notwithstanding a great diminution of the tax upon gold so silver might rise in its price in proportion to labor and commodities notwithstanding an equal diminution of the tax upon silver  that the first of these three events has already begun to take place or that silver has during the course of the present century begun to rise somewhat in its value in the european market the facts and arguments which have been alleged above dispose me to believe the rise indeed has hitherto been so very small that after all that has been said it may perhaps appear to many people uncertain not only whether this event has actually taken place but whether the contrary may not have taken place or whether the value of silver may not still continue to fall in the european market  grounds of the suspicion that the value of silver still continues to decrease the increase of the wealth of europe and the popular notion that as the quantity of the precious metals naturally increases with the increase of wealth so their value diminishes as their quantity increases may besides dispose many people to believe that their value still continues to fall in the european market and the still gradually increasing price of many parts of the rude produce of land may perhaps confirm them still further in this opinion  that the increase of the quantity of the precious metals in any country which arises from the increase of wealth has no tendency to diminish their value i have endeavored to show already gold and silver naturally resort to a rich country for the same reason that all sorts of luxuries and curiosities resort to it not because they are cheaper there than in poorer countries but because they are dearer or because a better price is given for them it is the superiority of price which attracts them and as soon as that superiority ceases they necessarily cease to go thither  if you except corn and such other vegetables as are raised altogether by human industry that all other sorts of rude produce cattle poultry game of all kinds the useful fossils and minerals of the earth etc naturally grow dearer as the society advances in wealth and improvement i have endeavored to show already though such commodities therefore come to exchange for a greater quantity of silver than before it will not from thence follow that silver has become really cheaper or will purchase less labor than before but that such commodities have become really dearer or will purchase more labor than before it is not their nominal price only but their real price which rises in the progress of improvement the rise of their nominal price is the effect not of any degradation of the value of silver but of the rise in their real price  different effects of the progress of improvement upon three different sorts of rude produce these different sorts of rude produce may be divided into three classes the first comprehends those which it is scarce in the power of human industry to multiply at all the second those which it can multiply in proportion to the demand the third those in which the efficacy of industry is either limited or uncertain in the progress of wealth and improvement the real price of the first may rise to any degree of extravagance and seems not to be limited by any certain boundary that of the second though it may rise greatly has however a certain boundary beyond which it cannot well pass for any considerable time together that of the third though its natural tendency is to rise in the progress of improvement yet in the same degree of improvement it may sometimes happen even to fall sometimes to continue the same and sometimes to rise more or less according as different accidents render the efforts of human industry in multiplying this sort of rude produce more or less successful  first sort the first sort of rude produce of which the price rises in the progress of improvement is that which it is scarce in the power of human industry to multiply at all it consists in those things which nature produces only in certain quantities and which being of a very perishable nature it is impossible to accumulate together the produce of many different seasons such are the greater part of rare and singular birds and fishes many different sorts of game almost all wildfowl all birds of passage in particular as well as many other things when wealth and the luxury which accompanies it increase the demand for these is likely to increase with them and no effort of human industry may be able to increase the supply much beyond what it was before this increase of the demand the quantity of such commodities therefore remaining the same or nearly the same while the competition to purchase them is continually increasing their price may rise to any degree of extravagance and seems not to be limited by any certain boundary if woodcocks should become so fashionable as to sell for twenty guineas apiece no effort of human industry could increase the number of those brought to market much beyond what it is at present the high price paid by the romans in the time of their greatest grandeur for rare birds and fishes may in this manner easily be accounted for these prices were not the effects of the low value of silver in those times but of the high value of such rarities and curiosities as human industry could not multiply at pleasure the real value of silver was higher at rome for some time before and after the fall of the republic than it is through the greater part of europe at present three sestertii equal to about sixpence sterling was the price which the republic paid for the modius or peck of the tithe wheat of sicily this price however was probably below the average market price the obligation to deliver their wheat at this rate being considered as a tax upon the sicilian farmers when the romans therefore had occasion to order more corn than the tithe of wheat amounted to they were bound by capitulation to pay for the surplus at the rate of four sestertii or eightpence sterling the peck and this had probably been reckoned the moderate and reasonable that is the ordinary or average contract price of those times it is equal to about one and twenty shillings the quarter eight and twenty shillings the quarter was before the late years of scarcity the ordinary contract price of english wheat which in quality is inferior to the sicilian and generally sells for a lower price in the european market the value of silver therefore in those ancient times must have been to its value in the present as three to four inversely that is three ounces of silver would then have purchased the same quantity of labor and commodities which four ounces will do at present when we read in pliny therefore that seius bought a white nightingale as a present for the empress agrippina at the price of six thousand sestertii equal to about fifty pounds of our present money and that asinius celer purchased a surmullet at the price of eight thousand sestertii equal to about sixtysix pounds thirteen shillings and fourpence of our present money the extravagance of those prices how much soever it may surprise us is apt notwithstanding to appear to us about onethird less than it really was their real price the quantity of labor and subsistence which was given away for them was about onethird more than their nominal price is apt to express to us in the present times seius gave for the nightingale the command of a quantity of labor and subsistence equal to what       s  d would purchase in the present times and asinius celer gave for the surmullet the command of a quantity equal to what       s  d would purchase what occasioned the extravagance of those high prices was not so much the abundance of silver as the abundance of labor and subsistence of which those romans had the disposal beyond what was necessary for their own use the quantity of silver of which they had the disposal was a good deal less than what the command of the same quantity of labor and subsistence would have procured to them in the present times  second sort the second sort of rude produce of which the price rises in the progress of improvement is that which human industry can multiply in proportion to the demand it consists in those useful plants and animals which in uncultivated countries nature produces with such profuse abundance that they are of little or no value and which as cultivation advances are therefore forced to give place to some more profitable produce during a long period in the progress of improvement the quantity of these is continually diminishing while at the same time the demand for them is continually increasing their real value therefore the real quantity of labor which they will purchase or command gradually rises till at last it gets so high as to render them as profitable a produce as any thing else which human industry can raise upon the most fertile and best cultivated land when it has got so high it cannot well go higher if it did more land and more industry would soon be employed to increase their quantity  when the price of cattle for example rises so high that it is as profitable to cultivate land in order to raise food for them as in order to raise food for man it cannot well go higher if it did more corn land would soon be turned into pasture the extension of tillage by diminishing the quantity of wild pasture diminishes the quantity of butchersmeat which the country naturally produces without labor or cultivation and by increasing the number of those who have either corn or what comes to the same thing the price of corn to give in exchange for it increases the demand the price of butchersmeat therefore and consequently of cattle must gradually rise till it gets so high that it becomes as profitable to employ the most fertile and best cultivated lands in raising food for them as in raising corn but it must always be late in the progress of improvement before tillage can be so far extended as to raise the price of cattle to this height and till it has got to this height if the country is advancing at all their price must be continually rising there are perhaps some parts of europe in which the price of cattle has not yet got to this height it had not got to this height in any part of scotland before the union had the scotch cattle been always confined to the market of scotland in a country in which the quantity of land which can be applied to no other purpose but the feeding of cattle is so great in proportion to what can be applied to other purposes it is scarce possible perhaps that their price could ever have risen so high as to render it profitable to cultivate land for the sake of feeding them in england the price of cattle it has already been observed seems in the neighborhood of london to have got to this height about the beginning of the last century but it was much later probably before it got to it through the greater part of the remoter counties in some of which perhaps it may scarce yet have got to it of all the different substances however which compose this second sort of rude produce cattle is perhaps that of which the price in the progress of improvement rises first to this height  till the price of cattle indeed has got to this height it seems scarce possible that the greater part even of those lands which are capable of the highest cultivation can be completely cultivated in all farms too distant from any town to carry manure from it that is in the far greater part of those of every extensive country the quantity of wellcultivated land must be in proportion to the quantity of manure which the farm itself produces and this again must be in proportion to the stock of cattle which are maintained upon it the land is manured either by pasturing the cattle upon it or by feeding them in the stable and from thence carrying out their dung to it but unless the price of the cattle be sufficient to pay both the rent and profit of cultivated land the farmer cannot afford to pasture them upon it and he can still less afford to feed them in the stable it is with the produce of improved and cultivated land only that cattle can be fed in the stable because to collect the scanty and scattered produce of waste and unimproved lands would require too much labor and be too expensive if the price of the cattle therefore is not sufficient to pay for the produce of improved and cultivated land when they are allowed to pasture it that price will be still less sufficient to pay for that produce when it must be collected with a good deal of additional labor and brought into the stable to them in these circumstances therefore no more cattle can with profit be fed in the stable than what are necessary for tillage but these can never afford manure enough for keeping constantly in good condition all the lands which they are capable of cultivating what they afford being insufficient for the whole farm will naturally be reserved for the lands to which it can be most advantageously or conveniently applied the most fertile or those perhaps in the neighborhood of the farmyard these therefore will be kept constantly in good condition and fit for tillage the rest will the greater part of them be allowed to lie waste producing scarce any thing but some miserable pasture just sufficient to keep alive a few straggling halfstarved cattle the farm though much understocked in proportion to what would be necessary for its complete cultivation being very frequently overstocked in proportion to its actual produce a portion of this waste land however after having been pastured in this wretched manner for six or seven years together may be ploughed up when it will yield perhaps a poor crop or two of bad oats or of some other coarse grain and then being entirely exhausted it must be rested and pastured again as before and another portion ploughed up to be in the same manner exhausted and rested again in its turn such accordingly was the general system of management all over the low country of scotland before the union the lands which were kept constantly well manured and in good condition seldom exceeded a third or a fourth part of the whole farm and sometimes did not amount to a fifth or a sixth part of it the rest were never manured but a certain portion of them was in its turn notwithstanding regularly cultivated and exhausted under this system of management it is evident even that part of the lands of scotland which is capable of good cultivation could produce but little in comparison of what it may be capable of producing but how disadvantageous soever this system may appear yet before the union the low price of cattle seems to have rendered it almost unavoidable if notwithstanding a great rise in their price it still continues to prevail through a considerable part of the country it is owing in many places no doubt to ignorance and attachment to old customs but in most places to the unavoidable obstructions which the natural course of things opposes to the immediate or speedy establishment of a better system first to the poverty of the tenants to their not having yet had time to acquire a stock of cattle sufficient to cultivate their lands more completely the same rise of price which would render it advantageous for them to maintain a greater stock rendering it more difficult for them to acquire it and secondly to their not having yet had time to put their lands in condition to maintain this greater stock properly supposing they were capable of acquiring it the increase of stock and the improvement of land are two events which must go hand in hand and of which the one can no where much outrun the other without some increase of stock there can be scarce any improvement of land but there can be no considerable increase of stock but in consequence of a considerable improvement of land because otherwise the land could not maintain it these natural obstructions to the establishment of a better system cannot be removed but by a long course of frugality and industry and half a century or a century more perhaps must pass away before the old system which is wearing out gradually can be completely abolished through all the different parts of the country of all commercial advantages however which scotland has derived from the union with england this rise in the price of cattle is perhaps the greatest it has not only raised the value of all highland estates but it has perhaps been the principal cause of the improvement of the low country  in all new colonies the great quantity of waste land which can for many years be applied to no other purpose but the feeding of cattle soon renders them extremely abundant and in every thing great cheapness is the necessary consequence of great abundance though all the cattle of the european colonies in america were originally carried from europe they soon multiplied so much there and became of so little value that even horses were allowed to run wild in the woods without any owner thinking it worth while to claim them it must be a long time after the first establishment of such colonies before it can become profitable to feed cattle upon the produce of cultivated land the same causes therefore the want of manure and the disproportion between the stock employed in cultivation and the land which it is destined to cultivate are likely to introduce there a system of husbandry not unlike that which still continues to take place in so many parts of scotland mr kalm the swedish travellor when he gives an account of the husbandry of some of the english colonies in north america as he found it in      observes accordingly that he can with difficulty discover there the character of the english nation so well skilled in all the different branches of agriculture they make scarce any manure for their corn fields he says but when one piece of ground has been exhausted by continual cropping they clear and cultivate another piece of fresh land and when that is exhausted proceed to a third their cattle are allowed to wander through the woods and other uncultivated grounds where they are half starved having long ago extirpated almost all the annual grasses by cropping them too early in the spring before they had time to form their flowers or to shed their seeds the annual grasses were it seems the best natural grasses in that part of north america and when the europeans first settled there they used to grow very thick and to rise three or four feet high a piece of ground which when he wrote could not maintain one cow would in former times he was assured have maintained four each of which would have given four times the quantity of milk which that one was capable of giving the poorness of the pasture had in his opinion occasioned the degradation of their cattle which degenerated sensibly from one generation to another they were probably not unlike that stunted breed which was common all over scotland thirty or forty years ago and which is now so much mendedthrough the greater part of the low country not so much by a change of the breed though that expedient has been employed in some places as by a more plentiful method of feeding them  though it is late therefore in the progress of improvement before cattle can bring such a price as to render it profitable to cultivate land for the sake of feeding them yet of all the different parts which compose this second sort of rude produce they are perhaps the first which bring this price because till they bring it it seems impossible that improvement can be brought near even to that degree of perfection to which it has arrived in many parts of europe  as cattle are among the first so perhaps venison is among the last parts of this sort of rude produce which bring this price the price of venison in great britain how extravagant soever it may appear is not near sufficient to compensate the expense of a deer park as is well known to all those who have had any experience in the feeding of deer if it was otherwise the feeding of deer would soon become an article of common farming in the same manner as the feeding of those small birds called turdi was among the ancient romans varro and columella assure us that it was a most profitable article the fattening of ortolans birds of passage which arrive lean in the country is said to be so in some parts of france if venison continues in fashion and the wealth and luxury of great britain increase as they have done for some time past its price may very probably rise still higher than it is at present  between that period in the progress of improvement which brings to its height the price of so necessary an article as cattle and that which brings to it the price of such a superfluity as venison there is a very long interval in the course of which many other sorts of rude produce gradually arrive at their highest price some sooner and some later according to different circumstances  thus in every farm the offals of the barn and stables will maintain a certain number of poultry these as they are fed with what would otherwise be lost are a mere saveall and as they cost the farmer scarce any thing so he can afford to sell them for very little almost all that he gets is pure gain and their price can scarce be so low as to discourage him from feeding this number but in countries ill cultivated and therefore but thinly inhabited the poultry which are thus raised without expense are often fully sufficient to supply the whole demand in this state of things therefore they are often as cheap as butchersmeat or any other sort of animal food but the whole quantity of poultry which the farm in this manner produces without expense must always be much smaller than the whole quantity of butchers meat which is reared upon it and in times of wealth and luxury what is rare with only nearly equal merit is always preferred to what is common as wealth and luxury increase therefore in consequence of improvement and cultivation the price of poultry gradually rises above that of butchers meat till at last it gets so high that it becomes profitable to cultivate land for the sake of feeding them when it has got to this height it cannot well go higher if it did more land would soon be turned to this purpose in several provinces of france the feeding of poultry is considered as a very important article in rural economy and sufficiently profitable to encourage the farmer to raise a considerable quantity of indian corn and buck wheat for this purpose a middling farmer will there sometimes have four hundred fowls in his yard the feeding of poultry seems scarce yet to be generally considered as a matter of so much importance in england they are certainly however dearer in england than in france as england receives considerable supplies from france in the progress of improvement the period at which every particular sort of animal food is dearest must naturally be that which immediately preceeds the general practice of cultivating land for the sake of raising it for some time before this practice becomes general the scarcity must necessarily raise the price after it has become general new methods of feeding are commonly fallen upon which enable the farmer to raise upon the same quantity of ground a much greater quantity of that particular sort of animal food the plenty not only obliges him to sell cheaper but in consequence of these improvements he can afford to sell cheaper for if he could not afford it the plenty would not be of long continuance it has been probably in this manner that the introduction of clover turnips carrots cabbages etc has contributed to sink the common price of butchersmeat in the london market somewhat below what it was about the beginning of the last century  the hog that finds his food among ordure and greedily devours many things rejected by every other useful animal is like poultry originally kept as a saveall as long as the number of such animals which can thus be reared at little or no expense is fully sufficient to supply the demand this sort of butchersmeat comes to market at a much lower price than any other but when the demand rises beyond what this quantity can supply when it becomes necessary to raise food on purpose for feeding and fattening hogs in the same manner as for feeding and fattening other cattle the price necessarily rises and becomes proportionably either higher or lower than that of other butchersmeat according as the nature of the country and the state of its agriculture happen to render the feeding of hogs more or less expensive than that of other cattle in france according to mr buffon the price of pork is nearly equal to that of beef in most parts of great britain it is at present somewhat higher  the great rise in the price both of hogs and poultry has in great britain been frequently imputed to the diminution of the number of cottagers and other small occupiers of land an event which has in every part of europe been the immediate forerunner of improvement and better cultivation but which at the same time may have contributed to raise the price of those articles both somewhat sooner and somewhat faster than it would otherwise have risen as the poorest family can often maintain a cat or a dog without any expense so the poorest occupiers of land can commonly maintain a few poultry or a sow and a few pigs at very little the little offals of their own table their whey skimmed milk and buttermilk supply those animals with a part of their food and they find the rest in the neighboring fields without doing any sensible damage to any body by diminishing the number of those small occupiers therefore the quantity of this sort of provisions which is thus produced at little or no expense must certainly have been a good deal diminished and their price must consequently have been raised both sooner and faster than it would otherwise have risen sooner or later however in the progress of improvement it must at any rate have risen to the utmost height to which it is capable of rising or to the price which pays the labor and expense of cultivating the land which furnishes them with food as well as these are paid upon the greater part of other cultivated land  the business of the dairy like the feeding of hogs and poultry is originally carried on as a saveall the cattle necessarily kept upon the farm produce more milk than either the rearing of their own young or the consumption of the farmers family requires and they produce most at one particular season but of all the productions of land milk is perhaps the most perishable in the warm season when it is most abundant it will scarce keep four and twenty hours the farmer by making it into fresh butter stores a small part of it for a week by making it into salt butter for a year and by making it into cheese he stores a much greater part of it for several years part of all these is reserved for the use of his own family the rest goes to market in order to find the best price which is to be had and which can scarce be so low as to discourage him from sending thither whatever is over and above the use of his own family if it is very low indeed he will be likely to manage his dairy in a very slovenly and dirty manner and will scarce perhaps think it worth while to have a particular room or building on purpose for it but will suffer the business to be carried on amidst the smoke filth and nastiness of his own kitchen as was the case of almost all the farmers dairies in scotland thirty or forty years ago and as is the case of many of them still the same causes which gradually raise the price of butchersmeat the increase of the demand and in consequence of the improvement of the country the diminution of the quantity which can be fed at little or no expense raise in the same manner that of the produce of the dairy of which the price naturally connects with that of butchersmeat or with the expense of feeding cattle the increase of price pays for more labor care and cleanliness the dairy becomes more worthy of the farmers attention and the quality of its produce gradually improves the price at last gets so high that it becomes worth while to employ some of the most fertile and best cultivated lands in feeding cattle merely for the purpose of the dairy and when it has got to this height it cannot well go higher if it did more land would soon be turned to this purpose it seems to have got to this height through the greater part of england where much good land is commonly employed in this manner if you except the neighborhood of a few considerable towns it seems not yet to have got to this height any where in scotland where common farmers seldom employ much good land in raising food for cattle merely for the purpose of the dairy the price of the produce though it has risen very considerably within these few years is probably still too low to admit of it the inferiority of the quality indeed compared with that of the produce of english dairies is fully equal to that of the price but this inferiority of quality is perhaps rather the effect of this lowness of price than the cause of it though the quality was much better the greater part of what is brought to market could not i apprehend in the present circumstances of the country be disposed of at a much better price and the present price it is probable would not pay the expense of the land and labor necessary for producing a much better quality through the greater part of england notwithstanding the superiority of price the dairy is not reckoned a more profitable employment of land than the raising of corn or the fattening of cattle the two great objects of agriculture through the greater part of scotland therefore it cannot yet be equally profitable  the lands of no country it is evident can ever be completely cultivated and improved till once the price of every produce which human industry is obliged to raise upon them has got so high as to pay for the expense of complete improvement and cultivation in order to do this the price of each particular produce must be sufficient first to pay the rent of good corn land as it is that which regulates the rent of the greater part of other cultivated land and secondly to pay the labor and expense of the farmer as well as they are commonly paid upon good corn land or in other words to replace with the ordinary profits the stock which he employs about it this rise in the price of each particular produce must evidently be previous to the improvement and cultivation of the land which is destined for raising it gain is the end of all improvement and nothing could deserve that name of which loss was to be the necessary consequence but loss must be the necessary consequence of improving land for the sake of a produce of which the price could never bring back the expense if the complete improvement and cultivation of the country be as it most certainly is the greatest of all public advantages this rise in the price of all those different sorts of rude produce instead of being considered as a public calamity ought to be regarded as the necessary forerunner and attendant of the greatest of all public advantages  this rise too in the nominal or money price of all those different sorts of rude produce has been the effect not of any degradation in the value of silver but of a rise in their real price they have become worth not only a greater quantity of silver but a greater quantity of labor and subsistence than before as it costs a greater quantity of labor and subsistence to bring them to market so when they are brought thither they represent or are equivalent to a greater quantity  third sort the third and last sort of rude produce of which the price naturally rises in the progress of improvement is that in which the efficacy of human industry in augmenting the quantity is either limited or uncertain though the real price of this sort of rude produce therefore naturally tends to rise in the progress of improvement yet according as different accidents happen to render the efforts of human industry more or less successful in augmenting the quantity it may happen sometimes even to fall sometimes to continue the same in very different periods of improvement and sometimes to rise more or less in the same period  there are some sorts of rude produce which nature has rendered a kind of appendages to other sorts so that the quantity of the one which any country can afford is necessarily limited by that of the other the quantity of wool or of raw hides for example which any country can afford is necessarily limited by the number of great and small cattle that are kept in it the state of its improvement and the nature of its agriculture again necessarily determine this number  the same causes which in the progress of improvement gradually raise the price of butchersmeat should have the same effect it may be thought upon the prices of wool and raw hides and raise them too nearly in the same proportion it probably would be so if in the rude beginnings of improvement the market for the latter commodities was confined within as narrow bounds as that for the former but the extent of their respective markets is commonly extremely different  the market for butchersmeat is almost every where confined to the country which produces it ireland and some part of british america indeed carry on a considerable trade in salt provisions but they are i believe the only countries in the commercial world which do so or which export to other countries any considerable part of their butchersmeat  the market for wool and raw hides on the contrary is in the rude beginnings of improvement very seldom confined to the country which produces them they can easily be transported to distant countries wool without any preparation and raw hides with very little and as they are the materials of many manufactures the industry of other countries may occasion a demand for them though that of the country which produces them might not occasion any  in countries ill cultivated and therefore but thinly inhabited the price of the wool and the hide bears always a much greater proportion to that of the whole beast than in countries where improvement and population being further advanced there is more demand for butchersmeat mr hume observes that in the saxon times the fleece was estimated at twofifths of the value of the whole sheep and that this was much above the proportion of its present estimation in some provinces of spain i have been assured the sheep is frequently killed merely for the sake of the fleece and the tallow the carcass is often left to rot upon the ground or to be devoured by beasts and birds of prey if this sometimes happens even in spain it happens almost constantly in chili at buenos airs and in many other parts of spanish america where the horned cattle are almost constantly killed merely for the sake of the hide and the tallow this too used to happen almost constantly in hispaniola while it was infested by the buccaneers and before the settlement improvement and populousness of the french plantations which now extend round the coast of almost the whole western half of the island had given some value to the cattle of the spaniards who still continue to possess not only the eastern part of the coast but the whole inland and mountainous part of the country  though in the progress of improvement and population the price of the whole beast necessarily rises yet the price of the carcass is likely to be much more affected by this rise than that of the wool and the hide the market for the carcass being in the rude state of society confined always to the country which produces it must necessarily be extended in proportion to the improvement and population of that country but the market for the wool and the hides even of a barbarous country often extending to the whole commercial world it can very seldom be enlarged in the same proportion the state of the whole commercial world can seldom be much affected by the improvement of any particular country and the market for such commodities may remain the same or very nearly the same after such improvements as before it should however in the natural course of things rather upon the whole be somewhat extended in consequence of them if the manufactures especially of which those commodities are the materials should ever come to flourish in the country the market though it might not be much enlarged would at least be brought much nearer to the place of growth than before and the price of those materials might at least be increased by what had usually been the expense of transporting them to distant countries though it might not rise therefore in the same proportion as that of butchersmeat it ought naturally to rise somewhat and it ought certainly not to fall  in england however notwithstanding the flourishing state of its woollen manufacture the price of english wool has fallen very considerably since the time of edward iii there are many authentic records which demonstrate that during the reign of that prince toward the middle of the fourteenth century or about      what was reckoned the moderate and reasonable price of the tod or twentyeight pounds of english wool was not less than ten shillings of the money of those times see smiths memoirs of wool  containing at the rate of twentypence the ounce six ounces of silver towerweight equal to about thirty shillings of our present money in the present times one and twenty shillings the tod may be reckoned a good price for very good english wool the moneyprice of wool therefore in the time of edward iii was to its moneyprice in the present times as ten to seven the superiority of its real price was still greater at the rate of six shillings and eightpence the quarter ten shillings was in those ancient times the price of twelve bushels of wheat at the rate of twentyeight shillings the quarter one and twenty shillings is in the present times the price of six bushels only the proportion between the real prices of ancient and modern times therefore is as twelve to six or as two to one in those ancient times a tod of wool would have purchased twice the quantity of subsistence which it will purchase at present and consequently twice the quantity of labor if the real recompense of labor had been the same in both periods  this degradation both in the real and nominal value of wool could never have happened in consequence of the natural course of things it has accordingly been the effect of violence and artifice first of the absolute prohibition of exporting wool from england secondly of the permission of importing it from all other countries duty free thirdly of the prohibition of exporting it from ireland to any other country but england in consequence of these regulations the market for english wool instead of being somewhat extended in consequence of the improvement of england has been confined to the home market where the wool of all other countries is allowed to come into competition with it and where that of ireland is forced into competition with it as the woollen manufactures too of ireland are fully as much discouraged as is consistent with justice and fair dealing the irish can work up but a small part of their own wool at home and are therefore obliged to send a greater proportion of it to great britain the only market they are allowed  i have not been able to find any such authentic records concerning the price of raw hides in ancient times wool was commonly paid as a subsidy to the king and its valuation in that subsidy ascertains at least in some degree what was its ordinary price but this seems not to have been the case with raw hides fleetwood however from an account in      between the prior of burcester oxford and one of his canons gives us their price at least as it was stated upon that particular occasion viz five ox hides at twelve shillings five cow hides at seven shillings and threepence thirtysix sheeps skins of two years old at nine shillings sixteen calves skins at two shillings in      twelve shillings contained about the same quantity of silver as four and twenty shillings of our present money an ox hide therefore was in this account valued at the same quantity of silver as  s ths of our present money its nominal price was a good deal lower than at present but at the rate of six shillings and eightpence the quarter twelve shillings would in those times have purchased fourteen bushels and fourfifths of a bushel of wheat which at three and sixpence the bushel would in the present times cost   s  d an ox hide therefore would in those times have purchased as much corn as ten shillings and threepence would purchase at present its real value was equal to ten shillings and threepence of our present money in those ancient times when the cattle were half starved during the greater part of the winter we cannot suppose that they were of a very large size an ox hide which weighs four stone of sixteen pounds averdupois is not in the present times reckoned a bad one and in those ancient times would probably have been reckoned a very good one but at half a crown the stone which at this moment february      i understand to be the common price such a hide would at present cost only ten shillings though its nominal price therefore is higher in the present than it was in those ancient times its real price the real quantity of subsistence which it will purchase or command is rather somewhat lower the price of cow hides as stated in the above account is nearly in the common proportion to that of ox hides that of sheep skins is a good deal above it they had probably been sold with the wool that of calves skins on the contrary is greatly below it in countries where the price of cattle is very low the calves which are not intended to be reared in order to keep up the stock are generally killed very young as was the case in scotland twenty or thirty years ago it saves the milk which their price would not pay for their skins therefore are commonly good for little  the price of raw hides is a good deal lower at present than it was a few years ago owing probably to the taking off the duty upon seal skins and to the allowing for a limited time the importation of raw hides from ireland and from the plantations duty free which was done in      take the whole of the present century at an average their real price has probably been somewhat higher than it was in those ancient times the nature of the commodity renders it not quite so proper for being transported to distant markets as wool it suffers more by keeping a salted hide is reckoned inferior to a fresh one and sells for a lower price this circumstance must necessarily have some tendency to sink the price of raw hides produced in a country which does not manufacture them but is obliged to export them and comparatively to raise that of those produced in a country which does manufacture them it must have some tendency to sink their price in a barbarous and to raise it in an improved and manufacturing country it must have had some tendency therefore to sink it in ancient and to raise it in modern times our tanners besides have not been quite so successful as our clothiers in convincing the wisdom of the nation that the safety of the commonwealth depends upon the prosperity of their particular manufacture they have accordingly been much less favored the exportation of raw hides has indeed been prohibited and declared a nuisance but their importation from foreign countries has been subjected to a duty and though this duty has been taken off from those of ireland and the plantations for the limited time of five years only yet ireland has not been confined to the market of great britain for the sale of its surplus hides or of those which are not manufactured at home the hides of common cattle have but within these few years been put among the enumerated commodities which the plantations can send nowhere but to the mother country neither has the commerce of ireland been in this case oppressed hitherto in order to support the manufactures of great britain  whatever regulations tend to sink the price either of wool or of raw hides below what it naturally would be must in an improved and cultivated country have some tendency to raise the price of butchersmeat the price both of the great and small cattle which are fed on improved and cultivated land must be sufficient to pay the rent which the landlord and the profit which the farmer has reason to expect from improved and cultivated land if it is not they will soon cease to feed them whatever part of this price therefore is not paid by the wool and the hide must be paid by the carcass the less there is paid for the one the more must be paid for the other in what manner this price is to be divided upon the different parts of the beast is indifferent to the landlords and farmers provided it is all paid to them in an improved and cultivated country therefore their interest as landlords and farmers cannot be much affected by such regulations though their interest as consumers may by the rise in the price of provisions it would be quite otherwise however in an unimproved and uncultivated country where the greater part of the lands could be applied to no other purpose but the feeding of cattle and where the wool and the hide made the principal part of the value of those cattle their interest as landlords and farmers would in this case be very deeply affected by such regulations and their interest as consumers very little the fall in the price of the wool and the hide would not in this case raise the price of the carcass because the greater part of the lands of the country being applicable to no other purpose but the feeding of cattle the same number would still continue to be fed the same quantity of butchersmeat would still come to market the demand for it would be no greater than before its price therefore would be the same as before the whole price of cattle would fall and along with it both the rent and the profit of all those lands of which cattle was the principal produce that is of the greater part of the lands of the country the perpetual prohibition of the exportation of wool which is commonly but very falsely ascribed to edward iii would in the then circumstances of the country have been the most destructive regulation which could well have been thought of it would not only have reduced the actual value of the greater part of the lands of the kingdom but by reducing the price of the most important species of small cattle it would have retarded very much its subsequent improvement  the wool of scotland fell very considerably in its price in consequence of the union with england by which it was excluded from the great market of europe and confined to the narrow one of great britain the value of the greater part of the lands in the southern counties of scotland which are chiefly a sheep country would have been very deeply affected by this event had not the rise in the price of butchersmeat fully compensated the fall in the price of wool  as the efficacy of human industry in increasing the quantity either of wool or of raw hides is limited so far as it depends upon the produce of the country where it is exerted so it is uncertain so far as it depends upon the produce of other countries it so far depends not so much upon the quantity which they produce as upon that which they do not manufacture and upon the restraints which they may or may not think proper to impose upon the exportation of this sort of rude produce these circumstances as they are altogether independent of domestic industry so they necessarily render the efficacy of its efforts more or less uncertain in multiplying this sort of rude produce therefore the efficacy of human industry is not only limited but uncertain  in multiplying another very important sort of rude produce the quantity of fish that is brought to market it is likewise both limited and uncertain it is limited by the local situation of the country by the proximity or distance of its different provinces from the sea by the number of its lakes and rivers and by what may be called the fertility or barrenness of those seas lakes and rivers as to this sort of rude produce as population increases as the annual produce of the land and labor of the country grows greater and greater there come to be more buyers of fish and those buyers too have a greater quantity and variety of other goods or what is the same thing the price of a greater quantity and variety of other goods to buy with but it will generally be impossible to supply the great and extended market without employing a quantity of labor greater than in proportion to what had been requisite for supplying the narrow and confined one a market which from requiring only one thousand comes to require annually ten thousand tun of fish can seldom be supplied without employing more than ten times the quantity of labor which had before been sufficient to supply it the fish must generally be sought for at a greater distance larger vessels must be employed and more expensive machinery of every kind made use of the real price of this commodity therefore naturally rises in the progress of improvement it has accordingly done so i believe more or less in every country  though the success of a particular days fishing may be a very uncertain matter yet the local situation of the country being supposed the general efficacy of industry in bringing a certain quantity of fish to market taking the course of a year or of several years together it may perhaps be thought is certain enough and it no doubt is so as it depends more however upon the local situation of the country than upon the state of its wealth and industry as upon this account it may in different countries be the same in very different periods of improvement and very different in the same period its connection with the state of improvement is uncertain and it is of this sort of uncertainty that i am here speaking  in increasing the quantity of the different minerals and metals which are drawn from the bowels of the earth that of the more precious ones particularly the efficacy of human industry seems not to be limited but to be altogether uncertain  the quantity of the precious metals which is to be found in any country is not limited by any thing in its local situation such as the fertility or barrenness of its own mines those metals frequently abound in countries which possess no mines their quantity in every particular country seems to depend upon two different circumstances first upon its power of purchasing upon the state of its industry upon the annual produce of its land and labor in consequence of which it can afford to employ a greater or a smaller quantity of labor and subsistence in bringing or purchasing such superfluities as gold and silver either from its own mines or from those of other countries and secondly upon the fertility or barrenness of the mines which may happen at any particular time to supply the commercial world with those metals the quantity of those metals in the countries most remote from the mines must be more or less affected by this fertility or barrenness on account of the easy and cheap transportation of those metals of their small bulk and great value their quantity in china and indostan must have been more or less affected by the abundance of the mines of america  so far as their quantity in any particular country depends upon the former of those two circumstances the power of purchasing their real price like that of all other luxuries and superfluities is likely to rise with the wealth and improvement of the country and to fall with its poverty and depression countries which have a great quantity of labor and subsistence to spare can afford to purchase any particular quantity of those metals at the expense of a greater quantity of labor and subsistence than countries which have less to spare  so far as their quantity in any particular country depends upon the latter of those two circumstances the fertility or barrenness of the mines which happen to supply the commercial world their real price the real quantity of labor and subsistence which they will purchase or exchange for will no doubt sink more or less in proportion to the fertility and rise in proportion to the barrenness of those mines  the fertility or barrenness of the mines however which may happen at any particular time to supply the commercial world is a circumstance which it is evident may have no sort of connection with the state of industry in a particular country it seems even to have no very necessary connection with that of the world in general as arts and commerce indeed gradually spread themselves over a greater and a greater part of the earth the search for new mines being extended over a wider surface may have somewhat a better chance for being successful than when confined within narrower bounds the discovery of new mines however as the old ones come to be gradually exhausted is a matter of the greatest uncertainty and such as no human skill or industry can ensure all indications it is acknowledged are doubtful and the actual discovery and successful working of a new mine can alone ascertain the reality of its value or even of its existence in this search there seem to be no certain limits either to the possible success or to the possible disappointment of human industry in the course of a century or two it is possible that new mines may be discovered more fertile than any that have ever yet been known and it is just equally possible that the most fertile mine then known may be more barren than any that was wrought before the discovery of the mines of america whether the one or the other of those two events may happen to take place is of very little importance to the real wealth and prosperity of the world to the real value of the annual produce of the land and labor of mankind its nominal value the quantity of gold and silver by which this annual produce could be expressed or represented would no doubt be very different but its real value the real quantity of labor which it could purchase or command would be precisely the same a shilling might in the one case represent no more labor than a penny does at present and a penny in the other might represent as much as a shilling does now but in the one case he who had a shilling in his pocket would be no richer than he who has a penny at present and in the other he who had a penny would be just as rich as he who has a shilling now the cheapness and abundance of gold and silver plate would be the sole advantage which the world could derive from the one event and the dearness and scarcity of those trifling superfluities the only inconveniency it could suffer from the other  conclusion of the digression concerning the variations in the value of silver the greater part of the writers who have collected the money prices of things in ancient times seem to have considered the low money price of corn and of goods in general or in other words the high value of gold and silver as a proof not only of the scarcity of those metals but of the poverty and barbarism of the country at the time when it took place this notion is connected with the system of political economy which represents national wealth as consisting in the abundance and national poverty in the scarcity of gold and silver a system which i shall endeavor to explain and examine at great length in the fourth book of this enquiry i shall only observe at present that the high value of the precious metals can be no proof of the poverty or barbarism of any particular country at the time when it took place it is a proof only of the barrenness of the mines which happened at that time to supply the commercial world a poor country as it cannot afford to buy more so it can as little afford to pay dearer for gold and silver than a rich one and the value of those metals therefore is not likely to be higher in the former than in the latter in china a country much richer than any part of europe the value of the precious metals is much higher than in any part of europe as the wealth of europe indeed has increased greatly since the discovery of the mines of america so the value of gold and silver has gradually diminished this diminution of their value however has not been owing to the increase of the real wealth of europe of the annual produce of its land and labor but to the accidental discovery of more abundant mines than any that were known before the increase of the quantity of gold and silver in europe and the increase of its manufactures and agriculture are two events which though they have happened nearly about the same time yet have arisen from very different causes and have scarce any natural connection with one another the one has arisen from a mere accident in which neither prudence nor policy either had or could have any share the other from the fall of the feudal system and from the establishment of a government which afforded to industry the only encouragement which it requires some tolerable security that it shall enjoy the fruits of its own labor poland where the feudal system still continues to take place is at this day as beggarly a country as it was before the discovery of america the money price of corn however has risen the real value of the precious metals has fallen in poland in the same manner as in other parts of europe their quantity therefore must have increased there as in other places and nearly in the same proportion to the annual produce of its land and labor this increase of the quantity of those metals however has not it seems increased that annual produce has neither improved the manufactures and agriculture of the country nor mended the circumstances of its inhabitants spain and portugal the countries which possess the mines are after poland perhaps the two most beggarly countries in europe the value of the precious metals however must be lower in spain and portugal than in any other part of europe as they come from those countries to all other parts of europe loaded not only with a freight and an insurance but with the expense of smuggling their exportation being either prohibited or subjected to a duty in proportion to the annual produce of the land and labor therefore their quantity must be greater in those countries than in any other part of europe those countries however are poorer than the greater part of europe though the feudal system has been abolished in spain and portugal it has not been succeeded by a much better  as the low value of gold and silver therefore is no proof of the wealth and flourishing state of the country where it takes place so neither is their high value or the low money price either of goods in general or of corn in particular any proof of its poverty and barbarism  but though the low money price either of goods in general or of corn in particular be no proof of the poverty or barbarism of the times the low money price of some particular sorts of goods such as cattle poultry game of all kinds in proportion to that of corn is a most decisive one it clearly demonstrates first their great abundance in proportion to that of corn and consequently the great extent of the land which they occupied in proportion to what was occupied by corn and secondly the low value of this land in proportion to that of corn land and consequently the uncultivated and unimproved state of the far greater part of the lands of the country it clearly demonstrates that the stock and population of the country did not bear the same proportion to the extent of its territory which they commonly do in civilized countries and that society was at that time and in that country but in its infancy from the high or low money price either of goods in general or of corn in particular we can infer only that the mines which at that time happened to supply the commercial world with gold and silver were fertile or barren not that the country was rich or poor but from the high or low money price of some sorts of goods in proportion to that of others we can infer with a degree of probability that approaches almost to certainty that it was rich or poor that the greater part of its lands were improved or unimproved and that it was either in a more or less barbarous state or in a more or less civilized one  any rise in the money price of goods which proceeded altogether from the degradation of the value of silver would affect all sorts of goods equally and raise their price universally a third or a fourth or a fifth part higher according as silver happened to lose a third or a fourth or a fifth part of its former value but the rise in the price of provisions which has been the subject of so much reasoning and conversation does not affect all sorts of provisions equally taking the course of the present century at an average the price of corn it is acknowledged even by those who account for this rise by the degradation of the value of silver has risen much less than that of some other sorts of provisions the rise in the price of those other sorts of provisions therefore cannot be owing altogether to the degradation of the value of silver some other causes must be taken into the account and those which have been above assigned will perhaps without having recourse to the supposed degradation of the value of silver sufficiently explain this rise in those particular sorts of provisions of which the price has actually risen in proportion to that of corn  as to the price of corn itself it has during the sixtyfour first years of the present century and before the late extraordinary course of bad seasons been somewhat lower than it was during the sixtyfour last years of the preceding century this fact is attested not only by the accounts of windsor market but by the public fiars of all the different counties of scotland and by the accounts of several different markets in france which have been collected with great diligence and fidelity by mr messance and by mr dupre de st maur the evidence is more complete than could well have been expected in a matter which is naturally so very difficult to be ascertained  as to the high price of corn during these last ten or twelve years it can be sufficiently accounted for from the badness of the seasons without supposing any degradation in the value of silver  the opinion therefore that silver is continually sinking in its value seems not to be founded upon any good observations either upon the prices of corn or upon those of other provisions  the same quantity of silver it may perhaps be said will in the present times even according to the account which has been here given purchase a much smaller quantity of several sorts of provisions than it would have done during some part of the last century and to ascertain whether this change be owing to a rise in the value of those goods or to a fall in the value of silver is only to establish a vain and useless distinction which can be of no sort of service to the man who has only a certain quantity of silver to go to market with or a certain fixed revenue in money i certainly do not pretend that the knowledge of this distinction will enable him to buy cheaper it may not however upon that account be altogether useless  it may be of some use to the public by affording an easy proof of the prosperous condition of the country if the rise in the price of some sorts of provisions be owing altogether to a fall in the value of silver it is owing to a circumstance from which nothing can be inferred but the fertility of the american mines the real wealth of the country the annual produce of its land and labor may notwithstanding this circumstance be either gradually declining as in portugal and poland or gradually advancing as in most other parts of europe but if this rise in the price of some sorts of provisions be owing to a rise in the real value of the land which produces them to its increased fertility or in consequence of more extended improvement and good cultivation to its having been rendered fit for producing corn it is owing to a circumstance which indicates in the clearest manner the prosperous and advancing state of the country the land constitutes by far the greatest the most important and the most durable part of the wealth of every extensive country it may surely be of some use or at least it may give some satisfaction to the public to have so decisive a proof of the increasing value of by far the greatest the most important and the most durable part of its wealth  it may too be of some use to the public in regulating the pecuniary reward of some of its inferior servants if this rise in the price of some sorts of provisions be owing to a fall in the value of silver their pecuniary reward provided it was not too large before ought certainly to be augmented in proportion to the extent of this fall if it is not augmented their real recompense will evidently be so much diminished but if this rise of price is owing to the increased value in consequence of the improved fertility of the land which produces such provisions it becomes a much nicer matter to judge either in what proportion any pecuniary reward ought to be augmented or whether it ought to be augmented at all the extension of improvement and cultivation as it necessarily raises more or less in proportion to the price of corn that of every sort of animal food so it as necessarily lowers that of i believe every sort of vegetable food it raises the price of animal food because a great part of the land which produces it being rendered fit for producing corn must afford to the landlord and farmer the rent and profit of corn land it lowers the price of vegetable food because by increasing the fertility of the land it increases its abundance the improvements of agriculture too introduce many sorts of vegetable food which requiring less land and not more labor than corn come much cheaper to market such are potatoes and maize or what is called indian corn the two most important improvements which the agriculture of europe perhaps which europe itself has received from the great extension of its commerce and navigation many sorts of vegetable food besides which in the rude state of agriculture are confined to the kitchen garden and raised only by the spade come in its improved state to be introduced into common fields and to be raised by the plough such as turnips carrots cabbages etc if in the progress of improvement therefore the real price of one species of food necessarily rises that of another as necessarily falls and it becomes a matter of more nicety to judge how far the rise in the one may be compensated by the fall in the other when the real price of butchers meat has once got to its height which with regard to every sort except perhaps that of hogs flesh it seems to have done through a great part of england more than a century ago any rise which can afterward happen in that of any other sort of animal food cannot much affect the circumstances of the inferior ranks of people the circumstances of the poor through a great part of england cannot surely be so much distressed by any rise in the price of poultry fish wildfowl or venison as they must be relieved by the fall in that of potatoes  in the present season of scarcity the high price of corn no doubt distresses the poor but in times of moderate plenty when corn is at its ordinary or average price the natural rise in the price of any other sort of rude produce cannot much affect them they suffer more perhaps by the artificial rise which has been occasioned by taxes in the price of some manufactured commodities as of salt soap leather candles malt beer and ale etc  effects of the progress of improvement upon the real price of manufactures it is the natural effect of improvement however to diminish gradually the real price of almost all manufactures that of the manufacturing workmanship diminishes perhaps in all of them without exception in consequence of better machinery of greater dexterity and of a more proper division and distribution of work all of which are the natural effects of improvement a much smaller quantity of labor becomes requisite for executing any particular piece of work and though in consequence of the flourishing circumstances of the society the real price of labor should rise very considerably yet the great diminution of the quantity will generally much more than compensate the greatest rise which can happen in the price  there are indeed a few manufactures in which the necessary rise in the real price of the rude materials will more than compensate all the advantages which improvement can introduce into the execution of the work in carpenters and joiners work and in the coarser sort of cabinet work the necessary rise in the real price of barren timber in consequence of the improvement of land will more than compensate all the advantages which can be derived from the best machinery the greatest dexterity and the most proper division and distribution of work  but in all cases in which the real price of the rude materials either does not rise at all or does not rise very much that of the manufactured commodity sinks very considerably  this diminution of price has in the course of the present and preceding century been most remarkable in those manufactures of which the materials are the coarser metals a better movement of a watch than about the middle of the last century could have been bought for twenty pounds may now perhaps be had for twenty shillings in the work of cutlers and locksmiths in all the toys which are made of the coarser metals and in all those goods which are commonly known by the name of birmingham and sheffield ware there has been during the same period a very great reduction of price though not altogether so great as in watch work it has however been sufficient to astonish the workmen of every other part of europe who in many cases acknowledge that they can produce no work of equal goodness for double or even for triple the price there are perhaps no manufactures in which the division of labor can be carried further or in which the machinery employed admits of a greater variety of improvements than those of which the materials are the coarser metals  in the clothing manufacture there has during the same period been no such sensible reduction of price the price of superfine cloth i have been assured on the contrary has within these five and twenty or thirty years risen somewhat in proportion to its quality owing it was said to a considerable rise in the price of the material which consists altogether of spanish wool that of the yorkshire cloth which is made altogether of english wool is said indeed during the course of the present century to have fallen a good deal in proportion to its quality quality however is so very disputable a matter that i look upon all informations of this kind as somewhat uncertain in the clothing manufacture the division of labor is nearly the same now as it was a century ago and the machinery employed is not very different there may however have been some small improvements in both which may have occasioned some reduction of price  the reduction however will appear much more sensible and undeniable if we compare the price of this manufacture in the present times with what it was in a much remoter period toward the end of the fifteenth century when the labor was probably much less subdivided and the machinery employed much more imperfect than it is at present  in      being the  th of henry viith it was enacted that whosoever shall sell by retail a broad yard of the finest scarlet grained or of other grained cloth of the finest making above sixteen shillings shall forfeit forty shillings for every yard so sold sixteen shillings therefore containing about the same quantity of silver as four and twenty shillings of our present money was at that time reckoned not an unreasonable price for a yard of the finest cloth and as this is a sumptuary law such cloth it is probable had usually been sold somewhat dearer a guinea may be reckoned the highest price in the present times even though the quality of the cloths therefore should be supposed equal and that of the present times is most probably much superior yet even upon this supposition the money price of the finest cloth appears to have been considerably reduced since the end of the fifteenth century but its real price has been much more reduced six shillings and eightpence was then and long afterward reckoned the average price of a quarter of wheat sixteen shillings therefore was the price of two quarters and more than three bushels of wheat valuing a quarter of wheat in the present times at eight and twenty shillings the real price of a yard of fine cloth must in those times have been equal to at least three pounds six shillings and sixpence of our present money the man who bought it must have parted with the command of a quantity of labor and subsistence equal to what that sum would purchase in the present times  the reduction in the real price of the coarse manufacture though considerable has not been so great as in that of the fine  in      being the  d of edward ivth it was enacted that no servant in husbandry nor common labourer nor servant to any artificer inhabiting out of a city or burgh shall use or wear in their clothing any cloth above two shillings the broad yard in the  d of edward the ivth two shillings contained very nearly the same quantity of silver as four of our present money but the yorkshire cloth which is now sold at four shillings the yard is probably much superior to any that was then made for the wearing of the very poorest order of common servants even the money price of their clothing therefore may in proportion to the quality be somewhat cheaper in the present than it was in those ancient times the real price is certainly a good deal cheaper ten pence was then reckoned what is called the moderate and reasonable price of a bushel of wheat two shillings therefore was the price of two bushels and near two pecks of wheat which in the present times at three shillings and sixpence the bushel would be worth eight shillings and ninepence for a yard of this cloth the poor servant must have parted with the power of purchasing a quantity of subsistence equal to what eight shillings and ninepence would purchase in the present times this is a sumptuary law too restraining the luxury and extravagance of the poor their clothing therefore had commonly been much more expensive  the same order of people are by the same law prohibited from wearing hose of which the price should exceed fourteenpence the pair equal to about eight and twenty pence of our present money but fourteenpence was in those times the price of a bushel and near two pecks of wheat which in the present times at three and sixpence the bushel would cost five shillings and threepence we should in the present times consider this as a very high price for a pair of stockings to a servant of the poorest and lowest order he must however in those times have paid what was really equivalent to this price for them  in the time of edward ivth the art of knitting stockings was probably not known in any part of europe their hose were made of common cloth which may have been one of the causes of their dearness the first person that wore stockings in england is said to have been queen elizabeth she received them as a present from the spanish ambassador  both in the coarse and in the fine woollen manufacture the machinery employed was much more imperfect in those ancient than it is in the present times it has since received three very capital improvements besides probably many smaller ones of which it may be difficult to ascertain either the number or the importance the three capital improvements are first the exchange of the rock and spindle for the spinning wheel which with the same quantity of labor will perform more than double the quantity of work secondly the use of several very ingenious machines which facilitate and abridge in a still greater proportion the winding of the worsted and woollen yarn or the proper arrangement of the warp and woof before they are put into the loom an operation which previous to the invention of those machines must have been extremely tedious and troublesome thirdly the employment of the fullingmill for thickening the cloth instead of treading it in water neither wind nor water mills of any kind were known in england so early as the beginning of the sixteenth century nor so far as i know in any other part of europe north of the alps they had been introduced into italy some time before  the consideration of these circumstances may perhaps in some measure explain to us why the real price both of the coarse and of the fine manufacture was so much higher in those ancient than it is in the present times it cost a greater quantity of labor to bring the goods to market when they were brought thither therefore they must have purchased or exchanged for the price of a greater quantity  the coarse manufacture probably was in those ancient times carried on in england in the same manner as it always has been in countries where arts and manufactures are in their infancy it was probably a household manufacture in which every different part of the work was occasionally performed by all the different members of almost every private family but so as to be their work only when they had nothing else to do and not to be the principal business from which any of them derived the greater part of their subsistence the work which is performed in this manner it has already been observed comes always much cheaper to market than that which is the principal or sole fund of the workmans subsistence the fine manufacture on the other hand was not in those times carried on in england but in the rich and commercial country of flanders and it was probably conducted then in the same manner as now by people who derived the whole or the principal part of their subsistence from it it was besides a foreign manufacture and must have paid some duty the ancient custom of tunnage and poundage at least to the king this duty indeed would not probably be very great it was not then the policy of europe to restrain by high duties the importation of foreign manufactures but rather to encourage it in order that merchants might be enabled to supply at as easy a rate as possible the great men with the conveniences and luxuries which they wanted and which the industry of their own country could not afford them  the consideration of these circumstances may perhaps in some measure explain to us why in those ancient times the real price of the coarse manufacture was in proportion to that of the fine so much lower than in the present times  conclusion of the chapter i shall conclude this very long chapter with observing that every improvement in the circumstances of the society tends either directly or indirectly to raise the real rent of land to increase the real wealth of the landlord his power of purchasing the labor or the produce of the labor of other people  the extension of improvement and cultivation tends to raise it directly the landlords share of the produce necessarily increases with the increase of the produce  that rise in the real price of those parts of the rude produce of land which is first the effect of extended improvement and cultivation and afterward the cause of their being still further extended the rise in the price of cattle for example tends too to raise the rent of land directly and in a still greater proportion the real value of the landlords share his real command of the labor of other people not only rises with the real value of the produce but the proportion of his share to the whole produce rises with it that produce after the rise in its real price requires no more labor to collect it than before a smaller proportion of it will therefore be sufficient to replace with the ordinary profit the stock which employs that labor a greater proportion of it must consequently belong to the landlord  all those improvements in the productive powers of labor which tend directly to reduce the real price of manufactures tend indirectly to raise the real rent of land the landlord exchanges that part of his rude produce which is over and above his own consumption or what comes to the same thing the price of that part of it for manufactured produce whatever reduces the real price of the latter raises that of the former an equal quantity of the former becomes thereby equivalent to a greater quantity of the latter and the landlord is enabled to purchase a greater quantity of the conveniences ornaments or luxuries which he has occasion for  every increase in the real wealth of the society every increase in the quantity of useful labor employed within it tends indirectly to raise the real rent of land a certain proportion of this labor naturally goes to the land a greater number of men and cattle are employed in its cultivation the produce increases with the increase of the stock which is thus employed in raising it and the rent increases with the produce  the contrary circumstances the neglect of cultivation and improvement the fall in the real price of any part of the rude produce of land the rise in the real price of manufactures from the decay of manufacturing art and industry the declension of the real wealth of the society all tend on the other hand to lower the real rent of land to reduce the real wealth of the landlord to diminish his power of purchasing either the labor or the produce of the labor of other people  the whole annual produce of the land and labor of every country or what comes to the same thing the whole price of that annual produce naturally divides itself it has already been observed into three parts the rent of land the wages of labor and the profits of stock and constitutes a revenue to three different orders of people to those who live by rent to those who live by wages and to those who live by profit these are the three great original and constituent orders of every civilized society from whose revenue that of every other order is ultimately derived  the interest of the first of those three great orders it appears from what has been just now said is strictly and inseparably connected with the general interest of the society whatever either promotes or obstructs the one necessarily promotes or obstructs the other when the public deliberates concerning any regulation of commerce or police the proprietors of land never can mislead it with a view to promote the interest of their own particular order at least if they have any tolerable knowledge of that interest they are indeed too often defective in this tolerable knowledge they are the only one of the three orders whose revenue costs them neither labor nor care but comes to them as it were of its own accord and independent of any plan or project of their own that indolence which is the natural effect of the ease and security of their situation renders them too often not only ignorant but incapable of that application of mind which is necessary in order to foresee and understand the consequences of any public regulation  the interest of the second order that of those who live by wages is as strictly connected with the interest of the society as that of the first the wages of the labourer it has already been shown are never so high as when the demand for labor is continually rising or when the quantity employed is every year increasing considerably when this real wealth of the society becomes stationary his wages are soon reduced to what is barely enough to enable him to bring up a family or to continue the race of laborers when the society declines they fall even below this the order of proprietors may perhaps gain more by the prosperity of the society than that of laborers but there is no order that suffers so cruelly from its decline but though the interest of the labourer is strictly connected with that of the society he is incapable either of comprehending that interest or of understanding its connection with his own his condition leaves him no time to receive the necessary information and his education and habits are commonly such as to render him unfit to judge even though he was fully informed in the public deliberations therefore his voice is little heard and less regarded except upon some particular occasions when his clamor is animated set on and supported by his employers not for his but their own particular purposes  his employers constitute the third order that of those who live by profit it is the stock that is employed for the sake of profit which puts into motion the greater part of the useful labor of every society the plans and projects of the employers of stock regulate and direct all the most important operations of labor and profit is the end proposed by all those plans and projects but the rate of profit does not like rent and wages rise with the prosperity and fall with the declension of the society on the contrary it is naturally low in rich and high in poor countries and it is always highest in the countries which are going fastest to ruin the interest of this third order therefore has not the same connection with the general interest of the society as that of the other two merchants and master manufacturers are in this order the two classes of people who commonly employ the largest capitals and who by their wealth draw to themselves the greatest share of the public consideration as during their whole lives they are engaged in plans and projects they have frequently more acuteness of understanding than the greater part of country gentlemen as their thoughts however are commonly exercised rather about the interest of their own particular branch of business than about that of the society their judgment even when given with the greatest candor which it has not been upon every occasion is much more to be depended upon with regard to the former of those two objects than with regard to the latter their superiority over the country gentleman is not so much in their knowledge of the public interest as in their having a better knowledge of their own interest than he has of his it is by this superior knowledge of their own interest that they have frequently imposed upon his generosity and persuaded him to give up both his own interest and that of the public from a very simple but honest conviction that their interest and not his was the interest of the public the interest of the dealers however in any particular branch of trade or manufactures is always in some respects different from and even opposite to that of the public to widen the market and to narrow the competition is always the interest of the dealers to widen the market may frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the public but to narrow the competition must always be against it and can serve only to enable the dealers by raising their profits above what they naturally would be to levy for their own benefit an absurd tax upon the rest of their fellow citizens the proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order ought always to be listened to with great precaution and ought never to be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined not only with the most scrupulous but with the most suspicious attention it comes from an order of men whose interest is never exactly the same with that of the public who have generally an interest to deceive and even to oppress the public and who accordingly have upon many occasions both deceived and oppressed it years xii price of the quarter of wheat each year average of the different prices of the same year the average price of each year in money of the present times l s d l s d l s d   0

introduction in that rude state of society in which there is no division of labor in which exchanges are seldom made and in which every man provides every thing for himself it is not necessary that any stock should be accumulated or stored up beforehand in order to carry on the business of the society every man endeavors to supply by his own industry his own occasional wants as they occur when he is hungry he goes to the forest to hunt when his coat is worn out he clothes himself with the skin of the first large animal he kills and when his hut begins to go to ruin he repairs it as well as he can with the trees and the turf that are nearest it  but when the division of labor has once been thoroughly introduced the produce of a mans own labor can supply but a very small part of his occasional wants the far greater part of them are supplied by the produce of other mens labor which he purchases with the produce or what is the same thing with the price of the produce of his own but this purchase cannot be made till such time as the produce of his own labor has not only been completed but sold a stock of goods of different kinds therefore must be stored up somewhere sufficient to maintain him and to supply him with the materials and tools of his work till such time at least as both these events can be brought about a weaver cannot apply himself entirely to his peculiar business unless there is beforehand stored up somewhere either in his own possession or in that of some other person a stock sufficient to maintain him and to supply him with the materials and tools of his work till he has not only completed but sold his web this accumulation must evidently be previous to his applying his industry for so long a time to such a peculiar business  as the accumulation of stock must in the nature of things be previous to the division of labor so labor can be more and more subdivided only in proportion as stock is previously more and more accumulated the quantity of materials which the same number of people can work up increases in a great proportion as labor comes to be more and more subdivided and as the operations of each workman are gradually reduced to a greater degree of simplicity a variety of new machines come to be invented for facilitating and abridging those operations as the division of labor advances therefore in order to give constant employment to an equal number of workmen an equal stock of provisions and a greater stock of materials and tools than what would have been necessary in a ruder state of things must be accumulated beforehand but the number of workmen in every branch of business generally increases with the division of labor in that branch or rather it is the increase of their number which enables them to class and subdivide themselves in this manner  as the accumulation of stock is previously necessary for carrying on this great improvement in the productive powers of labor so that accumulation naturally leads to this improvement the person who employs his stock in maintaining labor necessarily wishes to employ it in such a manner as to produce as great a quantity of work as possible he endeavors therefore both to make among his workmen the most proper distribution of employment and to furnish them with the best machines which he can either invent or afford to purchase his abilities in both these respects are generally in proportion to the extent of his stock or to the number of people whom it can employ the quantity of industry therefore not only increases in every country with the increase of the stock which employs it but in consequence of that increase the same quantity of industry produces a much greater quantity of work  such are in general the effects of the increase of stock upon industry and its productive powers  in the following book i have endeavored to explain the nature of stock the effects of its accumulation into capitals of different kinds and the effects of the different employments of those capitals this book is divided into five chapters in the first chapter i have endeavored to show what are the different parts or branches into which the stock either of an individual or of a great society naturally divides itself in the second i have endeavored to explain the nature and operation of money considered as a particular branch of the general stock of the society the stock which is accumulated into a capital may either be employed by the person to whom it belongs or it may be lent to some other person in the third and fourth chapters i have endeavored to examine the manner in which it operates in both these situations the fifth and last chapter treats of the different effects which the different employments of capital immediately produce upon the quantity both of national industry and of the annual produce of land and labor  chap i of the division of stock when the stock which a man possesses is no more than sufficient to maintain him for a few days or a few weeks he seldom thinks of deriving any revenue from it he consumes it as sparingly as he can and endeavors by his labor to acquire something which may supply its place before it be consumed altogether his revenue is in this case derived from his labor only this is the state of the greater part of the laboring poor in all countries  but when he possesses stock sufficient to maintain him for months or years he naturally endeavors to derive a revenue from the greater part of it reserving only so much for his immediate consumption as may maintain him till this revenue begins to come in his whole stock therefore is distinguished into two parts that part which he expects is to afford him this revenue is called his capital the other is that which supplied his immediate consumption and which consists either first in that portion of his whole stock which was originally reserved for this purpose or secondly in his revenue from whatever source derived as it gradually comes in or thirdly in such things as had been purchased by either of these in former years and which are not yet entirely consumed such as a stock of clothes household furniture and the like in one or other or all of these three articles consists the stock which men commonly reserve for their own immediate consumption  there are two different ways in which a capital may be employed so as to yield a revenue or profit to its employer  first it may be employed in raising manufacturing or purchasing goods and selling them again with a profit the capital employed in this manner yields no revenue or profit to its employer while it either remains in his possession or continues in the same shape the goods of the merchant yield him no revenue or profit till he sells them for money and the money yields him as little till it is again exchanged for goods his capital is continually going from him in one shape and returning to him in another and it is only by means of such circulation or successive exchanges that it can yield him any profit such capitals therefore may very properly be called circulating capitals  secondly it may be employed in the improvement of land in the purchase of useful machines and instruments of trade or in suchlike things as yield a revenue or profit without changing masters or circulating any further such capitals therefore may very properly be called fixed capitals  different occupations require very different proportions between the fixed and circulating capitals employed in them  the capital of a merchant for example is altogether a circulating capital he has occasion for no machines or instruments of trade unless his shop or warehouse be considered as such  some part of the capital of every master artificer or manufacturer must be fixed in the instruments of his trade this part however is very small in some and very great in others a master tailor requires no other instruments of trade but a parcel of needles those of the master shoemaker are a little though but a very little more expensive those of the weaver rise a good deal above those of the shoemaker the far greater part of the capital of all such master artificers however is circulated either in the wages of their workmen or in the price of their materials and repaid with a profit by the price of the work  in other works a much greater fixed capital is required in a great ironwork for example the furnace for melting the ore the forge the slittmill are instruments of trade which cannot be erected without a very great expense in coalworks and mines of every kind the machinery necessary both for drawing out the water and for other purposes is frequently still more expensive  that part of the capital of the farmer which is employed in the instruments of agriculture is a fixed that which is employed in the wages and maintenance of his laboring servants is a circulating capital he makes a profit of the one by keeping it in his own possession and of the other by parting with it the price or value of his laboring cattle is a fixed capital in the same manner as that of the instruments of husbandry their maintenance is a circulating capital in the same manner as that of the laboring servants the farmer makes his profit by keeping the laboring cattle and by parting with their maintenance both the price and the maintenance of the cattle which are bought in and fattened not for labor but for sale are a circulating capital the farmer makes his profit by parting with them a flock of sheep or a herd of cattle that in a breeding country is bought in neither for labor nor for sale but in order to make a profit by their wool by their milk and by their increase is a fixed capital the profit is made by keeping them their maintenance is a circulating capital the profit is made by parting with it and it comes back with both its own profit and the profit upon the whole price of the cattle in the price of the wool the milk and the increase the whole value of the seed too is properly a fixed capital though it goes backwards and forwards between the ground and the granary it never changes masters and therefore does not properly circulate the farmer makes his profit not by its sale but by its increase  the general stock of any country or society is the same with that of all its inhabitants or members and therefore naturally divides itself into the same three portions each of which has a distinct function or office  the first is that portion which is reserved for immediate consumption and of which the characteristick is that it affords no revenue or profit it consists in the stock of food clothes household furniture etc which have been purchased by their proper consumers but which are not yet entirely consumed the whole stock of mere dwelling houses too subsisting at any one time in the country make a part of this first portion the stock that is laid out in a house if it is to be the dwelling house of the proprietor ceases from that moment to serve in the function of a capital or to afford any revenue to its owner a dwelling house as such contributes nothing to the revenue of its inhabitant and though it is no doubt extremely useful to him it is as his clothes and household furniture are useful to him which however make a part of his expense and not of his revenue if it is to be let to a tenant for rent as the house itself can produce nothing the tenant must always pay the rent out of some other revenue which he derives either from labor or stock or land though a house therefore may yield a revenue to its proprietor and thereby serve in the function of a capital to him it cannot yield any to the public nor serve in the function of a capital to it and the revenue of the whole body of the people can never be in the smallest degree increased by it clothes and household furniture in the same manner sometimes yield a revenue and thereby serve in the function of a capital to particular persons in countries where masquerades are common it is a trade to let out masquerade dresses for a night upholsterers frequently let furniture by the month or by the year undertakers let the furniture of funerals by the day and by the week many people let furnished houses and get a rent not only for the use of the house but for that of the furniture the revenue however which is derived from such things must always be ultimately drawn from some other source of revenue of all parts of the stock either of an individual or of a society reserved for immediate consumption what is laid out in houses is most slowly consumed a stock of clothes may last several years a stock of furniture half a century or a century but a stock of houses well built and properly taken care of may last many centuries though the period of their total consumption however is more distant they are still as really a stock reserved for immediate consumption as either clothes or household furniture  the second of the three portions into which the general stock of the society divides itself is the fixed capital of which the characteristick is that it affords a revenue or profit without circulating or changing masters it consists chiefly of the four following articles  first of all useful machines and instruments of trade which facilitate and abridge labor  secondly of all those profitable buildings which are the means of procuring a revenue not only to their proprietor who letts them for a rent but to the person who possesses them and pays that rent for them such as shops warehouses workhouses farmhouses with all their necessary buildings stables granaries etc these are very different from mere dwelling houses they are a sort of instruments of trade and may be considered in the same light  thirdly of the improvements of land of what has been profitably laid out in clearing draining enclosing manuring and reducing it into the condition most proper for tillage and culture an improved farm may very justly be regarded in the same light as those useful machines which facilitate and abridge labor and by means of which an equal circulating capital can afford a much greater revenue to its employer an improved farm is equally advantageous and more durable than any of those machines frequently requiring no other repairs than the most profitable application of the farmers capital employed in cultivating it  fourthly of the acquired and useful abilities of all the inhabitants or members of the society the acquisition of such talents by the maintenance of the acquirer during his education study or apprenticeship always costs a real expense which is a capital fixed and realized as it were in his person those talents as they make a part of his fortune so do they likewise of that of the society to which he belongs the improved dexterity of a workman may be considered in the same light as a machine or instrument of trade which facilitates and abridges labor and which though it costs a certain expense repays that expense with a profit  the third and last of the three portions into which the general stock of the society naturally divides itself is the circulating capital of which the characteristick is that it affords a revenue only by circulating or changing masters it is composed likewise of four parts  first of the money by means of which all the other three are circulated and distributed to their proper users and consumers  secondly of the stock of provisions which are in the possession of the butcher the grazier the farmer the cornmerchant the brewer etc and from the sale of which they expect to derive a profit  thirdly of the materials whether altogether rude or more or less manufactured of clothes furniture and building which are not yet made up into any of those three shapes but which remain in the hands of the growers the manufacturers the mercers and drapers the timbermerchants the carpenters and joiners the brickmakers etc  fourthly and lastly of the work which is made up and completed but which is still in the hands of the merchant or manufacturer and not yet disposed of or distributed to the proper users and consumers such as the finished work which we frequently find ready made in the shops of the smith the cabinetmaker the goldsmith the jeweller the chinamerchant etc the circulating capital consists in this manner of the provisions materials and finished work of all kinds that are in the hands of their respective dealers and of the money that is necessary for circulating and distributing them to those who are finally to use or to consume them  of these four parts three provisions materials and finished work are either annually or in a longer or shorter period regularly withdrawn from it and placed either in the fixed capital or in the stock reserved for immediate consumption  every fixed capital is both originally derived from and requires to be continually supported by a circulating capital all useful machines and instruments of trade are originally derived from a circulating capital which furnishes the materials of which they are made and the maintenance of the workmen who make them they require too a capital of the same kind to keep them in constant repair  no fixed capital can yield any revenue but by means of a circulating capital the most useful machines and instruments of trade will produce nothing without the circulating capital which affords the materials they are employed upon and the maintenance of the workmen who employ them land however improved will yield no revenue without a circulating capital which maintains the laborers who cultivate and collect its produce  to maintain and augment the stock which may be reserved for immediate consumption is the sole end and purpose both of the fixed and circulating capitals it is this stock which feeds clothes and lodges the people their riches or poverty depends upon the abundant or sparing supplies which those two capitals can afford to the stock reserved for immediate consumption  so great a part of the circulating capital being continually withdrawn from it in order to be placed in the other two branches of the general stock of the society it must in its turn require continual supplies without which it would soon cease to exist these supplies are principally drawn from three sources the produce of land of mines and of fisheries these afford continual supplies of provisions and materials of which part is afterward wrought up into finished work and by which are replaced the provisions materials and finished work continually withdrawn from the circulating capital from mines too is drawn what is necessary for maintaining and augmenting that part of it which consists in money for though in the ordinary course of business this part is not like the other three necessarily withdrawn from it in order to be placed in the other two branches of the general stock of the society it must however like all other things be wasted and worn out at last and sometimes too be either lost or sent abroad and must therefore require continual though no doubt much smaller supplies  land mines and fisheries require all both a fixed and a circulating capital to cultivate them and their produce replaces with a profit not only those capitals but all the others in the society thus the farmer annually replaces to the manufacturer the provisions which he had consumed and the materials which he had wrought up the year before and the manufacturer replaces to the farmer the finished work which he had wasted and worn out in the same time this is the real exchange that is annually made between those two orders of people though it seldom happens that the rude produce of the one and the manufactured produce of the other are directly bartered for one another because it seldom happens that the farmer sells his corn and his cattle his flax and his wool to the very same person of whom he chooses to purchase the clothes furniture and instruments of trade which he wants he sells therefore his rude produce for money with which he can purchase wherever it is to be had the manufactured produce he has occasion for land even replaces in part at least the capitals with which fisheries and mines are cultivated it is the produce of land which draws the fish from the waters and it is the produce of the surface of the earth which extracts the minerals from its bowels  the produce of land mines and fisheries when their natural fertility is equal is in proportion to the extent and proper application of the capitals employed about them when the capitals are equal and equally well applied it is in proportion to their natural fertility  in all countries where there is tolerable security every man of common understanding will endeavor to employ whatever stock he can command in procuring either present enjoyment or future profit if it is employed in procuring present enjoyment it is a stock reserved for immediate consumption if it is employed in procuring future profit it must procure this profit either by staying with him or by going from him in the one case it is a fixed in the other it is a circulating capital a man must be perfectly crazy who where there is tolerable security does not employ all the stock which he commands whether it be his own or borrowed of other people in some one or other of those three ways  in those unfortunate countries indeed where men are continually afraid of the violence of their superiors they frequently bury and conceal a great part of their stock in order to have it always at hand to carry with them to some place of safety in case of their being threatened with any of those disasters to which they consider themselves as at all times exposed this is said to be a common practice in turkey in indostan and i believe in most other governments of asia it seems to have been a common practice among our ancestors during the violence of the feudal government treasuretrove was in those times considered as no contemptible part of the revenue of the greatest sovereigns in europe it consisted in such treasure as was found concealed in the earth and to which no particular person could prove any right this was regarded in those times as so important an object that it was always considered as belonging to the sovereign and neither to the finder nor to the proprietor of the land unless the right to it had been conveyed to the latter by an express clause in his charter it was put upon the same footing with gold and silver mines which without a special clause in the charter were never supposed to be comprehended in the general grant of the lands though mines of lead copper tin and coal were as things of smaller consequence  chap ii of money considered as a particular branch of the general stock of the society or of the expense of maintaining the national capital it has been shown in the first book that the price of the greater part of commodities resolves itself into three parts of which one pays the wages of the labor another the profits of the stock and a third the rent of the land which had been employed in producing and bringing them to market that there are indeed some commodities of which the price is made up of two of those parts only the wages of labor and the profits of stock and a very few in which it consists altogether in one the wages of labor but that the price of every commodity necessarily resolves itself into some one or other or all of these three parts every part of it which goes neither to rent nor to wages being necessarily profit to somebody  since this is the case it has been observed with regard to every particular commodity taken separately it must be so with regard to all the commodities which compose the whole annual produce of the land and labor of every country taken complexly the whole price or exchangeable value of that annual produce must resolve itself into the same three parts and be parcelled out among the different inhabitants of the country either as the wages of their labor the profits of their stock or the rent of their land  but though the whole value of the annual produce of the land and labor of every country is thus divided among and constitutes a revenue to its different inhabitants yet as in the rent of a private estate we distinguish between the gross rent and the neat rent so may we likewise in the revenue of all the inhabitants of a great country  the gross rent of a private estate comprehends whatever is paid by the farmer the neat rent what remains free to the landlord after deducting the expense of management of repairs and all other necessary charges or what without hurting his estate he can afford to place in his stock reserved for immediate consumption or to spend upon his table equipage the ornaments of his house and furniture his private enjoyments and amusements his real wealth is in proportion not to his gross but to his neat rent  the gross revenue of all the inhabitants of a great country comprehends the whole annual produce of their land and labor the neat revenue what remains free to them after deducting the expense of maintaining first their fixed and secondly their circulating capital or what without encroaching upon their capital they can place in their stock reserved for immediate consumption or spend upon their subsistence conveniences and amusements their real wealth too is in proportion not to their gross but to their neat revenue  the whole expense of maintaining the fixed capital must evidently be excluded from the neat revenue of the society neither the materials necessary for supporting their useful machines and instruments of trade their profitable buildings etc nor the produce of the labor necessary for fashioning those materials into the proper form can ever make any part of it the price of that labor may indeed make a part of it as the workmen so employed may place the whole value of their wages in their stock reserved for immediate consumption but in other sorts of labor both the price and the produce go to this stock the price to that of the workmen the produce to that of other people whose subsistence conveniences and amusements are augmented by the labor of those workmen  the intention of the fixed capital is to increase the productive powers of labor or to enable the same number of laborers to perform a much greater quantity of work in a farm where all the necessary buildings fences drains communications etc are in the most perfect good order the same number of laborers and laboring cattle will raise a much greater produce than in one of equal extent and equally good ground but not furnished with equal conveniences in manufactures the same number of hands assisted with the best machinery will work up a much greater quantity of goods than with more imperfect instruments of trade the expense which is properly laid out upon a fixed capital of any kind is always repaid with great profit and increases the annual produce by a much greater value than that of the support which such improvements require this support however still requires a certain portion of that produce a certain quantity of materials and the labor of a certain number of workmen both of which might have been immediately employed to augment the food clothing and lodging the subsistence and conveniences of the society are thus diverted to another employment highly advantageous indeed but still different from this one it is upon this account that all such improvements in mechanics as enable the same number of workmen to perform an equal quantity of work with cheaper and simpler machinery than had been usual before are always regarded as advantageous to every society a certain quantity of materials and the labor of a certain number of workmen which had before been employed in supporting a more complex and expensive machinery can afterward be applied to augment the quantity of work which that or any other machinery is useful only for performing the undertaker of some great manufactory who employs a thousand a year in the maintenance of his machinery if he can reduce this expense to five hundred will naturally employ the other five hundred in purchasing an additional quantity of materials to be wrought up by an additional number of workmen the quantity of that work therefore which his machinery was useful only for performing will naturally be augmented and with it all the advantage and convenience which the society can derive from that work  the expense of maintaining the fixed capital in a great country may very properly be compared to that of repairs in a private estate the expense of repairs may frequently be necessary for supporting the produce of the estate and consequently both the gross and the neat rent of the landlord when by a more proper direction however it can be diminished without occasioning any diminution of produce the gross rent remains at least the same as before and the neat rent is necessarily augmented  but though the whole expense of maintaining the fixed capital is thus necessarily excluded from the neat revenue of the society it is not the same case with that of maintaining the circulating capital of the four parts of which this latter capital is composed money provisions materials and finished work the three last it has already been observed are regularly withdrawn from it and placed either in the fixed capital of the society or in their stock reserved for immediate consumption whatever portion of those consumable goods is not employed in maintaining the former goes all to the latter and makes a part of the neat revenue of the society the maintenance of those three parts of the circulating capital therefore withdraws no portion of the annual produce from the neat revenue of the society besides what is necessary for maintaining the fixed capital  the circulating capital of a society is in this respect different from that of an individual that of an individual is totally excluded from making any part of his neat revenue which must consist altogether in his profits but though the circulating capital of every individual makes a part of that of the society to which he belongs it is not upon that account totally excluded from making a part likewise of their neat revenue though the whole goods in a merchants shop must by no means be placed in his own stock reserved for immediate consumption they may in that of other people who from a revenue derived from other funds may regularly replace their value to him together with its profits without occasioning any diminution either of his capital or of theirs  money therefore is the only part of the circulating capital of a society of which the maintenance can occasion any diminution in their neat revenue  the fixed capital and that part of the circulating capital which consists in money so far as they affect the revenue of the society bear a very great resemblance to one another  first as those machines and instruments of trade etc require a certain expense first to erect them and afterward to support them both which expenses though they make a part of the gross are deductions from the neat revenue of the society so the stock of money which circulates in any country must require a certain expense first to collect it and afterward to support it both which expenses though they make a part of the gross are in the same manner deductions from the neat revenue of the society a certain quantity of very valuable materials gold and silver and of very curious labor instead of augmenting the stock reserved for immediate consumption the subsistence conveniences and amusements of individuals is employed in supporting that great but expensive instrument of commerce by means of which every individual in the society has his subsistence conveniences and amusements regularly distributed to him in their proper proportions  secondly as the machines and instruments of trade etc which compose the fixed capital either of an individual or of a society make no part either of the gross or of the neat revenue of either so money by means of which the whole revenue of the society is regularly distributed among all its different members makes itself no part of that revenue the great wheel of circulation is altogether different from the goods which are circulated by means of it the revenue of the society consists altogether in those goods and not in the wheel which circulates them in computing either the gross or the neat revenue of any society we must always from their whole annual circulation of money and goods deduct the whole value of the money of which not a single farthing can ever make any part of either  it is the ambiguity of language only which can make this proposition appear either doubtful or paradoxical when properly explained and understood it is almost selfevident  when we talk of any particular sum of money we sometimes mean nothing but the metal pieces of which it is composed and sometimes we include in our meaning some obscure reference to the goods which can be had in exchange for it or to the power of purchasing which the possession of it conveys thus when we say that the circulating money of england has been computed at eighteen millions we mean only to express the amount of the metal pieces which some writers have computed or rather have supposed to circulate in that country but when we say that a man is worth fifty or a hundred pounds a year we mean commonly to express not only the amount of the metal pieces which are annually paid to him but the value of the goods which he can annually purchase or consume we mean commonly to ascertain what is or ought to be his way of living or the quantity and quality of the necessaries and conveniences of life in which he can with propriety indulge himself  when by any particular sum of money we mean not only to express the amount of the metal pieces of which it is composed but to include in its signification some obscure reference to the goods which can be had in exchange for them the wealth or revenue which it in this case denotes is equal only to one of the two values which are thus intimated somewhat ambiguously by the same word and to the latter more properly than to the former to the moneysworth more properly than to the money  thus if a guinea be the weekly pension of a particular person he can in the course of the week purchase with it a certain quantity of subsistence conveniences and amusements in proportion as this quantity is great or small so are his real riches his real weekly revenue his weekly revenue is certainly not equal both to the guinea and to what can be purchased with it but only to one or other of those two equal values and to the latter more properly than to the former to the guineasworth rather than to the guinea  if the pension of such a person was paid to him not in gold but in a weekly bill for a guinea his revenue surely would not so properly consist in the piece of paper as in what he could get for it a guinea may be considered as a bill for a certain quantity of necessaries and conveniences upon all the tradesmen in the neighborhood the revenue of the person to whom it is paid does not so properly consist in the piece of gold as in what he can get for it or in what he can exchange it for if it could be exchanged for nothing it would like a bill upon a bankrupt be of no more value than the most useless piece of paper  though the weekly or yearly revenue of all the different inhabitants of any country in the same manner may be and in reality frequently is paid to them in money their real riches however the real weekly or yearly revenue of all of them taken together must always be great or small in proportion to the quantity of consumable goods which they can all of them purchase with this money the whole revenue of all of them taken together is evidently not equal to both the money and the consumable goods but only to one or other of those two values and to the latter more properly than to the former  though we frequently therefore express a persons revenue by the metal pieces which are annually paid to him it is because the amount of those pieces regulates the extent of his power of purchasing or the value of the goods which he can annually afford to consume we still consider his revenue as consisting in this power of purchasing or consuming and not in the pieces which convey it  but if this is sufficiently evident even with regard to an individual it is still more so with regard to a society the amount of the metal pieces which are annually paid to an individual is often precisely equal to his revenue and is upon that account the shortest and best expression of its value but the amount of the metal pieces which circulate in a society can never be equal to the revenue of all its members as the same guinea which pays the weekly pension of one man today may pay that of another tomorrow and that of a third the day thereafter the amount of the metal pieces which annually circulate in any country must always be of much less value than the whole money pensions annually paid with them but the power of purchasing the goods which can successively be bought with the whole of those money pensions as they are successively paid must always be precisely of the same value with those pensions as must likewise be the revenue of the different persons to whom they are paid that revenue therefore cannot consist in those metal pieces of which the amount is so much inferior to its value but in the power of purchasing in the goods which can successively be bought with them as they circulate from hand to hand  money therefore the great wheel of circulation the great instrument of commerce like all other instruments of trade though it makes a part and a very valuable part of the capital makes no part of the revenue of the society to which it belongs and though the metal pieces of which it is composed in the course of their annual circulation distribute to every man the revenue which properly belongs to him they make themselves no part of that revenue  thirdly and lastly the machines and instruments of trade etc which compose the fixed capital bear this further resemblance to that part of the circulating capital which consists in money that as every saving in the expense of erecting and supporting those machines which does not diminish the productive powers of labor is an improvement of the neat revenue of the society so every saving in the expense of collecting and supporting that part of the circulating capital which consists in money is an improvement of exactly the same kind  it is sufficiently obvious and it has partly too been explained already in what manner every saving in the expense of supporting the fixed capital is an improvement of the neat revenue of the society the whole capital of the undertaker of every work is necessarily divided between his fixed and his circulating capital while his whole capital remains the same the smaller the one part the greater must necessarily be the other it is the circulating capital which furnishes the materials and wages of labor and puts industry into motion every saving therefore in the expense of maintaining the fixed capital which does not diminish the productive powers of labor must increase the fund which puts industry into motion and consequently the annual produce of land and labor the real revenue of every society  the substitution of paper in the room of gold and silver money replaces a very expensive instrument of commerce with one much less costly and sometimes equally convenient circulation comes to be carried on by a new wheel which it costs less both to erect and to maintain than the old one but in what manner this operation is performed and in what manner it tends to increase either the gross or the neat revenue of the society is not altogether so obvious and may therefore require some further explication  there are several different sorts of paper money but the circulating notes of banks and bankers are the species which is best known and which seems best adapted for this purpose  when the people of any particular country have such confidence in the fortune probity and prudence of a particular banker as to believe that he is always ready to pay upon demand such of his promissary notes as are likely to be at any time presented to him those notes come to have the same currency as gold and silver money from the confidence that such money can at any time be had for them  a particular banker lends among his customers his own promissary notes to the extent we shall suppose of a hundred thousand pounds as those notes serve all the purposes of money his debtors pay him the same interest as if he had lent them so much money this interest is the source of his gain though some of those notes are continually coming back upon him for payment part of them continue to circulate for months and years together though he has generally in circulation therefore notes to the extent of a hundred thousand pounds twenty thousand pounds in gold and silver may frequently be a sufficient provision for answering occasional demands by this operation therefore twenty thousand pounds in gold and silver perform all the functions which a hundred thousand could otherwise have performed the same exchanges may be made the same quantity of consumable goods may be circulated and distributed to their proper consumers by means of his promissary notes to the value of a hundred thousand pounds as by an equal value of gold and silver money eighty thousand pounds of gold and silver therefore can in this manner be spared from the circulation of the country and if different operations of the same kind should at the same time be carried on by many different banks and bankers the whole circulation may thus be conducted with a fifth part only of the gold and silver which would otherwise have been requisite  let us suppose for example that the whole circulating money of some particular country amounted at a particular time to one million sterling that sum being then sufficient for circulating the whole annual produce of their land and labor let us suppose too that some time thereafter different banks and bankers issued promissary notes payable to the bearer to the extent of one million reserving in their different coffers two hundred thousand pounds for answering occasional demands there would remain therefore in circulation eight hundred thousand pounds in gold and silver and a million of bank notes or eighteen hundred thousand pounds of paper and money together but the annual produce of the land and labor of the country had before required only one million to circulate and distribute it to its proper consumers and that annual produce cannot be immediately augmented by those operations of banking one million therefore will be sufficient to circulate it after them the goods to be bought and sold being precisely the same as before the same quantity of money will be sufficient for buying and selling them the channel of circulation if i may be allowed such an expression will remain precisely the same as before one million we have supposed sufficient to fill that channel whatever therefore is poured into it beyond this sum cannot run in it but must overflow one million eight hundred thousand pounds are poured into it eight hundred thousand pounds therefore must overflow that sum being over and above what can be employed in the circulation of the country but though this sum cannot be employed at home it is too valuable to be allowed to lie idle it will therefore be sent abroad in order to seek that profitable employment which it cannot find at home but the paper cannot go abroad because at a distance from the banks which issue it and from the country in which payment of it can be exacted by law it will not be received in common payments gold and silver therefore to the amount of eight hundred thousand pounds will be sent abroad and the channel of home circulation will remain filled with a million of paper instead of the million of those metals which filled it before  but though so great a quantity of gold and silver is thus sent abroad we must not imagine that it is sent abroad for nothing or that its proprietors make a present of it to foreign nations they will exchange it for foreign goods of some kind or another in order to supply the consumption either of some other foreign country or of their own  if they employ it in purchasing goods in one foreign country in order to supply the consumption of another or in what is called the carrying trade whatever profit they make will be an addition to the neat revenue of their own country it is like a new fund created for carrying on a new trade domestic business being now transacted by paper and the gold and silver being converted into a fund for this new trade  if they employ it in purchasing foreign goods for home consumption they may either first purchase such goods as are likely to be consumed by idle people who produce nothing such as foreign wines foreign silks etc or secondly they may purchase an additional stock of materials tools and provisions in order to maintain and employ an additional number of industrious people who reproduce with a profit the value of their annual consumption  so far as it is employed in the first way it promotes prodigality increases expense and consumption without increasing production or establishing any permanent fund for supporting that expense and is in every respect hurtful to the society  so far as it is employed in the second way it promotes industry and though it increases the consumption of the society it provides a permanent fund for supporting that consumption the people who consume reproducing with a profit the whole value of their annual consumption the gross revenue of the society the annual produce of their land and labor is increased by the whole value which the labor of those workmen adds to the materials upon which they are employed and their neat revenue by what remains of this value after deducting what is necessary for supporting the tools and instruments of their trade  that the greater part of the gold and silver which being forced abroad by those operations of banking is employed in purchasing foreign goods for home consumption is and must be employed in purchasing those of this second kind seems not only probable but almost unavoidable though some particular men may sometimes increase their expense very considerably though their revenue does not increase at all we may be assured that no class or order of men ever does so because though the principles of common prudence do not always govern the conduct of every individual they always influence that of the majority of every class or order but the revenue of idle people considered as a class or order cannot in the smallest degree be increased by those operations of banking their expense in general therefore cannot be much increased by them though that of a few individuals among them may and in reality sometimes is the demand of idle people therefore for foreign goods being the same or very nearly the same as before a very small part of the money which being forced abroad by those operations of banking is employed in purchasing foreign goods for home consumption is likely to be employed in purchasing those for their use the greater part of it will naturally be destined for the employment of industry and not for the maintenance of idleness  when we compute the quantity of industry which the circulating capital of any society can employ we must always have regard to those parts of it only which consist in provisions materials and finished work the other which consists in money and which serves only to circulate those three must always be deducted in order to put industry into motion three things are requisite materials to work upon tools to work with and the wages or recompense for the sake of which the work is done money is neither a material to work upon nor a tool to work with and though the wages of the workman are commonly paid to him in money his real revenue like that of all other men consists not in the money but in the moneys worth not in the metal pieces but in what can be got for them  the quantity of industry which any capital can employ must evidently be equal to the number of workmen whom it can supply with materials tools and a maintenance suitable to the nature of the work money may be requisite for purchasing the materials and tools of the work as well as the maintenance of the workmen but the quantity of industry which the whole capital can employ is certainly not equal both to the money which purchases and to the materials tools and maintenance which are purchased with it but only to one or other of those two values and to the latter more properly than to the former  when paper is substituted in the room of gold and silver money the quantity of the materials tools and maintenance which the whole circulating capital can supply may be increased by the whole value of gold and silver which used to be employed in purchasing them the whole value of the great wheel of circulation and distribution is added to the goods which are circulated and distributed by means of it the operation in some measure resembles that of the undertaker of some great work who in consequence of some improvement in mechanics takes down his old machinery and adds the difference between its price and that of the new to his circulating capital to the fund from which he furnishes materials and wages to his workmen  what is the proportion which the circulating money of any country bears to the whole value of the annual produce circulated by means of it it is perhaps impossible to determine it has been computed by different authors at a fifth at a tenth at a twentieth and at a thirtieth part of that value but how small soever the proportion which the circulating money may bear to the whole value of the annual produce as but a part and frequently but a small part of that produce is ever destined for the maintenance of industry it must always bear a very considerable proportion to that part when therefore by the substitution of paper the gold and silver necessary for circulation is reduced to perhaps a fifth part of the former quantity if the value of only the greater part of the other fourfifths be added to the funds which are destined for the maintenance of industry it must make a very considerable addition to the quantity of that industry and consequently to the value of the annual produce of land and labor  an operation of this kind has within these five and twenty or thirty years been performed in scotland by the erection of new banking companies in almost every considerable town and even in some country villages the effects of it have been precisely those above described the business of the country is almost entirely carried on by means of the paper of those different banking companies with which purchases and payments of all kinds are commonly made silver very seldom appears except in the change of a twenty shillings bank note and gold still seldomer but though the conduct of all those different companies has not been unexceptionable and has accordingly required an act of parliament to regulate it the country notwithstanding has evidently derived great benefit from their trade i have heard it asserted that the trade of the city of glasgow doubled in about fifteen years after the first erection of the banks there and that the trade of scotland has more than quadrupled since the first erection of the two public banks at edinburgh of which the one called the bank of scotland was established by act of parliament in      the other called the royal bank by royal charter in      whether the trade either of scotland in general or of the city of glasgow in particular has really increased in so great a proportion during so short a period i do not pretend to know if either of them has increased in this proportion it seems to be an effect too great to be accounted for by the sole operation of this cause that the trade and industry of scotland however have increased very considerably during this period and that the banks have contributed a good deal to this increase cannot be doubted  the value of the silver money which circulated in scotland before the union in   0  and which immediately after it was brought into the bank of scotland in order to be recoined amounted to       l ros  d sterling no account has been got of the gold coin but it appears from the ancient accounts of the mint of scotland that the value of the gold annually coined somewhat exceeded that of the silver see rudimans preface to andersons diplomata etc scotiae  there were a good many people too upon this occasion who from a diffidence of repayment did not bring their silver into the bank of scotland and there was besides some english coin which was not called in the whole value of the gold and silver therefore which circulated in scotland before the union cannot be estimated at less than a million sterling it seems to have constituted almost the whole circulation of that country for though the circulation of the bank of scotland which had then no rival was considerable it seems to have made but a very small part of the whole in the present times the whole circulation of scotland cannot be estimated at less than two millions of which that part which consists in gold and silver most probably does not amount to half a million but though the circulating gold and silver of scotland have suffered so great a diminution during this period its real riches and prosperity do not appear to have suffered any its agriculture manufactures and trade on the contrary the annual produce of its land and labor have evidently been augmented  it is chiefly by discounting bills of exchange that is by advancing money upon them before they are due that the greater part of banks and bankers issue their promissory notes they deduct always upon whatever sum they advance the legal interest till the bill shall become due the payment of the bill when it becomes due replaces to the bank the value of what had been advanced together with a clear profit of the interest the banker who advances to the merchant whose bill he discounts not gold and silver but his own promissory notes has the advantage of being able to discount to a greater amount by the whole value of his promissory notes which he finds by experience are commonly in circulation he is thereby enabled to make his clear gain of interest on so much a larger sum  the commerce of scotland which at present is not very great was still more inconsiderable when the two first banking companies were established and those companies would have had but little trade had they confined their business to the discounting of bills of exchange they invented therefore another method of issuing their promissary notes by granting what they called cash accounts that is by giving credit to the extent of a certain sum two or three thousand pounds for example to any individual who could procure two persons of undoubted credit and good landed estate to become surety for him that whatever money should be advanced to him within the sum for which the credit had been given should be repaid upon demand together with the legal interest credits of this kind are i believe commonly granted by banks and bankers in all different parts of the world but the easy terms upon which the scotch banking companies accept of repayment are so far as i know peculiar to them and have perhaps been the principal cause both of the great trade of those companies and of the benefit which the country has received from it  whoever has a credit of this kind with one of those companies and borrows a thousand pounds upon it for example may repay this sum piecemeal by twenty and thirty pounds at a time the company discounting a proportionable part of the interest of the great sum from the day on which each of those small sums is paid in till the whole be in this manner repaid all merchants therefore and almost all men of business find it convenient to keep such cash accounts with them and are thereby interested to promote the trade of those companies by readily receiving their notes in all payments and by encouraging all those with whom they have any influence to do the same the banks when their customers apply to them for money generally advance it to them in their own promissary notes these the merchants pay away to the manufacturers for goods the manufacturers to the farmers for materials and provisions the farmers to their landlords for rent the landlords repay them to the merchants for the conveniences and luxuries with which they supply them and the merchants again return them to the banks in order to balance their cash accounts or to replace what they may have borrowed of them and thus almost the whole money business of the country is transacted by means of them hence the great trade of those companies  by means of those cash accounts every merchant can without imprudence carry on a greater trade than he otherwise could do if there are two merchants one in london and the other in edinburgh who employ equal stocks in the same branch of trade the edinburgh merchant can without imprudence carry on a greater trade and give employment to a greater number of people than the london merchant the london merchant must always keep by him a considerable sum of money either in his own coffers or in those of his banker who gives him no interest for it in order to answer the demands continually coming upon him for payment of the goods which he purchases upon credit let the ordinary amount of this sum be supposed five hundred pounds the value of the goods in his warehouse must always be less by five hundred pounds than it would have been had he not been obliged to keep such a sum unemployed let us suppose that he generally disposes of his whole stock upon hand or of goods to the value of his whole stock upon hand once in the year by being obliged to keep so great a sum unemployed he must sell in a year five hundred pounds worth less goods than he might otherwise have done his annual profits must be less by all that he could have made by the sale of five hundred pounds worth more goods and the number of people employed in preparing his goods for the market must be less by all those that five hundred pounds more stock could have employed the merchant in edinburgh on the other hand keeps no money unemployed for answering such occasional demands when they actually come upon him he satisfies them from his cash account with the bank and gradually replaces the sum borrowed with the money or paper which comes in from the occasional sales of his goods with the same stock therefore he can without imprudence have at all times in his warehouse a larger quantity of goods than the london merchant and can thereby both make a greater profit himself and give constant employment to a greater number of industrious people who prepare those goods for the market hence the great benefit which the country has derived from this trade  the facility of discounting bills of exchange it may be thought indeed gives the english merchants a convenience equivalent to the cash accounts of the scotch merchants but the scotch merchants it must be remembered can discount their bills of exchange as easily as the english merchants and have besides the additional convenience of their cash accounts  the whole paper money of every kind which can easily circulate in any country never can exceed the value of the gold and silver of which it supplies the place or which the commerce being supposed the same would circulate there if there was no paper money if twenty shilling notes for example are the lowest paper money current in scotland the whole of that currency which can easily circulate there cannot exceed the sum of gold and silver which would be necessary for transacting the annual exchanges of twenty shillings value and upwards usually transacted within that country should the circulating paper at any time exceed that sum as the excess could neither be sent abroad nor be employed in the circulation of the country it must immediately return upon the banks to be exchanged for gold and silver many people would immediately perceive that they had more of this paper than was necessary for transacting their business at home and as they could not send it abroad they would immediately demand payment of it from the banks when this superfluous paper was converted into gold and silver they could easily find a use for it by sending it abroad but they could find none while it remained in the shape of paper there would immediately therefore be a run upon the banks to the whole extent of this superfluous paper and if they showed any difficulty or backwardness in payment to a much greater extent the alarm which this would occasion necessarily increasing the run  over and above the expenses which are common to every branch of trade such as the expense of houserent the wages of servants clerks accountants etc the expenses peculiar to a bank consist chiefly in two articles first in the expense of keeping at all times in its coffers for answering the occasional demands of the holders of its notes a large sum of money of which it loses the interest and secondly in the expense of replenishing those coffers as fast as they are emptied by answering such occasional demands  a banking company which issues more paper than can be employed in the circulation of the country and of which the excess is continually returning upon them for payment ought to increase the quantity of gold and silver which they keep at all times in their coffers not only in proportion to this excessive increase of their circulation but in a much greater proportion their notes returning upon them much faster than in proportion to the excess of their quantity such a company therefore ought to increase the first article of their expense not only in proportion to this forced increase of their business but in a much greater proportion  the coffers of such a company too though they ought to be filled much fuller yet must empty themselves much faster than if their business was confined within more reasonable bounds and must require not only a more violent but a more constant and uninterrupted exertion of expense in order to replenish them the coin too which is thus continually drawn in such large quantities from their coffers cannot be employed in the circulation of the country it comes in place of a paper which is over and above what can be employed in that circulation and is therefore over and above what can be employed in it too but as that coin will not be allowed to lie idle it must in one shape or another be sent abroad in order to find that profitable employment which it cannot find at home and this continual exportation of gold and silver by enhancing the difficulty must necessarily enhance still further the expense of the bank in finding new gold and silver in order to replenish those coffers which empty themselves so very rapidly such a company therefore must in proportion to this forced increase of their business increase the second article of their expense still more than the first  let us suppose that all the paper of a particular bank which the circulation of the country can easily absorb and employ amounts exactly to forty thousand pounds and that for answering occasional demands this bank is obliged to keep at all times in its coffers ten thousand pounds in gold and silver should this bank attempt to circulate fortyfour thousand pounds the four thousand pounds which are over and above what the circulation can easily absorb and employ will return upon it almost as fast as they are issued for answering occasional demands therefore this bank ought to keep at all times in its coffers not eleven thousand pounds only but fourteen thousand pounds it will thus gain nothing by the interest of the four thousand pounds excessive circulation and it will lose the whole expense of continually collecting four thousand pounds in gold and silver which will be continually going out of its coffers as fast as they are brought into them  had every particular banking company always understood and attended to its own particular interest the circulation never could have been overstocked with paper money but every particular banking company has not always understood or attended to its own particular interest and the circulation has frequently been overstocked with paper money  by issuing too great a quantity of paper of which the excess was continually returning in order to be exchanged for gold and silver the bank of england was for many years together obliged to coin gold to the extent of between eight hundred thousand pounds and a million a year or at an average about eight hundred and fifty thousand pounds for this great coinage the bank in consequence of the worn and degraded state into which the gold coin had fallen a few years ago was frequently obliged to purchase gold bullion at the high price of four pounds an ounce which it soon after issued in coin at  l   s  0d an ounce losing in this manner between two and a half and three per cent upon the coinage of so very large a sum though the bank therefore paid no seignorage though the government was properly at the expense of the coinage this liberality of government did not prevent altogether the expense of the bank  the scotch banks in consequence of an excess of the same kind were all obliged to employ constantly agents at london to collect money for them at an expense which was seldom below one and a half or two per cent this money was sent down by the wagon and insured by the carriers at an additional expense of three quarters per cent or fifteen shillings on the hundred pounds those agents were not always able to replenish the coffers of their employers so fast as they were emptied in this case the resource of the banks was to draw upon their correspondents in london bills of exchange to the extent of the sum which they wanted when those correspondents afterward drew upon them for the payment of this sum together with the interest and a commission some of those banks from the distress into which their excessive circulation had thrown them had sometimes no other means of satisfying this draught but by drawing a second set of bills either upon the same or upon some other correspondents in london and the same sum or rather bills for the same sum would in this manner make sometimes more than two or three journies the debtor bank paying always the interest and commission upon the whole accumulated sum even those scotch banks which never distinguished themselves by their extreme imprudence were sometimes obliged to employ this ruinous resource  the gold coin which was paid out either by the bank of england or by the scotch banks in exchange for that part of their paper which was over and above what could be employed in the circulation of the country being likewise over and above what could be employed in that circulation was sometimes sent abroad in the shape of coin sometimes melted down and sent abroad in the shape of bullion and sometimes melted down and sold to the bank of england at the high price of four pounds an ounce it was the newest the heaviest and the best pieces only which were carefully picked out of the whole coin and either sent abroad or melted down at home and while they remained in the shape of coin those heavy pieces were of no more value than the light but they were of more value abroad or when melted down into bullion at home the bank of england notwithstanding their great annual coinage found to their astonishment that there was every year the same scarcity of coin as there had been the year before and that notwithstanding the great quantity of good and new coin which was every year issued from the bank the state of the coin instead of growing better and better became every year worse and worse every year they found themselves under the necessity of coining nearly the same quantity of gold as they had coined the year before and from the continual rise in the price of gold bullion in consequence of the continual wearing and clipping of the coin the expense of this great annual coinage became every year greater and greater the bank of england it is to be observed by supplying its own coffers with coin is indirectly obliged to supply the whole kingdom into which coin is continually flowing from those coffers in a great variety of ways whatever coin therefore was wanted to support this excessive circulation both of scotch and english paper money whatever vacuities this excessive circulation occasioned in the necessary coin of the kingdom the bank of england was obliged to supply them the scotch banks no doubt paid all of them very dearly for their own imprudence and inattention but the bank of england paid very dearly not only for its own imprudence but for the much greater imprudence of almost all the scotch banks  the over trading of some bold projectors in both parts of the united kingdom was the original cause of this excessive circulation of paper money  what a bank can with propriety advance to a merchant or undertaker of any kind is not either the whole capital with which he trades or even any considerable part of that capital but that part of it only which he would otherwise be obliged to keep by him unemployed and in ready money for answering occasional demands if the paper money which the bank advances never exceeds this value it can never exceed the value of the gold and silver which would necessarily circulate in the country if there was no paper money it can never exceed the quantity which the circulation of the country can easily absorb and employ  when a bank discounts to a merchant a real bill of exchange drawn by a real creditor upon a real debtor and which as soon as it becomes due is really paid by that debtor it only advances to him a part of the value which he would otherwise be obliged to keep by him unemployed and in ready money for answering occasional demands the payment of the bill when it becomes due replaces to the bank the value of what it had advanced together with the interest the coffers of the bank so far as its dealings are confined to such customers resemble a water pond from which though a stream is continually running out yet another is continually running in fully equal to that which runs out so that without any further care or attention the pond keeps always equally or very near equally full little or no expense can ever be necessary for replenishing the coffers of such a bank  a merchant without overtrading may frequently have occasion for a sum of ready money even when he has no bills to discount when a bank besides discounting his bills advances him likewise upon such occasions such sums upon his cash account and accepts of a piecemeal repayment as the money comes in from the occasional sale of his goods upon the easy terms of the banking companies of scotland it dispenses him entirely from the necessity of keeping any part of his stock by him unemployed and in ready money for answering occasional demands when such demands actually come upon him he can answer them sufficiently from his cash account the bank however in dealing with such customers ought to observe with great attention whether in the course of some short period of four five six or eight months for example the sum of the repayments which it commonly receives from them is or is not fully equal to that of the advances which it commonly makes to them if within the course of such short periods the sum of the repayments from certain customers is upon most occasions fully equal to that of the advances it may safely continue to deal with such customers though the stream which is in this case continually running out from its coffers may be very large that which is continually running into them must be at least equally large so that without any further care or attention those coffers are likely to be always equally or very near equally full and scarce ever to require any extraordinary expense to replenish them if on the contrary the sum of the repayments from certain other customers falls commonly very much short of the advances which it makes to them it cannot with any safety continue to deal with such customers at least if they continue to deal with it in this manner the stream which is in this case continually running out from its coffers is necessarily much larger than that which is continually running in so that unless they are replenished by some great and continual effort of expense those coffers must soon be exhausted altogether  the banking companies of scotland accordingly were for a long time very careful to require frequent and regular repayments from all their customers and did not care to deal with any person whatever might be his fortune or credit who did not make what they called frequent and regular operations with them by this attention besides saving almost entirely the extraordinary expense of replenishing their coffers they gained two other very considerable advantages  first by this attention they were enabled to make some tolerable judgment concerning the thriving or declining circumstances of their debtors without being obliged to look out for any other evidence besides what their own books afforded them men being for the most part either regular or irregular in their repayments according as their circumstances are either thriving or declining a private man who lends out his money to perhaps half a dozen or a dozen of debtors may either by himself or his agents observe and enquire both constantly and carefully into the conduct and situation of each of them but a banking company which lends money to perhaps five hundred different people and of which the attention is continually occupied by objects of a very different kind can have no regular information concerning the conduct and circumstances of the greater part of its debtors beyond what its own books afford it in requiring frequent and regular repayments from all their customers the banking companies of scotland had probably this advantage in view  secondly by this attention they secured themselves from the possibility of issuing more paper money than what the circulation of the country could easily absorb and employ when they observed that within moderate periods of time the repayments of a particular customer were upon most occasions fully equal to the advances which they had made to him they might be assured that the paper money which they had advanced to him had not at any time exceeded the quantity of gold and silver which he would otherwise have been obliged to keep by him for answering occasional demands and that consequently the paper money which they had circulated by his means had not at any time exceeded the quantity of gold and silver which would have circulated in the country had there been no paper money the frequency regularity and amount of his repayments would sufficiently demonstrate that the amount of their advances had at no time exceeded that part of his capital which he would otherwise have been obliged to keep by him unemployed and in ready money for answering occasional demands that is for the purpose of keeping the rest of his capital in constant employment it is this part of his capital only which within moderate periods of time is continually returning to every dealer in the shape of money whether paper or coin and continually going from him in the same shape if the advances of the bank had commonly exceeded this part of his capital the ordinary amount of his repayments could not within moderate periods of time have equalled the ordinary amount of its advances the stream which by means of his dealings was continually running into the coffers of the bank could not have been equal to the stream which by means of the same dealings was continually running out the advances of the bank paper by exceeding the quantity of gold and silver which had there been no such advances he would have been obliged to keep by him for answering occasional demands might soon come to exceed the whole quantity of gold and silver which the commerce being supposed the same would have circulated in the country had there been no paper money and consequently to exceed the quantity which the circulation of the country could easily absorb and employ and the excess of this paper money would immediately have returned upon the bank in order to be exchanged for gold and silver this second advantage though equally real was not perhaps so well understood by all the different banking companies of scotland as the first  when partly by the convenience of discounting bills and partly by that of cash accounts the creditable traders of any country can be dispensed from the necessity of keeping any part of their stock by them unemployed and in ready money for answering occasional demands they can reasonably expect no further assistance from banks and bankers who when they have gone thus far cannot consistently with their own interest and safety go farther a bank cannot consistently with its own interest advance to a trader the whole or even the greater part of the circulating capital with which he trades because though that capital is continually returning to him in the shape of money and going from him in the same shape yet the whole of the returns is too distant from the whole of the outgoings and the sum of his repayments could not equal the sum of its advances within such moderate periods of time as suit the convenience of a bank still less could a bank afford to advance him any considerable part of his fixed capital of the capital which the undertaker of an iron forge for example employs in erecting his forge and smeltinghouse his workhouses and warehouses the dwelling houses of his workmen etc of the capital which the undertaker of a mine employs in sinking his shafts in erecting engines for drawing out the water in making roads and waggonways etc of the capital which the person who undertakes to improve land employs in clearing draining enclosing manuring and ploughing waste and uncultivated fields in building farmhouses with all their necessary appendages of stables granaries etc the returns of the fixed capital are in almost all cases much slower than those of the circulating capital and such expenses even when laid out with the greatest prudence and judgment very seldom return to the undertaker till after a period of many years a period by far too distant to suit the convenience of a bank traders and other undertakers may no doubt with great propriety carry on a very considerable part of their projects with borrowed money in justice to their creditors however their own capital ought in this case to be sufficient to ensure if i may say so the capital of those creditors or to render it extremely improbable that those creditors should incur any loss even though the success of the project should fall very much short of the expectation of the projectors even with this precaution too the money which is borrowed and which it is meant should not be repaid till after a period of several years ought not to be borrowed of a bank but ought to be borrowed upon bond or mortgage of such private people as propose to live upon the interest of their money without taking the trouble themselves to employ the capital and who are upon that account willing to lend that capital to such people of good credit as are likely to keep it for several years a bank indeed which lends its money without the expense of stamped paper or of attorneys fees for drawing bonds and mortgages and which accepts of repayment upon the easy terms of the banking companies of scotland would no doubt be a very convenient creditor to such traders and undertakers but such traders and undertakers would surely be most inconvenient debtors to such a bank  it is now more than five and twenty years since the paper money issued by the different banking companies of scotland was fully equal or rather was somewhat more than fully equal to what the circulation of the country could easily absorb and employ those companies therefore had so long ago given all the assistance to the traders and other undertakers of scotland which it is possible for banks and bankers consistently with their own interest to give they had even done somewhat more they had overtraded a little and had brought upon themselves that loss or at least that diminution of profit which in this particular business never fails to attend the smallest degree of overtrading those traders and other undertakers having got so much assistance from banks and bankers wished to get still more the banks they seem to have thought could extend their credits to whatever sum might be wanted without incurring any other expense besides that of a few reams of paper they complained of the contracted views and dastardly spirit of the directors of those banks which did not they said extend their credits in proportion to the extension of the trade of the country meaning no doubt by the extension of that trade the extension of their own projects beyond what they could carry on either with their own capital or with what they had credit to borrow of private people in the usual way of bond or mortgage the banks they seem to have thought were in honor bound to supply the deficiency and to provide them with all the capital which they wanted to trade with the banks however were of a different opinion and upon their refusing to extend their credits some of those traders had recourse to an expedient which for a time served their purpose though at a much greater expense yet as effectually as the utmost extension of bank credits could have done this expedient was no other than the wellknown shift of drawing and redrawing the shift to which unfortunate traders have sometimes recourse when they are upon the brink of bankruptcy the practice of raising money in this manner had been long known in england and during the course of the late war when the high profits of trade afforded a great temptation to overtrading is said to have been carried on to a very great extent from england it was brought into scotland where in proportion to the very limited commerce and to the very moderate capital of the country it was soon carried on to a much greater extent than it ever had been in england  the practice of drawing and redrawing is so well known to all men of business that it may perhaps be thought unnecessary to give any account of it but as this book may come into the hands of many people who are not men of business and as the effects of this practice upon the banking trade are not perhaps generally understood even by men of business themselves i shall endeavor to explain it as distinctly as i can  the customs of merchants which were established when the barbarous laws of europe did not enforce the performance of their contracts and which during the course of the two last centuries have been adopted into the laws of all european nations have given such extraordinary privileges to bills of exchange that money is more readily advanced upon them than upon any other species of obligation especially when they are made payable within so short a period as two or three months after their date if when the bill becomes due the acceptor does not pay it as soon as it is presented he becomes from that moment a bankrupt the bill is protested and returns upon the drawer who if he does not immediately pay it becomes likewise a bankrupt if before it came to the person who presents it to the acceptor for payment it had passed through the hands of several other persons who had successively advanced to one another the contents of it either in money or goods and who to express that each of them had in his turn received those contents had all of them in their order endorsed that is written their names upon the back of the bill each endorser becomes in his turn liable to the owner of the bill for those contents and if he fails to pay he becomes too from that moment a bankrupt though the drawer acceptor and endorsers of the bill should all of them be persons of doubtful credit yet still the shortness of the date gives some security to the owner of the bill though all of them may be very likely to become bankrupts it is a chance if they all become so in so short a time the house is crazy says a weary traveller to himself and will not stand very long but it is a chance if it falls tonight and i will venture therefore to sleep in it tonight  the trader a in edinburgh we shall suppose draws a bill upon b in london payable two months after date in reality b in london owes nothing to a in edinburgh but he agrees to accept of as bill upon condition that before the term of payment he shall redraw upon a in edinburgh for the same sum together with the interest and a commission another bill payable likewise two months after date b accordingly before the expiration of the first two months redraws this bill upon a in edinburgh who again before the expiration of the second two months draws a second bill upon b in london payable likewise two months after date and before the expiration of the third two months b in london redraws upon a in edinburgh another bill payable also two months after date this practice has sometimes gone on not only for several months but for several years together the bill always returning upon a in edinburgh with the accumulated interest and commission of all the former bills the interest was five per cent in the year and the commission was never less than one half per cent on each draught this commission being repeated more than six times in the year whatever money a might raise by this expedient must necessarily have cost him something more than eight per cent in the year and sometimes a great deal more when either the price of the commission happened to rise or when he was obliged to pay compound interest upon the interest and commission of former bills this practice was called raising money by circulation  in a country where the ordinary profits of stock in the greater part of mercantile projects are supposed to run between six and ten per cent it must have been a very fortunate speculation of which the returns could not only repay the enormous expense at which the money was thus borrowed for carrying it on but afford besides a good surplus profit to the projector many vast and extensive projects however were undertaken and for several years carried on without any other fund to support them besides what was raised at this enormous expense the projectors no doubt had in their golden dreams the most distinct vision of this great profit upon their awaking however either at the end of their projects or when they were no longer able to carry them on they very seldom i believe had the good fortune to find it  the bills which a in edinburgh drew upon b in london he regularly discounted two months before they were due with some bank or banker in edinburgh and the bills which b in london redrew upon a in edinburgh he as regularly discounted either with the bank of england or with some other bankers in london whatever was advanced upon such circulating bills was in edinburgh advanced in the paper of the scotch banks and in london when they were discounted at the bank of england in the paper of that bank though the bills upon which this paper had been advanced were all of them repaid in their turn as soon as they became due yet the value which had been really advanced upon the first bill was never really returned to the banks which advanced it because before each bill became due another bill was always drawn to somewhat a greater amount than the bill which was soon to be paid and the discounting of this other bill was essentially necessary toward the payment of that which was soon to be due this payment therefore was altogether fictitious the stream which by means of those circulating bills of exchange had once been made to run out from the coffers of the banks was never replaced by any stream which really run into them  the paper which was issued upon those circulating bills of exchange amounted upon many occasions to the whole fund destined for carrying on some vast and extensive project of agriculture commerce or manufactures and not merely to that part of it which had there been no paper money the projector would have been obliged to keep by him unemployed and in ready money for answering occasional demands the greater part of this paper was consequently over and above the value of the gold and silver which would have circulated in the country had there been no paper money it was over and above therefore what the circulation of the country could easily absorb and employ and upon that account immediately returned upon the banks in order to be exchanged for gold and silver which they were to find as they could it was a capital which those projectors had very artfully contrived to draw from those banks not only without their knowledge or deliberate consent but for some time perhaps without their having the most distant suspicion that they had really advanced it  when two people who are continually drawing and redrawing upon one another discount their bills always with the same banker he must immediately discover what they are about and see clearly that they are trading not with any capital of their own but with the capital which he advances to them but this discovery is not altogether so easy when they discount their bills sometimes with one banker and sometimes with another and when the same two persons do not constantly draw and redraw upon one another but occasionally run the round of a great circle of projectors who find it for their interest to assist one another in this method of raising money and to render it upon that account as difficult as possible to distinguish between a real and a fictitious bill of exchange between a bill drawn by a real creditor upon a real debtor and a bill for which there was properly no real creditor but the bank which discounted it nor any real debtor but the projector who made use of the money when a banker had even made this discovery he might sometimes make it too late and might find that he had already discounted the bills of those projectors to so great an extent that by refusing to discount any more he would necessarily make them all bankrupts and thus by ruining them might perhaps ruin himself for his own interest and safety therefore he might find it necessary in this very perilous situation to go on for some time endeavoring however to withdraw gradually and upon that account making every day greater and greater difficulties about discounting in order to force those projectors by degrees to have recourse either to other bankers or to other methods of raising money so as that he himself might as soon as possible get out of the circle the difficulties accordingly which the bank of england which the principal bankers in london and which even the more prudent scotch banks began after a certain time and when all of them had already gone too far to make about discounting not only alarmed but enraged in the highest degree those projectors their own distress of which this prudent and necessary reserve of the banks was no doubt the immediate occasion they called the distress of the country and this distress of the country they said was altogether owing to the ignorance pusillanimity and bad conduct of the banks which did not give a sufficiently liberal aid to the spirited undertakings of those who exerted themselves in order to beautify improve and enrich the country it was the duty of the banks they seemed to think to lend for as long a time and to as great an extent as they might wish to borrow the banks however by refusing in this manner to give more credit to those to whom they had already given a great deal too much took the only method by which it was now possible to save either their own credit or the public credit of the country  in the midst of this clamor and distress a new bank was established in scotland for the express purpose of relieving the distress of the country the design was generous but the execution was imprudent and the nature and causes of the distress which it meant to relieve were not perhaps well understood this bank was more liberal than any other had ever been both in granting cash accounts and in discounting bills of exchange with regard to the latter it seems to have made scarce any distinction between real and circulating bills but to have discounted all equally it was the avowed principle of this bank to advance upon any reasonable security the whole capital which was to be employed in improvements of which the returns are the most slow and distant such as the improvements of land to promote such improvements was even said to be the chief of the public spirited purposes for which it was instituted by its liberality in granting cash accounts and in discounting bills of exchange it no doubt issued great quantities of its banknotes but those banknotes being the greater part of them over and above what the circulation of the country could easily absorb and employ returned upon it in order to be exchanged for gold and silver as fast as they were issued its coffers were never well filled the capital which had been subscribed to this bank at two different subscriptions amounted to one hundred and sixty thousand pounds of which eighty per cent only was paid up this sum ought to have been paid in at several different installments a great part of the proprietors when they paid in their first installment opened a cash account with the bank and the directors thinking themselves obliged to treat their own proprietors with the same liberality with which they treated all other men allowed many of them to borrow upon this cash account what they paid in upon all their subsequent installments such payments therefore only put into one coffer what had the moment before been taken out of another but had the coffers of this bank been filled ever so well its excessive circulation must have emptied them faster than they could have been replenished by any other expedient but the ruinous one of drawing upon london and when the bill became due paying it together with interest and commission by another draught upon the same place its coffers having been filled so very ill it is said to have been driven to this resource within a very few months after it began to do business the estates of the proprietors of this bank were worth several millions and by their subscription to the original bond or contract of the bank were really pledged for answering all its engagements by means of the great credit which so great a pledge necessarily gave it it was notwithstanding its too liberal conduct enabled to carry on business for more than two years when it was obliged to stop it had in the circulation about two hundred thousand pounds in banknotes in order to support the circulation of those notes which were continually returning upon it as fast as they were issued it had been constantly in the practice of drawing bills of exchange upon london of which the number and value were continually increasing and when it stopped amounted to upwards of six hundred thousand pounds this bank therefore had in little more than the course of two years advanced to different people upwards of eight hundred thousand pounds at five per cent upon the two hundred thousand pounds which it circulated in banknotes this five per cent might perhaps be considered as clear gain without any other deduction besides the expense of management but upon upwards of six hundred thousand pounds for which it was continually drawing bills of exchange upon london it was paying in the way of interest and commission upwards of eight per cent and was consequently losing more than three per cent upon more than threefourths of all its dealings  the operations of this bank seem to have produced effects quite opposite to those which were intended by the particular persons who planned and directed it they seem to have intended to support the spirited undertakings for as such they considered them which were at that time carrying on in different parts of the country and at the same time by drawing the whole banking business to themselves to supplant all the other scotch banks particularly those established at edinburgh whose backwardness in discounting bills of exchange had given some offense this bank no doubt gave some temporary relief to those projectors and enabled them to carry on their projects for about two years longer than they could otherwise have done but it thereby only enabled them to get so much deeper into debt so that when ruin came it fell so much the heavier both upon them and upon their creditors the operations of this bank therefore instead of relieving in reality aggravated in the longrun the distress which those projectors had brought both upon themselves and upon their country it would have been much better for themselves their creditors and their country had the greater part of them been obliged to stop two years sooner than they actually did the temporary relief however which this bank afforded to those projectors proved a real and permanent relief to the other scotch banks all the dealers in circulating bills of exchange which those other banks had become so backward in discounting had recourse to this new bank where they were received with open arms those other banks therefore were enabled to get very easily out of that fatal circle from which they could not otherwise have disengaged themselves without incurring a considerable loss and perhaps too even some degree of discredit  in the longrun therefore the operations of this bank increased the real distress of the country which it meant to relieve and effectually relieved from a very great distress those rivals whom it meant to supplant  at the first setting out of this bank it was the opinion of some people that how fast soever its coffers might be emptied it might easily replenish them by raising money upon the securities of those to whom it had advanced its paper experience i believe soon convinced them that this method of raising money was by much too slow to answer their purpose and that coffers which originally were so ill filled and which emptied themselves so very fast could be replenished by no other expedient but the ruinous one of drawing bills upon london and when they became due paying them by other draughts upon the same place with accumulated interest and commission but though they had been able by this method to raise money as fast as they wanted it yet instead of making a profit they must have suffered a loss by every such operation so that in the longrun they must have ruined themselves as a mercantile company though perhaps not so soon as by the more expensive practice of drawing and redrawing they could still have made nothing by the interest of the paper which being over and above what the circulation of the country could absorb and employ returned upon them in order to be exchanged for gold and silver as fast as they issued it and for the payment of which they were themselves continually obliged to borrow money on the contrary the whole expense of this borrowing of employing agents to look out for people who had money to lend of negociating with those people and of drawing the proper bond or assignment must have fallen upon them and have been so much clear loss upon the balance of their accounts the project of replenishing their coffers in this manner may be compared to that of a man who had a waterpond from which a stream was continually running out and into which no stream was continually running but who proposed to keep it always equally full by employing a number of people to go continually with buckets to a well at some miles distance in order to bring water to replenish it  but though this operation had proved not only practicable but profitable to the bank as a mercantile company yet the country could have derived no benefit from it but on the contrary must have suffered a very considerable loss by it this operation could not augment in the smallest degree the quantity of money to be lent it could only have erected this bank into a sort of general loan office for the whole country those who wanted to borrow must have applied to this bank instead of applying to the private persons who had lent it their money but a bank which lends money perhaps to five hundred different people the greater part of whom its directors can know very little about is not likely to be more judicious in the choice of its debtors than a private person who lends out his money among a few people whom he knows and in whose sober and frugal conduct he thinks he has good reason to confide the debtors of such a bank as that whose conduct i have been giving some account of were likely the greater part of them to be chimerical projectors the drawers and redrawers of circulating bills of exchange who would employ the money in extravagant undertakings which with all the assistance that could be given them they would probably never be able to complete and which if they should be completed would never repay the expense which they had really cost would never afford a fund capable of maintaining a quantity of labor equal to that which had been employed about them the sober and frugal debtors of private persons on the contrary would be more likely to employ the money borrowed in sober undertakings which were proportioned to their capitals and which though they might have less of the grand and the mavelous would have more of the solid and the profitable which would repay with a large profit whatever had been laid out upon them and which would thus afford a fund capable of maintaining a much greater quantity of labor than that which had been employed about them the success of this operation therefore without increasing in the smallest degree the capital of the country would only have transferred a great part of it from prudent and profitable to imprudent and unprofitable undertakings  that the industry of scotland languished for want of money to employ it was the opinion of the famous mr law by establishing a bank of a particular kind which he seems to have imagined might issue paper to the amount of the whole value of all the lands in the country he proposed to remedy this want of money the parliament of scotland when he first proposed his project did not think proper to adopt it it was afterward adopted with some variations by the duke of orleans at that time regent of france the idea of the possibility of multiplying paper money to almost any extent was the real foundation of what is called the mississippi scheme the most extravagant project both of banking and stockjobbing that perhaps the world ever saw the different operations of this scheme are explained so fully so clearly and with so much order and distinctness by mr du verney in his examination of the political reflections upon commerce and finances of mr du tot that i shall not give any account of them the principles upon which it was founded are explained by mr law himself in a discourse concerning money and trade which he published in scotland when he first proposed his project the splendid but visionary ideas which are set forth in that and some other works upon the same principles still continue to make an impression upon many people and have perhaps in part contributed to that excess of banking which has of late been complained of both in scotland and in other places  the bank of england is the greatest bank of circulation in europe it was incorporated in pursuance of an act of parliament by a charter under the great seal dated the   th july      it at that time advanced to government the sum of one million two hundred thousand pounds for an annuity of one hundred thousand pounds or for   000 l a year interest at the rate of eight per cent and  000 l a year for the expense of management the credit of the new government established by the revolution we may believe must have been very low when it was obliged to borrow at so high an interest  in      the bank was allowed to enlarge its capital stock by an engraftment of  00     l  0 s its whole capital stock therefore amounted at this time to   0     l  0 s this engraftment is said to have been for the support of public credit in      tallies had been at forty and fifty and sixty per cent discount and bank notes at twenty per cent james postlethwaites history of the public revenue page  0   during the great recoinage of the silver which was going on at this time the bank had thought proper to discontinue the payment of its notes which necessarily occasioned their discredit  in pursuance of the  th anne c vii the bank advanced and paid into the exchequer the sum of  00000 l making in all the sum of   00000 l which it had advanced upon its original annuity of   000 l interest and  000 l for expense of management in   0  therefore the credit of government was as good as that of private persons since it could borrow at six per cent interest the common legal and market rate of those times in pursuance of the same act the bank cancelled exchequer bills to the amount of     0   l    s  0d at six per cent interest and was at the same time allowed to take in subscriptions for doubling its capital in   0  therefore the capital of the bank amounted to   0     l and it had advanced to government the sum of     0   l    s  0d  by a call of fifteen per cent in   0  there was paid in and made stock     0  l   s   d and by another of ten per cent in    0 0     l    s    d in consequence of those two calls therefore the bank capital amounted to         l    s   d  in pursuance of the  th george i c xxi the bank purchased of the south sea company stock to the amount of  000000 l and in      in consequence of the subscriptions which it had taken in for enabling it to make this purchase its capital stock was increased by   00000 l at this time therefore the bank had advanced to the public     0   l    s  0d and its capital stock amounted only to         l    s   d it was upon this occasion that the sum which the bank had advanced to the public and for which it received interest began first to exceed its capital stock or the sum for which it paid a dividend to the proprietors of bank stock or in other words that the bank began to have an undivided capital over and above its divided one it has continued to have an undivided capital of the same kind ever since in      the bank had upon different occasions advanced to the public       00 l and its divided capital had been raised by different calls and subscriptions to  0  0000 l the state of those two sums has continued to be the same ever since in pursuance of the  th of george iii c    the bank agreed to pay to government for the renewal of its charter   0000 l without interest or repayment this sum therefore did not increase either of those two other sums  the dividend of the bank has varied according to the variations in the rate of the interest which it has at different times received for the money it had advanced to the public as well as according to other circumstances this rate of interest has gradually been reduced from eight to three per cent for some years past the bank dividend has been at five and a half per cent  the stability of the bank of england is equal to that of the british government all that it has advanced to the public must be lost before its creditors can sustain any loss no other banking company in england can be established by act of parliament or can consist of more than six members it acts not only as an ordinary bank but as a great engine of state it receives and pays the greater part of the annuities which are due to the creditors of the public it circulates exchequer bills and it advances to government the annual amount of the land and malt taxes which are frequently not paid up till some years thereafter in those different operations its duty to the public may sometimes have obliged it without any fault of its directors to overstock the circulation with paper money it likewise discounts merchants bills and has upon several different occasions supported the credit of the principal houses not only of england but of hamburgh and holland upon one occasion it is said to have advanced for this purpose in one week about   00000 l a great part of it in bullion i do not however pretend to warrant either the greatness of the sum or the shortness of the time upon other occasions this great company has been reduced to the necessity of paying in sixpences  it is not by augmenting the capital of the country but by rendering a greater part of that capital active and productive than would otherwise be so that the most judicious operations of banking can increase the industry of the country that part of his capital which a dealer is obliged to keep by him unemployed and in ready money for answering occasional demands is so much dead stock which so long as it remains in this situation produces nothing either to him or to his country the judicious operations of banking enable him to convert this dead stock into active and productive stock into materials to work upon into tools to work with and into provisions and subsistence to work for into stock which produces something both to him and to his country the gold and silver money which circulates in any country and by means of which the produce of its land and labor is annually circulated and distributed to the proper consumers is in the same manner as the ready money of the dealer all dead stock it is a very valuable part of the capital of the country which produces nothing to the country the judicious operations of banking by substituting paper in the room of a great part of this gold and silver enables the country to convert a great part of this dead stock into active and productive stock into stock which produces something to the country the gold and silver money which circulates in any country may very properly be compared to a highway which while it circulates and carries to market all the grass and corn of the country produces itself not a single pile of either the judicious operations of banking by providing if i may be allowed so violent a metaphor a sort of waggonway through the air enable the country to convert as it were a great part of its highways into good pastures and corn fields and thereby to increase very considerably the annual produce of its land and labor the commerce and industry of the country however it must be acknowledged though they may be somewhat augmented cannot be altogether so secure when they are thus as it were suspended upon the daedalian wings of paper money as when they travel about upon the solid ground of gold and silver over and above the accidents to which they are exposed from the unskilfulness of the conductors of this paper money they are liable to several others from which no prudence or skill of those conductors can guard them  an unsuccessful war for example in which the enemy got possession of the capital and consequently of that treasure which supported the credit of the paper money would occasion a much greater confusion in a country where the whole circulation was carried on by paper than in one where the greater part of it was carried on by gold and silver the usual instrument of commerce having lost its value no exchanges could be made but either by barter or upon credit all taxes having been usually paid in paper money the prince would not have wherewithal either to pay his troops or to furnish his magazines and the state of the country would be much more irretrievable than if the greater part of its circulation had consisted in gold and silver a prince anxious to maintain his dominions at all times in the state in which he can most easily defend them ought upon this account to guard not only against that excessive multiplication of paper money which ruins the very banks which issue it but even againt that multiplication of it which enables them to fill the greater part of the circulation of the country with it  the circulation of every country may be considered as divided into two different branches the circulation of the dealers with one another and the circulation between the dealers and the consumers though the same pieces of money whether paper or metal may be employed sometimes in the one circulation and sometimes in the other yet as both are constantly going on at the same time each requires a certain stock of money of one kind or another to carry it on the value of the goods circulated between the different dealers never can exceed the value of those circulated between the dealers and the consumers whatever is bought by the dealers being ultimately destined to be sold to the consumers the circulation between the dealers as it is carried on by wholesale requires generally a pretty large sum for every particular transaction that between the dealers and the consumers on the contrary as it is generally carried on by retail frequently requires but very small ones a shilling or even a halfpenny being often sufficient but small sums circulate much faster than large ones a shilling changes masters more frequently than a guinea and a halfpenny more frequently than a shilling though the annual purchases of all the consumers therefore are at least equal in value to those of all the dealers they can generally be transacted with a much smaller quantity of money the same pieces by a more rapid circulation serving as the instrument of many more purchases of the one kind than of the other  paper money may be so regulated as either to confine itself very much to the circulation between the different dealers or to extend itself likewise to a great part of that between the dealers and the consumers where no bank notes are circulated under ten pounds value as in london paper money confines itself very much to the circulation between the dealers when a ten pound bank note comes into the hands of a consumer he is generally obliged to change it at the first shop where he has occasion to purchase five shillings worth of goods so that it often returns into the hands of a dealer before the consumer has spent the fortieth part of the money where bank notes are issued for so small sums as twenty shillings as in scotland paper money extends itself to a considerable part of the circulation between dealers and consumers before the act of parliament which put a stop to the circulation of ten and five shilling notes it filled a still greater part of that circulation in the currencies of north america paper was commonly issued for so small a sum as a shilling and filled almost the whole of that circulation in some paper currencies of yorkshire it was issued even for so small a sum as a sixpence  where the issuing of bank notes for such very small sums is allowed and commonly practiced many mean people are both enabled and encouraged to become bankers a person whose promissory note for five pounds or even for twenty shillings would be rejected by every body will get it to be received without scruple when it is issued for so small a sum as a sixpence but the frequent bankruptcies to which such beggarly bankers must be liable may occasion a very considerable inconveniency and sometimes even a very great calamity to many poor people who had received their notes in payment  it were better perhaps that no bank notes were issued in any part of the kingdom for a smaller sum than five pounds paper money would then probably confine itself in every part of the kingdom to the circulation between the different dealers as much as it does at present in london where no bank notes are issued under ten pounds value five pounds being in most parts of the kingdom a sum which though it will purchase perhaps little more than half the quantity of goods is as much considered and is as seldom spent all at once as ten pounds are amidst the profuse expense of london  where paper money it is to be observed is pretty much confined to the circulation between dealers and dealers as at london there is always plenty of gold and silver where it extends itself to a considerable part of the circulation between dealers and consumers as in scotland and still more in north america it banishes gold and silver almost entirely from the country almost all the ordinary transactions of its interior commerce being thus carried on by paper the suppression of ten and five shilling bank notes somewhat relieved the scarcity of gold and silver in scotland and the suppression of twenty shilling notes would probably relieve it still more those metals are said to have become more abundant in america since the suppression of some of their paper currencies they are said likewise to have been more abundant before the institution of those currencies  though paper money should be pretty much confined to the circulation between dealers and dealers yet banks and bankers might still be able to give nearly the same assistance to the industry and commerce of the country as they had done when paper money filled almost the whole circulation the ready money which a dealer is obliged to keep by him for answering occasional demands is destined altogether for the circulation between himself and other dealers of whom he buys goods he has no occasion to keep any by him for the circulation between himself and the consumers who are his customers and who bring ready money to him instead of taking any from him though no paper money therefore was allowed to be issued but for such sums as would confine it pretty much to the circulation between dealers and dealers yet partly by discounting real bills of exchange and partly by lending upon cash accounts banks and bankers might still be able to relieve the greater part of those dealers from the necessity of keeping any considerable part of their stock by them unemployed and in ready money for answering occasional demands they might still be able to give the utmost assistance which banks and bankers can with propriety give to traders of every kind  to restrain private people it may be said from receiving in payment the promissary notes of a banker for any sum whether great or small when they themselves are willing to receive them or to restrain a banker from issuing such notes when all his neighbors are willing to accept of them is a manifest violation of that natural liberty which it is the proper business of law not to infringe but to support such regulations may no doubt be considered as in some respect a violation of natural liberty but those exertions of the natural liberty of a few individuals which might endanger the security of the whole society are and ought to be restrained by the laws of all governments of the most free as well as of the most despotical the obligation of building party walls in order to prevent the communication of fire is a violation of natural liberty exactly of the same kind with the regulations of the banking trade which are here proposed  a paper money consisting in bank notes issued by people of undoubted credit payable upon demand without any condition and in fact always readily paid as soon as presented is in every respect equal in value to gold and silver money since gold and silver money can at any time be had for it whatever is either bought or sold for such paper must necessarily be bought or sold as cheap as it could have been for gold and silver  the increase of paper money it has been said by augmenting the quantity and consequently diminishing the value of the whole currency necessarily augments the money price of commodities but as the quantity of gold and silver which is taken from the currency is always equal to the quantity of paper which is added to it paper money does not necessarily increase the quantity of the whole currency from the beginning of the last century to the present times provisions never were cheaper in scotland than in      though from the circulation of ten and five shilling bank notes there was then more paper money in the country than at present the proportion between the price of provisions in scotland and that in england is the same now as before the great multiplication of banking companies in scotland corn is upon most occasions fully as cheap in england as in france though there is a great deal of paper money in england and scarce any in france in      and in      when mr hume published his political discourses and soon after the great multiplication of paper money in scotland there was a very sensible rise in the price of provisions owing probably to the badness of the seasons and not to the multiplication of paper money  it would be otherwise indeed with a paper money consisting in promissary notes of which the immediate payment depended in any respect either upon the good will of those who issued them or upon a condition which the holder of the notes might not always have it in his power to fulfill or of which the payment was not exigible till after a certain number of years and which in the meantime bore no interest such a paper money would no doubt fall more or less below the value of gold and silver according as the difficulty or uncertainty of obtaining immediate payment was supposed to be greater or less or according to the greater or less distance of time at which payment was exigible  some years ago the different banking companies of scotland were in the practice of inserting into their bank notes what they called an optional clause by which they promised payment to the bearer either as soon as the note should be presented or in the option of the directors six months after such presentment together with the legal interest for the said six months the directors of some of those banks sometimes took advantage of this optional clause and sometimes threatened those who demanded gold and silver in exchange for a considerable number of their notes that they would take advantage of it unless such demanders would content themselves with a part of what they demanded the promissary notes of those banking companies constituted at that time the far greater part of the currency of scotland which this uncertainty of payment necessarily degraded below the value of gold and silver money during the continuance of this abuse which prevailed chiefly in           and      while the exchange between london and carlisle was at par that between london and dumfries would sometimes be four per cent against dumfries though this town is not thirty miles distant from carlisle but at carlisle bills were paid in gold and silver whereas at dumfries they were paid in scotch bank notes and the uncertainty of getting those bank notes exchanged for gold and silver coin had thus degraded them four per cent below the value of that coin the same act of parliament which suppressed ten and five shilling bank notes suppressed likewise this optional clause and thereby restored the exchange between england and scotland to its natural rate or to what the course of trade and remittances might happen to make it  in the paper currencies of yorkshire the payment of so small a sum as a sixpence sometimes depended upon the condition that the holder of the note should bring the change of a guinea to the person who issued it a condition which the holders of such notes might frequently find it very difficult to fulfill and which must have degraded this currency below the value of gold and silver money an act of parliament accordingly declared all such clauses unlawful and suppressed in the same manner as in scotland all promissary notes payable to the bearer under twenty shillings value  the paper currencies of north america consisted not in bank notes payable to the bearer on demand but in a government paper of which the payment was not exigible till several years after it was issued and though the colony governments paid no interest to the holders of this paper they declared it to be and in fact rendered it a legal tender of payment for the full value for which it was issued but allowing the colony security to be perfectly good a hundred pounds payable fifteen years hence for example in a country where interest is at six per cent is worth little more than forty pounds ready money to oblige a creditor therefore to accept of this as full payment for a debt of a hundred pounds actually paid down in ready money was an act of such violent injustice as has scarce perhaps been attempted by the government of any other country which pretended to be free it bears the evident marks of having originally been what the honest and downright doctor douglass assures us it was a scheme of fraudulent debtors to cheat their creditors the government of pensylvania indeed pretended upon their first emission of paper money in      to render their paper of equal value with gold and silver by enacting penalties against all those who made any difference in the price of their goods when they sold them for a colony paper and when they sold them for gold and silver a regulation equally tyrannical but much less effectual than that which it was meant to support a positive law may render a shilling a legal tender for a guinea because it may direct the courts of justice to discharge the debtor who has made that tender but no positive law can oblige a person who sells goods and who is at liberty to sell or not to sell as he pleases to accept of a shilling as equivalent to a guinea in the price of them notwithstanding any regulation of this kind it appeared by the course of exchange with great britain that a hundred pounds sterling was occasionally considered as equivalent in some of the colonies to a hundred and thirty pounds and in others to so great a sum as eleven hundred pounds currency this difference in the value arising from the difference in the quantity of paper emitted in the different colonies and in the distance and probability of the term of its final discharge and redemption  no law therefore could be more equitable than the act of parliament so unjustly complained of in the colonies which declared that no paper currency to be emitted there in time coming should be a legal tender of payment  pensylvania was always more moderate in its emissions of paper money than any other of our colonies its paper currency accordingly is said never to have sunk below the value of the gold and silver which was current in the colony before the first emission of its paper money before that emission the colony had raised the denomination of its coin and had by act of assembly ordered five shillings sterling to pass in the colony for six and threepence and afterward for six and eightpence a pound colony currency therefore even when that currency was gold and silver was more than thirty per cent below the value of a pound sterling and when that currency was turned into paper it was seldom much more than thirty per cent below that value the pretense for raising the denomination of the coin was to prevent the exportation of gold and silver by making equal quantities of those metals pass for greater sums in the colony than they did in the mother country it was found however that the price of all goods from the mother country rose exactly in proportion as they raised the denomination of their coin so that their gold and silver were exported as fast as ever  the paper of each colony being received in the payment of the provincial taxes for the full value for which it had been issued it necessarily derived from this use some additional value over and above what it would have had from the real or supposed distance of the term of its final discharge and redemption this additional value was greater or less according as the quantity of paper issued was more or less above what could be employed in the payment of the taxes of the particular colony which issued it it was in all the colonies very much above what could be employed in this manner  a prince who should enact that a certain proportion of his taxes should be paid in a paper money of a certain kind might thereby give a certain value to this paper money even though the term of its final discharge and redemption should depend altogether upon the will of the prince if the bank which issued this paper was careful to keep the quantity of it always somewhat below what could easily be employed in this manner the demand for it might be such as to make it even bear a premium or sell for somewhat more in the market than the quantity of gold or silver currency for which it was issued some people account in this manner for what is called the agio of the bank of amsterdam or for the superiority of bank money over current money though this bank money as they pretend cannot be taken out of the bank at the will of the owner the greater part of foreign bills of exchange must be paid in bank money that is by a transfer in the books of the bank and the directors of the bank they allege are careful to keep the whole quantity of bank money always below what this use occasions a demand for it is upon this account they say that bank money sells for a premium or bears an agio of four or five per cent above the same nominal sum of the gold and silver currency of the country this account of the bank of amsterdam however i have reason to believe is altogether chimerical  a paper currency which falls below the value of gold and silver coin does not thereby sink the value of gold and silver or occasion equal quantities of those metals to exchange for a smaller quantity of goods of any other kind the proportion between the value of gold and silver and that of goods of any other kind depends in all cases not upon the nature or quantity of any particular paper money which may be current in any particular country but upon the richness or poverty of the mines which happen at any particular time to supply the great market of the commercial world with those metals it depends upon the proportion between the quantity of labor which is necessary in order to bring a certain quantity of gold and silver to market and that which is necessary in order to bring thither a certain quantity of any other sort of goods  if bankers are restrained from issuing any circulating bank notes or notes payable to the bearer for less than a certain sum and if they are subjected to the obligation of an immediate and unconditional payment of such bank notes as soon as presented their trade may with safety to the public be rendered in all other respects perfectly free the late multiplication of banking companies in both parts of the united kingdom an event by which many people have been much alarmed instead of diminishing increases the security of the public it obliges all of them to be more circumspect in their conduct and by not extending their currency beyond its due proportion to their cash to guard themselves against those malicious runs which the rivalship of so many competitors is always ready to bring upon them it restrains the circulation of each particular company within a narrower circle and reduces their circulating notes to a smaller number by dividing the whole circulation into a greater number of parts the failure of any one company an accident which in the course of things must sometimes happen becomes of less consequence to the public this free competition too obliges all bankers to be more liberal in their dealings with their customers lest their rivals should carry them away in general if any branch of trade or any division of labor be advantageous to the public the freer and more general the competition it will always be the more so  chap iii of the accumulation of capital or of productive and unproductive labor there is one sort of labor which adds to the value of the subject upon which it is bestowed there is another which has no such effect the former as it produces a value may be called productive the latter unproductive some french authors of great learning and ingenuity have used those words in a different sense in the last chapter of the fourth book i shall endeavor to show that their sense is an improper one labor thus the labor of a manufacturer adds generally to the value of the materials which he works upon that of his own maintenance and of his masters profit the labor of a menial servant on the contrary adds to the value of nothing though the manufacturer has his wages advanced to him by his master he in reality costs him no expense the value of those wages being generally restored together with a profit in the improved value of the subject upon which his labor is bestowed but the maintenance of a menial servant never is restored a man grows rich by employing a multitude of manufacturers he grows poor by maintaining a multitude of menial servants the labor of the latter however has its value and deserves its reward as well as that of the former but the labor of the manufacturer fixes and realizes itself in some particular subject or vendible commodity which lasts for some time at least after that labor is past it is as it were a certain quantity of labor stocked and stored up to be employed if necessary upon some other occasion that subject or what is the same thing the price of that subject can afterward if necessary put into motion a quantity of labor equal to that which had originally produced it the labor of the menial servant on the contrary does not fix or realize itself in any particular subject or vendible commodity his services generally perish in the very instant of their performance and seldom leave any trace or value behind them for which an equal quantity of service could afterward be procured  the labor of some of the most respectable orders in the society is like that of menial servants unproductive of any value and does not fix or realize itself in any permanent subject or vendible commodity which endures after that labor is past and for which an equal quantity of labor could afterward be procured the sovereign for example with all the officers both of justice and war who serve under him the whole army and navy are unproductive laborers they are the servants of the public and are maintained by a part of the annual produce of the industry of other people their service how honorable how useful or how necessary soever produces nothing for which an equal quantity of service can afterward be procured the protection security and defense of the commonwealth the effect of their labor this year will not purchase its protection security and defense for the year to come in the same class must be ranked some both of the gravest and most important and some of the most frivolous professions churchmen lawyers physicians men of letters of all kinds players buffoons musicians operasingers operadancers etc the labor of the meanest of these has a certain value regulated by the very same principles which regulate that of every other sort of labor and that of the noblest and most useful produces nothing which could afterward purchase or procure an equal quantity of labor like the declamation of the actor the harangue of the orator or the tune of the musician the work of all of them perishes in the very instant of its production  both productive and unproductive laborers and those who do not labor at all are all equally maintained by the annual produce of the land and labor of the country this produce how great soever can never be infinite but must have certain limits according therefore as a smaller or greater proportion of it is in any one year employed in maintaining unproductive hands the more in the one case and the less in the other will remain for the productive and the next years produce will be greater or smaller accordingly the whole annual produce if we except the spontaneous productions of the earth being the effect of productive labor  though the whole annual produce of the land and labor of every country is no doubt ultimately destined for supplying the consumption of its inhabitants and for procuring a revenue to them yet when it first comes either from the ground or from the hands of the productive laborers it naturally divides itself into two parts one of them and frequently the largest is in the first place destined for replacing a capital or for renewing the provisions materials and finished work which had been withdrawn from a capital the other for constituting a revenue either to the owner of this capital as the profit of his stock or to some other person as the rent of his land thus of the produce of land one part replaces the capital of the farmer the other pays his profit and the rent of the landlord and thus constitutes a revenue both to the owner of this capital as the profits of his stock and to some other person as the rent of his land of the produce of a great manufacture in the same manner one part and that always the largest replaces the capital of the undertaker of the work the other pays his profit and thus constitutes a revenue to the owner of this capital  that part of the annual produce of the land and labor of any country which replaces a capital never is immediately employed to maintain any but productive hands it pays the wages of productive labor only that which is immediately destined for constituting a revenue either as profit or as rent may maintain indifferently either productive or unproductive hands  whatever part of his stock a man employs as a capital he always expects is to be replaced to him with a profit he employs it therefore in maintaining productive hands only and after having served in the function of a capital to him it constitutes a revenue to them whenever he employs any part of it in maintaining unproductive hands of any kind that part is from that moment withdrawn from his capital and placed in his stock reserved for immediate consumption  unproductive laborers and those who do not labor at all are all maintained by revenue either first by that part of the annual produce which is originally destined for constituting a revenue to some particular persons either as the rent of land or as the profits of stock or secondly by that part which though originally destined for replacing a capital and for maintaining productive laborers only yet when it comes into their hands whatever part of it is over and above their necessary subsistence may be employed in maintaining indifferently either productive or unproductive hands thus not only the great landlord or the rich merchant but even the common workman if his wages are considerable may maintain a menial servant or he may sometimes go to a play or a puppetshow and so contribute his share toward maintaining one set of unproductive laborers or he may pay some taxes and thus help to maintain another set more honorable and useful indeed but equally unproductive no part of the annual produce however which had been originally destined to replace a capital is ever directed toward maintaining unproductive hands till after it has put into motion its full complement of productive labor or all that it could put into motion in the way in which it was employed the workman must have earned his wages by work done before he can employ any part of them in this manner that part too is generally but a small one it is his spare revenue only of which productive laborers have seldom a great deal they generally have some however and in the payment of taxes the greatness of their number may compensate in some measure the smallness of their contribution the rent of land and the profits of stock are every where therefore the principal sources from which unproductive hands derive their subsistence these are the two sorts of revenue of which the owners have generally most to spare they might both maintain indifferently either productive or unproductive hands they seem however to have some predilection for the latter the expense of a great lord feeds generally more idle than industrious people the rich merchant though with his capital he maintains industrious people only yet by his expense that is by the employment of his revenue he feeds commonly the very same sort as the great lord  the proportion therefore between the productive and unproductive hands depends very much in every country upon the proportion between that part of the annual produce which as soon as it comes either from the ground or from the hands of the productive laborers is destined for replacing a capital and that which is destined for constituting a revenue either as rent or as profit this proportion is very different in rich from what it is in poor countries  thus at present in the opulent countries of europe a very large frequently the largest portion of the produce of the land is destined for replacing the capital of the rich and independent farmer the other for paying his profits and the rent of the landlord but anciently during the prevalency of the feudal government a very small portion of the produce was sufficient to replace the capital employed in cultivation it consisted commonly in a few wretched cattle maintained altogether by the spontaneous produce of uncultivated land and which might therefore be considered as a part of that spontaneous produce it generally too belonged to the landlord and was by him advanced to the occupiers of the land all the rest of the produce properly belonged to him too either as rent for his land or as profit upon this paultry capital the occupiers of land were generally bondmen whose persons and effects were equally his property those who were not bondmen were tenants at will and though the rent which they paid was often nominally little more than a quitrent it really amounted to the whole produce of the land their lord could at all times command their labor in peace and their service in war though they lived at a distance from his house they were equally dependant upon him as his retainers who lived in it but the whole produce of the land undoubtedly belongs to him who can dispose of the labor and service of all those whom it maintains in the present state of europe the share of the landlord seldom exceeds a third sometimes not a fourth part of the whole produce of the land the rent of land however in all the improved parts of the country has been tripled and quadrupled since those ancient times and this third or fourth part of the annual produce is it seems three or four times greater than the whole had been before in the progress of improvement rent though it increases in proportion to the extent diminishes in proportion to the produce of the land  in the opulent countries of europe great capitals are at present employed in trade and manufactures in the ancient state the little trade that was stirring and the few homely and coarse manufactures that were carried on required but very small capitals these however must have yielded very large profits the rate of interest was no where less than ten per cent and their profits must have been sufficient to afford this great interest at present the rate of interest in the improved parts of europe is no where higher than six per cent and in some of the most improved it is so low as four three and two per cent though that part of the revenue of the inhabitants which is derived from the profits of stock is always much greater in rich than in poor countries it is because the stock is much greater in proportion to the stock the profits are generally much less  that part of the annual produce therefore which as soon as it comes either from the ground or from the hands of the productive laborers is destined for replacing a capital is not only much greater in rich than in poor countries but bears a much greater proportion to that which is immediately destined for constituting a revenue either as rent or as profit the funds destined for the maintenance of productive labor are not only much greater in the former than in the latter but bear a much greater proportion to those which though they may be employed to maintain either productive or unproductive hands have generally a predilection for the latter  the proportion between those different funds necessarily determines in every country the general character of the inhabitants as to industry or idleness we are more industrious than our forefathers because in the present times the funds destined for the maintenance of industry are much greater in proportion to those which are likely to be employed in the maintenance of idleness than they were two or three centuries ago our ancestors were idle for want of a sufficient encouragement to industry it is better says the proverb to play for nothing than to work for nothing in mercantile and manufacturing towns where the inferior ranks of people are chiefly maintained by the employment of capital they are in general industrious sober and thriving as in many english and in most dutch towns in those towns which are principally supported by the constant or occasional residence of a court and in which the inferior ranks of people are chiefly maintained by the spending of revenue they are in general idle dissolute and poor as at rome versailles compiegne and fontainbleau if you except rouen and bourdeaux there is little trade or industry in any of the parliament towns of france and the inferior ranks of people being chiefly maintained by the expense of the members of the courts of justice and of those who come to plead before them are in general idle and poor the great trade of rouen and bourdeaux seems to be altogether the effect of their situation rouen is necessarily the entrepot of almost all the goods which are brought either from foreign countries or from the maritime provinces of france for the consumption of the great city of paris bourdeaux is in the same manner the entrepot of the wines which grow upon the banks of the garonne and of the rivers which run into it one of the richest wine countries in the world and which seems to produce the wine fittest for exportation or best suited to the taste of foreign nations such advantageous situations necessarily attract a great capital by the great employment which they afford it and the employment of this capital is the cause of the industry of those two cities in the other parliament towns of france very little more capital seems to be employed than what is necessary for supplying their own consumption that is little more than the smallest capital which can be employed in them the same thing may be said of paris madrid and vienna of those three cities paris is by far the most industrious but paris itself is the principal market of all the manufactures established at paris and its own consumption is the principal object of all the trade which it carries on london lisbon and copenhagen are perhaps the only three cities in europe which are both the constant residence of a court and can at the same time be considered as trading cities or as cities which trade not only for their own consumption but for that of other cities and countries the situation of all the three is extremely advantageous and naturally fits them to be the entrepots of a great part of the goods destined for the consumption of distant places in a city where a great revenue is spent to employ with advantage a capital for any other purpose than for supplying the consumption of that city is probably more difficult than in one in which the inferior ranks of people have no other maintenance but what they derive from the employment of such a capital the idleness of the greater part of the people who are maintained by the expense of revenue corrupts it is probable the industry of those who ought to be maintained by the employment of capital and renders it less advantageous to employ a capital there than in other places there was little trade or industry in edinburgh before the union when the scotch parliament was no longer to be assembled in it when it ceased to be the necessary residence of the principal nobility and gentry of scotland it became a city of some trade and industry it still continues however to be the residence of the principal courts of justice in scotland of the boards of customs and excise etc a considerable revenue therefore still continues to be spent in it in trade and industry it is much inferior to glasgow of which the inhabitants are chiefly maintained by the employment of capital the inhabitants of a large village it has sometimes been observed after having made considerable progress in manufactures have become idle and poor in consequence of a great lords having taken up his residence in their neighborhood  the proportion between capital and revenue therefore seems every where to regulate the proportion between industry and idleness wherever capital predominates industry prevails wherever revenue idleness every increase or diminution of capital therefore naturally tends to increase or diminish the real quantity of industry the number of productive hands and consequently the exchangeable value of the annual produce of the land and labor of the country the real wealth and revenue of all its inhabitants  capitals are increased by parsimony and diminished by prodigality and misconduct  whatever a person saves from his revenue he adds to his capital and either employs it himself in maintaining an additional number of productive hands or enables some other person to do so by lending it to him for an interest that is for a share of the profits as the capital of an individual can be increased only by what he saves from his annual revenue or his annual gains so the capital of a society which is the same with that of all the individuals who compose it can be increased only in the same manner  parsimony and not industry is the immediate cause of the increase of capital industry indeed provides the subject which parsimony accumulates but whatever industry might acquire if parsimony did not save and store up the capital would never be the greater  parsimony by increasing the fund which is destined for the maintenance of productive hands tends to increase the number of those hands whose labor adds to the value of the subject upon which it is bestowed it tends therefore to increase the exchangeable value of the annual produce of the land and labor of the country it puts into motion an additional quantity of industry which gives an additional value to the annual produce  what is annually saved is as regularly consumed as what is annually spent and nearly in the same time too but it is consumed by a different set of people that portion of his revenue which a rich man annually spends is in most cases consumed by idle guests and menial servants who leave nothing behind them in return for their consumption that portion which he annually saves as for the sake of the profit it is immediately employed as a capital is consumed in the same manner and nearly in the same time too but by a different set of people by laborers manufacturers and artificers who reproduce with a profit the value of their annual consumption his revenue we shall suppose is paid him in money had he spent the whole the food clothing and lodging which the whole could have purchased would have been distributed among the former set of people by saving a part of it as that part is for the sake of the profit immediately employed as a capital either by himself or by some other person the food clothing and lodging which may be purchased with it are necessarily reserved for the latter the consumption is the same but the consumers are different  by what a frugal man annually saves he not only affords maintenance to an additional number of productive hands for that or the ensuing year but like the founder of a public workhouse he establishes as it were a perpetual fund for the maintenance of an equal number in all times to come the perpetual allotment and destination of this fund indeed is not always guarded by any positive law by any trustright or deed of mortmain it is always guarded however by a very powerful principle the plain and evident interest of every individual to whom any share of it shall ever belong no part of it can ever afterward be employed to maintain any but productive hands without an evident loss to the person who thus perverts it from its proper destination  the prodigal perverts it in this manner by not confining his expense within his income he encroaches upon his capital like him who perverts the revenues of some pious foundation to profane purposes he pays the wages of idleness with those funds which the frugality of his forefathers had as it were consecrated to the maintenance of industry by diminishing the funds destined for the employment of productive labor he necessarily diminishes so far as depends upon him the quantity of that labor which adds a value to the subject upon which it is bestowed and consequently the value of the annual produce of the land and labor of the whole country the real wealth and revenue of its inhabitants if the prodigality of some was not compensated by the frugality of others the conduct of every prodigal by feeding the idle with the bread of the industrious tends not only to beggar himself but to impoverish his country  though the expense of the prodigal should be altogether in homemade and no part of it in foreign commodities its effect upon the productive funds of the society would still be the same every year there would still be a certain quantity of food and clothing which ought to have maintained productive employed in maintaining unproductive hands every year therefore there would still be some diminution in what would otherwise have been the value of the annual produce of the land and labor of the country  this expense it may be said indeed not being in foreign goods and not occasioning any exportation of gold and silver the same quantity of money would remain in the country as before but if the quantity of food and clothing which were thus consumed by unproductive had been distributed among productive hands they would have reproduced together with a profit the full value of their consumption the same quantity of money would in this case equally have remained in the country and there would besides have been a reproduction of an equal value of consumable goods there would have been two values instead of one  the same quantity of money besides cannot long remain in any country in which the value of the annual produce diminishes the sole use of money is to circulate consumable goods by means of it provisions materials and finished work are bought and sold and distributed to their proper consumers the quantity of money therefore which can be annually employed in any country must be determined by the value of the consumable goods annually circulated within it these must consist either in the immediate produce of the land and labor of the country itself or in something which had been purchased with some part of that produce their value therefore must diminish as the value of that produce diminishes and along with it the quantity of money which can be employed in circulating them but the money which by this annual diminution of produce is annually thrown out of domestic circulation will not be allowed to lie idle the interest of whoever possesses it requires that it should be employed but having no employment at home it will in spite of all laws and prohibitions be sent abroad and employed in purchasing consumable goods which may be of some use at home its annual exportation will in this manner continue for some time to add something to the annual consumption of the country beyond the value of its own annual produce what in the days of its prosperity had been saved from that annual produce and employed in purchasing gold and silver will contribute for some little time to support its consumption in adversity the exportation of gold and silver is in this case not the cause but the effect of its declension and may even for some little time alleviate the misery of that declension  the quantity of money on the contrary must in every country naturally increase as the value of the annual produce increases the value of the consumable goods annually circulated within the society being greater will require a greater quantity of money to circulate them a part of the increased produce therefore will naturally be employed in purchasing wherever it is to be had the additional quantity of gold and silver necessary for circulating the rest the increase of those metals will in this case be the effect not the cause of the public prosperity gold and silver are purchased every where in the same manner the food clothing and lodging the revenue and maintenance of all those whose labor or stock is employed in bringing them from the mine to the market is the price paid for them in peru as well as in england the country which has this price to pay will never be long without the quantity of those metals which it has occasion for and no country will ever long retain a quantity which it has no occasion for  whatever therefore we may imagine the real wealth and revenue of a country to consist in whether in the value of the annual produce of its land and labor as plain reason seems to dictate or in the quantity of the precious metals which circulate within it as vulgar prejudices suppose in either view of the matter every prodigal appears to be a public enemy and every frugal man a public benefactor  the effects of misconduct are often the same as those of prodigality every injudicious and unsuccessful project in agriculture mines fisheries trade or manufactures tends in the same manner to diminish the funds destined for the maintenance of productive labor in every such project though the capital is consumed by productive hands only yet as by the injudicious manner in which they are employed they do not reproduce the full value of their consumption there must always be some diminution in what would otherwise have been the productive funds of the society  it can seldom happen indeed that the circumstances of a great nation can be much affected either by the prodigality or misconduct of individuals the profusion or imprudence of some being always more than compensated by the frugality and good conduct of others  with regard to profusion the principle which prompts to expense is the passion for present enjoyment which though sometimes violent and very difficult to be restrained is in general only momentary and occasional but the principle which prompts to save is the desire of bettering our condition a desire which though generally calm and dispassionate comes with us from the womb and never leaves us till we go into the grave in the whole interval which separates those two moments there is scarce perhaps a single instant in which any man is so perfectly and completely satisfied with his situation as to be without any wish of alteration or improvement of any kind an augmentation of fortune is the means by which the greater part of men propose and wish to better their condition it is the means the most vulgar and the most obvious and the most likely way of augmenting their fortune is to save and accumulate some part of what they acquire either regularly and annually or upon some extraordinary occasions though the principle of expense therefore prevails in almost all men upon some occasions and in some men upon almost all occasions yet in the greater part of men taking the whole course of their life at an average the principle of frugality seems not only to predominate but to predominate very greatly  with regard to misconduct the number of prudent and successful undertakings is every where much greater than that of injudicious and unsuccessful ones after all our complaints of the frequency of bankruptcies the unhappy men who fall into this misfortune make but a very small part of the whole number engaged in trade and all other sorts of business not much more perhaps than one in a thousand bankruptcy is perhaps the greatest and most humiliating calamity which can befall an innocent man the greater part of men therefore are sufficiently careful to avoid it some indeed do not avoid it as some do not avoid the gallows  great nations are never impoverished by private though they sometimes are by public prodigality and misconduct the whole or almost the whole public revenue is in most countries employed in maintaining unproductive hands such are the people who compose a numerous and splendid court a great ecclesiastical establishment great fleets and armies who in time of peace produce nothing and in time of war acquire nothing which can compensate the expense of maintaining them even while the war lasts such people as they themselves produce nothing are all maintained by the produce of other mens labor when multiplied therefore to an unnecessary number they may in a particular year consume so great a share of this produce as not to leave a sufficiency for maintaining the productive laborers who should reproduce it next year the next years produce therefore will be less than that of the foregoing and if the same disorder should continue that of the third year will be still less than that of the second those unproductive hands who should be maintained by a part only of the spare revenue of the people may consume so great a share of their whole revenue and thereby oblige so great a number to encroach upon their capitals upon the funds destined for the maintenance of productive labor that all the frugality and good conduct of individuals may not be able to compensate the waste and degradation of produce occasioned by this violent and forced encroachment  this frugality and good conduct however is upon most occasions it appears from experience sufficient to compensate not only the private prodigality and misconduct of individuals but the public extravagance of government the uniform constant and uninterrupted effort of every man to better his condition the principle from which public and national as well as private opulence is originally derived is frequently powerful enough to maintain the natural progress of things toward improvement in spite both of the extravagance of government and of the greatest errors of administration like the unknown principle of animal life it frequently restores health and vigor to the constitution in spite not only of the disease but of the absurd prescriptions of the doctor  the annual produce of the land and labor of any nation can be increased in its value by no other means but by increasing either the number of its productive laborers or the productive powers of those laborers who had before been employed the number of its productive laborers it is evident can never be much increased but in consequence of an increase of capital or of the funds destined for maintaining them the productive powers of the same number of laborers cannot be increased but in consequence either of some addition and improvement to those machines and instruments which facilitate and abridge labor or of a more proper division and distribution of employment in either case an additional capital is almost always required it is by means of an additional capital only that the undertaker of any work can either provide his workmen with better machinery or make a more proper distribution of employment among them when the work to be done consists of a number of parts to keep every man constantly employed in one way requires a much greater capital than where every man is occasionally employed in every different part of the work when we compare therefore the state of a nation at two different periods and find that the annual produce of its land and labor is evidently greater at the latter than at the former that its lands are better cultivated its manufactures more numerous and more flourishing and its trade more extensive we may be assured that its capital must have increased during the interval between those two periods and that more must have been added to it by the good conduct of some than had been taken from it either by the private misconduct of others or by the public extravagance of government but we shall find this to have been the case of almost all nations in all tolerably quiet and peaceable times even of those who have not enjoyed the most prudent and parsimonious governments to form a right judgment of it indeed we must compare the state of the country at periods somewhat distant from one another the progress is frequently so gradual that at near periods the improvement is not only not sensible but from the declension either of certain branches of industry or of certain districts of the country things which sometimes happen though the country in general is in great prosperity there frequently arises a suspicion that the riches and industry of the whole are decaying  the annual produce of the land and labor of england for example is certainly much greater than it was a little more than a century ago at the restoration of charles ii though at present few people i believe doubt of this yet during this period five years have seldom passed away in which some book or pamphlet has not been published written too with such abilities as to gain some authority with the public and pretending to demonstrate that the wealth of the nation was fast declining that the country was depopulated agriculture neglected manufactures decaying and trade undone nor have these publications been all party pamphlets the wretched offspring of falsehood and venality many of them have been written by very candid and very intelligent people who wrote nothing but what they believed and for no other reason but because they believed it  the annual produce of the land and labor of england again was certainly much greater at the restoration than we can suppose it to have been about an hundred years before at the accession of elizabeth at this period too we have all reason to believe the country was much more advanced in improvement than it had been about a century before toward the close of the dissensions between the houses of york and lancaster even then it was probably in a better condition than it had been at the norman conquest and at the norman conquest than during the confusion of the saxon heptarchy even at this early period it was certainly a more improved country than at the invasion of julius caesar when its inhabitants were nearly in the same state with the savages in north america  in each of those periods however there was not only much private and public profusion many expensive and unnecessary wars great perversion of the annual produce from maintaining productive to maintain unproductive hands but sometimes in the confusion of civil discord such absolute waste and destruction of stock as might be supposed not only to retard as it certainly did the natural accumulation of riches but to have left the country at the end of the period poorer than at the beginning thus in the happiest and most fortunate period of them all that which has passed since the restoration how many disorders and misfortunes have occurred which could they have been foreseen not only the impoverishment but the total ruin of the country would have been expected from them the fire and the plague of london the two dutch wars the disorders of the revolution the war in ireland the four expensive french wars of        0       and      together with the two rebellions of      and      in the course of the four french wars the nation has contracted more than a hundred and forty five millions of debt over and above all the other extraordinary annual expense which they occasioned so that the whole cannot be computed at less than two hundred millions so great a share of the annual produce of the land and labor of the country has since the revolution been employed upon different occasions in maintaining an extraordinary number of unproductive hands but had not those wars given this particular direction to so large a capital the greater part of it would naturally have been employed in maintaining productive hands whose labor would have replaced with a profit the whole value of their consumption the value of the annual produce of the land and labor of the country would have been considerably increased by it every year and every years increase would have augmented still more that of the next year more houses would have been built more lands would have been improved and those which had been improved before would have been better cultivated more manufactures would have been established and those which had been established before would have been more extended and to what height the real wealth and revenue of the country might by this time have been raised it is not perhaps very easy even to imagine  but though the profusion of government must undoubtedly have retarded the natural progress of england toward wealth and improvement it has not been able to stop it the annual produce of its land and labor is undoubtedly much greater at present than it was either at the restoration or at the revolution the capital therefore annually employed in cultivating this land and in maintaining this labor must likewise be much greater in the midst of all the exactions of government this capital has been silently and gradually accumulated by the private frugality and good conduct of individuals by their universal continual and uninterrupted effort to better their own condition it is this effort protected by law and allowed by liberty to exert itself in the manner that is most advantageous which has maintained the progress of england toward opulence and improvement in almost all former times and which it is to be hoped will do so in all future times england however as it has never been blessed with a very parsimonious government so parsimony has at no time been the characteristical virtue of its inhabitants it is the highest impertinence and presumption therefore in kings and ministers to pretend to watch over the economy of private people and to restrain their expense either by sumptuary laws or by prohibiting the importation of foreign luxuries they are themselves always and without any exception the greatest spendthrifts in the society let them look well after their own expense and they may safely trust private people with theirs if their own extravagance does not ruin the state that of their subjects never will  as frugality increases and prodigality diminishes the public capital so the conduct of those whose expense just equals their revenue without either accumulating or encroaching neither increases nor diminishes it some modes of expense however seem to contribute more to the growth of public opulence than others  the revenue of an individual may be spent either in things which are consumed immediately and in which one days expense can neither alleviate nor support that of another or it may be spent in things more durable which can therefore be accumulated and in which every days expense may as he chooses either alleviate or support and heighten the effect of that of the following day a man of fortune for example may either spend his revenue in a profuse and sumptuous table and in maintaining a great number of menial servants and a multitude of dogs and horses or contenting himself with a frugal table and few attendants he may lay out the greater part of it in adorning his house or his country villa in useful or ornamental buildings in useful or ornamental furniture in collecting books statues pictures or in things more frivolous jewels baubles ingenious trinkets of different kinds or what is most trifling of all in amassing a great wardrobe of fine clothes like the favorite and minister of a great prince who died a few years ago were two men of equal fortune to spend their revenue the one chiefly in the one way the other in the other the magnificence of the person whose expense had been chiefly in durable commodities would be continually increasing every days expense contributing something to support and heighten the effect of that of the following day that of the other on the contrary would be no greater at the end of the period than at the beginning the former too would at the end of the period be the richer man of the two he would have a stock of goods of some kind or other which though it might not be worth all that it cost would always be worth something no trace or vestige of the expense of the latter would remain and the effects of ten or twenty years profusion would be as completely annihilated as if they had never existed  as the one mode of expense is more favorable than the other to the opulence of an individual so is it likewise to that of a nation the houses the furniture the clothing of the rich in a little time become useful to the inferior and middling ranks of people they are able to purchase them when their superiors grow weary of them and the general accommodation of the whole people is thus gradually improved when this mode of expense becomes universal among men of fortune in countries which have long been rich you will frequently find the inferior ranks of people in possession both of houses and furniture perfectly good and entire but of which neither the one could have been built nor the other have been made for their use what was formerly a seat of the family of seymour is now an inn upon the bath road the marriage bed of james the is it of great britain which his queen brought with her from denmark as a present fit for a sovereign to make to a sovereign was a few years ago the ornament of an alehouse at dunfermline in some ancient cities which either have been long stationary or have gone somewhat to decay you will sometimes scarce find a single house which could have been built for its present inhabitants if you go into those houses too you will frequently find many excellent though antiquated pieces of furniture which are still very fit for use and which could as little have been made for them noble palaces magnificent villas great collections of books statues pictures and other curiosities are frequently both an ornament and an honor not only to the neighborhood but to the whole country to which they belong versailles is an ornament and an honor to france stowe and wilton to england italy still continues to command some sort of veneration by the number of monuments of this kind which it possesses though the wealth which produced them has decayed and the genius which planned them seems to be extinguished perhaps from not having the same employment  the expense too which is laid out in durable commodities is favorable not only to accumulation but to frugality if a person should at any time exceed in it he can easily reform without exposing himself to the censure of the public to reduce very much the number of his servants to reform his table from great profusion to great frugality to lay down his equipage after he has once set it up are changes which cannot escape the observation of his neighbors and which are supposed to imply some acknowledgement of preceding bad conduct few therefore of those who have once been so unfortunate as to launch out too far into this sort of expense have afterward the courage to reform till ruin and bankruptcy oblige them but if a person has at any time been at too great an expense in building in furniture in books or pictures no imprudence can be inferred from his changing his conduct these are things in which further expense is frequently rendered unnecessary by former expense and when a person stops short he appears to do so not because he has exceeded his fortune but because he has satisfied his fancy  the expense besides that is laid out in durable commodities gives maintenance commonly to a greater number of people than that which is employed in the most profuse hospitality of two or three hundred weight of provisions which may sometimes be served up at a great festival onehalf perhaps is thrown to the dunghill and there is always a great deal wasted and abused but if the expense of this entertainment had been employed in setting to work masons carpenters upholsterers mechanics a quantity of provisions of equal value would have been distributed among a still greater number of people who would have bought them in pennyworths and pound weights and not have lost or thrown away a single ounce of them in the one way besides this expense maintains productive in the other unproductive hands in the one way therefore it increases in the other it does not increase the exchangeable value of the annual produce of the land and labor of the country  i would not however by all this be understood to mean that the one species of expense always betokens a more liberal or generous spirit than the other when a man of fortune spends his revenue chiefly in hospitality he shares the greater part of it with his friends and companions but when he employs it in purchasing such durable commodities he often spends the whole upon his own person and gives nothing to any body without an equivalent the latter species of expense therefore especially when directed toward frivolous objects the little ornaments of dress and furniture jewels trinkets gewgaws frequently indicates not only a trifling but a base and selfish disposition all that i mean is that the one sort of expense as it always occasions some accumulation of valuable commodities as it is more favorable to private frugality and consequently to the increase of the public capital and as it maintains productive rather than unproductive hands conduces more than the other to the growth of public opulence  chap iv of stock lent at interest the stock which is lent at interest is always considered as a capital by the lender he expects that in due time it is to be restored to him and that in the mean time the borrower is to pay him a certain annual rent for the use of it the borrower may use it either as a capital or as a stock reserved for immediate consumption if he uses it as a capital he employs it in the maintenance of productive laborers who reproduce the value with a profit he can in this case both restore the capital and pay the interest without alienating or encroaching upon any other source of revenue if he uses it as a stock reserved for immediate consumption he acts the part of a prodigal and dissipates in the maintenance of the idle what was destined for the support of the industrious he can in this case neither restore the capital nor pay the interest without either alienating or encroaching upon some other source of revenue such as the property or the rent of land  the stock which is lent at interest is no doubt occasionally employed in both these ways but in the former much more frequently than in the latter the man who borrows in order to spend will soon be ruined and he who lends to him will generally have occasion to repent of his folly to borrow or to lend for such a purpose therefore is in all cases where gross usury is out of the question contrary to the interest of both parties and though it no doubt happens sometimes that people do both the one and the other yet from the regard that all men have for their own interest we may be assured that it cannot happen so very frequently as we are sometimes apt to imagine ask any rich man of common prudence to which of the two sorts of people he has lent the greater part of his stock to those who he thinks will employ it profitably or to those who will spend it idly and he will laugh at you for proposing the question even among borrowers therefore not the people in the world most famous for frugality the number of the frugal and industrious surpasses considerably that of the prodigal and idle  the only people to whom stock is commonly lent without their being expected to make any very profitable use of it are country gentlemen who borrow upon mortgage even they scarce ever borrow merely to spend what they borrow one may say is commonly spent before they borrow it they have generally consumed so great a quantity of goods advanced to them upon credit by shopkeepers and tradesmen that they find it necessary to borrow at interest in order to pay the debt the capital borrowed replaces the capitals of those shopkeepers and tradesmen which the country gentlemen could not have replaced from the rents of their estates it is not properly borrowed in order to be spent but in order to replace a capital which had been spent before  almost all loans at interest are made in money either of paper or of gold and silver but what the borrower really wants and what the lender really supplies him with is not the money but the moneys worth or the goods which it can purchase if he wants it as a stock for immediate consumption it is those goods only which he can place in that stock if he wants it as a capital for employing industry it is from those goods only that the industrious can be furnished with the tools materials and maintenance necessary for carrying on their work by means of the loan the lender as it were assigns to the borrower his right to a certain portion of the annual produce of the land and labor of the country to be employed as the borrower pleases  the quantity of stock therefore or as it is commonly expressed of money which can be lent at interest in any country is not regulated by the value of the money whether paper or coin which serves as the instrument of the different loans made in that country but by the value of that part of the annual produce which as soon as it comes either from the ground or from the hands of the productive laborers is destined not only for replacing a capital but such a capital as the owner does not care to be at the trouble of employing himself as such capitals are commonly lent out and paid back in money they constitute what is called the monied interest it is distinct not only from the landed but from the trading and manufacturing interests as in these last the owners themselves employ their own capitals even in the monied interest however the money is as it were but the deed of assignment which conveys from one hand to another those capitals which the owners do not care to employ themselves those capitals may be greater in almost any proportion than the amount of the money which serves as the instrument of their conveyance the same pieces of money successively serving for many different loans as well as for many different purchases a for example lends to w a thousand pounds with which w immediately purchases of b a thousand pounds worth of goods b having no occasion for the money himself lends the identical pieces to x with which x immediately purchases of c another thousand pounds worth of goods c in the same manner and for the same reason lends them to y who again purchases goods with them of d in this manner the same pieces either of coin or of paper may in the course of a few days serve as the instrument of three different loans and of three different purchases each of which is in value equal to the whole amount of those pieces what the three monied men a b and c assign to the three borrowers w x y is the power of making those purchases in this power consist both the value and the use of the loans the stock lent by the three monied men is equal to the value of the goods which can be purchased with it and is three times greater than that of the money with which the purchases are made those loans however may be all perfectly well secured the goods purchased by the different debtors being so employed as in due time to bring back with a profit an equal value either of coin or of paper and as the same pieces of money can thus serve as the instrument of different loans to three or for the same reason to thirty times their value so they may likewise successively serve as the instrument of repayment  a capital lent at interest may in this manner be considered as an assignment from the lender to the borrower of a certain considerable portion of the annual produce upon condition that the borrower in return shall during the continuance of the loan annually assign to the lender a smaller portion called the interest and at the end of it a portion equally considerable with that which had originally been assigned to him called the repayment though money either coin or paper serves generally as the deed of assignment both to the smaller and to the more considerable portion it is itself altogether different from what is assigned by it  in proportion as that share of the annual produce which as soon as it comes either from the ground or from the hands of the productive laborers is destined for replacing a capital increases in any country what is called the monied interest naturally increases with it the increase of those particular capitals from which the owners wish to derive a revenue without being at the trouble of employing them themselves naturally accompanies the general increase of capitals or in other words as stock increases the quantity of stock to be lent at interest grows gradually greater and greater  as the quantity of stock to be lent at interest increases the interest or the price which must be paid for the use of that stock necessarily diminishes not only from those general causes which make the market price of things commonly diminish as their quantity increases but from other causes which are peculiar to this particular case as capitals increase in any country the profits which can be made by employing them necessarily diminish it becomes gradually more and more difficult to find within the country a profitable method of employing any new capital there arises in consequence a competition between different capitals the owner of one endeavoring to get possession of that employment which is occupied by another but upon most occasions he can hope to justle that other out of this employment by no other means but by dealing upon more reasonable terms he must not only sell what he deals in somewhat cheaper but in order to get it to sell he must sometimes too buy it dearer the demand for productive labor by the increase of the funds which are destined for maintaining it grows every day greater and greater laborers easily find employment but the owners of capitals find it difficult to get laborers to employ their competition raises the wages of labor and sinks the profits of stock but when the profits which can be made by the use of a capital are in this manner diminished as it were at both ends the price which can be paid for the use of it that is the rate of interest must necessarily be diminished with them  mr lock mr law and mr montesquiou as well as many other writers seem to have imagined that the increase of the quantity of gold and silver in consequence of the discovery of the spanish west indies was the real cause of the lowering of the rate of interest through the greater part of europe those metals they say having become of less value themselves the use of any particular portion of them necessarily became of less value too and consequently the price which could be paid for it this notion which at first sight seems so plausible has been so fully exposed by mr hume that it is perhaps unnecessary to say any thing more about it the following very short and plain argument however may serve to explain more distinctly the fallacy which seems to have misled those gentlemen  before the discovery of the spanish west indies ten per cent seems to have been the common rate of interest through the greater part of europe it has since that time in different countries sunk to six five four and three per cent let us suppose that in every particular country the value of silver has sunk precisely in the same proportion as the rate of interest and that in those countries for example where interest has been reduced from ten to five per cent the same quantity of silver can now purchase just half the quantity of goods which it could have purchased before this supposition will not i believe be found any where agreeable to the truth but it is the most favorable to the opinion which we are going to examine and even upon this supposition it is utterly impossible that the lowering of the value of silver could have the smallest tendency to lower the rate of interest if a hundred pounds are in those countries now of no more value than fifty pounds were then ten pounds must now be of no more value than five pounds were then whatever were the causes which lowered the value of the capital the same must necessarily have lowered that of the interest and exactly in the same proportion the proportion between the value of the capital and that of the interest must have remained the same though the rate had never been altered by altering the rate on the contrary the proportion between those two values is necessarily altered if a hundred pounds now are worth no more than fifty were then five pounds now can be worth no more than two pounds ten shillings were then by reducing the rate of interest therefore from ten to five per cent we give for the use of a capital which is supposed to be equal to onehalf of its former value an interest which is equal to onefourth only of the value of the former interest  any increase in the quantity of silver while that of the commodities circulated by means of it remained the same could have no other effect than to diminish the value of that metal the nominal value of all sorts of goods would be greater but their real value would be precisely the same as before they would be exchanged for a greater number of pieces of silver but the quantity of labor which they could command the number of people whom they could maintain and employ would be precisely the same the capital of the country would be the same though a greater number of pieces might be requisite for conveying any equal portion of it from one hand to another the deeds of assignment like the conveyances of a verbose attorney would be more cumbersome but the thing assigned would be precisely the same as before and could produce only the same effects the funds for maintaining productive labor being the same the demand for it would be the same its price or wages therefore though nominally greater would really be the same they would be paid in a greater number of pieces of silver but they would purchase only the same quantity of goods the profits of stock would be the same both nominally and really the wages of labor are commonly computed by the quantity of silver which is paid to the labourer when that is increased therefore his wages appear to be increased though they may sometimes be no greater than before but the profits of stock are not computed by the number of pieces of silver with which they are paid but by the proportion which those pieces bear to the whole capital employed thus in a particular country five shillings a week are said to be the common wages of labor and ten per cent the common profits of stock but the whole capital of the country being the same as before the competition between the different capitals of individuals into which it was divided would likewise be the same they would all trade with the same advantages and disadvantages the common proportion between capital and profit therefore would be the same and consequently the common interest of money what can commonly be given for the use of money being necessarily regulated by what can commonly be made by the use of it  any increase in the quantity of commodities annually circulated within the country while that of the money which circulated them remained the same would on the contrary produce many other important effects besides that of raising the value of the money the capital of the country though it might nominally be the same would really be augmented it might continue to be expressed by the same quantity of money but it would command a greater quantity of labor the quantity of productive labor which it could maintain and employ would be increased and consequently the demand for that labor its wages would naturally rise with the demand and yet might appear to sink they might be paid with a smaller quantity of money but that smaller quantity might purchase a greater quantity of goods than a greater had done before the profits of stock would be diminished both really and in appearance the whole capital of the country being augmented the competition between the different capitals of which it was composed would naturally be augmented along with it the owners of those particular capitals would be obliged to content themselves with a smaller proportion of the produce of that labor which their respective capitals employed the interest of money keeping pace always with the profits of stock might in this manner be greatly diminished though the value of money or the quantity of goods which any particular sum could purchase was greatly augmented  in some countries the interest of money has been prohibited by law but as something can every where be made by the use of money something ought every where to be paid for the use of it this regulation instead of preventing has been found from experience to increase the evil of usury the debtor being obliged to pay not only for the use of the money but for the risk which his creditor runs by accepting a compensation for that use he is obliged if one may say so to insure his creditor from the penalties of usury  in countries where interest is permitted the law in order to prevent the extortion of usury generally fixes the highest rate which can be taken without incurring a penalty this rate ought always to be somewhat above the lowest market price or the price which is commonly paid for the use of money by those who can give the most undoubted security if this legal rate should be fixed below the lowest market rate the effects of this fixation must be nearly the same as those of a total prohibition of interest the creditor will not lend his money for less than the use of it is worth and the debtor must pay him for the risk which he runs by accepting the full value of that use if it is fixed precisely at the lowest market price it ruins with honest people who respect the laws of their country the credit of all those who cannot give the very best security and obliges them to have recourse to exorbitant usurers in a country such as great britain where money is lent to government at three per cent and to private people upon good security at four and four and a half the present legal rate five per cent is perhaps as proper as any  the legal rate it is to be observed though it ought to be somewhat above ought not to be much above the lowest market rate if the legal rate of interest in great britain for example was fixed so high as eight or ten per cent the greater part of the money which was to be lent would be lent to prodigals and projectors who alone would be willing to give this high interest sober people who will give for the use of money no more than a part of what they are likely to make by the use of it would not venture into the competition a great part of the capital of the country would thus be kept out of the hands which were most likely to make a profitable and advantageous use of it and thrown into those which were most likely to waste and destroy it where the legal rate of interest on the contrary is fixed but a very little above the lowest market rate sober people are universally preferred as borrowers to prodigals and projectors the person who lends money gets nearly as much interest from the former as he dares to take from the latter and his money is much safer in the hands of the one set of people than in those of the other a great part of the capital of the country is thus thrown into the hands in which it is most likely to be employed with advantage  no law can reduce the common rate of interest below the lowest ordinary market rate at the time when that law is made notwithstanding the edict of      by which the french king attempted to reduce the rate of interest from five to four per cent money continued to be lent in france at five per cent the law being evaded in several different ways  the ordinary market price of land it is to be observed depends every where upon the ordinary market rate of interest the person who has a capital from which he wishes to derive a revenue without taking the trouble to employ it himself deliberates whether he should buy land with it or lend it out at interest the superior security of land together with some other advantages which almost every where attend upon this species of property will generally dispose him to content himself with a smaller revenue from land than what he might have by lending out his money at interest these advantages are sufficient to compensate a certain difference of revenue but they will compensate a certain difference only and if the rent of land should fall short of the interest of money by a greater difference nobody would buy land which would soon reduce its ordinary price on the contrary if the advantages should much more than compensate the difference every body would buy land which again would soon raise its ordinary price when interest was at ten per cent land was commonly sold for ten and twelve years purchase as interest sunk to six five and four per cent the price of land rose to twenty five and twenty and thirty years purchase the market rate of interest is higher in france than in england and the common price of land is lower in england it commonly sells at thirty in france at twenty years purchase  chap v of the different employment of capitals though all capitals are destined for the maintenance of productive labor only yet the quantity of that labor which equal capitals are capable of putting into motion varies extremely according to the diversity of their employment as does likewise the value which that employment adds to the annual produce of the land and labor of the country  a capital may be employed in four different ways either first in procuring the rude produce annually required for the use and consumption of the society or secondly in manufacturing and preparing that rude produce for immediate use and consumption or thirdly in transporting either the rude or manufactured produce from the places where they abound to those where they are wanted or lastly in dividing particular portions of either into such small parcels as suit the occasional demands of those who want them in the first way are employed the capitals of all those who undertake the improvement or cultivation of lands mines or fisheries in the second those of all master manufacturers in the third those of all wholesale merchants and in the fourth those of all retailers it is difficult to conceive that a capital should be employed in any way which may not be classed under some one or other of those four  each of those four methods of employing a capital is essentially necessary either to the existence or extension of the other three or to the general convenience of the society  unless a capital was employed in furnishing rude produce to a certain degree of abundance neither manufactures nor trade of any kind could exist  unless a capital was employed in manufacturing that part of the rude produce which requires a good deal of preparation before it can be fit for use and consumption it either would never be produced because there could be no demand for it or if it was produced spontaneously it would be of no value in exchange and could add nothing to the wealth of the society  unless a capital was employed in transporting either the rude or manufactured produce from the places where it abounds to those where it is wanted no more of either could be produced than was necessary for the consumption of the neighborhood the capital of the merchant exchanges the surplus produce of one place for that of another and thus encourages the industry and increases the enjoyments of both  unless a capital was employed in breaking and dividing certain portions either of the rude or manufactured produce into such small parcels as suit the occasional demands of those who want them every man would be obliged to purchase a greater quantity of the goods he wanted than his immediate occasions required if there was no such trade as a butcher for example every man would be obliged to purchase a whole ox or a whole sheep at a time this would generally be inconvenient to the rich and much more so to the poor if a poor workman was obliged to purchase a months or six months provisions at a time a great part of the stock which he employs as a capital in the instruments of his trade or in the furniture of his shop and which yields him a revenue he would be forced to place in that part of his stock which is reserved for immediate consumption and which yields him no revenue nothing can be more convenient for such a person than to be able to purchase his subsistence from day to day or even from hour to hour as he wants it he is thereby enabled to employ almost his whole stock as a capital he is thus enabled to furnish work to a greater value and the profit which he makes by it in this way much more than compensates the additional price which the profit of the retailer imposes upon the goods the prejudices of some political writers against shopkeepers and tradesmen are altogether without foundation so far is it from being necessary either to tax them or to restrict their numbers that they can never be multiplied so as to hurt the public though they may so as to hurt one another the quantity of grocery goods for example which can be sold in a particular town is limited by the demand of that town and neighborhood the capital therefore which can be employed in the grocery trade cannot exceed what is sufficient to purchase that quantity if this capital is divided between two different grocers their competition will tend to make both of them sell cheaper than if it were in the hands of one only and if it were divided among twenty their competition would be just so much the greater and the chance of their combining together in order to raise the price just so much the less their competition might perhaps ruin some of themselves but to take care of this is the business of the parties concerned and it may safely be trusted to their discretion it can never hurt either the consumer or the producer on the contrary it must tend to make the retailers both sell cheaper and buy dearer than if the whole trade was monopolized by one or two persons some of them perhaps may sometimes decoy a weak customer to buy what he has no occasion for this evil however is of too little importance to deserve the public attention nor would it necessarily be prevented by restricting their numbers it is not the multitude of alehouses to give the most suspicious example that occasions a general disposition to drunkenness among the common people but that disposition arising from other causes necessarily gives employment to a multitude of alehouses  the persons whose capitals are employed in any of those four ways are themselves productive laborers their labor when properly directed fixes and realizes itself in the subject or vendible commodity upon which it is bestowed and generally adds to its price the value at least of their own maintenance and consumption the profits of the farmer of the manufacturer of the merchant and retailer are all drawn from the price of the goods which the two first produce and the two last buy and sell equal capitals however employed in each of those four different ways will put into motion very different quantities of productive labor and augment too in very different proportions the value of the annual produce of the land and labor of the society to which they belong  the capital of the retailer replaces together with its profits that of the merchant of whom he purchases goods and thereby enables him to continue his business the retailer himself is the only productive labourer whom it employs in his profits consists the whole value which its employment adds to the annual produce of the land and labor of the society  the capital of the wholesale merchant replaces together with their profits the capitals of the farmers and manufacturers of whom he purchases the rude and manufactured produce which he deals in and thereby enables them to continue their respective trades it is by this service chiefly that he contributes indirectly to support the productive labor of the society and to increase the value of its annual produce his capital employs too the sailors and carriers who transport his goods from one place to another and it augments the price of those goods by the value not only of his profits but of their wages this is all the productive labor which it immediately puts into motion and all the value which it immediately adds to the annual produce its operation in both these respects is a good deal superior to that of the capital of the retailer  part of the capital of the master manufacturer is employed as a fixed capital in the instruments of his trade and replaces together with its profits that of some other artificer of whom he purchases them part of his circulating capital is employed in purchasing materials and replaces with their profits the capitals of the farmers and miners of whom he purchases them but a great part of it is always either annually or in a much shorter period distributed among the different workmen whom he employs it augments the value of those materials by their wages and by their masters profits upon the whole stock of wages materials and instruments of trade employed in the business it puts into motion therefore a much greater quantity of productive labor and adds a much greater value to the annual produce of the land and labor of the society than an equal capital in the hands of any wholesale merchant  no equal capital puts into motion a greater quantity of productive labor than that of the farmer not only his laboring servants but his laboring cattle are productive laborers in agriculture too nature labors along with man and though her labor costs no expense its produce has its value as well as that of the most expensive workmen the most important operations of agriculture seem intended not so much to increase though they do that too as to direct the fertility of nature toward the production of the plants most profitable to man a field overgrown with briars and brambles may frequently produce as great a quantity of vegetables as the best cultivated vineyard or corn field planting and tillage frequently regulate more than they animate the active fertility of nature and after all their labor a great part of the work always remains to be done by her the laborers and laboring cattle therefore employed in agriculture not only occasion like the workmen in manufacturers the reproduction of a value equal to their own consumption or to the capital which employs them together with its owners profits but of a much greater value over and above the capital of the farmer and all its profits they regularly occasion the reproduction of the rent of the landlord this rent may be considered as the produce of those powers of nature the use of which the landlord lends to the farmer it is greater or smaller according to the supposed extent of those powers or in other words according to the supposed natural or improved fertility of the land it is the work of nature which remains after deducting or compensating every thing which can be regarded as the work of man it is seldom less than a fourth and frequently more than a third of the whole produce no equal quantity of productive labor employed in manufactures can ever occasion so great a reproduction in them nature does nothing man does all and the reproduction must always be in proportion to the strength of the agents that occasion it the capital employed in agriculture therefore not only puts into motion a greater quantity of productive labor than any equal capital employed in manufactures but in proportion too to the quantity of productive labor which it employs it adds a much greater value to the annual produce of the land and labor of the country to the real wealth and revenue of its inhabitants of all the ways in which a capital can be employed it is by far the most advantageous to the society  the capitals employed in the agriculture and in the retail trade of any society must always reside within that society their employment is confined almost to a precise spot to the farm and to the shop of the retailer they must generally too though there are some exceptions to this belong to resident members of the society  the capital of a wholesale merchant on the contrary seems to have no fixed or necessary residence anywhere but may wander about from place to place according as it can either buy cheap or sell dear  the capital of the manufacturer must no doubt reside where the manufacture is carried on but where this shall be is not always necessarily determined it may frequently be at a great distance both from the place where the materials grow and from that where the complete manufacture is consumed lions is very distant both from the places which afford the materials of its manufactures and from those which consume them the people of fashion in sicily are clothed in silks made in other countries from the materials which their own produces part of the wool of spain is manufactured in great britain and some part of that cloth is afterward sent back to spain  whether the merchant whose capital exports the surplus produce of any society be a native or a foreigner is of very little importance if he is a foreigner the number of their productive laborers is necessarily less than if he had been a native by one man only and the value of their annual produce by the profits of that one man the sailors or carriers whom he employs may still belong indifferently either to his country or to their country or to some third country in the same manner as if he had been a native the capital of a foreigner gives a value to their surplus produce equally with that of a native by exchanging it for something for which there is a demand at home it as effectually replaces the capital of the person who produces that surplus and as effectually enables him to continue his business the service by which the capital of a wholesale merchant chiefly contributes to support the productive labor and to augment the value of the annual produce of the society to which he belongs  it is of more consequence that the capital of the manufacturer should reside within the country it necessarily puts into motion a greater quantity of productive labor and adds a greater value to the annual produce of the land and labor of the society it may however be very useful to the country though it should not reside within it the capitals of the british manufacturers who work up the flax and hemp annually imported from the coasts of the baltic are surely very useful to the countries which produce them those materials are a part of the surplus produce of those countries which unless it was annually exchanged for something which is in demand there would be of no value and would soon cease to be produced the merchants who export it replace the capitals of the people who produce it and thereby encourage them to continue the production and the british manufacturers replace the capitals of those merchants  a particular country in the same manner as a particular person may frequently not have capital sufficient both to improve and cultivate all its lands to manufacture and prepare their whole rude produce for immediate use and consumption and to transport the surplus part either of the rude or manufactured produce to those distant markets where it can be exchanged for something for which there is a demand at home the inhabitants of many different parts of great britain have not capital sufficient to improve and cultivate all their lands the wool of the southern counties of scotland is a great part of it after a long land carriage through very bad roads manufactured in yorkshire for want of a capital to manufacture it at home there are many little manufacturing towns in great britain of which the inhabitants have not capital sufficient to transport the produce of their own industry to those distant markets where there is demand and consumption for it if there are any merchants among them they are properly only the agents of wealthier merchants who reside in some of the greater commercial cities  when the capital of any country is not sufficient for all those three purposes in proportion as a greater share of it is employed in agriculture the greater will be the quantity of productive labor which it puts into motion within the country as will likewise be the value which its employment adds to the annual produce of the land and labor of the society after agriculture the capital employed in manufactures put into motion the greatest quantity of productive labor and adds the greatest value to the annual produce that which is employed in the trade of exportation has the least effect of any of the three  the country indeed which has not capital sufficient for all those three purposes has not arrived at that degree of opulence for which it seems naturally destined to attempt however prematurely and with an insufficient capital to do all the three is certainly not the shortest way for a society no more than it would be for an individual to acquire a sufficient one the capital of all the individuals of a nation has its limits in the same manner as that of a single individual and is capable of executing only certain purposes the capital of all the individuals of a nation is increased in the same manner as that of a single individual by their continually accumulating and adding to it whatever they save out of their revenue it is likely to increase the fastest therefore when it is employed in the way that affords the greatest revenue to all the inhabitants of the country as they will thus be enabled to make the greatest savings but the revenue of all the inhabitants of the country is necessarily in proportion to the value of the annual produce of their land and labor  it has been the principal cause of the rapid progress of our american colonies toward wealth and greatness that almost their whole capitals have hitherto been employed in agriculture they have no manufactures those household and coarser manufactures excepted which necessarily accompany the progress of agriculture and which are the work of the women and children in every private family the greater part both of the exportation and coasting trade of america is carried on by the capitals of merchants who reside in great britain even the stores and warehouses from which goods are retailed in some provinces particularly in virginia and maryland belong many of them to merchants who reside in the mother country and afford one of the few instances of the retail trade of a society being carried on by the capitals of those who are not resident members of it were the americans either by combination or by any other sort of violence to stop the importation of european manufactures and by thus giving a monopoly to such of their own countrymen as could manufacture the like goods divert any considerable part of their capital into this employment they would retard instead of accelerating the further increase in the value of their annual produce and would obstruct instead of promoting the progress of their country toward real wealth and greatness this would be still more the case were they to attempt in the same manner to monopolize to themselves their whole exportation trade  the course of human prosperity indeed seems searce ever to have been of so long continuance as to enable any great country to acquire capital sufficient for all those three purposes unless perhaps we give credit to the wonderful accounts of the wealth and cultivation of china of those of ancient egypt and of the ancient state of indostan even those three countries the wealthiest according to all accounts that ever were in the world are chiefly renowned for their superiority in agriculture and manufactures they do not appear to have been eminent for foreign trade the ancient egyptians had a superstitious antipathy to the sea a superstition nearly of the same kind prevails among the indians and the chinese have never excelled in foreign commerce the greater part of the surplus produce of all those three countries seems to have been always exported by foreigners who gave in exchange for it something else for which they found a demand there frequently gold and silver  it is thus that the same capital will in any country put into motion a greater or smaller quantity of productive labor and add a greater or smaller value to the annual produce of its land and labor according to the different proportions in which it is employed in agriculture manufactures and wholesale trade the difference too is very great according to the different sorts of wholesale trade in which any part of it is employed  all wholesale trade all buying in order to sell again by wholesale may be reduced to three different sorts the home trade the foreign trade of consumption and the carrying trade the home trade is employed in purchasing in one part of the same country and selling in another the produce of the industry of that country it comprehends both the inland and the coasting trade the foreign trade of consumption is employed in purchasing foreign goods for home consumption the carrying trade is employed in transacting the commerce of foreign countries or in carrying the surplus produce of one to another  the capital which is employed in purchasing in one part of the country in order to sell in another the produce of the industry of that country generally replaces by every such operation two distinct capitals that had both been employed in the agriculture or manufactures of that country and thereby enables them to continue that employment when it sends out from the residence of the merchant a certain value of commodities it generally brings back in return at least an equal value of other commodities when both are the produce of domestic industry it necessarily replaces by every such operation two distinct capitals which had both been employed in supporting productive labor and thereby enables them to continue that support the capital which sends scotch manufactures to london and brings back english corn and manufactures to edinburgh necessarily replaces by every such operation two british capitals which had both been employed in the agriculture or manufactures of great britain  the capital employed in purchasing foreign goods for homeconsumption when this purchase is made with the produce of domestic industry replaces too by every such operation two distinct capitals but one of them only is employed in supporting domestic industry the capital which sends british goods to portugal and brings back portuguese goods to great britain replaces by every such operation only one british capital the other is a portuguese one though the returns therefore of the foreign trade of consumption should be as quick as those of the hometrade the capital employed in it will give but onehalf the encouragement to the industry or productive labor of the country  but the returns of the foreign trade of consumption are very seldom so quick as those of the hometrade the returns of the hometrade generally come in before the end of the year and sometimes three or four times in the year the returns of the foreign trade of consumption seldom come in before the end of the year and sometimes not till after two or three years a capital therefore employed in the hometrade will sometimes make twelve operations or be sent out and returned twelve times before a capital employed in the foreign trade of consumption has made one if the capitals are equal therefore the one will give four and twenty times more encouragement and support to the industry of the country than the other  the foreign goods for homeconsumption may sometimes be purchased not with the produce of domestic industry but with some other foreign goods these last however must have been purchased either immediately with the produce of domestic industry or with something else that had been purchased with it for the case of war and conquest excepted foreign goods can never be acquired but in exchange for something that had been produced at home either immediately or after two or more different exchanges the effects therefore of a capital employed in such a round about foreign trade of consumption are in every respect the same as those of one employed in the most direct trade of the same kind except that the final returns are likely to be still more distant as they must depend upon the returns of two or three distinct foreign trades if the flax and hemp of riga are purchased with the tobacco of virginia which had been purchased with british manufactures the merchant must wait for the returns of two distinct foreign trades before he can employ the same capital in repurchasing a like quantity of british manufactures if the tobacco of virginia had been purchased not with british manufactures but with the sugar and rum of jamaica which had been purchased with those manufactures he must wait for the returns of three if those two or three distinct foreign trades should happen to be carried on by two or three distinct merchants of whom the second buys the goods imported by the first and the third buys those imported by the second in order to export them again each merchant indeed will in this case receive the returns of his own capital more quickly but the final returns of the whole capital employed in the trade will be just as slow as ever whether the whole capital employed in such a round about trade belong to one merchant or to three can make no difference with regard to the country though it may with regard to the particular merchants three times a greater capital must in both cases be employed in order to exchange a certain value of british manufactures for a certain quantity of flax and hemp than would have been necessary had the manufactures and the flax and hemp been directly exchanged for one another the whole capital employed therefore in such a round about foreign trade of consumption will generally give less encouragement and support to the productive labor of the country than an equal capital employed in a more direct trade of the same kind  whatever be the foreign commodity with which the foreign goods for homeconsumption are purchased it can occasion no essential difference either in the nature of the trade or in the encouragement and support which it can give to the productive labor of the country from which it is carried on if they are purchased with the gold of brazil for example or with the silver of peru this gold and silver like the tobacco of virginia must have been purchased with something that either was the produce of the industry of the country or that had been purchased with something else that was so so far therefore as the productive labor of the country is concerned the foreign trade of consumption which is carried on by means of gold and silver has all the advantages and all the inconveniences of any other equally round about foreign trade of consumption and will replace just as fast or just as slow the capital which is immediately employed in supporting that productive labor it seems even to have one advantage over any other equally round about foreign trade the transportation of those metals from one place to another on account of their small bulk and great value is less expensive than that of almost any other foreign goods of equal value their freight is much less and their insurance not greater an equal quantity of foreign goods therefore may frequently be purchased with a smaller quantity of the produce of domestic industry by the intervention of gold and silver than by that of any other foreign goods the demand of the country may frequently in this manner be supplied more completely and at a smaller expense than in any other whether by the continual exportation of those metals a trade of this kind is likely to impoverish the country from which it is carried on in any other way i shall have occasion to examine at great length hereafter  that part of the capital of any country which is employed in the carrying trade is altogether withdrawn from supporting the productive labor of that particular country to support that of some foreign countries though it may replace by every operation two distinct capitals yet neither of them belong to that particular country the capital of the dutch merchant which carries the corn of poland to portugal and brings back the fruits and wines of portugal to poland replaces by every such operation two capitals neither of which had been employed in supporting the productive labor of holland but one of them in supporting that of poland and the other that of portugal the profits only return regularly to holland and constitute the whole addition which this trade necessarily makes to the annual produce of the land and labor of that country when indeed the carrying trade of any particular country is carried on with the ships and sailors of that country that part of the capital employed in it which pays the freight is distributed among and puts into motion a certain number of productive laborers of that country almost all nations that have had any considerable share of the carrying trade have in fact carried it on in this manner the trade itself has probably derived its name from it the people of such countries being the carriers to other countries it does not however seem essential to the nature of the trade that it should be so a dutch merchant may for example employ his capital in transacting the commerce of poland and portugal by carrying part of the surplus produce of the one to the other not in dutch but in british bottoms it may be presumed that he actually does so upon some particular occasions it is upon this account however that the carrying trade has been supposed peculiarly advantageous to such a country as great britain of which the defense and security depend upon the number of its sailors and shipping but the same capital may employ as many sailors and shipping either in the foreign trade of consumption or even in the hometrade when carried on by coasting vessels as it could in the carrying trade the number of sailors and shipping which any particular capital can employ does not depend upon the nature of the trade but partly upon the bulk of the goods in proportion to their value and partly upon the distance of the ports between which they are to be carried chiefly upon the former of those two circumstances the coaltrade from newcastle to london for example employs more shipping than all the carrying trade of england though the ports are at no great distance to force therefore by extraordinary encouragements a larger share of the capital of any country into the carrying trade than what would naturally go to it will not always necessarily increase the shipping of that country  the capital therefore employed in the hometrade of any country will generally give encouragement and support to a greater quantity of productive labor in that country and increase the value of its annual produce more than an equal capital employed in the foreign trade of consumption and the capital employed in this latter trade has in both these respects a still greater advantage over an equal capital employed in the carrying trade the riches and so far as power depends upon riches the power of every country must always be in proportion to the value of its annual produce the fund from which all taxes must ultimately be paid but the great object of the political economy of every country is to increase the riches and power of that country it ought therefore to give no preference nor superior encouragement to the foreign trade of consumption above the hometrade nor to the carrying trade above either of the other two it ought neither to force nor to allure into either of those two channels a greater share of the capital of the country than what would naturally flow into them of its own accord  each of those different branches of trade however is not only advantageous but necessary and unavoidable when the course of things without any constraint or violence naturally introduces it  when the produce of any particular branch of industry exceeds what the demand of the country requires the surplus must be sent abroad and exchanged for something for which there is a demand at home without such exportation a part of the productive labor of the country must cease and the value of its annual produce diminish the land and labor of great britain produce generally more corn woollens and hard ware than the demand of the homemarket requires the surplus part of them therefore must be sent abroad and exchanged for something for which there is a demand at home it is only by means of such exportation that this surplus can acquire a value sufficient to compensate the labor and expense of producing it the neighborhood of the seacoast and the banks of all navigable rivers are advantageous situations for industry only because they facilitate the exportation and exchange of such surplus produce for something else which is more in demand there  when the foreign goods which are thus purchased with the surplus produce of domestic industry exceed the demand of the homemarket the surplus part of them must be sent abroad again and exchanged for something more in demand at home about ninetysix thousand hogsheads of tobacco are annually purchased in virginia and maryland with a part of the surplus produce of british industry but the demand of great britain does not require perhaps more than fourteen thousand if the remaining eightytwo thousand therefore could not be sent abroad and exchanged for something more in demand at home the importation of them must cease immediately and with it the productive labor of all those inhabitants of great britain who are at present employed in preparing the goods with which these eightytwo thousand hogsheads are annually purchased those goods which are part of the produce of the land and labor of great britain having no market at home and being deprived of that which they had abroad must cease to be produced the most round about foreign trade of consumption therefore may upon some occasions be as necessary for supporting the productive labor of the country and the value of its annual produce as the most direct  when the capital stock of any country is increased to such a degree that it cannot be all employed in supplying the consumption and supporting the productive labor of that particular country the surplus part of it naturally disgorges itself into the carrying trade and is employed in performing the same offices to other countries the carrying trade is the natural effect and symptom of great national wealth but it does not seem to be the natural cause of it those statesmen who have been disposed to favor it with particular encouragements seem to have mistaken the effect and symptom for the cause holland in proportion to the extent of the land and the number of its inhabitants by far the richest country in europe has accordingly the greatest share of the carrying trade of europe england perhaps the second richest country of europe is likewise supposed to have a considerable share of it though what commonly passes for the carrying trade of england will frequently perhaps be found to be no more than a round about foreign trade of consumption such are in a great measure the trades which carry the goods of the east and west indies and of america to different european markets those goods are generally purchased either immediately with the produce of british industry or with something else which had been purchased with that produce and the final returns of those trades are generally used or consumed in great britain the trade which is carried on in british bottoms between the different ports of the mediterranean and some trade of the same kind carried on by british merchants between the different ports of india make perhaps the principal branches of what is properly the carrying trade of great britain  the extent of the hometrade and of the capital which can be employed in it is necessarily limited by the value of the surplus produce of all those distant places within the country which have occasion to exchange their respective productions with one another that of the foreign trade of consumption by the value of the surplus produce of the whole country and of what can be purchased with it that of the carrying trade by the value of the surplus produce of all the different countries in the world its possible extent therefore is in a manner infinite in comparison of that of the other two and is capable of absorbing the greatest capitals  the consideration of his own private profit is the sole motive which determines the owner of any capital to employ it either in agriculture in manufactures or in some particular branch of the wholesale or retail trade the different quantities of productive labor which it may put into motion and the different values which it may add to the annual produce of the land and labor of the society according as it is employed in one or other of those different ways never enter into his thoughts in countries therefore where agriculture is the most profitable of all employments and farming and improving the most direct roads to a splendid fortune the capitals of individuals will naturally be employed in the manner most advantageous to the whole society the profits of agriculture however seem to have no superiority over those of other employments in any part of europe projectors indeed in every corner of it have within these few years amused the public with most magnificent accounts of the profits to be made by the cultivation and improvement of land without entering into any particular discussion of their calculations a very simple observation may satisfy us that the result of them must be false we see every day the most splendid fortunes that have been acquired in the course of a single life by trade and manufactures frequently from a very small capital sometimes from no capital a single instance of such a fortune acquired by agriculture in the same time and from such a capital has not perhaps occurred in europe during the course of the present century in all the great countries of europe however much good land still remains uncultivated and the greater part of what is cultivated is far from being improved to the degree of which it is capable agriculture therefore is almost every where capable of absorbing a much greater capital than has ever yet been employed in it what circumstances in the policy of europe have given the trades which are carried on in towns so great an advantage over that which is carried on in the country that private persons frequently find it more for their advantage to employ their capitals in the most distant carrying trades of asia and america than in the improvement and cultivation of the most fertile fields in their own neighborhood i shall endeavor to explain at full length in the two following books  book iii of the different progress of opulence in different nations chap   of the natural progress of opulence the great commerce of every civilized society is that carried on between the inhabitants of the town and those of the country it consists in the exchange of rude for manufactured produce either immediately or by the intervention of money or of some sort of paper which represents money the country supplies the town with the means of subsistence and the materials of manufacture the town repays this supply by sending back a part of the manufactured produce to the inhabitants of the country the town in which there neither is nor can be any reproduction of substances may very properly be said to gain its whole wealth and subsistence from the country we must not however upon this account imagine that the gain of the town is the loss of the country the gains of both are mutual and reciprocal and the division of labor is in this as in all other cases advantageous to all the different persons employed in the various occupations into which it is subdivided the inhabitants of the country purchase of the town a greater quantity of manufactured goods with the produce of a much smaller quantity of their own labor than they must have employed had they attempted to prepare them themselves the town affords a market for the surplus produce of the country or what is over and above the maintenance of the cultivators and it is there that the inhabitants of the country exchange it for something else which is in demand among them the greater the number and revenue of the inhabitants of the town the more extensive is the market which it affords to those of the country and the more extensive that market it is always the more advantageous to a great number the corn which grows within a mile of the town sells there for the same price with that which comes from twenty miles distance but the price of the latter must generally not only pay the expense of raising and bringing it to market but afford too the ordinary profits of agriculture to the farmer the proprietors and cultivators of the country therefore which lies in the neighborhood of the town over and above the ordinary profits of agriculture gain in the price of what they sell the whole value of the carriage of the like produce that is brought from more distant parts and they save besides the whole value of this carriage in the price of what they buy compare the cultivation of the lands in the neighborhood of any considerable town with that of those which lie at some distance from it and you will easily satisfy yourself how much the country is benefited by the commerce of the town among all the absurd speculations that have been propagated concerning the balance of trade it has never been pretended that either the country loses by its commerce with the town or the town by that with the country which maintains it  as subsistence is in the nature of things prior to convenience and luxury so the industry which procures the former must necessarily be prior to that which ministers to the latter the cultivation and improvement of the country therefore which affords subsistence must necessarily be prior to the increase of the town which furnishes only the means of convenience and luxury it is the surplus produce of the country only or what is over and above the maintenance of the cultivators that constitutes the subsistence of the town which can therefore increase only with the increase of this surplus produce the town indeed may not always derive its whole subsistence from the country in its neighborhood or even from the territory to which it belongs but from very distant countries and this though it forms no exception from the general rule has occasioned considerable variations in the progress of opulence in different ages and nations  that order of things which necessity imposes in general though not in every particular country is in every particular country promoted by the natural inclinations of man if human institutions had never thwarted those natural inclinations the towns could no where have increased beyond what the improvement and cultivation of the territory in which they were situated could support till such time at least as the whole of that territory was completely cultivated and improved upon equal or nearly equal profits most men will choose to employ their capitals rather in the improvement and cultivation of land than either in manufactures or in foreign trade the man who employs his capital in land has it more under his view and command and his fortune is much less liable to accidents than that of the trader who is obliged frequently to commit it not only to the winds and the waves but to the more uncertain elements of human folly and injustice by giving great credits in distant countries to men with whose character and situation he can seldom be thoroughly acquainted the capital of the landlord on the contrary which is fixed in the improvement of his land seems to be as well secured as the nature of human affairs can admit of the beauty of the country besides the pleasures of a country life the tranquillity of mind which it promises and wherever the injustice of human laws does not disturb it the independency which it really affords have charms that more or less attract every body and as to cultivate the ground was the original destination of man so in every stage of his existence he seems to retain a predilection for this primitive employment  without the assistance of some artificers indeed the cultivation of land cannot be carried on but with great inconveniency and continual interruption smiths carpenters wheelwrights and ploughwrights masons and bricklayers tanners shoemakers and tailors are people whose service the farmer has frequent occasion for such artificers too stand occasionally in need of the assistance of one another and as their residence is not like that of the farmer necessarily tied down to a precise spot they naturally settle in the neighborhood of one another and thus form a small town or village the butcher the brewer and the baker soon join them together with many other artificers and retailers necessary or useful for supplying their occasional wants and who contribute still further to augment the town the inhabitants of the town and those of the country are mutually the servants of one another the town is a continual fair or market to which the inhabitants of the country resort in order to exchange their rude for manufactured produce it is this commerce which supplies the inhabitants of the town both with the materials of their work and the means of their subsistence the quantity of the finished work which they sell to the inhabitants of the country necessarily regulates the quantity of the materials and provisions which they buy neither their employment nor subsistence therefore can augment but in proportion to the augmentation of the demand from the country for finished work and this demand can augment only in proportion to the extension of improvement and cultivation had human institutions therefore never disturbed the natural course of things the progressive wealth and increase of the towns would in every political society be consequential and in proportion to the improvement and cultivation of the territory or country  in our north american colonies where uncultivated land is still to be had upon easy terms no manufactures for distant sale have ever yet been established in any of their towns when an artificer has acquired a little more stock than is necessary for carrying on his own business in supplying the neighboring country he does not in north america attempt to establish with it a manufacture for more distant sale but employs it in the purchase and improvement of uncultivated land from artificer he becomes planter and neither the large wages nor the easy subsistence which that country affords to artificers can bribe him rather to work for other people than for himself he feels that an artificer is the servant of his customers from whom he derives his subsistence but that a planter who cultivates his own land and derives his necessary subsistence from the labor of his own family is really a master and independent of all the world  in countries on the contrary where there is either no uncultivated land or none that can be had upon easy terms every artificer who has acquired more stock than he can employ in the occasional jobs of the neighborhood endeavors to prepare work for more distant sale the smith erects some sort of iron the weaver some sort of linen or woollen manufactory those different manufactures come in process of time to be gradually subdivided and thereby improved and refined in a great variety of ways which may easily be conceived and which it is therefore unnecessary to explain any further  in seeking for employment to a capital manufactures are upon equal or nearly equal profits naturally preferred to foreign commerce for the same reason that agriculture is naturally preferred to manufactures as the capital of the landlord or farmer is more secure than that of the manufacturer so the capital of the manufacturer being at all times more within his view and command is more secure than that of the foreign merchant in every period indeed of every society the surplus part both of the rude and manufactured produce or that for which there is no demand at home must be sent abroad in order to be exchanged for something for which there is some demand at home but whether the capital which carries this surplus produce abroad be a foreign or a domestic one is of very little importance if the society has not acquired sufficient capital both to cultivate all its lands and to manufacture in the compleatest manner the whole of their rude produce there is even a considerable advantage that it should be exported by a foreign capital in order that the whole stock of the society may be employed in more useful purposes the wealth of ancient egypt that of china and indostan sufficiently demonstrate that a nation may attain a very high degree of opulence though the greater part of its exportation trade be carried on by foreigners the progress of our north american and west indian colonies would have been much less rapid had no capital but what belonged to themselves been employed in exporting their surplus produce  according to the natural course of things therefore the greater part of the capital of every growing society is first directed to agriculture afterward to manufactures and last of all to foreign commerce this order of things is so very natural that in every society that had any territory it has always i believe been in some degree observed some of their lands must have been cultivated before any considerable towns could be established and some sort of coarse industry of the manufacturing kind must have been carried on in those towns before they could well think of employing themselves in foreign commerce  but though this natural order of things must have taken place in some degree in every such society it has in all the modern states of europe been in many respects entirely inverted the foreign commerce of some of their cities has introduced all their finer manufactures or such as were fit for distant sale and manufactures and foreign commerce together have given birth to the principal improvements of agriculture the manners and customs which the nature of their original government introduced and which remained after that government was greatly altered necessarily forced them into this unnatural and retrograde order  chap ii of the discouragement of agriculture in the ancient state of europe after the fall of the roman empire when the german and scythian nations overran the western provinces of the roman empire the confusions which followed so great a revolution lasted for several centuries the rapine and violence which the barbarians exercised against the ancient inhabitants interrupted the commerce between the towns and the country the towns were deserted and the country was left uncultivated and the western provinces of europe which had enjoyed a considerable degree of opulence under the roman empire sunk into the lowest state of poverty and barbarism during the continuance of those confusions the chiefs and principal leaders of those nations acquired or usurped to themselves the greater part of the lands of those countries a great part of them was uncultivated but no part of them whether cultivated or uncultivated was left without a proprietor all of them were engrossed and the greater part by a few great proprietors  this original engrossing of uncultivated lands though a great might have been but a transitory evil they might soon have been divided again and broke into small parcels either by succession or by alienation the law of primogeniture hindered them from being divided by succession the introduction of entails prevented their being broke into small parcels by alienation  when land like movables is considered as the means only of subsistence and enjoyment the natural law of succession divides it like them among all the children of the family of all of whom the subsistence and enjoyment may be supposed equally dear to the father this natural law of succession accordingly took place among the romans who made no more distinction between elder and younger between male and female in the inheritance of lands than we do in the distribution of movables but when land was considered as the means not of subsistence merely but of power and protection it was thought better that it should descend undivided to one in those disorderly times every great landlord was a sort of petty prince his tenants were his subjects he was their judge and in some respects their legislator in peace and their leader in war he made war according to his own discretion frequently against his neighbors and sometimes against his sovereign the security of a landed estate therefore the protection which its owner could afford to those who dwelt on it depended upon its greatness to divide it was to ruin it and to expose every part of it to be oppressed and swallowed up by the incursions of its neighbors the law of primogeniture therefore came to take place not immediately indeed but in process of time in the succession of landed estates for the same reason that it has generally taken place in that of monarchies though not always at their first institution that the power and consequently the security of the monarchy may not be weakened by division it must descend entire to one of the children to which of them so important a preference shall be given must be determined by some general rule founded not upon the doubtful distinctions of personal merit but upon some plain and evident difference which can admit of no dispute among the children of the same family there can be no indisputable difference but that of scx and that of age the male sex is universally preferred to the female and when all other things are equal the elder every where takes place of the younger hence the origin of the right of primogeniture and of what is called lineal succession  laws frequently continue in force long after the circumstances which first gave occasion to them and which could alone render them reasonable are no more in the present state of europe the proprietor of a single acre of land is as perfectly secure of his possession as the proprietor of a hundred thousand the right of primogeniture however still continues to be respected and as of all institutions it is the fittest to support the pride of family distinctions it is still likely to endure for many centuries in every other respect nothing can be more contrary to the real interest of a numerous family than a right which in order to enrich one beggars all the rest of the children  entails are the natural consequences of the law of primogeniture they were introduced to preserve a certain lineal succession of which the law of primogeniture first gave the idea and to hinder any part of the original estate from being carried out of the proposed line either by gift or devise or alienation either by the folly or by the misfortune of any of its successive owners they were altogether unknown to the romans neither their substitutions nor fideicommisses bear any resemblance to entails though some french lawyers have thought proper to dress the modern institution in the language and form of those ancient ones  when great landed estates were a sort of principalities entails might not be unreasonable like what are called the fundamental laws of some monarchies they might frequently hinder the security of thousands from being endangered by the caprice or extravagance of one man but in the present state of europe when small as well as great estates derive their security from the laws of their country nothing can be more completely absurd they are founded upon the most absurd of all suppositions the supposition that every successive generation of men have not an equal right to the earth and to all that it possesses but that the property of the present generation should be restrained and regulated according to the fancy of those who died perhaps five hundred years ago entails however are still respected through the greater part of europe in those countries particularly in which noble birth is a necessary qualification for the enjoyment either of civil or military honors entails are thought necessary for maintaining this exclusive privilege of the nobility to the great offices and honors of their country and that order having usurped one unjust advantage over the rest of their fellow citizens left their poverty should render it ridiculous it is thought reasonable that they should have another the common law of england indeed is said to abhor perpetuities and they are accordingly more restricted there than in any other european monarchy though even england is not altogether without them in scotland more than onefifth perhaps more than onethird part of the whole lands of the country are at present under strict entail  great tracts of uncultivated land were in this manner not only engrossed by particular families but the possibility of their being divided again was as much as possible precluded forever it seldom happens however that a great proprietor is a great improver in the disorderly times which gave birth to those barbarous institutions the great proprietor was sufficiently employed in defending his own territories or in extending his jurisdiction and authority over those of his neighbors he had no leisure to attend to the cultivation and improvement of land when the establishment of law and order afforded him this leisure he often wanted the inclination and almost always the requisite abilities if the expense of his house and person either equalled or exceeded his revenue as it did very frequently he had no stock to employ in this manner if he was an oeconomist he generally found it more profitable to employ his annual savings in new purchases than in the improvement of his old estate to improve land with profit like all other commercial projects requires an exact attention to small savings and small gains of which a man born to a great fortune even though naturally frugal is very seldom capable the situation of such a person naturally disposes him to attend rather to ornament which pleases his fancy than to profit for which he has so little occasion the elegance of his dress of his equipage of his house and household furniture are objects which from his infancy he has been accustomed to have some anxiety about the turn of mind which this habit naturally forms follows him when he comes to think of the improvement of land he embellishes perhaps four or five hundred acres in the neighborhood of his house at ten times the expense which the land is worth after all his improvements and finds that if he was to improve his whole estate in the same manner and he has little taste for any other he would be a bankrupt before he had finished the tenth part of it there still remain in both parts of the united kingdom some great estates which have continued without interruption in the hands of the same family since the times of feudal anarchy compare the present condition of those estates with the possessions of the small proprietors in their neighborhood and you will require no other argument to convince you how unfavourable such extensive property is to improvement  if little improvement was to be expected from such great proprietors still less was to be hoped for from those who occupied the land under them in the ancient state of europe the occupiers of land were all tenants at will they were all or almost all slaves but their slavery was of a milder kind than that known among the ancient greeks and romans or even in our west indian colonies they were supposed to belong more directly to the land than to their master they could therefore be sold with it but not separately they could marry provided it was with the consent of their master and he could not afterward dissolve the marriage by selling the man and wife to different persons if he maimed or murdered any of them he was liable to some penalty though generally but to a small one they were not however capable of acquiring property whatever they acquired was acquired to their master and he could take it from them at pleasure whatever cultivation and improvement could be carried on by means of such slaves was properly carried on by their master it was at his expense the seed the cattle and the instruments of husbandry were all his it was for his benefit such slaves could acquire nothing but their daily maintenance it was properly the proprietor himself therefore that in this case occupied his own lands and cultivated them by his own bondmen this species of slavery still subsists in russia poland hungary bohemia moravia and other parts of germany it is only in the western and southwestern provinces of europe that it has gradually been abolished altogether  but if great improvements are seldom to be expected from great proprietors they are least of all to be expected when they employ slaves for their workmen the experience of all ages and nations i believe demonstrates that the work done by slaves though it appears to cost only their maintenance is in the end the dearest of any a person who can acquire no property can have no other interest but to eat as much and to labor as little as possible whatever work he does beyond what is sufficient to purchase his own maintenance can be squeezed out of him by violence only and not by any interest of his own in ancient italy how much the cultivation of corn degenerated how unprofitable it became to the master when it fell under the management of slaves is remarked by both pliny and columella in the time of aristotle it had not been much better in ancient greece speaking of the ideal republic described in the laws of plato to maintain five thousand idle men the number of warriors supposed necessary for its defense together with their women and servants would require he says a territory of boundless extent and fertility like the plains of babylon  the pride of man makes him love to domineer and nothing mortifies him so much as to be obliged to condescend to persuade his inferiors wherever the law allows it and the nature of the work can afford it therefore he will generally prefer the service of slaves to that of freemen the planting of sugar and tobacco can afford the expense of slavecultivation the raising of corn it seems in the present times cannot in the english colonies of which the principal produce is corn the far greater part of the work is done by freemen the late resolution of the quakers in pensylvania to set at liberty all their negroe slaves may satisfy us that their number cannot be very great had they made any considerable part of their property such a resolution could never have been agreed to in our sugar colonies on the contrary the whole work is done by slaves and in our tobacco colonies a very great part of it the profits of a sugarplantation in any of our west indian colonies are generally much greater than those of any other cultivation that is known either in europe or america and the profits of a tobacco plantation though inferior to those of sugar are superior to those of corn as has already been observed both can afford the expense of slavecultivation but sugar can afford it still better than tobacco the number of negroes accordingly is much greater in proportion to that of whites in our sugar than in our tobacco colonies  to the slave cultivators of ancient times gradually succeeded a species of farmers known at present in france by the name of metayers they are called in latin coloni partiarii they have been so long in disuse in england that at present i know no english name for them the proprietor furnished them with the seed cattle and instruments of husbandry the whole stock in short necessary for cultivating the farm the produce was divided equally between the proprietor and the farmer after setting aside what was judged necessary for keeping up the stock which was restored to the proprietor when the farmer either quitted or was turned out of the farm  land occupied by such tenants is properly cultivated at the expense of the proprietor as much as that occupied by slaves there is however one very essential difference between them such tenants being freemen are capable of acquiring property and having a certain proportion of the produce of the land they have a plain interest that the whole produce should be as great as possible in order that their own proportion may be so a slave on the contrary who can acquire nothing but his maintenance consults his own ease by making the land produce as little as possible over and above that maintenance it is probable that it was partly upon account of this advantage and partly upon account of the encroachments which the sovereign always jealous of the great lords gradually encouraged their villains to make upon their authority and which seem at last to have been such as rendered this species of servitude altogether inconvenient that tenure in villanage gradually wore out through the greater part of europe the time and manner however in which so important a revolution was brought about is one of the most obscure points in modern history the church of rome claims great merit in it and it is certain that so early as the twelfth century alexander iii published a bull for the general emancipation of slaves it seems however to have been rather a pious exhortation than a law to which exact obedience was required from the faithful slavery continued to take place almost universally for several centuries afterward till it was gradually abolished by the joint operation of the two interests above mentioned that of the proprietor on the one hand and that of the sovereign on the other a villain enfranchised and at the same time allowed to continue in possession of the land having no stock of his own could cultivate it only by means of what the landlord advanced to him and must therefore have been what the french call a metayer  it could never however be the interest even of this last species of cultivators to lay out in the further improvement of the land any part of the little stock which they might save from their own share of the produce because the lord who laid out nothing was to get onehalf of whatever it produced the tithe which is but a tenth of the produce is found to be a very great hinderance to improvement a tax therefore which amounted to one half must have been an effectual bar to it it might be the interest of a metayer to make the land produce as much as could be brought out of it by means of the stock furnished by the proprietor but it could never be his interest to mix any part of his own with it in france where five parts out of six of the whole kingdom are said to be still occupied by this species of cultivators the proprietors complain that their metayers take every opportunity of employing the masters cattle rather in carriage than in cultivation because in the one case they get the whole profits to themselves in the other they share them with their landlord this species of tenants still subsists in some parts of scotland they are called steelbow tenants those ancient english tenants who are said by chief baron gilbert and doctor blackstone to have been rather bailiffs of the landlord than farmers properly so called were probably of the same kind  to this species of tenancy succeeded though by very slow degrees farmers properly so called who cultivated the land with their own stock paying a rent certain to the landlord when such farmers have a lease for a term of years they may sometimes find it for their interest to lay out part of their capital in the further improvement of the farm because they may sometimes expect to recover it with a large profit before the expiration of the lease the possession even of such farmers however was long extremely precarious and still is so in many parts of europe they could before the expiration of their term be legally outed of their lease by a new purchaser in england even by the fictitious action of a common recovery if they were turned out illegally by the violence of their master the action by which they obtained redress was extremely imperfect it did not always reinstate them in the possession of the land but gave them damages which never amounted to the real loss even in england the country perhaps of europe where the yeomanry has always been most respected it was not till about the   th of henry the viith that the action of ejectment was invented by which the tenant recovers not damages only but possession and in which his claim is not necessarily concluded by the uncertain decision of a single assize this action has been found so effectual a remedy that in the modern practice when the landlord has occasion to sue for the possession of the land he seldom makes use of the actions which properly belong to him as landlord the writ of right or the writ of entry but sues in the name of his tenant by the writ of ejectment in england therefore the security of the tenant is equal to that of the proprietor in england besides a lease for life of forty shillings a year value is a freehold and entitles the lessee to vote for a member of parliament and as a great part of the yeomanry have freeholds of this kind the whole order becomes respectable to their landlords on account of the political consideration which this gives them there is i believe nowhere in europe except in england any instance of the tenant building upon the land of which he had no lease and trusting that the honor of his landlord would take no advantage of so important an improvement those laws and customs so favorable to the yeomanry have perhaps contributed more to the present grandeur of england than all their boasted regulations of commerce taken together  the law which secures the longest leases against successors of every kind is so far as i know peculiar to great britain it was introduced into scotland so early as      by a law of james the iid its beneficial influence however has been much obstructed by entails the heirs of entail being generally restrained from letting leases for any long term of years frequently for more than one year a late act of parliament has in this respect somewhat flackened their setters though they are still by much too strait in scotland besides as no leasehold gives a vote for a member of parliament the yeomanry are upon this account less respectable to their landlords than in england  in other parts of europe after it was found convenient to secure tenants both against heirs and purchasers the term of their security was still limited to a very short period in france for example to nine years from the commencement of the lease it has in that country indeed been lately extended to twenty seven a period still too short to encourage the tenant to make the most important improvements the proprietors of land were anciently the legislators of every part of europe the laws relating to land therefore were all calculated for what they supposed the interest of the proprietor it was for his interest they had imagined that no lease granted by any of his predecessors should hinder him from enjoying during a long term of years the full value of his land avarice and injustice are always shortsighted and they did not foresee how much this regulation must obstruct improvement and thereby hurt in the long run the real interest of the landlord  the farmers too besides paying the rent were anciently it was supposed bound to perform a great number of services to the landlord which were seldom either specified in the lease or regulated by any precise rule but by the use and wont of the manor or barony these services therefore being almost entirely arbitrary subjected the tenant to many vexations in scotland the abolition of all services not precisely stipulated in the lease has in the course of a few years very much altered for the better the condition of the yeomanry of that country  the public services to which the yeomanry were bound were not less arbitrary than the private ones to make and maintain the high roads a servitude which still subsists i believe every where though with different degrees of oppression in different countries was not the only one when the kings troops when his household or his officers of any kind passed through any part of the country the yeomanry were bound to provide them with horses carriages and provisions at a price regulated by the purveyor great britain is i believe the only monarchy in europe where the oppression of purveyance has been entirely abolished it still subsists in france and germany  the public taxes to which they were subject were as irregular and oppressive as the services the ancient lords though extremely unwilling to grant themselves any pecuniary aid to their sovereign easily allowed him to tallage as they called it their tenants and had not knowledge enough to foresee how much this must in the end affect their own revenue the taille as it still subsists in france may serve as an example of those ancient tallages it is a tax upon the supposed profits of the farmer which they estimate by the stock that he has upon the farm it is his interest therefore to appear to have as little as possible and consequently to employ as little as possible in its cultivation and none in its improvement should any stock happen to accumulate in the hands of a french farmer the taille is almost equal to a prohibition of its ever being employed upon the land this tax besides is supposed to dishonor whoever is subject to it and to degrade him below not only the rank of a gentleman but that of a burgher and whoever rents the lands of another becomes subject to it no gentleman nor even any burgher that has stock will submit to this degradation this tax therefore not only hinders the stock which accumulates upon the land from being employed in its improvement but drives away all other stock from it the ancient tenths and fifteenths so usual in england in former times seem so far as they affected the land to have been taxes of the same nature with the taille  under all these discouragements little improvement could be expected from the occupiers of land that order of people with all the liberty and security which law can give must always improve under great disadvantages the farmer compared with the proprietor is as a merchant who trades with borrowed money compared with one who trades with his own the stock of both may improve but that of the one with only equal good conduct must always improve more slowly than that of the other on account of the large share of the profits which is consumed by the interest of the loan the lands cultivated by the farmer must in the same manner with only equal good conduct be improved more slowly than those cultivated by the proprietor on account of the large share of the produce which is consumed in the rent and which had the farmer been proprietor he might have employed in the further improvement of the land the station of a farmer besides is from the nature of things inferior to that of a proprietor through the greater part of europe the yeomanry are regarded as an inferior rank of people even to the better sort of tradesmen and mechanics and in all parts of europe to the great merchants and master manufacturers it can seldom happen therefore that a man of any considerable stock should quit the superior in order to place himself in an inferior station even in the present state of europe therefore little stock is likely to go from any other profession to the improvement of land in the way of farming more does perhaps in great britain than in any other country though even there the great stocks which are in some places employed in farming have generally been acquired by farming the trade perhaps in which of all others stock is commonly acquired most slowly after small proprietors however rich and great farmers are in every country the principal improvers there are more such perhaps in england than in any other european monarchy in the republican governments of holland and of berne in switzerland the farmers are said to be not inferior to those of england  the ancient policy of europe was over and above all this unfavourable to the improvement and cultivation of land whether carried on by the proprietor or by the farmer first by the general prohibition of the exportation of corn without a special license which seems to have been a very universal regulation and secondly by the restraints which were laid upon the inland commerce not only of corn but of almost every other part of the produce of the farm by the absurd laws against engrossers regrators and forestallers and by the privileges of fairs and markets it has already been observed in what manner the prohibition of the exportation of corn together with some encouragement given to the importation of foreign corn obstructed the cultivation of ancient italy naturally the most fertile country in europe and at that time the seat of the greatest empire in the world to what degree such restraints upon the inland commerce of this commodity joined to the general prohibition of exportation must have discouraged the cultivation of countries less fertile and less favorably circumstanced it is not perhaps very easy to imagine  chap iii of the rise and progress of cities and towns after the fall of the roman empire the inhabitants of cities and towns were after the fall of the roman empire not more favored than those of the country they consisted indeed of a very different order of people from the first inhabitants of the ancient republics of greece and italy these last were composed chiefly of the proprietors of lands among whom the public territory was originally divided and who found it convenient to build their houses in the neighborhood of one another and to surround them with a wall for the sake of common defense after the fall of the roman empire on the contrary the proprietors of lands seem generally to have lived in fortified castles on their own estates and in the midst of their own tenants and dependants the towns were chiefly inhabited by tradesmen and mechanics who seem in those days to have been of servile or very nearly of servile condition the privileges which we find granted by ancient charters to the inhabitants of some of the principal towns in europe sufficiently show what they were before those grants the people to whom it is granted as a privilege that they might give away their own daughters in marriage without the consent of their lord that upon their death their own children and not their lord should succeed to their goods and that they might dispose of their own effects by will must before those grants have been either altogether or very nearly in the same state of villanage with the occupiers of land in the country  they seem indeed to have been a very poor mean set of people who used to travel about with their goods from place to place and from fair to fair like the hawkers and pedlars of the present times in all the different countries of europe then in the same manner as in several of the tartar governments of asia at present taxes used to be levied upon the persons and goods of travelers when they passed through certain manors when they went over certain bridges when they carried about their goods from place to place in a fair when they erected in it a booth or stall to sell them in these different taxes were known in england by the names of passage pontage lastage and stallage sometimes the king sometimes a great lord who had it seems upon some occasions authority to do this would grant to particular traders to such particularly as lived in their own demesnes a general exemption from such taxes such traders though in other respects of servile or very nearly of servile condition were upon this account called freetraders they in return usually paid to their protector a sort of annual polltax in those days protection was seldom granted without a valuable consideration and this tax might perhaps be considered as compensation for what their patrons might lose by their exemption from other taxes at first both those polltaxes and those exemptions seem to have been altogether personal and to have affected only particular individuals during either their lives or the pleasure of their protectors in the very imperfect accounts which have been published from domesdaybook of several of the towns of england mention is frequently made sometimes of the tax which particular burghers paid each of them either to the king or to some other great lord for this sort of protection and sometimes of the general amount only of all those taxes  but how servile soever may have been originally the condition of the inhabitants of towns it appears evidently that they arrived at liberty and independency much earlier than the occupiers of land in the country that part of the kings revenue which arose from such polltaxes in any particular town used commonly to be let in farm during a term of years for a rent certain sometimes to the sheriff of the county and sometimes to other persons the burghers themselves frequently got credit enough to be admitted to farm the revenues of this sort which arose out of their own town they becoming jointly and severally answerable for the whole rent to let a farm in this manner was quite agreeable to the usual economy of i believe the sovereigns of all the different countries of europe who used frequently to let whole manors to all the tenants of those manors they becoming jointly and severally answerable for the whole rent but in return being allowed to collect it in their own way and to pay it into the kings exchequer by the hands of their own bailiff and being thus altogether freed from the insolence of the kings officers a circumstance in those days regarded as of the greatest importance  at first the farm of the town was probably let to the burghers in the same manner as it had been to other farmers for a term of years only in process of time however it seems to have become the general practice to grant it to them in fee that is forever reserving a rent certain never afterward to be augmented the payment having thus become perpetual the exemptions in return for which it was made naturally became perpetual too those exemptions therefore ceased to be personal and could not afterward be considered as belonging to individuals as individuals but as burghers of a particular burgh which upon this account was called a freeburgh for the same reason that they had been called freeburghers or freetraders  along with this grant the important privileges above mentioned that they might give away their own daughters in marriage that their children should succeed to them and that they might dispose of their own effects by will were generally bestowed upon the burghers of the town to whom it was given whether such privileges had before been usually granted along with the freedom of trade to particular burghers as individuals i know not i reckon it not improbable that they were though i cannot produce any direct evidence of it but however this may have been the principal attributes of villanage and slavery being thus taken away from them they now at least became really free in our present sense of the word freedom  nor was this all they were generally at the same time erected into a commonality or corporation with the privilege of having magistrates and a town council of their own of making bye laws for their own government of building walls for their own defense and of reducing all their inhabitants under a sort of military discipline by obliging them to watch and ward that is as anciently understood to guard and defend those walls against all attacks and surprises by night as well as by day in england they were generally exempted from suit to the hundred and county courts and all such pleas as should arise among them the pleas of the crown excepted were left to the decision of their own magistrates in other countries much greater and more extensive jurisdictions were frequently granted to them  it might probably be necessary to grant to such towns as were admitted to farm their own revenues some sort of compulsive jurisdiction to oblige their own citizens to make payment in those disorderly times it might have been extremely inconvenient to have left them to seek this sort of justice from any other tribunal but it must seem extraordinary that the sovereigns of all the different countries of europe should have exchanged in this manner for a rent certain never more to be augmented that branch of their revenue which was perhaps of all others the most likely to be improved by the natural course of things without either expense or attention of their own and that they should besides have in this manner voluntarily erected a sort of independent republics in the heart of their own dominions  in order to understand this it must be remembered that in those days the sovereign of perhaps no country in europe was able to protect through the whole extent of his dominions the weaker part of his subjects from the oppression of the great lords those whom the law could not protect and who were not strong enough to defend themselves were obliged either to have recourse to the protection of some great lord and in order to obtain it to become either his slaves or vassals or to enter into a league of mutual defense for the common protection of one another the inhabitants of cities and burghs considered as single individuals had no power to defend themselves but by entering into a league of mutual defense with their neighbors they were capable of making no contemptible resistance the lords despised the burghers whom they considered not only as of a different order but as a parcel of emancipated slaves almost of a different species from themselves the wealth of the burghers never failed to provoke their envy and indignation and they plundered them upon every occasion without mercy or remorse the burghers naturally hated and feared the lords the king hated and feared them too but though perhaps he might despise he had no reason either to hate or fear the burghers mutual interest therefore disposed them to support the king and the king to support them against the lords they were the enemies of his enemies and it was his interest to render them as secure and independent of those enemies as he could by granting them magistrates of their own the privilege of making byelaws for their own government that of building walls for their own defense and that of reducing all their inhabitants under a sort of military discipline he gave them all the means of security and independency of the barons which it was in his power to bestow without the establishment of some regular government of this kind without some authority to compel their inhabitants to act according to some certain plan or system no voluntary league of mutual defense could either have afforded them any permanent security or have enabled them to give the king any considerable support by granting them the farm of their town in fee he took away from those whom he wished to have for his friends and if one may say so for his allies all ground of jealousy and suspicion that he was ever afterward to oppress them either by raising the farm rent of their town or by granting it to some other farmer  the princes who lived upon the worst terms with their barons seem accordingly to have been the most liberal in grants of this kind to their burghs king john of england for example appears to have been a most munificent benefactor to his towns philip the first of france lost all authority over his barons toward the end of his reign his son lewis known afterward by the name of lewis the fat consulted according to father daniel with the bishops of the royal demesnes concerning the most proper means of restraining the violence of the great lords their advice consisted of two different proposals one was to erect a new order of jurisdiction by establishing magistrates and a town council in every considerable town of his demesnes the other was to form a new militia by making the inhabitants of those towns under the command of their own magistrates march out upon proper occasions to the assistance of the king it is from this period according to the french antiquarians that we are to date the institution of the magistrates and councils of cities in france it was during the unprosperous reigns of the princes of the house of suabia that the greater part of the free towns of germany received the first grants of their privileges and that the famous hanseatic league first became formidable  the militia of the cities seems in those times not to have been inferior to that of the country and as they could be more readily assembled upon any sudden occasion they frequently had the advantage in their disputes with the neighboring lords in countries such as italy and switzerland in which on account either of their distance from the principal seat of government of the natural strength of the country itself or of some other reason the sovereign came to lose the whole of his authority the cities generally became independent republics and conquered all the nobility in their neighborhood obliging them to pull down their castles in the country and to live like other peaceable inhabitants in the city this is the short history of the republic of berne as well as of several other cities in switzerland if you except venice for of that city the history is somewhat different it is the history of all the considerable italian republics of which so great a number arose and perished between the end of the twelfth and the beginning of the sixteenth century  in countries such as france or england where the authority of the sovereign though frequently very low never was destroyed altogether the cities had no opportunity of becoming entirely independent they became however so considerable that the sovereign could impose no tax upon them besides the stated farm rent of the town without their own consent they were therefore called upon to send deputies to the general assembly of the states of the kingdom where they might join with the clergy and the barons in granting upon urgent occasions some extraordinary aid to the king being generally too more favorable to his power their deputies seem sometimes to have been employed by him as a counterbalance to the authority of the great lords in those assemblies hence the origin of the representation of burghs in the states general of all the great monarchies in europe  order and good government and along with them the liberty and security of individuals were in this manner established in cities at a time when the occupiers of land in the country were exposed to every sort of violence but men in this defenseless state naturally content themselves with their necessary subsistence because to acquire more might only tempt the injustice of their oppressors on the contrary when they are secure of enjoying the fruits of their industry they naturally exert it to better their condition and to acquire not only the necessaries but the conveniences and elegancies of life that industry therefore which aims at something more than necessary subsistence was established in cities long before it was commonly practiced by the occupiers of land in the country if in the hands of a poor cultivator oppressed with the servitude of villanage some little stock should accumulate he would naturally conceal it with great care from his master to whom it would otherwise have belonged and take the first opportunity of running away to a town the law was at that time so indulgent to the inhabitants of towns and so desirous of diminishing the authority of the lords over those of the country that if he could conceal himself there from the pursuit of his lord for a year he was free for ever whatever stock therefore accumulated in the hands of the industrious part of the inhabitants of the country naturally took refuge in cities as the only sanctuaries in which it could be secure to the person that acquired it  the inhabitants of a city it is true must always ultimately derive their subsistence and the whole materials and means of their industry from the country but those of a city situated near either the seacoast or the banks of a navigable river are not necessarily confined to derive them from the country in their neighborhood they have a much wider range and may draw them from the most remote corners of the world either in exchange for the manufactured produce of their own industry or by performing the office of carriers between distant countries and exchanging the produce of one for that of another a city might in this manner grow up to great wealth and splendour while not only the country in its neighborhood but all those to which it traded were in poverty and wretchedness each of those countries perhaps taken singly could afford it but a small part either of its subsistence or of its employment but all of them taken together could afford it both a great subsistence and a great employment there were however within the narrow circle of the commerce of those times some countries that were opulent and industrious such was the greek empire as long as it subsisted and that of the saracens during the reigns of the abassides such too was egypt till it was conquered by the turks some part of the coast of barbary and all those provinces of spain which were under the government of the moors  the cities of italy seem to have been the first in europe which were raised by commerce to any considerable degree of opulence italy lay in the center of what was at that time the improved and civilized part of the world the cruzades too though by the great waste of stock and destruction of inhabitants which they occasioned they must necessarily have retarded the progress of the greater part of europe were extremely favorable to that of some italian cities the great armies which marched from all parts to the conquest of the holy land gave extraordinary encouragement to the shipping of venice genoa and pisa sometimes in transporting them thither and always in supplying them with provisions they were the commissaries if one may say so of those armies and the most destructive frenzy that ever befell the european nations was a source of opulence to those republics  the inhabitants of trading cities by importing the improved manufactures and expensive luxuries of richer countries afforded some food to the vanity of the great proprietors who eagerly purchased them with great quantities of the rude produce of their own lands the commerce of a great part of europe in those times accordingly consisted chiefly in the exchange of their own rude for the manufactured produce of more civilized nations thus the wool of england used to be exchanged for the wines of france and the fine cloths of flanders in the same manner as the corn of poland is at this day exchanged for the wines and brandies of france and for the silks and velvets of france and italy  a taste for the finer and more improved manufactures was in this manner introduced by foreign commerce into countries where no such works were carried on but when this taste became so general as to occasion a considerable demand the merchants in order to save the expense of carriage naturally endeavored to establish some manufactures of the same kind in their own country hence the origin of the first manufactures for distant sale that seem to have been established in the western provinces of europe after the fall of the roman empire  no large country it must be observed ever did or could subsist without some sort of manufactures being carried on in it and when it is said of any such country that it has no manufactures it must always be understood of the finer and more improved or of such as are fit for distant sale in every large country both the clothing and household furniture of the far greater part of the people are the produce of their own industry this is even more universally the case in those poor countries which are commonly said to have no manufactures than in those rich ones that are said to abound in them in the latter you will generally find both in the clothes and household furniture of the lowest rank of people a much greater proportion of foreign productions than in the former  those manufactures which are fit for distant sale seem to have been introduced into different countries in two different ways  sometimes they have been introduced in the manner above mentioned by the violent operation if one may say so of the stocks of particular merchants and undertakers who established them in imitation of some foreign manufactures of the same kind such manufactures therefore are the offspring of foreign commerce and such seem to have been the ancient manufactures of silks velvets and brocades that were introduced into venice in the beginning of the thirteenth century such too seem to have been the manufactures of fine cloths that anciently flourished in flanders and which were introduced into england in the beginning of the reign of elizabeth and such are the present silk manufactures of lions and spitalfields manufactures introduced in this manner are generally employed upon foreign materials being in imitations of foreign manufactures when the venetian manufacture flourished there was not a mulberry tree nor consequently a silkworm in all lombardy they brought the materials from sicily and from the levant the manufacture itself being in imitation of those carried on in the greek empire mulberry trees were first planted in lombardy in the beginning of the sixteenth century by the encouragement of ludovico sforza duke of milan the manufactures of flanders were carried on chiefly with spanish and english wool spanish wool was the material not of the first woollen manufacture of england but of the first that was fit for distant sale more than one half the materials of the lions manufacture is at this day foreign silk when it was first established the whole or very nearly the whole was so no part of the materials of the spitalfields manufacture is ever likely to be the produce of england the seat of such manufactures as they are generally introduced by the scheme and project of a few individuals is sometimes established in a maritime city and sometimes in an inland town according as their interest judgment or caprice happen to determine  at other times manufactures for distant sale grow up naturally and as it were of their own accord by the gradual refinement of those household and coarser manufactures which must at all times be carried on even in the poorest and rudest countries such manufactures are generally employed upon the materials which the country produces and they seem frequently to have been first refined and improved in such inland countries as were not indeed at a very great but at a considerable distance from the sea coast and sometimes even from all water carriage an inland country naturally fertile and easily cultivated produces a great surplus of provisions beyond what is necessary for maintaining the cultivators and on account of the expense of land carriage and inconveniency of river navigation it may frequently be difficult to send this surplus abroad abundance therefore renders provisions cheap and encourages a great number of workmen to settle in the neighborhood who find that their industry can there procure them more of the necessaries and conveniences of life than in other places they work up the materials of manufacture which the land produces and exchange their finished work or what is the same thing the price of it for more materials and provisions they give a new value to the surplus part of the rude produce by saving the expense of carrying it to the water side or to some distant market and they furnish the cultivators with something in exchange for it that is either useful or agreeable to them upon easier terms than they could have obtained it before the cultivators get a better price for their surplus produce and can purchase cheaper other conveniences which they have occasion for they are thus both encouraged and enabled to increase this surplus produce by a further improvement and better cultivation of the land and as the fertility of the land had given birth to the manufacture so the progress of the manufacture reacts upon the land and increases still further its fertility the manufacturers first supply the neighborhood and afterward as their work improves and refines more distant markets for though neither the rude produce nor even the coarse manufacture could without the greatest difficulty support the expense of a considerable land carriage the refined and improved manufacture easily may in a small bulk it frequently contains the price of a great quantity of rude produce a piece of fine cloth for example which weighs only eighty pounds contains in it the price not only of eighty pounds weight of wool but sometimes of several thousand weight of corn the maintenance of the different working people and of their immediate employers the corn which could with difficulty have been carried abroad in its own shape is in this manner virtually exported in that of the complete manufacture and may easily be sent to the remotest corners of the world in this manner have grown up naturally and as it were of their own accord the manufactures of leeds halifax sheffield birmingham and wolverhampton such manufactures are the offspring of agriculture in the modern history of europe their extension and improvement have generally been posterior to those which were the offspring of foreign commerce england was noted for the manufacture of fine cloths made of spanish wool more than a century before any of those which now flourish in the places above mentioned were fit for foreign sale the extension and improvement of these last could not take place but in consequence of the extension and improvement of agriculture the last and greatest effect of foreign commerce and of the manufactures immediately introduced by it and which i shall now proceed to explain  chap iv how the commerce of the towns contributed to the improvement of the country the increase and riches of commercial and manufacturing towns contributed to the improvement and cultivation of the countries to which they belonged in three different ways  first by affording a great and ready market for the rude produce of the country they gave encouragement to its cultivation and further improvement this benefit was not even confined to the countries in which they were situated but extended more or less to all those with which they had any dealings to all of them they afforded a market for some part either of their rude or manufactured produce and consequently gave some encouragement to the industry and improvement of all their own country however on account of its neighborhood necessarily derived the greatest benefit from this market its rude produce being charged with less carriage the traders could pay the growers a better price for it and yet afford it as cheap to the consumers as that of more distant countries  secondly the wealth acquired by the inhabitants of cities was frequently employed in purchasing such lands as were to be sold of which a great part would frequently be uncultivated merchants are commonly ambitious of becoming country gentlemen and when they do they are generally the best of all improvers a merchant is accustomed to employ his money chiefly in profitable projects whereas a mere country gentleman is accustomed to employ it chiefly in expense the one often sees his money go from him and return to him again with a profit the other when once he parts with it very seldom expects to see any more of it those different habits naturally affect their temper and disposition in every sort of business a merchant is commonly a bold a country gentleman a timid undertaker the one is not afraid to lay out at once a large capital upon the improvement of his land when he has a probable prospect of raising the value of it in proportion to the expense the other if he has any capital which is not always the case seldom ventures to employ it in this manner if he improves at all it is commonly not with a capital but with what he can save out of his annual revenue whoever has had the fortune to live in a mercantile town situated in an unimproved country must have frequently observed how much more spirited the operations of merchants were in this way than those of mere country gentlemen the habits besides of order economy and attention to which mercantile business naturally forms a merchant render him much fitter to execute with profit and success any project of improvement  thirdly and lastly commerce and manufactures gradually introduced order and good government and with them the liberty and security of individuals among the inhabitants of the country who had before lived almost in a continual state of war with their neighbors and of servile dependency upon their superiors this though it has been the least observed is by far the most important of all their effects mr hume is the only writer who so far as i know has hitherto taken notice of it  in a country which has neither foreign commerce nor any of the finer manufactures a great proprietor having nothing for which he can exchange the greater part of the produce of his lands which is over and above the maintenance of the cultivators consumes the whole in rustic hospitality at home if this surplus produce is sufficient to maintain a hundred or a thousand men he can make use of it in no other way than by maintaining a hundred or a thousand men he is at all times therefore surrounded with a multitude of retainers and dependants who having no equivalent to give in return for their maintenance but being fed entirely by his bounty must obey him for the same reason that soldiers must obey the prince who pays them before the extension of commerce and manufactures in europe the hospitality of the rich and the great from the sovereign down to the smallest baron exceeded every thing which in the present times we can easily form a notion of westminster hall was the dining room of william rufus and might frequently perhaps not be too large for his company it was reckoned a piece of magnificence in thomas becket that he strowed the floor of his hall with clean hay or rushes in the season in order that the knights and squires who could not get seats might not spoil their fine clothes when they fat down on the floor to eat their dinner the great earl of warwick is said to have entertained every day at his different manors thirty thousand people and though the number here may have been exaggerated it must however have been very great to admit of such exaggeration a hospitality nearly of the same kind was exercised not many years ago in many different parts of the highlands of scotland it seems to be common in all nations to whom commerce and manufactures are little known i have seen says doctor pocock an arabian chief dine in the streets of a town where he had come to sell his cattle and invite all passengers even common beggars to sit down with him and partake of his banquet  the occupiers of land were in every respect as dependent upon the great proprietor as his retainers even such of them as were not in a state of villanage were tenants at will who paid a rent in no respect equivalent to the subsistence which the land afforded them a crown half a crown a sheep a lamb was some years ago in the highlands of scotland a common rent for lands which maintained a family in some places it is so at this day nor will money at present purchase a greater quantity of commodities there than in other places in a country where the surplus produce of a large estate must be consumed upon the estate itself it will frequently be more convenient for the proprietor that part of it be consumed at a distance from his own house provided they who consume it are as dependent upon him as either his retainers or his menial servants he is thereby saved from the embarrassment of either too large a company or too large a family a tenant at will who possesses land sufficient to maintain his family for little more than a quit rent is as dependant upon the proprietor as any servant or retainer whatever and must obey him with as little reserve such a proprietor as he feeds his servants and retainers at his own house so he feeds his tenants at their houses the subsistence of both is derived from his bounty and its continuance depends upon his good pleasure  upon the authority which the great proprietors necessarily had in such a state of things over their tenants and retainers was founded the power of the ancient barons they necessarily became the judges in peace and the leaders in war of all who dwelt upon their estates they could maintain order and execute the law within their respective demesnes because each of them could there turn the whole force of all the inhabitants against the injustice of any one no other person had sufficient authority to do this the king in particular had not in those ancient times he was little more than the greatest proprietor in his dominions to whom for the sake of common defense against their common enemies the other great proprietors paid certain respects to have enforced payment of a small debt within the lands of a great proprietor where all the inhabitants were armed and accustomed to stand by one another would have cost the king had he attempted it by his own authority almost the same effort as to extinguish a civil war he was therefore obliged to abandon the administration of justice through the greater part of the country to those who were capable of administering it and for the same reason to leave the command of the country militia to those whom that militia would obey  it is a mistake to imagine that those territorial jurisdictions took their origin from the feudal law not only the highest jurisdictions both civil and criminal but the power of levying troops of coining money and even that of making byelaws for the government of their own people were all rights possessed allodially by the great proprietors of land several centuries before even the name of the feudal law was known in europe the authority and jurisdiction of the saxon lords in england appears to have been as great before the conquest as that of any of the norman lords after it but the feudal law is not supposed to have become the common law of england till after the conquest that the most extensive authority and jurisdictions were possessed by the great lords in france allodially long before the feudal law was introduced into that country is a matter of fact that admits of no doubt that authority and those jurisdictions all necessarily flowed from the state of property and manners just now described without remounting to the remote antiquities of either the french or english monarchies we may find in much later times many proofs that such effects must always flow from such causes it is not thirty years ago since mr cameron of lochiel a gentleman of lochabar in scotland without any legal warrant whatever not being what was then called a lord of regality nor even a tenant in chief but a vassal of the duke of argylle and without being so much as a justice of peace used notwithstanding to exercise the highest criminal jurisdiction over his own people he is said to have done so with great equity though without any of the formalities of justice and it is not improbable that the state of that part of the country at that time made it necessary for him to assume this authority in order to maintain the public peace that gentleman whose rent never exceeded five hundred pounds a year carried in      eight hundred of his own people into the rebellion with him  the introduction of the feudal law so far from extending may be regarded as an attempt to moderate the authority of the great allodial lords it established a regular subordination accompanied with a long train of services and duties from the king down to the smallest proprietor during the minority of the proprietor the rent together with the management of his lands fell into the hands of his immediate superior and consequently those of all great proprietors into the hands of the king who was charged with the maintenance and education of the pupil and who from his authority as guardian was supposed to have a right of disposing of him in marriage provided it was in a manner not unsuitable to his rank but though this institution necessarily tended to strengthen the authority of the king and to weaken that of the great proprietors it could not do either sufficiently for establishing order and good government among the inhabitants of the country because it could not alter sufficiently that state of property and manners from which the disorders arose the authority of government still continued to be as before too weak in the head and too strong in the inferior members and the excessive strength of the inferior members was the cause of the weakness of the head after the institution of feudal subordination the king was as incapable of restraining the violence of the great lords as before they still continued to make war according to their own discretion almost continually upon one another and very frequently upon the king and the open country still continued to be a scene of violence rapine and disorder  but what all the violence of the feudal institutions could never have effected the silent and insensible operation of foreign commerce and manufactures gradually brought about these gradually furnished the great proprietors with something for which they could exchange the whole surplus produce of their lands and which they could consume themselves without sharing it either with tenants or retainers all for ourselves and nothing for other people seems in every age of the world to have been the vile maxim of the masters of mankind as soon therefore as they could find a method of consuming the whole value of their rents themselves they had no disposition to share them with any other persons for a pair of diamond buckles perhaps or for something as frivolous and useless they exchanged the maintenance or what is the same thing the price of the maintenance of a thousand men for a year and with it the whole weight and authority which it could give them the buckles however were to be all their own and no other human creature was to have any share of them whereas in the more ancient method of expense they must have shared with at least a thousand people with the judges that were to determine the preference this difference was perfectly decisive and thus for the gratification of the most childish the meanest and the most sordid of all vanities they gradually bartered their whole power and authority  in a country where there is no foreign commerce nor any of the siner manufactures a man of ten thousand a year cannot well employ his revenue in any other way than in maintaining perhaps a thousand families who are all of them necessarily at his command in the present state of europe a man of ten thousand a year can spend his whole revenue and he generally does so without directly maintaining twenty people or being able to command more than ten footmen not worth the commanding indirectly perhaps he maintains as great or even a greater number of people than he could have done by the ancient method of expense for though the quantity of precious productions for which he exchanges his whole revenue be very small the number of workmen employed in collecting and preparing it must necessarily have been very great its great price generally arises from the wages of their labor and the profits of all their immediate employers by paying that price he indirectly pays all those wages and profits and thus indirectly contributes to the maintenance of all the workmen and their employers he generally contributes however but a very small proportion to that of each to very few perhaps a tenth to many not a hundredth and to some not a thousandth nor even a ten thousandth part of their whole annual maintenance though he contributes therefore to the maintenance of them all they are all more or less independent of him because generally they can all be maintained without him  when the great proprietors of land spend their rents in maintaining their tenants and retainers each of them maintains entirely all his own tenants and all his own retainers but when they spend them in maintaining tradesmen and artificers they may all of them taken together perhaps maintain as great or on account of the waste which attends rustic hospitality a greater number of people than before each of them however taken singly contributes often but a very small share to the maintenance of any individual of this greater number each tradesman or artificer derives his subsistence from the employment not of one but of a hundred or a thousand different customers though in some measure obliged to them all therefore he is not absolutely dependant upon any one of them  the personal expense of the great proprietors having in this manner gradually increased it was impossible that the number of their retainers should not as gradually diminish till they were at last dismissed altogether the same cause gradually led them to dismiss the unnecessary part of their tenants farms were enlarged and the occupiers of land notwithstanding the complaints of depopulation reduced to the number necessary for cultivating it according to the imperfect state of cultivation and improvement in those times by the removal of the unnecessary mouths and by exacting from the farmer the full value of the farm a greater surplus or what is the same thing the price of a greater surplus was obtained for the proprietor which the merchants and manufacturers soon furnished him with a method of spending upon his own person in the same manner as he had done the rest the same cause continuing to operate he was desirous to raise his rents above what his lands in the actual state of their improvement could afford his tenants could agree to this upon one condition only that they should be secured in their possession for such a term of years as might give them time to recover with profit whatever they should lay out in the further improvement of the land the expensive vanity of the landlord made him willing to accept of this condition and hence the origin of long leases  even a tenant at will who pays the full value of the land is not altogether dependent upon the landlord the pecuniary advantages which they receive from one another are mutual and equal and such a tenant will expose neither his life nor his fortune in the service of the proprietor but if he has a lease for a long term of years he is altogether independent and his landlord must not expect from him even the most trifling service beyond what is either expressly stipulated in the lease or imposed upon him by the common and known law of the country  the tenants having in this manner become independent and the retainers being dismissed the great proprietors were no longer capable of interrupting the regular execution of justice or of disturbing the peace of the country having sold their birthright not like esau for a mess of pottage in time of hunger and necessity but in the wantonness of plenty for trinkets and baubles fitter to be the playthings of children than the serious pursuits of men they became as insignificant as any substantial burgher or tradesman in a city a regular government was established in the country as well as in the city nobody having sufficient power to disturb its operations in the one any more than in the other  it does not perhaps relate to the present subject but i cannot help remarking it that very old families such as have possessed some considerable estate from father to son for many successive generations are very rare in commercial countries in countries which have little commerce on the contrary such as wales or the highlands of scotland they are very common the arabian histories seem to be all full of genealogies and there is a history written by a tartar khan which has been translated into several european languages and which contains scarce any thing else a proof that ancient families are very common among those nations in countries where a rich man can spend his revenue in no other way than by maintaining as many people as it can maintain he is not apt to run out and his benevolence it seems is seldom so violent as to attempt to maintain more than he can afford but where he can spend the greatest revenue upon his own person he frequently has no bounds to his expense because he frequently has no bounds to his vanity or to his affection for his own person in commercial countries therefore riches in spite of the most violent regulations of law to prevent their dissipation very seldom remain long in the same family among simple nations on the contrary they frequently do without any regulations of law for among nations of shepherds such as the tartars and arabs the consumable nature of their property necessarily renders all such regulations impossible  a revolution of the greatest importance to the public happiness was in this manner brought about by two different orders of people who had not the least intention to serve the public to gratify the most childish vanity was the sole motive of the great proprietors the merchants and artificers much less ridiculous acted merely from a view to their own interest and in pursuit of their own pedlar principle of turning a penny wherever a penny was to be got neither of them had either knowledge or forefight of that great revolution which the folly of the one and the industry of the other was gradually bringing about  it is thus that through the greater part of europe the commerce and manufactures of cities instead of being the effect have been the cause and occasion of the improvement and cultivation of the country  this order however being contrary to the natural course of things is necessarily both slow and uncertain compare the slow progress of those european countries of which the wealth depends very much upon their commerce and manufactures with the rapid advances of our north american colonies of which the wealth is founded altogether in agriculture through the greater part of europe the number of inhabitants is not supposed to double in less than five hundred years in several of our north american colonies it is found to double in twenty or five and twenty years in europe the law of primogeniture and perpetuities of different kinds prevent the division of great estates and thereby hinder the multiplication of small proprietors a small proprietor however who knows every part of his little territory who views it all with the affection which property especially small property naturally inspires and who upon that account takes pleasure not only in cultivating but in adorning it is generally of all improvers the most industrious the most intelligent and the most successful the same regulations besides keep so much land out of the market that there are always more capitals to buy than there is land to sell so that what is sold always sells at a monopoly price the rent never pays the interest of the purchase money and is besides burdened with repairs and other occasional charges to which the interest of money is not liable to purchase land is every where in europe a most unprofitable employment of a small capital for the sake of the superior security indeed a man of moderate circumstances when he retires from business will sometimes choose to lay out his little capital in land a man of profession too whose revenue is derived from another source often loves to secure his savings in the same way but a young man who instead of applying to trade or to some profession should employ a capital of two or three thousand pounds in the purchase and cultivation of a small piece of land might indeed expect to live very happily and very independently but must bid adieu forever to all hope of either great fortune or great illustration which by a different employment of his stock he might have had the same chance of acquiring with other people such a person too though he cannot aspire at being a proprietor will often disdain to be a farmer the small quantity of land therefore which is brought to market and the high price of what is brought prevents a great number of capitals from being employed in its cultivation and improvement which would otherwise have taken that direction in north america on the contrary fifty or sixty pounds is often found a sufficient stock to begin a plantation with the purchase and improvement of uncultivated land is there the most profitable employment of the smallest as well as of the greatest capitals and the most direct road to all the fortune and illustration which can be acquired in that country such land indeed is in north america to be had almost for nothing or at a price much below the value of the natural produce a thing impossible in europe or indeed in any country where all lands have long been private property if landed estates however were divided equally among all the children upon the death of any proprietor who left a numerous family the estate would generally be sold so much land would come to market that it could no longer sell at a monopoly price the free rent of the land would go nearer to pay the interest of the purchase money and a small capital might be employed in purchasing land as profitably as in any other way  england on account of the natural fertility of the soil of the great extent of sea coast in proportion to that of the whole country and of the many navigable rivers which run through it and afford the convenience of water carriage to some of the most inland parts of it is perhaps as well fitted by nature as any large country in europe to be the seat of foreign commerce of manufactures for distant sale and of all the improvements which these can occasion from the beginning of the reign of elizabeth too the english legislature has been peculiarly attentive to the interests of commerce and manufactures and in reality there is no country in europe holland itself not excepted of which the law is upon the whole more favorable to this sort of industry commerce and manufactures have accordingly been continually advancing during all this period the cultivation and improvement of the country has no doubt been gradually advancing too but it seems to have followed slowly and at a distance the more rapid progress of commerce and manufactures the greater part of the country must probably have been cultivated before the reign of elizabeth and a very great part of it still remains uncultivated and the cultivation of the far greater part much inferior to what it might be the law of england however favors agriculture not only indirectly by the protection of commerce but by several direct encouragements except in times of scarcity the exportation of corn is not only free but encouraged by a bounty in times of moderate plenty the importation of foreign corn is loaded with duties that amount to a prohibition the importation of live cattle except from ireland is prohibited at all times and it is but of late that it was permitted from thence those who cultivate the land therefore have a monopoly against their countrymen for the two greatest and most important articles of landproduce bread and butchers meat these encouragements though at bottom perhaps as i shall endeavor to show hereafter altogether illusory sufficiently demonstrate at least the good intention of the legislature to favor agriculture but what is of much more importance than all of them the yeomanry of england are rendered as secure as independent and as respectable as law can make them no country therefore in which the right of primogeniture takes place which pays tithes and where perpetuities though contrary to the spirit of the law are admitted in some cases can give more encouragement to agriculture than england such however notwithstanding is the state of its cultivation what would it have been had the law given no direct encouragement to agriculture besides what arises indirectly from the progress of commerce and had left the yeomanry in the same condition as in most other countries of europe it is now more than two hundred years since the beginning of the reign of elizabeth a period as long as the course of human prosperity usually endures  france seems to have had a considerable share of foreign commerce near a century before england was distinguished as a commercial country the marine of france was considerable according to the notions of the times before the expedition of charles the viiith to naples the cultivation and improvement of france however is upon the whole inferior to that of england the law of the country has never given the same direct encouragement to agriculture  the foreign commerce of spain and portugal to the other parts of europe though chiefly carried on in foreign ships is very considerable that to their colonies is carried on in their own and is much greater on account of the great riches and extent of those colonies but it has never introduced any considerable manufactures for distant sale into either of those countries and the greater part of both still remains uncultivated the foreign commerce of portugal is of older standing than that of any great country in europe except italy  italy is the only great country of europe which seems to have been cultivated and improved in every part by means of foreign commerce and manufactures for distant sale before the invasion of charles the viiith italy according to guicciardin was cultivated not less in the most mountainous and barren parts of the country than in the plainest and most fertile the advantageous situation of the country and the great number of independent states which at that time subsisted in it probably contributed not a little to this general cultivation it is not impossible too notwithstanding this general expression of one of the most judicious and reserved of modern historians that italy was not at that time better cultivated than england is at present  the capital however that is acquired to any country by commerce and manufacturers is all a very precarious and uncertain possession till some part of it has been secured and realized in the cultivation and improvement of its lands a merchant it has been said very properly is not necessarily the citizen of any particular country it is in a great measure indifferent to him from what place he carries on his trade and a very trifling disgust will make him remove his capital and together with it all the industry which it supports from one country to another no part of it can be said to belong to any particular country till it has been spread as it were over the face of that country either in buildings or in the lasting improvement of lands no vestige now remains of the great wealth said to have been possessed by the greater part of the hans towns except in the obscure histories of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries it is even uncertain where some of them were situated or to what towns in europe the latin names given to some of them belong but though the misfortunes of italy in the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth centuries greatly diminished the commerce and manufactures of the cities of lombardy and tuscany those countries still continue to be among the most populous and best cultivated in europe the civil wars of flanders and the spanish government which succeeded them chased away the great commerce of antwerp ghent and bruges but flanders still continues to be one of the richest best cultivated and most populous provinces of europe the ordinary revolutions of war and government easily dry up the sources of that wealth which arises from commerce only that which arises from the more solid improvements of agriculture is much more durable and cannot be destroyed but by those more violent convulsions occasioned by the depredations of hostile and barbarous nations continued for a century or two together such as those that happened for some time before and after the fall of the roman empire in the western provinces of europe  end of
