vol iv  a collection of poems in four volumes  by several hands    london printed by j hughs for r and j dodsley at tullyshead in pall mall mdcclv  an elegy written in a country church yard by mr gray the curfew tolls the knell of parting day the lowing herd wind slowly over the lea the plowman homeward plods his weary way and leaves the world to darkness and to me now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight and all the air a solemn stillness holds save where the beetle wheels his drony flight and drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds save that from yonder ivymantled tower the mopeing owl does to the moon complain of such as wandering near her secret bower molest her ancient solitary reign beneath those rugged elms that yewtrees shade where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap each in his narrow cell for ever laid the rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep the breezy call of incensebreathing morn the swallow twittring from the strawbuilt shed the cocks shrill clarion or the ecchoing horn no more shall rouse them from their lowly bed for them no more the blazing hearth shall burn or busy houswife ply her evening care no children run to lisp their sires return or climb his knees the envied kiss to share often did the harvest to their sickle yield their furrow often the stubborn glebe has broke how jocund did they drive their team afield how bowed the woods beneath their sturdy stroke let not ambition mock their useful toil their homely joys and destiny obscure nor grandeur hear with a disdainful smile the short and simple annals of the poor the boast of heraldry the pomp of power and all that beauty all that wealth ever gave await alike the inevitable hour the paths of glory lead but to the grave nor you ye proud impute to these the fault if memory over their tomb no trophies raise where through the longdrawn isle and fretted vault the pealing anthem swells the note of praise can storied urn or animated bust back to its mansion call the fleeting breath can honors voice provoke the silent dust or flattery sooth the dull cold ear of death perhaps in this neglected spot is laid some heart once pregnant with celestial fire hands that the rod of empire might have swayed or waked to ecstasy the living lyre but knowledge to their eyes her ample page rich with the spoils of time did never unroll chill penury repressed their noble rage and froze the genial current of the soul full many a gem of purest ray serene the dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear full many a flower is born to blush unseen and waste its sweetness on the desert air some villagehampden that with dauntless breast the little tyrant of his fields withstood some mute inglorious milton here may rest some cromwell guiltless of his countrys blood the applause of listening senates to command the threats of pain and ruin to despise to scatter plenty over a smiling land and read their history in a nations eyes their lot forbad nor circumscribed alone their growing virtues but their crimes consigned forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne and shut the gates of mercy on mankind the struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide to quench the blushes of ingenuous shame or heap the shrine of luxury and pride with incense kindled at the muses flame far from the madding crowds ignoble strife their sober wishes never learned to stray along the cool sequestered vale of life they kept the noiseless tenor of their way yet even these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhimes and shapeless sculpture decked implores the passing tribute of a sigh their name their years spelt by the unlettered muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to dye for who to dumb forgetfulness a prey this pleasing anxious being ever resigned left the warm precincts of the cheerful day nor cast one longing lingering look behind on some fond breast the parting soul relies some pious drops the closing eye requires even from the tomb the voice of nature cries even in our ashes live their wonted fires for thee who mindful of the unhonourd dead do in these lines their artless tale relate if chance by lonely contemplation led some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate happily some hoaryheaded swain may say oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn brushing with hasty steps the dews away to meet the sun upon the upland lawn there at the foot of yonder nodding beech that wreathes its old fantastic roots so high his listless length at noontide would he stretch and pore upon the brook that babbles by hard by yon wood now smiling as in scorn muttring his wayward sancies he would rove now drooping woeful wan like one forlorn or crazed with care or crossed in hopeless love one morn i missed him on the customd hill along the heath and near his favorite tree another came nor yet beside the rill nor up the lawn nor at the wood was he

young son conveys is staid by custom with him fights and his vain pride dismays a gentle knight there was whose noble deeds over fairy land by fame were blazoned round for warlike enterprise and sage areeds counsels areeds among the chief alike was he renowned whence with the marks of highest honors crowned by gloriana in domestic peace that port to which the wise are ever bound he anchored was and changed the tossing seas of bustling busy lise for calm sequestered ease ii there in domestic virtue rich and great as erst in public mid his wide domain long in primaeval patriarchal state the lord the judge the father of the plain he dwelt and with him in the golden chain of wedded faith ylinkd a matron sage aye dwelt sweet partner of his joy and pain sweet charmer of his youth friend of his age skilled to improve his bliss his sorrows to assuage iii from this fair union not of sordid gain but merit similar and mutual love true source of lineal virtue sprung a train of youths and virgins like the beauteous grove which round the temple of olympic jove begirt with youthful bloom the parent tree the sacred olive this tree grew in the altis or sacred grove of olympic jupiter at olympia having as the eleans pretenaed been originally planted there by hercules it was esteemed sacred and from that were taken the olympic crowns see pausanias eliac and the dissertation on the olympic games parent tree the sacred olive whence old elis wove her verdant crowns of peaceful victory the guerdons rewards guerdons of bold strength and swift activity iv so round their noble parents goodly rose these generous scyons they with watchful care still as the swelling passions began disclose the buds of future virtues did prepare with prudent culture the young shoots to rear and aye in this endearing pious toil they by a plmer pilgrim the person here signified is mr lock uncharacterized by his works palmer sage instructed were who from deep thought and studious search erewhile had learnt to mend the heart and till the human soil v for by celestial wisdom whilom led through all the apartments of the immortal mind he viewed the secret stores and marked the sted place station sted to judgment wit and memory assigned and how sensation and reflection joined to fill with images her darksome grotte where variously disjointed or combined as reason fancy or opinion wrought their various masks they played and fed her pensive thought vi alse also further alse through the fields of science had he strayed with eager search and sent his piercing eye through each learned school each philosophic shade where truth and virtue erst were deemed to lie if happily the fair vagrants he mote might mote spy or hear the music of their charming lore but all unable there to satisfy his curious soul he turned him to explore the sacred writ of faith to learn believe adore vii thence foe professed of falsehood and deceit those sly artificers of tyranny aye ever aye holding up before uncertain feet his faithful light to knowledge liberty mankind he led to civil policy and mild religions charitable law that framed by mercy and benignity the persecuting sword forbids to draw and freecreated souls with penal terrors awe viii ne nor ne with these glorious gifts elate and vain locked he his wisdom up in churlish pride but stooping from his height would even deign the feeble steps of infancy to guide eternal glory him therefore betide let every generous youth his praise proclaim who wandering through the worlds rude forest wide by him has been ytaught his course to frame to virtues sweet abodes and heavnaspiring fame ix for this the fairy knight with anxious thought and fond paternal care his counsel prayed and him of gentlest courtesy besought his guidance to vouchsafe and friendly aid the while his tender offspring he conveyed through devious paths to that secure retreat where sage paedia with each tuneful maid on a wide mount had fixed her rural seat mid flowery gardens placed untrod by vulgar feet x and now forthpacing with his blooming heir and that same virtuous palmer them to guide armed all to point and on a courser fair ymounted high in military pride his little train before he slow did ride him eke behind a gentle squire ensues follows ensues with his young lord aye marching side by side his counselor and guard in goodly thews manners thews who well had been brought up and nursed by every muse xi thus as their pleasing journey they pursued with cheerful argument beguiling pain ere long descending from an hill they viewed beneath their eyes outstretchd a spacious plain that fruitful showed and apt for every grain for pastures vines and flowers while nature fair sweetsmiling all around with countenance fain earnest eager fain seemed to demand the tillers art and care her wildness to correct her lavish waste repair xii right good i ween and bounteous was the soil aye wont in happy seasons to repay with tenfold usury the peasants toil but now twas ruin all and wild decay untilled the garden and the fallow lay the sheepshorne down with barren brakes briars brakes oergrown the whiles the merry peasants sport and play all as the public evil were unknown or every public care from every breast was flown xiii astonished at a scene at once so fair and so deformed with wonder and delight at mans neglect and natures bounty rare in studious thought awhile the fairy knight bent on that goodly land land land his eager sight then forward rushed impatient to descry what towns and castles therein were empight placed empight for towns him seemed and castles he did spy as to the horizon round he stretched his roaming eye xiv nor long way had they traveled ere they came to a wide stream that with tumultuous roar emongst rude rocks its winding course did frame black was the wave and sordid covered over with angry foam and stained with infants gore thereto along the unlovely margin stood a birchen grove that waving from the shore aye cast upon the tide its falling bud and with its bitter juice empoisond all the flood xv right in the center of the vale empight not distant far a forked mountain rose in outward form presenting to the sight that famed parnassian hill on whose fair brows the nine aonian sisters wont repose listening to sweet castalias sounding stream which through the plains of cirrha murmuring flows but this to that compared mote justly seem ne fitting haunt for gods ne worthy mans esteem xvi for this nor founded deep nor spredden wide nor high upraisd above the level plain by toiling art through tedious years applied from various parts compiled with studious pain was erst formerly erst upthrown if so it mote attain like that poetic mountain to be hight called named hight the noble seat of learnings goodly train thereto the more to captivate the sight it like a garden fair most curiously was dight dressed dight xvii in figured plots with leafy walls enclosed by measure and by rule it was outlayd with symmetry so regular disposed that plot to plot still answered shade to shade each correspondent twain alike arrayed with like embellishments of plants and flowers of statues vases spouting founts that played through shells of tritons their ascending showers and labyrinths involved and trelicewoven bowers xviii there likewise mote be seen on every side the yew obedient to the planters will and shapely box of all their branching pride ungently shorn and with preposterous skill to various beasts and birds of sundry quill transformed and human shapes of monstrous size huge as that giantrace who hill on hill highheaping sought with impious vain emprize enterprise attempt emprize despite of thundering jove to scale the steepy skies xix alse other wonders of the sportive shears fair nature misadorning there were found globes spiral columns pyramids and piers with sprouting urns and budding statues crowned and horizontal dials on the ground in living box by cunning artists traced and galleys trim on no long voyage bound but by their roots there ever anchored fast all used frequently by the old english poets for allthough all were their bellying sails outspread to every blast xx over all appeared the mountains forked brows with terrasses on terrasses upthrown and all along arrangd in ordered rows and vistos broad the velvet slopes adown the eververdant trees of daphne shone but aliens to the clime and brought of old from latian plains and grecian helicon they shrunk and languishd in a foreign mold by changeful summers starved and pinched by winters cold xxi amid this verdant grove with solemn state on golden thrones of antique form reclined in mimick majesty nine virgins sat in features various as unlike in mind alse boasted they themselves of heavenly kind and to the sweet parnassian nymphs allied thence round their brows the delphick bay they twined and matching with high names their apish pride over every learned school aye claimed they to preside xxii in antique garbs for modern they disdained by greek and roman artists whilom formerly whilom made of various woofs and variously distained with tints of every hue were they arrayed and here and there ambitiously displayed a purple shred of some rich robe prepared erst by the muses or the aonian maid to deck great tullius or the mantuan bard which over each motley vest with uncouth splendour glared xxiii and well their outward vesture did express the bent and habit of their inward mind affecting wisdoms antiquated dress and usages by time cast far behind thence to the charms of younger science blind the customs laws the learning arts and phrase of their own countries they with scorn declined ne sacred truth herself would they embrace unwarranted unknown in their forefathers days xxiv thus ever backward casting their survey to romes old ruins and the groves forlorn of elder athens which in prospect lay stretched out beneath the mountain would they turn their busy search and over the rubbish mourn then gathering up with superstitious care each little scrap however foul or torn in grave harangues they boldly would declare this ennius varro this the stagyrite did wear xxv yet under names of venerable sound wide over the world they stretched their aweful rod through all the provinces of learning owned for teachers of whatever is wise and good alse from each region to their drad dreadful drad abode came youths unnumberd crouding all to taste the streams of science which united flowed adown the mount from nine rich sources cast and to the vale below in one rude torrent passed xxvi over every source protectress of the stream one of those virgin sisters did preside who dignifying with her noble name her proper flood aye poured into the tide the heady vapors of scholastic pride despotical and abject bold and blind fierce in debate and forward to decide vain love of praise with adulation joined and disingenuous scorn and impotence of mind xxvii extending from the hill on every side in circuit vast a verdant valley spread across whose uniform flat bosom glide ten thousand streams in winding mazes led by various sluices from one common head a turbid mass of waters vast profound hight of philology the lake and fed by that rude torrent which with roaring sound came tumbling from the hill and flowed the level round xxviii and every where this spacious valley over fast by each stream was seen a numerous throng of beardless striplings to the birchcrownd shore by nurses guardians fathers dragged along who helpless meek and innocent of wrong were torn reluctant from the tender side of their fond mothers and by faitour doer from fair to do and fait deed commonly used by spenser in a bad sense faitours strong by power made insolent and hard by pride were driven with furious rage and lashed into the tide xxix on the rude bank with trembling feet they stood and casting round their oftreverted eyes if happily they mote scape the hated flood filled all the plain with lamentable cries but far away the unheeding father flies constrained his strong compunctions to repress while close behind assuming the disguise of nurturing care and smiling tenderness with secret scourges armed those griesly faitours press xxx as on the steepy margin of a brook when the young sun with flowery maia rides with innocent dismay a bleating flock crowd back affrighted at the rolling tides the shepherdswain at first exhorting chides their seely simple seely fear at length impatient grown with his rude crook he wounds their tender sides and all regardless of their piteous moan into the dashing wave compels them furious down xxxi thus urged by mastring fear and dolrous teen pain grief teen into the current plunged that infant crowd right piteous was the spectacle i ween of tender striplings stained with tears and blood perforce conflicting with the bitter flood and laboring to attain the distant shore where holding forth the gown of manhood stood the siren liberty and evermore solicited their hearts with her enchanting lore xxxii irksome and long the passage was perplexed with rugged rocks on which the raving tide by sudden bursts of angry tempests vexed often dashed the youth whose strength mote ill abide with head uplifted over the waves to ride whence many wearied ere they had oerpast the middle stream for they in vain have tried again returned astounded astonished astounded and aghast ne one regardful look would ever backward cast xxxiii some of a rugged more enduring frame their toilsome course with patient pain pursued and though with many a bruise and muchel much muchel blame eft hanging on the rocks and eft embrud deep in the muddy stream with hearts subdued and quaild by labor gained the shore at last but in lifes practick lear learning lear unskilled and rude forth to that forked hill they silent paced where hid in studious shades their fruitless hours they waste xxxiv others of rich and noble lineage bred though with the crowd to pass the flood constrained yet over the crags with fond indulgence led by hireling guides and in all depths sustained skimmd lightly over the tide undipt unstained save with the sprinkling of the watery spray and aye their proud prerogative maintained of ignorance and ease and wanton play soft harbingers of vice and praemature decay xxxv a few alas how few by heavens high will with subtle spirits endowed and sinews strong albe although albe sore mated amazed scared mated by the tempests shrill that bellowed fierce and rife the rocks among by their own native vigor borne along cut briskly through the waves and forces new gathering from toil and ardor from the throng of rival youths outstript the laboring crew and to the true parnasse parnassus parnasse and heavnthrond glory flew xxxvi dire was the tumult and from every shore discordant echoes struck the deafend ear heartthrilling cries with sobs and gults sighs singults sore shortinterrupted the imploring tear and furious stripes and angry threats severe confusedly mingled with the jarring sound of all the various speeches that whileear formerly whileear on shinars widespread champain did astound high babels builders vain and their proud works confound xxxvii much was the knight empassiond at the scene but more his blooming son whose tender breast empierced deep with sympathizing teen on his pale cheek the signs of dread impressed and filled his eyes with tears which sore distressed up to his sire he raised in mournful wise who with sweet smiles paternal soon redressed his troublous thoughts and cleared each sad surmise then turns his ready steed and on his journey hies xxxviii  far he had not marched ere he was stayed  voice that like the united sound  myriads through the valley brayed  the groves the floods and solid ground the distant hills rebellowd all around arrest sir knight it cried thy fond career nor with presumptuous disobedience wound that aweful majesty which all revere in my commands sir knight the voice of nations hear xxxix quick turned the knight and saw upon the plain advancing toward him with impetuous gate and visage all inflamed with fierce disdain a monstrous giant on whose brow elate shone the bright ensign of imperial state albeit lawful kingdom he had none but laws and kingdoms wont he often create and ofttimes over both erect his throne while senates priests and kings his sovran for sovereign sovran scepter own xl custom he hight and aye in every land usurped dominion with despotick sway over all he holds and to his high command constrains even stubborn nature to obey whom dispossessing often he does assay to govern in her right and with a pace so soft and gentle does he win his way that she unwares is caught in his embrace and though deflowered and thralld naught seels her foul disgrace xli for nurtring even from their tenderest age the docile sons of men withouten pain by disciplines and rules to every stage of life accommodate he does them train insensibly to wear and hug his chain alse his behests or gentle or severe or good or noxious rational or vain he craftily persuades them to revere as institutions sage and venerable lear xlii protector therefore of that forked hill and mighty patron of those sisters nine who there enthroned with many a copious rill feed the full streams that through the valley shine he deemed was and aye with rites divine the lacedaemonians in order to make their children hardy and endure pain with constancy and courage were accustomed to cause them to be scourged very severely and i myself says plutarch in his life of lycurgus have seen several of them endure whipping to death at the foot of the altar of diana surnamed orthia like those which spartas hardy race of yore were wont perform at fell dianas shrine he does constrain his vassals to adore perforce their sacred names and learn their sacred lore xliii and to the fairy knight now drawing near with voice terrifick and imperious mien all was he wont less dreadful to appear when known and practiced than at distance seen and kingly stretching forth his scepter sheen him he commands upon threatned pain of his displeasure high and vengeance keen from his rebellious purpose to refrain and all due honors pay to learnings reverend train xliv so saying and forestalling all reply his peremptory hand without delay as one who little cared to justify his princely will long used to boundless sway upon the fairy youth with great dismay in every quaking limb convulsed he laid and proudly stalking over the verdant lay mead trouble misfortune etc lay him to those scientifick streams conveyed with many his young compeers therein to be embayd bathed dipped embayd xlv the knight his tender sons distressful stour trouble misfortune etc stour perceiving swift to his assistance flew ne vainly stayed to deprecate that power which from submission aye more haughty grew for that proud giants force he wisely knew not to be meanly dreaded nor defied with rash presumption and with courage true rather than step from virtues paths aside often had he singly scorned his all dismaying pride xlvi and now disdaining parle his courser hot he siercely pricked and couched his vengeful spear wherewith the giant he so rudely smot that him perforce constrained to wend arrear move backwards wend arrear who much abashed at such rebuke severe yet his accustomed pride recovring soon forthwith his massy scepter began uprear for other warlike weapon he had none ne other him behoved to quell his boldest fone foes fone xlvii with that enormous mace the fairy knight so sore he bet beat bet that all his armor brayed resounded brayed to pieces wellnigh riven with the might of so tempestuous strokes but he was stayed and ever with deliberate valor weighed the sudden changes of the doubtful fray from cautious prudence often deriving aid when force unequal did him hard assay so lightly from his steed he leapt upon the lay xlviii then swiftly drawing forth his trenchant cutting trenchant blade high over his head he held his fenceful shield and warily forecasting to evade the giants furious arm about him wheeled with restless steps aye traversing the field and ever as his foes intemperate pride through rage defenseless mote advantage yield with his sharp sword so often he did him gride cut hack gride that his goldsandald feet in crimson floods were dyed xlix his baser parts he maimed with many a wound but far above his utmost reach were pight placed pight the forts of life ne ever to confound with utter ruin and abolish quite a power so puissant by his single might did he presume to hope himself alone from lawless force to free in bloody fight he stood content to bow to customs throne so reason mote not blush his sovran rule to own l so well he warded and so fiercely pressed his foe that weary wexd he of the fray yet nould he algates would not by any means nould he algates lower his haughty crest but masking in contempt his sore dismay disdainfully released the trembling prey as one unworthy of his princely care then proudly casting on the warlike fay fairy fay a smile of scorn and pity through the air began blow his shrilling horn the blast was heard afar li eftsoons astonished at the alarming sound the signal of distress and hostile wrong confusedly trooping from all quarters round came pouring over the plain a numerous throng of every sex and order old and young the vassals of great customs wide domain who to his lore inured by usage long his every summons heard with pleasure fain and felt his every wound with sympathetick pain lii they when their bleeding king they did behold and saw an armed knight him standing near attended by that palmer sage and bold whose venurous search of devious truth whileear spread through the realms of learning horrors drear yseized were at first with terrors great and in their boding hearts began to fear dissension factious controversial hate and innovations strange in customs peaceful state liii but when they saw the knight his fauchion sheathe and climbing to his steed march thence away with all his hostile train they began to breathe with freer spirit and with aspect gay soon chaced the gathering clouds of black affray alse their great monarch cheared with the view of myriads who confessed his sovran sway his ruffled pride began to plume anew and on his bugle clear a strain of triumph blew live thereat the multitude that stood around sent up at once a universal roar of boisterous joy the suddenbursting sound like the explosion of a warlike store of nitrous grain the afflicted welkin sky welkin tore then turning toward the knight with scoffings lewd heartpiercing insults and revilings sore loud bursts of laughter vain and hisses rude as through the throng he passed his parting steps pursued lv alse from that forked hill the boasted seat of studious peace and mild philosophy indignant murmurs mote be heard to threat mustering their rage eke baleful infamy roused from her den of base obscurity by those same maidens nine began to sound her brazen trump of blackning obloquy while satire with dark clouds encompast round sharp secret arrows shot and aimed his back to wound lvi but the brave fairy knight no whit dismayed held on his peaceful journey over the plain with curious eye observing as he strayed through the wide provinces of customs reign what mote afresh admonish him remain fast by his virtuous purpose all around so many objects moved his just disdain him seemed that nothing serious nothing sound in city village bower or castle mote be found lvii in village city castle bower and hall each sex each age each order and degree to vice and idle sport abandoned all kept one perpetual general jubilee ne suffered ought disturb their merry glee ne sense of private loss ne public woes restraint of law religions drad decree intestine desolation foreign foes nor heavens tempestuous threats nor earths convulsive throws lviii but chiefly they whom heavens disposing hand had seated high on fortunes upper stage and placed within their call the sacred band that waits on nurture and instruction sage if happily their wise hests behests precepts commands hests mote them engage to climb through knowledge to more noble praise and as they mount enlighten every age with the bright influence of fair virtues rays which from the aweful heights of grandeur brighter blaze lix they o perverse and base ingratitude despising the great ends of providence for which above their mates they were endued with wealth authority and eminence to the low services of brutal sense abused the means of pleasures more refined of knowledge virtue and beneficence and fettering on her throne the immortal mind the guidance of her realm to passions wild resigned lx hence thoughtless shameless reckless spiritless naught worthy of their kind did they assay but or benumbed with palsied idleness in merely living loiterd life away or by false taste of pleasure led astray forever wandering in the sensual bowers of feverish debauch and lustful play spent on ignoble toils their active powers and with untimely blasts diseased their vernal hours lxi even they to whom kind nature did accord a frame more delicate and purer mind though the foul brothel and the winestaind board of beastly comus loathing they declined yet their soft hearts to idle joys resigned like painted insects through the summerair with random flight aye ranging unconfined and tasting every flower and blossom fair withouten any choice withouten any care lxii for choice them needed none who only sought with vain amusements to beguile the day and wherefore should they take or care or thought whom nature prompts and fortune calls to play lords of the earth be happy as ye may so learned so taught the leaders of mankind the unreasoning vulgar willingly obey and leaving toil and poverty behind ran forth by different ways the blissful boon to find lxiii nor tedious was the search for every where as nigh great customs royal towers the knight passed through the adjoining hamlets mote he hear the merry voice of festival delight saluting the return of morning bright with matinrevels by the midday hours scarce ended and again with dewy night in covered theaters or leafy bowers offering her eveningvows to pleasures joyous powers lxiv and ever on the way mote he espy men women children a promiscuous throng of rich poor wise and simple low and high by land by water passing aye along with mummers anticks music dance and song to pleasures numerous temples that beside the glistening streams or tufted groves among to every idle foot stood open wide and every gay desire with various joys supplied lxv for there each heart with diverse charms to move the sly inchantress summoned all her train alluring venus queen of vagrant love the boon companion bacchus loud and vain and tricking hermes god of fraudful gain who when blind fortune throws directs the die and phoebus tuning his soft lydian strain to wanton motions and the lovers sigh and thoughbeguiling show and masking revelry lxvi unmeet associates there for noble youth who to true honor means to aspire and for the works of virtue faith and truth would keep his manly faculties entire the which avizing well the cautious sire from that soft sirenland of pleasaunce vain with timely haste was minded to retire or ere before or ere the sweet contagion mote attain his sons unpracticd heart yet free from vicious stain lxvii so turning from that beaten road aside through many a devious path at length he paced as that experienced palmer did him guide till to a mountain hoare they come at last whose highraisd brows with silvan honors graced majestically frowned upon the plain and over all an aweful horror cast seemed as those villas gay it did disdain which spangled all the vale like floras painted train lxviii the hill ascending strait erewhile they came to a tall grove whose thick embowring shade impervious to the suns meridian flame even at midnoon a dubious twilight made like to that sober light which disarrayd of all its gorgeous robe with blunted beams through windows dim with holy acts portrayed along some cloistered abbey faintly gleams abstracting the rapt thought from vain earthmusing themes lxix beneath this high oerarching canopy of clustring oaks a silvan colonnade aye listening to the native melody of birds sweetecchoing through the lonely shade on to the center of the grove they strayed which in a spacious circle opening round within it is sheltering arms securely laid disclosed to sudden view a vale profound with natures artless smiles and tranquil beauties crowned lxx there on the basis of an ancient pile whose cross surmounted spire oerlookd the wood a venerable matron they erewhile discovered have beside a murmuring flood reclining in right sad and pensive mood retired within her own abstracted breast she seemed over various woes by turns to brood the which her changing cheer by turns expressed now glowing with disdain with grief now overkest for overcast overkest lxxi her thus immersed in anxious thought profound when as the knight perceived he nearer drew to weet what bitter bale did her astound and whence the occasion of her anguish grew for that right noble matron well he knew and many perils huge and labors sore had for her sake endured her vassal true trained in her love and practiced evermore her honor to respect and reverence her lore lxxii o dearest drad he cried fair island queen mother of heroes empress of the main what means that stormy brow of troublous teen since since since heavenborn peace with all her smiling train of sciences and arts adorns thy reign with wealth and knowledge splendor and renown each port how thronged how fruitful every plain how blithe the country and how gay the town while liberty secures and heightens every boon lxxiii

structure rise with newplacd statues decked on every side her parentbreast would swell with generous pride and now with her in that sequestered plain the knight a while constraining to abide she to the fairy youth with pleasure fain those sculptured chiefs did show and their great lives explain great lives explain i cannot forbear taking occasion from these words to make my acknowledgments to the writers of biographia britannica for the pleasure and profit i have lately received from perusing the two first volumes of that useful and entertaining work of which the monumental structure above mentioned decorated with the statues of great and good men is no improper emblem this work which contains the lives of the most eminent persons who have flourished in great britain and ireland from the earliest ages down to the present time appears to me as far as it has hitherto gone to be executed with great spirit accuracy and judgment and deserves in my opinion to be encouraged by all who have at heart the honor of their country and that of their particular families and friends and who can any ways assist the ingenious and laborious authors to render as perfect as possible a design so apparently calculated to serve the public by setting in the truest and fullest light the characters of persons already generally though perhaps too indistinctly known and reviving from obscurity and oblivion examples of private and retired merit which though less glaring and ostentatious than the former are not however of a less extensive or less beneficial influence to those who may happen not to have seen this repository of british glory i cannot give a better idea of it than in the following lines of virgil hic manus ob patriam pugnando vulnera passi quique sacerdotes casti dum vita manebat quique pii vates and phoebo digna locuti inventas aut qui vitam excoluere per arts quique sui memores alios fecere merendo virg aen l    the end of the first canto penshurst inscribed to

warm and honor in a female form with them in aged groves to walk and lose my thoughts in artless talk i shun the voice of party loud i shun loose pleasures idle crowd and monkish academic cell where science only feigns to dwell and court where speckled vanity apes her tricks in tawdry dye and shifts each hour her tinsel hue still furbelowd in follies new here nature no distortion wears old truth retains his silver hairs and chastity her matron step and purple health her rosy lip ah on the virgins gentle brow how innocence delights to glow unlike the towndames haughty air the scornful eye and harlots stare but bending mild the bashful front as modest fear is ever wont shepherdesses such of old doric bards enamored told while the pleased arcadian vale echoed the enchanting tale but chief of virtues lovely train a pensive exile on the plain no longer active now to wield the avenging sword protecting shield here thoughtfulwalking liberty remembers britons once were free with her would nobles old converse and learn her dictates to rehearse ere yet they grew refined to hate the hospitable rural seat the spacious hall with tenants stored where mirth and plenty crowned the board ere yet their lares they forsook and lost the genuine british look the conscious brow of inward merit the rough unbending martial spirit to clink the chain of thraldom gay and courtidolatry to pay to live in city smoaks obscure where morn never wakes her breezes pure where darkest midnight reigns at noon and fogs eternal blot the sun but come the minutes flit away and eager fancy longs to stray come friendly genius lead me round thy sylvan haunts and magic ground point every spot of hill or dale and tell me as we tread the vale here mighty dudly once would rove to plan his triumphs in the grove

sidney was born of which ben johnson speaks in the following manner that taller tree which of a nut was set at his great birth where all the muses met  oak what rapture does my soul provoke there let me hang a garland high there let my muse her accents try be there my earliest homage paid be there my latest vigils made for thou wast planted in the earth the day that shone on sidneys birth that happy time that glorious day the muses came in concert gay with harps in tune and ready song the jolly chorus tript along in honor of the auspicious morn to hail an infant genius born next came the fauns in order meet the satyrs next with cloven feet the dryads swift that roam the woods the naiads green that swim the floods sylvanus left his silent cave medway came dropping from the wave

there the naiads watered well the ground and flora twined a woodbine round the tree sprung fast in hallowed earth coaeval with the illustrious birth thus let my feet unwearied stray nor satisfied with one survey when morn returns with doubtful light and phebe pales her lamp of night still let me wander forth anew and print my footsteps on the dew what time the swain with ruddy cheek prepares to yoke his oxen meek and early dressed in neat array the milkmaid chanting shrill her lay comes abroad with milking pail and the sound of distant flail gives the ear a rough good morrow and the lark from out his furrow soars upright on matin wings and at the gate of heaven sings but when the sun with fervid ray drives upwards to his noon of day and couching oxen lay them down beneath the beechen umbrage brown then let me wander in the hall round whose antiquevisagd wall hangs the armor britons wore rudely cast in days of yore yon sword some heros arm might wield red in the ranks of chalgraves field where everglorious hampden bled and freedom tears of sorrow shed or in the gallery let me walk where living pictures seem to talk where beauty smiles serenely fair and courage frowns with

factious waters fond to swell guides to battle in her carr against her sister earth to war thus let me muse on things sublime above the flight of modern rhyme and call the soul of newton down where it

reputation lost her money gone yet not a tradesman paid her fame yet she still damned to be a maid her spirits sink her nerves are so unstrung she weeps if but a handsome thief is hung by mercers

dreaded country first appears with sighs unfeigned the dying noise she hears of distant coaches fainter by degrees then starts and trembles at the sight of trees silent and sullen like some captive

nuptial ties they celebrate but no rejoycings can unbend her brow nor deigns she to return one awkward bow but bounces in disdaining once to speak and wipes the trickling tear from off her cheek now see her in the sad decline of life a peevish mistress and a sulky wife her nerves unbracd her faded cheek grown pale with many a real many a fancied ail of cards admirers equipage bereft her insolence and title only left severely humbled to her onehorse chair and the low pastimes of a country fair too wretched to endure one lonely day too proud one friendly visit to repay too indolent to read too

disappointed pride now stops her breath and with true scorpion rage she stings herself to death elegy to miss d  w  d in the manner of ovid by the late mr hammond o say thou dear possessor of my breast where now is my boasted liberty and rest where the gay moments which i once have known o where that heart i fondly thought my own from place to place i solitary roam abroad uneasy nor content at home i scorn the beauties common eyes adore the more i view them feel thy worth the more unmoved i hear them speak or see them fair and only think on thee  who art not there in vain would books their formal succor lend nor wit nor wisdom can relieve their friend wit cannot deceive the pain i now endure and wisdom shows the ill without the cure when from thy sight i waste the tedious day a thousand schemes i form and things to say but when thy presence gives the time i seek my hearts so full i wish but cannot speak and could i speak with eloquence and ease till now not studious of the art to please could i at woman who so often exclaim expose nor blush thy triumph and my shame abjure those maxims i so lately prized and court that sex i foolishly despised own thou have softened my obdurate mind and thou revenged the wrongs of womankind lost were my words and fruitless all my pain in vain to tell thee all i write in vain my humble sighs shall only reach thy ears and all my eloquence shall be my tears and now for more i never must pretend hear me not as thy lover but thy friend thousands will fain thy little heart ensnare for without danger none like thee are fair but wisely choose who best deserves thy flame so shall the choice itself become thy fame nor yet despise though void of winning art the plain and honest courtship of the heart the skilful tongue in loves persuasive lore though less it feels will please and flatter more and meanly learned in that guilty trade can long abuse a fond unthinking maid and since their lips so knowing to deceive thy unexperienced youth might soon believe and since their tears in false submission dressed might thaw the icy coldness of thy breast o shut thine eyes to such deceitful woe caught by the beauty of thy outward show like me they do not love whatever they seem like me  with passion founded on esteem answer to the foregoing lines by the late lord hervey too well these lines that fatal truth declare which long i have known yet now i blush to hear but say what hopes thy fond illfated love what can it hope though mutual it should prove this little form is fair in vain for you in vain for me thy honest heart is true for woudst thou fix dishonor on my name and give me up to penitence and shame or gild my ruin with the name of wife and make me a poor virtuous wretch for life coudst thou submit to wear the marriage chain too sure a cure for all thy present pain no saffron robe for us the godhead wears his torch inverted and his face in tears though every softer wish were amply crowned love soon would cease to smile where fortune frowned then would thy soul my fond consent deplore and blame what it solicited before thy own exhausted would reproach my truth and say i had undone thy blinded youth that i had damped ambitions nobler flame eclipsed thy talents and obscured thy fame to madrigals and odes that wit confined that would in senates or in courts have shined gloriously active in thy countrys cause asserting freedom and enacting laws or say at best that negatively kind you only mourned and silently repined the jealous demons in my own fond breast would all these thoughts incessantly suggest and all that sense must feel though pity had suppressed yet added grief my apprehension fills if there can be addition to those ills when they shall cry whose harsh reproof i dread it was thy own deed thy folly on thy head age knows not to allow for thoughtless youth nor pities tenderness nor honors truth holds it romantic to confess a heart and says those virgins act a wiser part who hospitals and bedlams would explore to find the rich and only dread the poor who legal prostitutes for interest sake clodios and timons to their bosoms take and if avenging heaven permit increase people the world with folly and disease those titles deeds and rentrolls only wed whilst the best bidder mounts the venal bed and the grave aunt and formal sire approve this nuptial sale this auction of their love but if regard to worth or sense be shown that poor degenerate child her friends disown who dares to deviate by a virtuous choice from her great names hereditary vice these scenes my prudence ushers to my mind of all the storms and quicksands i must find if i embark upon this summer sea where flattery smooths and pleasure gilds the way had our ill fate never blown thy dangerous flame beyond the limits of a friends cold name i might upon that score thy heart receive and with that guiltless name my own deceive that commerce now in vain you recommend i dread the latent lover in the friend of ignorance i want the poor excuse and know i both must take or both refuse hear then the safe the firm resolve i make never to encourage one i must forsake whilst other maids a shameless path pursue neither to interest nor to honor true and proud to swell the triumph of their eyes exult in love from lovers they despise their maxims all reversed i mean to prove and though i like the lover quit the love epistles in the manner of ovid monimia to philocles by the same since language never can describe my pain how can i hope to move when i complain but such is womans frenzy in distress we love to plead though hopeless of redress perhaps affecting ignorance thou wilt say from whence these lines whose message to convey mock not my grief with that feigned cold demand too well you know the hapless writers hand but if you force me to avow my shame behold it prefacd with monimias name lost to the world abandoned and forlorn exposed to infamy reproach and scorn to mirth and comfort lost and all for you yet lost perhaps to your remembrance too how hard my lot what refuge can i try weary of life and yet afraid to die of hope the wretchs last resort bereft by friends by kindred by my lover left oh frail dependence of confiding fools on lovers oaths or friendships sacred rules how weak in modern hearts too late i find monimias fallen and philocles unkind to these reflections each slow wearing day and each revolving night a constant prey think what i suffer nor ungentle hear what madness dictates in my fond despair grudge not this short relief too fast it flies nor chide that weakness i myself despise one moment sure may be at least her due who sacrificed her all of life for you without a frown this farewell then receive for it is the last my hapless love shall give nor this i would if reason could command but what restriction reins a lovers hand nor prudence shame nor pride nor interest sways the hand implicitly the heart obeys too well this maxim has my conduct shown too well that conduct to the world is known often have i writ and often to the flame condemned this afterwitness of my shame often in my cooler recollected thought thy beauties and my fondness half forgot how short those intervals for reasons aid thus to myself in anguish have i said thy vain remonstrance foolish maid give over who act the wrong can never that wrong deplore then sanguine hopes again delusive reign i formed thee melting as i tell my pain if not of rock thy flinty heart is made nor tigers nursed thee in the desert shade let me at least thy cold compassion prove that slender sustenance of greedy love though no return my warmer wishes find be to the wretch though not the mistress kind nor whilst i court my melancholy state forget twas love and thee that wrought my fate without restraint habituate to range the paths of pleasure can i bear this change doomed from the world unwilling to retire in bloom of life and warm with young desire in lieu of roofs with regal splendour gay condemned in distant wilds to drag the day where beasts of prey maintain their savage court or human brutes the worst of brutes resort yes yes the change i could unsighing see for none i mourn but what i find in thee there center all my woes thy heart estranged i weep my lover not my fortune changed blessed with thy presence i could all forget nor gilded palaces in huts regret but exiled thence superfluous is the rest each place the same my hell is in my breast to pleasure dead and living but to pain my only sense to suffer and complain as all my wrongs distressful i repeat say can thy pulse with equal cadence beat can thou know peace is conscience mute within that upright delegate for secret sin is nature so extinguished in thy heart that not one spark remains to take my part not one repentant throb one grateful sigh thy breast unruffled and unwet thy eye thou cool betrayer temperate in ill thou nor remorse nor thought humane can feel nature has formed thee of the rougher kind and education more debased thy mind born in an age when guilt and fraud prevail when justice sleeps and interest holds the scale thy loose companions a licentious crew most to each other all to us untrue whom chance or habit mix but rarely choice nor leagued in friendship but in social vice who indigent of honor or of shame glory in crimes which others blush to name by right or wrong disdaining to be moved unprincipled unloving and unlovd the fair who trusts their prostituted vows if not their falsehood still their boasts expose nor knows the wisest to elude the harm even she whose prudence shuns the tinsel charm they know to slander though they fail to warm they make her languish in fictitious flame affix some specious slander on her name and baffled by her virtue triumph over her fame these are the leaders of thy blinded youth these vile seducers laughed thee out of truth whose scurril jests all solemn ties profane or friendships band or hymens sacred chain morality as weakness they upbraid nor even revere religions hallowed head alike they spurn divine and human laws and treat the honest like the christian cause curse on that tongue whose vile pernicious art delights the ear but to corrupt the heart that takes advantage of the cheerful hour when weakened virtue bends to natures power and would the goodness of the soul efface to substitute dishonor in her place with such you lose the day in false delights in lewd debauch you revel out the nights o fatal commerce to monimias peace their arguments convince because they please whilst sophistry for reason they admit and wander dazzled by the glare of wit wit that on ill a specious instre throws and in false colors every object shows that gilds the wrong depreciating the right and hurts the judgment while it feasts the sight so in a prism to the deluded eye each pictured trifle takes a rainbow dye with borrowed charms the shining prospect glows and truth reversed the faithless mirror shows inverted scenes in bright confusion lie the lawns impending over the nether sky no just no real images we meet but all the gaudy vision is deceit often i revolve in this distracted mind each word each look that spoke my charmer kind but oh how dear their memory i pay what pleasures past can present cares allay of all i love for ever dispossessed ah what avails to think i once was blessed hard disposition of unequal fate mixed are our joys and transient are their date nor can reflection bring them back again yet brings an aftersting to every pain thy fatal letters oh immoral youth those perjured pledges of fictitious truth dear as they were no second joy afford my credlous heart once leaped at every word my glowing bosom throbbd with thickheavd sighs and floods of rapture gushed into my eyes when now repeated for thy theft was vain each treasured syllable my thoughts retain far other passions rule and different care my joys and grief my transports and despair why do thou mock the ties of constant love but half its joys the faithless ever prove they only taste the pleasures they receive when sure the noblest is in those we give acceptance is the heaven which mortals know but it is the bliss of angels to bestow oh emulate my love that task divine be thou that angel and that heaven be mine yet yet relent yet intercept my fate alas i rave and sue for new deceit as soon the dead shall from the grave return as love extinguished with new ardor burn oh that i dared to act a roman part and stab thy image in this faithful heart where riveted for life secure you reign a cruel inmate author of my pain but cowardlike irresolute i wait times tardy aid nor dare to rush on fate perhaps may linger on lifes latest stage survive thy cruelties and fall by age no  grief shall swell my sails and speed me over despair my pilot to that quiet shore where i can trust and thou betray no more might i but once again behold thy charms might i but breathe my last in those dear arms on that loved face but fix my closing eye permitted where i might not live to die my softened fate i would accuse no more but fate has no such happiness in store it is past it is done  what gleam of hope behind when i can never be false nor thou be kind why then this care  it is weak  it is vain  farewell  at that last word what agonies i feel i faint  i die  remember i was true  it is all i ask  eternally  adieu  flora to pompey by the same pompey when he was very young fell in love with flora a roman courtezan who was so very beautiful that the romans had her painted to adorn the temple of castor and pollux geminius  pompeys friend afterward fell in love with her too but she prepossessed with a passion for pompey would not listen to geminius pompey in compassion to his friend yielded him his mistress which flora took so much to heart that she fell dangerously ill upon it and in that sickness is supposed to write the following letter to pompey  ere death these closing eyes for ever shade that death thy cruelties have welcome made receive thou yet loved man this one adieu this last farewell to happiness and you my eyes overflow with tears my trembling hand can scarce the letters form or pen command the dancing paper swims before my sight and scarce myself can read the words i write think you behold me in this lost estate and think yourself the author of my fate how vast the change your floras now become the general pity not the boast of rome this form a pattern to the sculptors art this face the idol once of pompeys heart whose pictured beauties rome thought fit to place the sacred temples of her gods to grace are charming now no more the bloom is fled the lillies languid and the roses dead soon shall some hand the glorious work deface where grecian pencils tell what flora was no longer my resemblance they impart they lost their likeness when i lost thy heart oh that those hours could take their turn again when pompey laboring with a jealous pain his flora thus bespoke say my dear love shall all these rivals unsuccessful prove in vain for ever shall the roman youth envy my happiness and tempt thy truth shall neither tears nor prayers thy pity move ah give not pity it is akin to love would flora were not fair in such excess that i might fear though not adore her less fool that i was i sought to ease that grief nor knew indiffrence followed the relief experience taught the cruel truth too late i never dreaded till i found my fate twas mine to ask if pompeys self could hear unmoved his rivals unsuccessful prayer to make thee swear he would not thy pity move alas such pity is no kin to love twas thou thyself ungrateful as thou art bade me unbend the rigor of my heart you chid my faith reproached my being true unnatral thought and labored to subdue the constancy my soul maintained for you to other arms your mistress you condemned too cool a lover and too warm a friend how could thou thus my lavish heart abuse to ask the only thing it could refuse nor yet upbraid me pompey what i say for it is my merit that i cannot obey yet this alleged against me as a fault thy rage fomented and my ruin wrought just gods what tie what conduct can prevail over fickle man when truth like mine can fail urge not to gloss thy crime the name of friend we know how far those sacred laws extend since other heroes have not blushed to prove how weak all passions when opposed to love nor boast the virtuous conflict of thy heart when generous pity took geminius part it is all heroic fraud and roman art such flights of honor might amuse the crowd but by a mistress never can be allowed keep for the senate and the grave debate that infamous hypocrisy of state there words are virtue and your trade deceit no riddle is thy change nor hard to explain flora was fond and pompey was a man no longer then a specious tale pretend nor plead fictitious merit to your friend by nature false you followed her decree nor generous are to him but false to me you say you melted at geminius tears you say you felt his agonizing cares gross artifice that this from him could move and not from flora whom you say you love you could not bear to hear your rival sigh yet bear unmoved to see your mistress die inhuman hypocrite not thus can he my wrongs and my distress obdurate see he who received condemns the gift you made and joins with me the giver to upbraid forgetting he is obliged and mourning i am betrayed he loves too well that cruel gift to use which pompey loved too little to refuse fain would he call my vagrant lord again but i the kind ambassador restrain i scorn to let another take my part and to myself will owe or lose thy heart can nothing ever rekindle love in thee can nothing ever extinguish it in me that i could tear thee from this injured breast and where you gave my person give the rest at once to grant and punish thy request that i could place thy worthy rival there no second insult need my fondness fear he views not flora with her pompeys eyes he loves like me he doats despairs and dies come to my arms thou dear deserving youth thou prodigy of man thou man with truth for him i will redouble every care to please for him these faded charms repair to crown his vows and sharpen thy despair oh it is illusion all and idle rage no second passion can this heart engage and shortly pompey shall thy flora prove death may dissolve but nothing change her love arisbe to marius junior from fontenelle by the same when marius was expelled from rome by syllas faction and retired into africa his son who accompanied him fell into the hands of hiempsal king of numidia who kept him prisoner one of the mistresses of that king fell in love with marius junior and was so generous to contrive and give him his liberty though by that means she sacrificed her love for ever twas after he had rejoined his father that she writ him the following letter  i of all i valued all i loved bereft say has my heart this little comfort left that you the memory of its truth retain and think with grateful pity on my pain ii though but with life my sorrows can have end for death alone can join me to my friend yet think not i repent i set you free i mourn your absence not your liberty iii before my marius left numidias coast each day i saw him scarce an hour was lost now months and years must pass nay life shall prove but one long absence from the man i love iv painful reflection poison to my mind was it but mortal too it would be kind but mad with grief i search the palace round and in that madness dream youre to be found v would thou believe it to those walls i fly where thou were captive held there frantic cry these fetters sure my vagrants flight restrained alas these fetters i myself unchaind vi the livelong day i mourn i loath the light and wait impatient each returning night what though the horrid gloom augment my grief it is grateful still for i disclaim relief vii that cozner hope intrudes not on my woe one only interval my sorrows know when dreams the kind reversers of my pain bring back my charming fugitive again viii yet there is a grief surpassing all the rest a jealous demon whispers in my breast marius was false for liberty alone the show of love the hypocrite put on ix then i reflect ah would i could forget how much your thoughts on war and rome were set how little passion did that conduct prove too strong thy reason but too weak thy love x thy sword it is true a fathers cause demands but twas a mistress gave it to thy hands to love and duty just give each their part his be the arm and mine be all thy heart xi but what avail these thoughts fond wretch give over marius or false or true is thine no more since fate has cast the lot and we must part why should i wish to think i had his heart xii yes let me cherish that remembrance still that thought alone shall soften every ill to tell my soul his love his truth was such all was his due nor have i done too much xiii deceitful comfort let me not persuade my credlous heart its fondness was repaid it makes my soul with double anguish mourn those joys which never never must return xiv perhaps even you what most i wish oppose and in the roman all the lover lose i am a numidian and your soul disdains to bear the inglorious weight of foreign chains xv can any climate then so barbarous prove to stand excluded from the laws of love his empires universal unconfined his proxy beauty and his slaves mankind xvi nor am i a numidian but by name for i can interest for my love disclaim my virtue shows what twas the gods designed by chance on africks clay they stamped a roman mind xvii not all the heroes which your rome can boast so much for fame as i for you have lost yourself i lost oh grateful then confess my trial greater though my glory less xviii yes partial gods inflicters of my care be witness what i felt what grief what fear when full of stifled woes the night he fled no sigh i dared to breathe no tear to shed xix whilst men of faith approved a chosen crew firm to their trust and to their mistress true with care too punctual my commands obey and in one freight my life and thee convey xx the harder task was mine condemned to bear with brow serene my agonizing care to mix in idle talk to force a smile a king and jealous lover to beguile xxi think in that dreadful interval of fate all i held dear thy safety in debate think what i suffered whilst my heart afraid suggests a thousand times that all is betrayed xxii a thousand times revolving in my mind the doubtful chance oh love said i be kind propitious to my scheme thy votry aid and be my fondness by success repaid xxiii now bolder grown with sanguine hopes elate my fancy represents thy smiling fate the guards deceived and every danger over the winds already waft him from the shore xxiv these pleasing images anew impart life to my eyes and gladness to my heart dispel the gloomy fears that cloud my face and charm the little flutterer to peace xxv but now the king or tasteless to my charms or weary of an absent mistress arms his own apartment seeks and grateful rest that courted stranger to the careful breast xxvi whilst i by hopes and fears alternate swayed impatient ask the slaves if i am obeyed it is done they cried and struck me with despair for what i longed to know i died to hear xxvii fantastic turn of a distracted mind i blamed the gods for having been too kind cursed the success they granted to my vows and this assistant hand that filled my woes xxviii such was my frenzy in that hour of care and such the injustice of my bold despair that even those ungrateful i upbraid whose fatal diligence my will obeyed xxix scarce marius did thyself escape my rage most loved of men when fears of black presage describe thy heart so fond of liberty it never gave one parting throb for me xxx at every step you should have turned your eye dropped a regretful tear and heaved a sigh the nature of the grace i showed was such you not deserved it if it pleased too much xxxi a lover would have lingered as he fled and often in anguish to himself have said farewell for ever ah yet more he would done a lover never would have fled alone xxxii to force me from a hated rivals bed why comes not marius at an armys head oh did thy heart but wish to see that

her marius lost roxana to philocles from les letters persannes by the same roxana one of usbecks wives was found whilst he was in europe in bed with her lover whom she had privately let into the seraglio the guardian eunuch who discovered them had the man murdered on the spot and her close guarded till he received instructions from his master how to dispose of her during that interval she swallowed poison and is supposed to write the following letter whilst she is dying  think not i write my innocence to prove to sue for pity or awake thy love no mean defense expect or abject prayers thou know no mercy and i know no tears i laugh at all thy vengeance has decreed avow the fact and glory in the deed yes tyrant i deceived thy spies and thee pleased in oppression and in bondage free the rigid agents of thy cruel laws by gold i won to aid my juster cause with dextrous skill eluded all thy care and acted more than jealousy could fear to wanton bowers this prisonhouse i turned and blessed that absence which you thought i mourned but short those joys allowed by niggard fate yet so refined so exquisitely great that their excess compensated their date i die already in each burning vein i feel the poisonous draught and bless the pain for what is life unless its joys we prove and where is joy deprived of what we love yet ere i die this justice i have paid to my dear murdered lovers injured shade those sacrilegious instruments of power who wrought that ruin these sad eyes deplore already with their blood their crimes atone and for his life have sacrificed their own thee though restraint and absence may defend from my revenge my curses still attend despair like mine barbarian be thy part remorse afflict and sorrow sting thy heart nor think this hate commencing in my breast though prudence long its latent force suppressed i knew those wrongs that i was forced to bear and cursed those chains injustice made me wear for could thou hope roxana to deceive with idle tales which only fools believe poor abject souls in superstition bred in ignorance trained by prejudice misled whom hireling dervises by proxy teach from those whose false prerogative they preach did thou imagine me so weak of mind because i murmured not i never repined but hugged my chain and thought my jailer kind that willingly those laws i ever obeyed which pride invented and oppression made and whilst selflicensd through the world you rove to quicken appetite by change in love each passion sated and each wish possessed that lust can urge or fancy can suggest that i should mourn thy loss with fond regret weep the misfortune and the wrong forget could i believe that heaven this beauty gave thy transient pleasure and thy lasting flave indud with reason only to fulfill the harsh commands of thy capricious will no usbeck no my soul difdaind those laws and though i wanted power to assert my cause my right i knew and still those pleasures sought which justice warranted and nature taught on customs senfeless precepts i refined i weighed what heaven i knew what man designed and formed by her own rules my freeborn mind thus whilst this wretched body owned thy power doomed unredressd its hardships to deplore my soul subservient to herself alone and reason independent on her throne contemned thy dictates and obeyed their own yet thus far to my conduct thanks are due at least i condescended to seem true endeavored still my sentiments to hide indulged thy vanity and soothed thy pride though this submission to a tyrant paid whom not my duty but my fears obeyed if rightly weighed would more deserve thy blame who call it virtue but profane her name for to the world i should have owned that love which all impartial judges must approve you urged a right to tyrannize my heart which he soliciting assailed by art whilst i impatient of the name of slave to force refused what i to merit gave often as thy slaves this wretched body led to the detested pleasures of thy bed in those soft moments consecrate to joy which extacy and transport should employ clasped in your arms you wondered still to find so cold my kisses so composed my mind but had thy cheated eyes discerned aright you would found aversion where you sought delight not that my soul incapable of love no charms could warm no tenderness could move for him whose love my every thought possessed a fiercer passion filled this constant breast than truth ever felt or falsehood ever professed this style unusual to thy pride appears for truths a stranger to the tyrants ears but what have i to manage or to dread nor threats alarm nor insults hurt the dead no wrongs they feel no miseries they find cares are the legacies we leave behind in the calm grave no usbecks we deplore no tyrant husband no oppressive power alas i faint  death intercepts the rest the venomed drug is busy in my breast each nerves unstrung a mist obscures the day my senses strength and even my hate decay though rage a while the ebbing spirits stayed it is past  they sink beneath the transient aid take then inhuman wretch my last farewell pain be thy portion here hereafter hell and when our prophet shall my fate decree be any curse my punishment but thee epilogue designed for sophonisba and to have been spoken by mrs oldfield by the same before you sign poor sophonisbas doom in her behalf petitioner i come not but our author knows whatever i say that i could find objections to his play this double marriage for her countrys good i told him never would be understood and that ye all would say twas flesh and blood had carthage only been in madams head her champion never had been in her  bed for could the idiot think a husbands name would make him quit his interest friends and fame that he would risque a kingdom for a wife and act dependent in a place for life yet what stern cato shall condemn the fair whilst public good she thundered in your ear if private interest had a little share you know she acted not against the laws of those oldfashioned times that in her cause old syphax could no longer make a stand and massinissa wooed her sword in hand but did she take the way to whet that sword

imitation of the eleventh ode of the first book of horace by the same forbear my dear stephen with a fruitless desire into truths which are better concealed to enquire perhaps many years are allowed us by fate or next winter perhaps is the last of their date let the credulous fools whom astrologers cheat exult or despond as they vary deceit who anticipate care their own pleasure destroy and invite disappointment who build upon joy all ills unforeseen we the easiest endure what avails to foresee unless foresight could cure and from ills by their art how can wretches be freed when that art must be false or those ills be decreed from reflection and hope little comfort we find to possession alone let thy thoughts be confined todays all the treasure poor mortals can boast for tomorrows not gained and yesterdays lost even now whilst i write time steals on our youth and a moments cut off from thy friendship and truth then seize the swift blessing enjoy the dear now and take not expect what hereafterll bestow a love letter by the same what shall i say to fix thy wavering mind to chase thy doubts and force thee to be kind what weight of argument can turn the scale if intercession from a lover fail by what shall i conjure thee to obey this tender summons nor prolong thy stay if unabated in this constant breast that passion burns which once thy vows professed if absence has not chilled the languid flame its ardour and its purity the same indulge those transports and no more control the dictates of thy fond consenting soul by no vain scruple be thy purpose swayed and only love implicitly obeyed let inclination this debate decide nor be thy prudence but thy heart thy guide but real prudence never can oppose what love suggests and gratitude avows the warm dear raptures which thy bosom move it is virtue to indulge it is wisdom to improve for think how few the joys allowed by fate how mixed the cup how short their longest date how onward still the stream of pleasure flows that no reflux the rapid current knows not even thy charms can bribe the ruthless hand of rigid time to stay his ebbing sand fair as thou art that beauty must decay the night of age succeeds the brightest day that cheek where natures sweetest garden blows her whitest lily and her warmest rose those eyes those meaning ministers of love who what thy lips can only utter prove these must resign their luster those their bloom and find with meaner charms one common doom pass but a few short years this change must be nor one less dreadful shall thou mourn in me for though no chance can alienate my flame while thine to feed the lamp shall burn the same yet shall the stream of years abate that fire and cold esteem succeed to warm desire then on thy breast unrapturd shall i dwell nor feel a joy beyond what i can tell or say should sickness antedate that woe and intercept what time would else allow if pain should pall my taste to all thy charms or death himself should tear me from thy arms how would thou then regret with fruitless truth the precious squandered hours of health and youth come then my love nor trust the future day live whilst we can be happy whilst we may for what is life unless its joys we prove and what is happiness but mutual love our time is wealth no frugal hand can store all our possession is the present hour and he who spares to use it ever poor the golden now is all that we can boast and that like snow at once is grasped and lost haste wing thy passage then no more delay but to these eyes their sole delight convey not thus i languishd for thy virgin charms when first surrendered to these eager arms when first admitted to that heaven thy breast to mine i strained that charming foe to rest how leaps my conscious heart whilst i retrace the dear idea of that strict embrace when on thy bosom quite entranced i lay and loved unsated the short night away whilst half reluctant you and half resigned amidst fears wishes pain and pleasure joined now holding off now growing to my breast by turns reproved me and by turns caressed oh how remembrance throbs in every vein i pant i sicken for that scene again my senses ach i can no word command and the pen

thy relics wait the inspiring nine for sure i said where maros ashes sleep the weeping muses must their vigils keep still over their favrites monument they mourn and with poetic tropies grace his urn have placed the shield and martial trumpet here the shepherds pipe and rural honors there fancy had decked the consecrated ground and scattered neverfading roses round and now my bold romantic thought aspires to hear the echo of celestial lyres then catch some sound to bear delighted home and boast i learnt the verse at virgils tomb or stretched beneath thy myrtles fragrant shade with dreams extatic hovering over my head see forms august and laureled ghosts ascend and with thyself perhaps the long procession end i came  but soon the phantoms disappeared far other scenes than wanton hope

voice but birds obscene in horrid notes rejoice fancy recoiled and with his tinsel train forsook the chearless scene no more remain the warm ambitions hopes of airy youth severe reflection came and frowning truth away each glittering gay idea fled and bade a melancholy train succeed that formed or seemed to form a mournful call in feeble echoes muttring round the wall seek not the muses here the affrighted maids have fled parthenopes polluted shades her happy shores the seats of joy and ease their favorite mansions once no longer please no longer as of old in transport lost the sisters rove along the enchanted coast they turn with horror from each muchloved stream and loath the fields that were their darling theme the tuneful names themselves once fondly gave to every swelling hill and mossy cave so pleasing then are only heard with sighs and each sad echo bids their sorrow rise yet nature smiles as when their virgil sung nor midst a fairer scene his lyre was strung still bloom the sweets of his elysium here and the same charms in every grove appear but ah in vain indulgent suns prevail health and delight in every balmy gale are wafted now in vain small comfort bring to weeping eyes the beauties of the spring to groaning slaves those fragrant meads belong where tully dictated and maro sung long since alas those golden days are flown when here each science wore its proper crown pale tyranny has laid their altars low and rent the laurel from the muses brow what wonder then midst such a scene to see the arts expire with bleeding liberty pensive and sad each fair angelic

of contented swains the songs of love of liberty and peace are heard no more the dance and tabor cease to the soft oaten pipe and pastral reed the din of arms and clarions blast succeed dire shapes

order of his mistress columbel after having served the ladies for a year he was sent out a second time not to return till he could find three hundred women incapable of yielding to any temptation the bad success he met with in the course of three years which is slightly touched upon by spenser is the foundation of the following poem  prologue i hard is the heart that never knew to love ne felt the pleasing anguish of desire ye british maids more fair than venus dove for you alone i tune my humble lyre adopt me nymphs receive me in your quire make me your bard for that is all my care then shall

minstrelsy listening to their sacred lore i think on ages long past over when truth and virtue hand in hand walked upon the smiling land thence my eyes on britain glance and awakened from my trance while my busy thoughts i rear often i wipe the falling tear when the night again descends and her shadowy cone extends over the fields i walk alone by the silence of the moon hark upon my left i hear

their revels leave no trace save the ring upon the grass when the elphin show is fled home i haste me to my bed there if thou with magic wand on my temples take thy stand i see in mixed disorder rise all that struck my waking eyes so when i stand and round me gaze where the famed lodona strays on the woods and thickets brown that its sedgy margin crown and watch the vagrant clouds that fly through

schemes nor all deceived ambitions feverish dreams lure his contented heart from the sweet vale of ease the pleasures of melancholy written in the year      by the rev mr thomas warton mother of musings contemplation sage whose grotto stands upon the topmost rock of teneriff mid the tempestuous night on which in calmest meditation held thou hearst with howling winds the beating rain and drifting hail descend or if the skies unclouded shine and through the blue serene pale cynthia rolls her silveraxled car whence gazing steadfast on the spangled vault raptured thou sitst while murmurs indistinct of distant billows sooth thy pensive ear with hoarse and hollow sounds secure selfblest there often thou listenst to the wild uproar of fleets encountring that in whispers low ascends the rocky summit where thou dwellst remote from man conversing with the spheres o lead me queen sublime to solemn glooms congenial with my soul to chearless shades to ruined seats to twilight cells and bowers where thoughtful melancholy loves to muse her favorite midnight haunts the laughing scenes of purple spring where all the wanton train of smiles and graces seem to lead the dance in sportive round while from their hands they shower ambrosial blooms and flowers no longer charm tempe no more i court thy balmy breeze adieu green vales ye broiderd meads adieu beneath yon ruined abbeys mossgrown piles often let me sit at twilight hour of eve where through some western window the pale moon pours her longlevelld rule of streaming light while sullen sacred silence reigns around save the lone screechowls note who builds his bower amid the mouldering caverns dark and damp or the calm breeze that rustles in the leaves of flaunting ivy that with mantle green invests some wasted tower or let me tread its neighboring walk of pines where mused of old the cloistered brothers through the gloomy void that far extends beneath their ample arch as on i pace religious horror wraps my soul in dread repose but when the world is clad in midnights ravencolourd robe mid hollow charnel let me watch the flame of taper dim shedding a livid glare over the wan heaps while airy voices talk along the glimmering walls or ghostly shape at distance seen invites with beckning hand my lonesome steps through the farwinding vaults nor undelightful is the solemn noon of night when happily wakeful from my couch i start lo all is motionless around roars not the rushing wind the sons of men and every beast in mute oblivion lie all natures hushed in silence and in sleep o then how fearful is it to reflect that through the still globes aweful solitude no being wakes but me till stealing sleep my drooping temples bathes in opiate dews nor then let dreams of wanton folly born my senses lead through flowery paths of joy but let the sacred genius of the night such mystic visions send as spenser saw when through bewildring fancys magic maze to the fell house of busyrane he led the unshaken britomart or milton knew when in abstracted thought he first conceived all heaven in tumult and the seraphim come towering armed in adamant and gold let others love soft summers evening smiles as listening to the distant waterfall they mark the blushes of the streaky west i choose the pale decembers foggy glooms then when the sullen shades of evening close where through the room a blindlyglimmring gleam the dying embers scatter far remote from mirths mad shouts that through the illumined roof resound with festive echo let me sit blessed with the lowly crickets drowsy dirge then let my thought contemplative explore this fleeting state of things the vain delights the fruitless toils that still our search elude as through the wilderness of life we rove this sober hour of silence will unmask false follys smile that like the dazzling spells of wily comus cheat the unweeting eye with blear illusion and persuade to drink that charmed cup which reasons mintage fair unmoulds and stamps the monster on the man eager we taste but in the luscious draught forget the poisonous dregs that lurk beneath few know that elegance of soul resind whose soft sensation feels a quicker joy from melancholys scenes than the dull pride of tasteless splendour and magnificence can ever afford thus eloise whose mind had languishd to the pangs of melting love more genuine transport found as on some tomb reclined she watched the tapers of the dead or through the pillard isles amid pale shrines of imagd saints and intermingled graves mused a veiled votaress than flavia feels as through the mazes of the festive ball proud of her conquering charms and beautys blaze she floats amid the silken sons of dress and shines the fairest of the assembled fair when azure noontide chears the daedal globe and the blessed regent of the golden day rejoices in his bright meridian bower how often my wishes ask the nights return that best befriends the melancholy mind hail sacred night thou too shall share my song sister of ebonscepterd hecat hail whether in congregated clouds thou wrapst thy viewless chariot or with silver crown thy beaming head encirclest ever hail what though beneath thy gloom the sorceresstrain far in obscured haunt of laplandmoors with rhymes uncouth the bloody cauldron bless though murder wan beneath thy shrouding shade summons her sloweyd votries to devise of secret slaughter while by one blue lamp in hideous confrence sits the listening band and start at each low wind or wakeful sound what though thy stay the pilgrim curses often as all benighted in arabian wastes he hears the wilderness around him howl with roaming monsters while on his hoar head the blackdescending tempest ceaseless beats yet more delightsul to my pensive mind is thy return than bloomy morns approach even then in youthful pride of opening may when from the portals of the saffron east she sheds fresh roses and ambrosial dews yet not ungrateful is the morns approach when dropping wet she comes and clad in clouds while through the damp air scowls the louring south blackening the landscapes face that grove and hill in formless vapors undistinguished swim the afflicted songsters of the saddend groves hail not the sullen gloom the waving elms that hoar through time and ranged in thick array enclose with stately row some rural hall are mute nor echo with the clamors hoarse of rooks rejoicing on their airy boughs while to the shed the dripping poultry crowd a mournful train secure the villagehind hangs over the crackling blaze nor tempts the storm fixed in the unfinished furrow rests the plough rings not the high wood with enlivening shouts of early hunter all is silence drear and deepest sadness wraps the face of things through popes soft song though all the graces breathe and happiest art adorn his attic page yet does my mind with sweeter transport glow as at the root of mossy trunk reclined in magic spensers wildlywarbled song i see deserted una wander wide through wasteful solitudes and lurid heaths weary forlorn than when the belinda see rape of the lock fated fair upon the bosom bright of silver thames launches in all the luster of brocade amid the splendors of the laughing sun the gay description palls upon the sense and coldly strikes the mind with feeble bliss ye youths of albions beautyblooming isle whose brows have worn the wreath of luckless love is there a pleasure like the pensive mood whose magic wont to sooth your softened souls o tell how rapturous the joy to melt to melodys assuasive voice to bend the uncertain step along the midnight mead and pour your sorrows to the pitying moon by many a slow trill from the bird of woe often interrupted in embowering woods by darksome brook to muse and there forget the solemn dullness of the tedious world while fancy grasps the visionary fair and now no more the abstracted ear attends the waters murmuring lapse the entranced eye pierces no longer through the extended rows of thickrangd trees till happily from the depth the woodmans stroke or distanttinkling team or heifer rustling through the brake alarms the illuded sense and mars the golden dream these are delights that absence drear has made familiar to my soul ever since the form of young sapphira beauteous as the spring when from her viletwoven couch awaked by frolic zephyrs hand her tender cheek graceful she lifts and blushing from her bower issues to cloth in gladsomeglistring green the genial globe first met my dazzled sight these are delights unknown to minds profane and which alone the pensive soul can taste the taperd choir at the late hour of prayer often let me tread while to the according voice the manysounding organ peals on high the clear slowdittied chaunt or varied hymn till all my soul is bathed in ecstasies and lapd in paradise or let me sit far in sequestered isles of the deep dome there lonesome listen to the sacred sounds which as they lengthen through the gothic vaults in hollow murmurs reach my ravished ear nor when the lamps expiring yield to night and solitude returns would i forsake the solemn mansion but attentive mark the due clock swinging slow with sweepy sway measuring times slight with momentary sound nor let me fail to cultivate my mind with the soft thrillings of the tragic muse divine melpomene sweet pitys nurse queen of the stately step and flowing pall now let monimia mourn with streaming eyes her joys incestuous and polluted love now let soft juliet in the gaping tomb print the last kiss on her true romeos lips his lips yet reeking from the deadly draught or jaffeir kneel for one forgiving look nor seldom let the moor on desdemone pour the misguided threats of jealous rage by soft degrees the manly torrent steals from my swollen eyes and at a brothers woe my big heart melts in sympathizing tears what are the splendors of the gaudy court its tinsel trappings and its pageant pomps to me far happier seems the banished lord amid siberias unrejoycing wilds who pines all lonesome in the chambers hoar of some high castle shut whose windows dim in distant ken discover trackless plains where winter ever whirls his icy car while still repeated objects of his view the gloomy battlements and ivied spires that crown the solitary dome arise while from the topmost turret the slow clock far heard along the inhospitable wastes with sadreturning chime awakes new grief even he far happier seems than is the proud the potent satrap whom he left behind mid moscows golden palaces to drown in ease and luxury the laughing hours illustrious objects strike the gazers mind with feeble bliss and but allure the sight nor rouse with impulse quick the unfeeling heart thus seen by shepherd from hymettus brow what daedal landscapes smile here palmy groves resounding once with platos voice arise amid whose umbrage green her silver head the unfading olive lifts here vineclad hills lay forth their purple store and sunny vales in prospect vast their level laps expand amid whose beauties glistering athens towers though through the blissful scenes ilissus roll his sageinspiring flood whose winding marge the thickwove laurel shades though roseate morn pour all her splendors on the empurpled scene yet feels the hoary hermit truer joys as from the cliff that over his cavern hangs he views the piles of fallen persepolis in deep arrangement hide the darksome plain unbounded waste the mouldering obelise here like a blasted oak ascends the clouds here parian domes their vaulted halls disclose horrid with thorn where lurks the unpitying thief whence flits the twilightloving bat at eve and the deaf adder wreathes her spotted train the dwellings once of elegance and art here temples rise amid whose hallowed bounds spires the black pine while through the naked street once haunt of tradeful merchants springs the grass here columns heaped on prostrate columns torn from their firm base increase the mouldering mass far as the sight can pierce appear the spoils of sunk magnificence a blended scene of moles fanes arches domes and palaces where with his brother horror ruin sits o come then melancholy queen of thought o come with saintly look and steadfast step from forth thy cave embowerd with mournful yew where ever to the curfeus solemn sound listening thou sittst and with thy cypress bind thy votarys hair and seal him for thy son but never let euphrosyne beguile with toys of wanton mirth my fixed mind nor in my path her primrosegarland cast though mid her train the dimpled hebe bare her rosy bosom to the enamored view though venus mother of the smiles and loves and bacchus ivycrownd in citronbowr with her on nectarstreaming fruitage feast what though it is here is to calm the lowering skies and at her presence mild the embatteld clouds disperse in air and over the face of heaven new day diffusive gleam at her approach yet are these joys that melancholy gives than all her witless revels happier far these deepfelt joys by contemplation taught then ever beauteous contemplation hail from thee began auspicious maid my song with thee shall end for thou art fairer far than are the nymphs of cirrhas mossy grot to loftier rapture thou can wake the thought than all the fabling poets boasted powers hail queen divine whom as tradition tells once in his evningwalk a druid found far in a hollow glade

rejoice and aged elms with awful bend in long cathedral walks extend lulled by the lapse of gliding floods cheered by the warbling of the woods how blessed my days my thoughts how free in sweet

can the painters utmost skill instruct one flower to please us more as vain it were with artful dye to change the bloom thy cheeks disclose and oh may laura ere she try with fresh vermilion paint the rose hark how the woodlarks tuneful throat can every studied grace excel let art constrain the rambling note and will she laura please so well oh ever keep thy native ease by no pedantic laws confined for lauras voice is formed to please so lauras words be not unkind ode to memory      by william shenstone esquire i o memory celestial maid who gleanst the flowerets cropped by time and suffering not a leaf to fade preservst the blossoms of our prime bring bring those moments to my mind when life was new and lesbia kind ii and bring that garland to my sight with which my favored crook she bound and bring that wreath of roses bright which then my festive temples crowned and to my raptured ear convey the gentle things she deigned to say iii and sketch with care the muses bower where isis rolls her silver tide nor yet omit one reed or flower that shines on cherwells verdant side if so thou may those hours prolong when polished lycon joined my song iv the song it vails not to recite  but sure to sooth our youthful dreams those banks and streams appeared more bright than other banks than other streams or by thy softening pencil shown assume they beauties not their own v and paint that sweetly vacant scene when all beneath the poplar bough my spirits light my soul serene i breathed in verse one cordial vow that nothing should my soul inspire but friendship warm and love entire vi dull to the sense of new delight on thee the drooping muse attends as some fond lover robbed of sight on thy expressive power depends nor would exchange thy glowing lines to live the lord of all that shines vii but let me chase those vows away which at ambitions shrine i made nor ever let thy skill display those anxious moments ill repaid oh from my breast that season raze and bring my childhood in its place viii bring me the bells the rattle bring and bring the hobby i bestrode when pleased in many a sportive ring around the room i jovial rode even let me bid my lyre adieu and bring the whistle that i blew ix then will i muse and pensive say why did not these enjoyments last how sweetly wasted i the day while innocence allowed to waste ambitions toils alike are vain but ah for pleasure yield us pain the princess elizabeth a ballad alluding to a story recorded of her when she was a prisoner at woodstock      by the same will you hear how once repining great eliza captive lay each ambitious thought resigning foe to riches pomp and sway while the nymphs and swains delighted tript around in all their pride envying joys by others slighted thus the royal maiden cried bred on plains or born in valleys who would bid those scenes adieu stranger to the arts of malice who would ever courts pursue malice never taught to treasure censure never taught to bear love is all the shepherds pleasure love is all the damsels care how can they of humble station vainly blame the powers above or accuse the dispensation which allows them all to love love like air is widely given power nor chance can these restrain truest noblest gifts of heaven only purest on the plain peers can no such charms discover all in stars and garters dressed as on sundays does the lover with his nosegay on his breast pinks and roses in profusion said to fade when chloes near fops may use the same allusion but the shepherd is sincere hark to yonder milkmaid singing chearly over the brimming pail cowslips all around her springing sweetly paint the golden vale never yet did courtly maiden move so sprightly look so fair never breast with jewels laden pour a song so void of care would indulgent heaven had granted me some rural damsels part all the empire i had wanted then had been my shepherds heart then with him over hills and mountains free from fetters might i rove fearless taste the crystal fountains peaceful sleep beneath the grove rusticks had been more forgiving partial to my virgin bloom none had envied me when living none had triumphed over my tomb verses written toward the close of the year      to william lyttelton esquire by the same how blithely passed the summers day how bright was every flower while friends arrived in circles gay to visit damons bower but now with silent step i range along some lonely shore and damons bower alas the change is gay with friends no more away to crowds and cities borne in quest of joy they steer whilst i alas am left forlorn to weep the parting year o pensive autumn how i grieve thy sorrowing face to see when languid suns are taking leave of every drooping tree ah let me not with heavy eye this dying scene survey haste winter haste usurp the sky complete my bowrs decay ill can i bear the motley cast yon sickening leaves retain that speak at once of pleasure past and bode approaching pain at home unblest i gaze around my distant scenes require where all in murky vapors drowned are hamlet hill and spire though thomson sweet descriptive bard inspiring autumn sung yet how should we the months regard that stopped his flowing tongue ah luckless months of all the rest to whose hard share it fell for sure he was the gentlest breast that ever sung so well and see the swallows now disown the roofs they loved before each like his tuneful genius flown to glad some happier shore the woodnymph eyes with pale affright the sportsmans frantic deed while hounds and horns and yells unite to drown the muses reed ye fields with blighted herbage brown ye skies no longer blue too much we feel from fortunes frown to bear these frowns from you where is the meads unsullied green the zephyrs balmy gale and where sweet friendships cordial mien that brightened every vale what though the vine disclose her dies and boast her purple store not all the vineyards rich supplies can soothe our sorrows more he he is gone whose moral strain could wit and mirth refine he he is gone whose social vein surpassed the power of wine fast by the streams he deigned to praise in yon sequestered grove to him a votive urn i raise to him and friendly love yes there my friend forlorn and sad i grave your thomsons name and there his lyre which fate forbad to sound your growing fame there shall my plaintive song recount dark themes of hopeless woe and faster than the dropping fount i will teach mine eyes to flow there leaves in spite of autumn green shall shade the hallowed ground and spring will there again be seen to call forth flowers around but no kind suns will bid me share once more his social hour ah spring thou never can repair this loss to damons bower songs by the same i in a vale fringed with woodland where grottos abound and rivulets murmur and echoes resound i vowed to the muses my time and my care since neither could win me the smiles of my fair as freedom inspired me i ranged and i sung and daphnes dear name never fell from my tongue but if once a smooth accent delighted my ear i should wish unawares that my daphne might hear with fairest ideas my bosom i stored allusions to none but the nymph i adored and the more i with study my fancy refined the deeper impression she made on my mind ah whilst i the beauties of nature pursue i still must my daphnes fair image renew the graces have chosen with daphne to rove and the muses are all in alliance with love ii daphnes visit ye birds for whom i reared the grove with melting lay salute my love my daphne with your notes detain or i have reared my grove in vain ye flowers before her footsteps rise display at once your brightest dies that she your opening charms may see or what were all your charms to me kind zephyr brush each fragrant flower and shed its odours round my bower or never more o gentle wind shall i from thee refreshment find ye streams if ever your banks i loved it ever your native sounds improved may each soft murmur soothe my fair or oh twill deepen my despair and thou my grot whose lonely bounds the melancholy pine surrounds may daphne praise thy peaceful gloom or thou shall prove her damons tomb iii the rosebud see flavia see that budding rose how bright beneath the bush it glows how safely there it lurks concealed how quickly blasted when revealed the sun with warm attractive rays tempts it to wanton in the blaze a blast descends from eastern skies and all its blushing radiance dies then guard my fair your charms divine and check the fond desire to shine where fames transporting rays allure while here more happy more secure the breath of some neglected maid shall make you sigh you left the shade a breath to beautys bloom unkind as to the rose an eastern wind the nymph replied you first my swain confine your sonnets to the plain one envious tongue alike disarms you of your wit me of my charms what is unheard the tuneful thrill of what unknown the poets skill what unadmird a charming mien or what the roses blush unseen iv written in a collection of bacchanalian songs adieu ye jovial youths who join to plunge old care in floods of wine and as your dazzled eye balls roll descern him struggling in the bowl nor yet is hope so wholly flown nor yet is thought so tedious grown but limpid stream and shady tree retain as yet some sweets for me and see through yonder silent grove see yonder does my daphne rove with pride her footsteps i pursue and bid your frantic joys adieu the sole confusion i admire is that my daphnes eyes inspire i scorn the madness you approve and value reason next to love v imitated from the french yes these are the scenes where with iris i strayed but short was her sway for so lovely a maid in the bloom of her youth to a cloister she run in the bloom of her graces too fair for a nun illgrounded no doubt a devotion must prove so fatal to beauty so killing to love yes these are the meadows the shrubs and the plains once the scene of my pleasures the scene of my pains how many soft moments i spent in this grove how fair was my nymph and how fervent my love be still though my heart thine emotion give over remember the season of love is no more with her how i strayed amid fountains and bowers or loiterd behind and collected the flowers then breathless with ardor my fairone pursued and to think with what kindness my garland she viewed but be still my fond heart this emotion give over fain would thou forget thou must love her no more rural inscriptions by the same i on a roothouse here in cool grot and mossy cell we rural fayes and faeries dwell though rarely seen by mortal eye when the pale moon ascending high darts through yon limes her quivering beams we frisk it near these crystal streams her beams reflected from the wave afford the light our revels crave the turf with daisies broiderd over exceeds we wot the parian floor nor yet for artful strains we call but listen to the waters fall would you then taste our tranquil scene be sure your bosoms be serene devoid of hate devoid of strife devoid of all that poisons life and much it vails you in their place to graft the love of human race and tread with awe these favored bowers nor wound the shrubs nor bruise the flowers so may your path with sweets abound so may your couch with rest be crowned but harm betide the wayward swain who dares our hallowed haunts profane oberon  ii in a shady valley near a running water o let me haunt this peaceful shade nor let ambition ever invade the tenants of this leafy bower that shun her paths and slight her power hither the plaintive halcyon flies from social meads and open skies pleased by this rill her course to steer and hide her sapphire plumage here the trout bedropt with crimson stains forsakes the rivers proud domains forsakes the suns unwelcome gleam to lurk within this humble stream and sure i hear the naiad say flow flow my stream this devious way though lovely soft thy murmurs are thy waters lovely cool and fair flow gentle stream nor let the vain thy small unsullied stores disdain nor let the pensive sage repine whose latent course resembles thine iii on a small building in the gothic taste oyou that has in courtly bliss or toyse in fortunes giddye sphere do not too rashlye deem amysse of him that bydes contentid here nor yet disdeigne the russet stoale which over each careless lymbe he flyngs nor yet deryde the beechen bowl in which he quaffs the iymuid spryngs forgyne him if at eve or dawne devoyde of worldly carhe he stray or all beside some flowerye sawne he waste his inoffensive day so may he pardonne fraud and strife if such in courtiye haunt he see for faults there been in busye life from which these peaceful ennes are free a pastoral ballad in four parts written      by the same arbusta humilesque myricae virg i absence i ye shepherds so cheerful and gay whose flocks never carelessly roam should corydons happen to stray oh call the poor wanderers home allow me to muse and to sigh nor talk of the change that ye find none once was so watchful as i  i have left my dear phyllis behind ii now i know what it is to have strove with the torture of doubt and desire what it is to admire and to love and to leave her we love and admire ah lead forth my flock in the morn and the damps of each evening repel alas i am saint and sorlorn  i have bade my dear phyllis farewell iii since phyllis vouchsafed me a look i never once dreamt of my vine may i lose both my pipe and my crook if i knew of a kid that was mine i prized every hour that went by beyond all that had pleased me before but now they are past and i sigh and i grieve that i prized them no more iv but why do i languish in vain why wander thus pensively here oh why did i come from the plain where i fed on the smiles of my dear they tell me my favorite maid the pride of that valley is flown alas where with her i have strayed i could wander with pleasure alone v when forced the fair nymph to forego what anguish i felt at my heart yet i thought  but it might not be so  twas with pain that she saw me depart she gazed as i slowly withdrew my path i could hardly discern so sweetly she bade me adieu i thought that she bade me return vi the pilgrim that journeys all day to visit some fardistant shrine if he bear but a relic away is happy nor heard to repine thus widely removed from the fair where my vows my devotion i owe soft hope is the relic i bear and my solace wherever i go ii hope i my banks they are furnished with bees whose murmur invites one to sleep my grottos are shaded with trees and my hills are whiteover with sheep i seldom have met with a loss such health do my fountains bestow my fountains all bordered with moss where the harebells and violets grow ii not a pine in my grove is there seen but with tendrils of woodbine is bound not a beechs more beautiful green but a sweetbriar twines it around not my fields in the prime of the year more charms than my cattle unfold not a brook that is limpid and clear but it glitters with fishes of gold iii one would think she might like to retire to the bower i have labored to rear not a shrub that i heard her admire but i hasted and planted it there o how sudden the jessamin strove with the lilac to render it gay already it calls for my love to prune the wild branches away iv from the plains from the woodlands and groves what strains of wild melody flow how the nightingales warble their loves from thickets of roses that blow and when her bright form shall appear each bird shall harmoniously join in a concert so soft and so clear as  she may not be fond to resign v i have found out a gift for my fair i have found where the woodpigeons breed but let me that plunder forbear she will say twas a barbarous deed for he never could be true she averd who could rob a poor bird of its young and i loved her the more when i heard such tenderness fall from her tongue vi i have heard her with sweetness unfold how that pity was due to  a dove that it ever attended the bold and she called it the sister of love but her words such a pleasure convey so much i her accents adore let her speak and whatever she say methinks i should love her the more vii can a bosom so gentle remain unmoved when her corydon sighs will a nymph that is fond of the plain these plains and this valley despise dear regions of silence and shade soft scenes of contentment and ease where i could have pleasingly strayed if aught in her absence could please viii but where does my phyllida stray and where are her grots and her bowers are the groves and the valleys as gay and the shepherds as gentle as ours the groves may perhaps be as fair and the face of the valleys as fine the swains may in manners compare but their love is not equal to mine iii solicitude i why will you my passion reprove why term it a folly to grieve ere i show you the charms of my love she is fairer than you can believe with her mien she enamours the brave with her wit she engages the free with her modesty pleases the grave she is every way pleasing to me ii o you that have been of her train come and join in my amorous lays i could lay down my life for the swain that will sing but a song in her praise when he sings may the nymphs of the town come trooping and listen the while nay on him let not phyllida frown  but i cannot allow her to smile iii for when paridel tries in the dance any favor with phyllis to find o how with one trivial glance might she ruin the peace of my mind in ringlets he dresses his hair and his crook is bestudded around and his pipe  oh may phyllis beware of a magic there is in the sound iv it is his with mock passion to glow it is his in smooth tales to unfold how her face is as bright as the snow and her bosom be sure is as cold how the nightingales labor the strain with the notes of his charmer to vie how they vary their accents in vain repine at her triumphs and die v to the grove or the garden he strays and pillages every sweet then suiting the wreath to his lays he throws it at phylliss feet o phyllis he whispers more fair more sweet than the jessamins flower what are pinks in a morn to compare what is eglantine after a shower vi then the lily no longer is white then the rose is deprived of its bloom then the violets die with despite and the woodbines give up their perfume thus glide the soft numbers along and he fancies no shepherd his peer  yet i never should envy the song were not phyllis to lend it an ear vii let his crook be with hyacinths bound so phyllis the trophy despise let his forehead with laurels be crowned so they shine not in phylliss eyes the language that flows from the heart is a stranger to paridels tongue  yet may she beware of his art or sure i must envy the song iv disappointment i ye shepherds give ear to my lay and take no more heed of my sheep they have nothing to do but to stray i have nothing to do but to weep yet do not my folly reprove she was fair  and my passion begun she smiled  and i could not but love she is faithless  and i am undone ii perhaps i was void of all thought perhaps it was plain to foresee that a nymph so complete would be sought by a swain more engaging than me ah love every hope can inspire it banishes wisdom the while and the lip of the nymph we admire seems for ever adorned with a smile iii she is faithless and i am undone ye that witness the woes i endure let reason instruct you to shun what it cannot instruct you to cure beware how ye loiter in vain amid nymphs of an higher degree it is not for me to explain how fair and how fickle they be iv alas from the day that we met what hope of an end to my woes when i cannot endure to forget the glance that undid my repose yet time may diminish the pain the flower and the shrub and the tree which i reared for her pleasure in vain in time may have comfort for me v the sweets of a dewsprinkled rose the sound of a murmuring stream the peace which from solitude flows henceforth shall be corydons theme high transports are shown to the sight but we are not to find them our own fate never bestowed such delight as i with my phyllis had known vi o ye woods spread your branches apace to your deepest recesses i fly i would hide with the beasts of the chase i would vanish from every eye yet my reed shall resound through the grove with
