with pleasure on your features and traced in them the exact lineaments of your glorious ancestor sir john brand vulgarly called sir john pudding  though the corruption of our english orthography indulges some appearance of distinction between brand and braund yet in effect they are one and the same thing the ancient manor of brands alias braunds near kilburn in middlesex was the very manorhouse of sir john brand and is called brands to this day although at present it be in the possession of the family of marsh  what honors are therefore due to one who is in a direct male line an immediate descendant from the loins of that great man let this teach you to value your self this remind the world how much they owe to the family of the braunds more particularly to you who inherit

learned dissertation on dumpling its dignity antiquity etc the dumplingeaters are a race sprung partly from the old epicurean and partly from the peripatetic sect they were brought first into britain by julius caesar and finding it a land of plenty they wisely resolved never to go home again their doctrines are amphibious and composed party per pale of the two sects beforementioned from the peripatetics they derive their principle of walking as a proper method to digest a meal or create an appetite from the epicureans they maintain that all pleasures are comprehended in good eating and drinking and so readily were their opinions embraced that every day produced many proselytes and their numbers have from age to age increased prodigiously insomuch that our whole island is overrun with them at present eating and drinking are become so customary among us that we seem to have entirely forgot and laid aside the old fashion of fasting instead of having wine sold at apothecaries shops as formerly every street has two or three taverns in it least these dumplingeaters should faint by the way nay so zealous are they in the cause of bacchus that one of the chief among em has made a vow never to say his prayers till he has a tavern of his own in every street in london and in every market town in england what may we then in time expect since by insensible degrees their society is become so numerous and formidable that they are without number other bodies have their meetings but where can the dumplingeaters assemble what place large enough to contain em the bank india and south sea companies have their general courts the freemasons and the gormogons their chapters nay our friends the quakers have their yearly meetings and who would imagine any of these should be dumplingeaters but thus it is the dumplingeating doctrine has so far prevailed among em that they eat not only dumplings but puddings and those in no small quantities  the dumpling is indeed of more ancient institution and of foreign origin but alas what were those dumplings nothing but a few lentils sodden together moistened and cemented with a little seethd fat not much unlike our gritt or oatmeal pudding yet were they of such esteem among the ancient romans that a statue was erected to fulvius agricola the first inventor of these lentil dumplings how unlike the gratitude shown by the public to our modern projectors  the romans though our conquerors found themselves much outdone in dumplings by our forefathers the roman dumplings were no more to compare to those made by the britons than a stonedumpling is to a marrow pudding though indeed the british dumpling at that time was little better than what we call a stonedumpling being no thing else but flour and water but every generation growing wiser and wiser the project was improved and dumpling grew to be pudding one projector found milk better than water another introduced butter some added marrow others plumbs and some found out the use of sugar so that to speak truth we know not where to fix the genealogy or chronology of any of these pudding projectors to the reproach of our historians who eat so much pudding yet have been so ungrateful to the first professors of this most noble science as not to find em a place in history  the invention of eggs was merely accidental two or three of which having casually rolled from off a shelf into a pudding which a good wife was making she found herself under a necessity either of throwing away her pudding or letting the eggs remain but concluding from the innocent quality of the eggs that they would do no hurt if they did no good she wisely jumbld em all together after having carefully picked out the shells the consequence is easily imagined the pudding became a pudding of puddings and the use of eggs from thence took its date the woman was sent for to court to make puddings for king john who then swayed the scepter and gained such favor that she was the making of her whole family i cannot conclude this paragraph without owning i received this important part of the history of pudding from old mr lawrence of wilsdengreen the greatest antiquary of the present age  from that time the english became so famous for puddings that they are called puddingeaters all over the world to this day  at her demise her son was taken into favor and made the kings chief cook and so great was his fame for puddings that he was called jack pudding all over the kingdom though in truth his real name was john barnes as by the records of the kitchen you will find this john barnes or jackpudding call him which you please the french have it jean boudin for his fame had reached france whose king would have given the world to have had our jack for his puddingmaker this jack pudding i say became yet a greater favorite than his mother insomuch that he had the kings ear as well as his mouth at command for the king you must know was a mighty lover of pudding and jack fitted him to a hair he knew how to make the most of a pudding no pudding came amiss to him he would make a pudding out of a flintstone comparatively speaking it is needless to enumerate the many sorts of pudding he made such as plain pudding plumb pudding marrow pudding oatmeal pudding carrot pudding saucesage pudding bread pudding flower pudding suet pudding and in short every pudding but quaking pudding which was solely invented by and took its name from our good friends of the bull and mouth before mentioned notwithstanding the many pretenders to that projection  but what raised our hero most in the esteem of this puddingeating monarch was his second edition of pudding he being the first that ever invented the art of broiling puddings which he did to such perfection and so much to the kings likeing who had a mortal aversion to cold pudding that he thereupon instituted him knight of the gridiron and gave him a gridiron of gold the ensign of that order which he always wore as a mark of his sovereigns favor in short jack pudding or sir john grew to be all in all with good king john he did nothing without him they were finger and glove and if we may believe tradition our very good friend had no small hand in the magna charta if so how much are all englishmen indebted to him in what repute ought the order of the gridiron to be which was instituted to do honor to this wonderful man but alas how soon is merit forgot how impudently do the vulgar turn the most serious things into ridicule and mock the most solemn trophies of honor for now every fool at a fair or zany at a mountebanks stage is called jack pudding has a gridiron at his back and a great pair of spectacles at his buttocks to ridicule the most noble order of the gridiron but their spectacles is a most ungrateful reflection on the memory of that great man whose indefatigable application to his business and deep study in that occult science rendered him poreblind to remedy which misfortune he had always a squire followed him bearing a huge pair of spectacles to saddle his honors nose and supply his muchlamented defect of sight but whether such an unhappiness did not deserve rather pity than ridicule i leave to the determination of all good christians i cannot but say it raises my indignation when i see these paunchgutted fellows usurping the title and achievements of my dear sir john whose memory i so much venerate i cannot always contain my self i remember to my cost i once carried my resentment a little farther than ordinary in furiously assaulting one of those rascals i tore the gridiron from his back and the spectacles from his a  e for which i was apprehended carried to pyepowder court and by that tremendous bench sentenced to most severe pains and penalties  this has indeed a little tamed me insomuch that i keep my fingers to my self but at the same time let my tongue run like a devil forbear vile miscreants cry i wherever i meet these wretches forbear to ascribe to your selves the name and honors of sir john pudding content your selves with being zanies pickledherrings punchionellos but dare not scandalize the noble name of pudding nor can i notwithstanding the clamours and ill usage of the vulgar refrain bearing my testimony against this manifest piece of injustice  what pity it is therefore so noble an order should be lost or at least neglected we have had no account of the real knights os the gridiron since they appeared under the fictitious name of the kitkat club in their possession was the very gridiron of gold worn by sir john himself which identical gridiron dignified the breast of the most ingenious mr richard estcourt that excellent physician and comedian who was president of that noble society  quis talia fando temperet a lachrymis what is become of the gridiron or of the remains of that excellent body of men time will i hope discover the world i believe must for such discoveries be obliged to my very good friend j  t  esquire who had the honor to be doorkeeper to that honorable assembly  but to return to sir john the more his wit engaged the king the more his grandeur alarmed his enemies who increased with his honors not but the courtiers caressed him to a man as the first who had brought dumplingeating to perfection king john himself loved him entirely being of cesars mind that is he had a natural antipathy against meagre herringgutted wretches he loved only fatheaded men and such who slept of nights and of such was his whole court composed now it was sir johns method every sunday morning to give the courtiers a breakfast which breakfast was every man his dumpling and cup of wine for you must know he was yeoman of the winecellar at the same time  this was a great eyesore and heartburning to some lubberly abbots who loungd about the court they took it in great dudgeon they were not invited and stuck so close to his skirts that they never rested till they outed him they told the king who was naturally very hasty that sir john madeaway with his wine and feasted his paramours at his expense and not only so but that they were forming a design against his life which they in conscience ought to discover that sir john was not only an heretic but an heathen nay worse they feared he was a witch and that he had bewitched his majesty into that unaccountable fondness for a puddingmaker they assured the king that on a sunday morning instead of being at mattins he and his trigrimates got together humjum all snug and performed many hellish and diabolical ceremonies in short they made the king believe that the moon was made of greencheese and to show how the innocent may be belied and the best intentions misrepresented they told the king that he and his associates offered sacrifices to ceres when alas it was only the dumplings they eat the butter which was melted and poured over them these vile miscreants called libations and the friendly compotations of our dumplingeaters were called bacchanalian rites two or three among em being sweettoothd would strew a little sugar over their dumplings this was represented as an heathenish offering in short not one action of theirs but what these rascally abbots made criminal and never let the king alone till poor sir john was discarded not but the king did it with the greatest reluctance but they had made it a religious concern and he could not get off on it  but mark the consequence the king never enjoyed himself after nor was it long before he was poisoned by a monk at swineshead abbey then too late he saw his error then he lamented the loss of sir john and in his latest moments would cry out oh that i had never parted from my dear jack pudding would i had never left off pudding and dumpling i then had never been thus basely poisoned never thus treacherously sent out of the world  thus did this good king lament but alas to no purpose the priest had given him his bane and complaints were ineffectual  sir john in the mean time had retired into norfolk where his diffusive knowledge extended it self for the good of the county in general and from that very cause norfolk has ever since been so famous for dumplings he lamented the kings death to his very last and was so cautious of being poisoned by the priests that he never touched a wafer to the day of his death and had it not been that some of the lessdesigning part of the clergy were his intimate friends and eat daily of his dumplings he had doubtless been madeaway with out they stood in the gap for him for the sake of his dumplings knowing that when sir john was gone they should never have the like again  but our facetious knight was too free of his talk to be long secure for a hole was picked in his coat in the succeeding reign and poor sir john had all his goods and chattels forfeited to the kings use it was then time for him to bestir himself and away to court he goes to recover his lands etc not doubting but he had friends there sufficient to carry his cause  but alas how was he mistaken not a soul there knew him the very porters used him rudely in vain did he seek for access to the king to vindicate his conduct in vain did he claim acquaintance with the lords of the court and reap up old civilities to remind em of former kindness the pudding was eat the obligation was over which made sir john compose that excellent proverb not a word of the pudding and finding all means ineffectual he left the court in a great pet yet not without passing a severe joke upon em in his way which was this he sent a pudding to the kings table under the name of a courtpudding or promisepudding this pudding he did not fail to set off with large encomiums assuring the king that therein he would find an hieroglyphical definition of courtiers promises and friendship  this caused some speculation and the kings physician debarred the king from tasting the pudding not knowing but that sir john had poisoned it  but how great a fit of laughter ensued may be easily guessed when the pudding was cut up it proved only a large bladder just closed over with paste the bladder was full of wind and nothing else excepting these verses written in a roll of paper and put in as is supposed before the bladder was blown full as wind in a bladdere ypent is lordings promise and serment sain what hem lust withouten dread they been so double in her falshede for they in heart can think ene thing and sain another in her speaking and what was sweet and apparent is smoterlich and eke yshent and when of service you have need pardie he will not rue nor read but when the symnel it is eten her curtesse is all foryetten   this adventure met with various constructions from those at table some laughed others frowned but the king took the joke by the right end and laughed outright  the verses though but scurvy ones in themselves yet in those days passed for tolerable nay the king was mightily pleased with em and played em off on his courtiers as occasion served he would stop em short in the middle of a flattering harangue and cry not a word of the pudding this would daunt and mortify em to the last degree they cursed sir john a thousand times over for the proverbs sake but to no purpose for the king gave him a private hearing in which he so well satisfied his majesty of his innocence and integrity that all his lands were restored the king would have put him in his old post but he modestly declined it but at the same time presented his majesty with a book of most excellent receipts for all kinds of puddings which book his majesty received with all imaginable kindness and kept it among his greatest rarities  but yet as the best instructions though never so strictly followed may not be always as successfully executed so not one of the kings cooks could make a pudding like sir john nay though he made a pudding before their eyes yet they out of the very same materials could not do the like which made his old friends the monks attribute it to witchcraft and it was currently reported the devil was his helper but good king harry was not to be fobbd off so the pudding was good it sat very well on his stomach and he eat very savourly without the least remorse of conscience  in short sir john grew in favor in spite of their teeth the king loved a merry joke and sir john had always his budget full of punns connundrums and carrawitchets not to forget the quibbles and flyflaps he played against his adversaries at which the king has laughed till his sides cracked  sir john though he was no very great scholar yet had a happy way of expressing himself he was a man of the most engaging address and never failed to draw attention plenty and goodnature smiled in his face his muscles were never distorted with anger or contemplation but an eternal smile drew up the corners of his mouth his very eyes laughed and as for his chin it was threedouble adown which hung a goodly wheycolourd beard shining with the drippings of his luxury for you must knew he was a great epicure and had a very sensible mouth he thought nothing toogood for himself all his care was for his belly and his palate was so exquisite that it was the perfect standard of tasting so that to him we owe all that is elegant in eating for pudding was not his only talent he was a great virtuoso in all manner of eatables and though he might come short of lambert for confectionaryniceties yet was he not inferior to brawnd lebec pede or any other great masters of cookery he could toss up a fricassee as well as a pancake and most of the kickshaws now in vogue are but his inventions with other names for what we call fricassees he called pancakes as a pancake of chickens a pancake of rabbets etc nay the french call a pudding an english fricassee to this day  we value our selves mightily for roasting a hare with a pudding in its belly when alas he has roasted an ox with a pudding in his belly there was no man like him for invention and contrivance and then for execution he spared no labor and pains to compass his magnanimous designs  o would to heaven this little attempt of mine may stir up some puddingheaded antiquary to dig his way through all the moldy records of antiquity and bring to light the noble actions of sir john it will not then be long before we see him on the stage sir john falstaff then will be a shrimp to sir john pudding when raised from oblivion and reanimated by the allinvigorating pen of the wellfed wellread wellpayd c  j  esquire nor would this be all for the pastrycooks would from the hands of an eminent physician and poet receive whole loads of memorandums to remind em of the gratitude due to sir johns memory  on such a subject i hope to see sir richard outdo himself nor arthur nor eliza shall with sir john compare there is not so much differenee between a telescope and a powderpuff a hooppettycoat and a farthingcandle a birchbroom and a diamondring as there will be between the former writings of this pair of poets and their lucubrations on this head  nor will it stop here the opera composers shall have the other contest which shall best singforth his praises sorry am i that nicolino is not here he would have made an excellent sir john but senesino being blown up after the manner that butchers blow calves may do well enough from thence the painters and printsellers shall retail his goodly phiz and what sacheverel was shall sir john pudding be his head shall hang elate on every sign his fame shall ring in every street and cluers press shall teem with ballads to his praise this would be but honor this would be but gratitude from a generation so much indebted to so great a man  but how much do we deviate from honor and gratitude when we put other names to his inventions and call em our own what is a tart a pie or a pasty but meat or fruit enclosed in a wall or covering of pudding what is a cake but a baked pudding or a christmaspie but a mincdmeatpudding as for cheesecakes custards tansies they are manifest puddings and all of sir johns own contrivance for custard is as old if not older than magna charta in short pudding is of the greatest dignity and antiquity bread it self which is the very staff of life is properly speaking a baked wheatpudding  to the satchel which is the puddingbag of ingenuity we are indebted for the greatest men in church and state all arts and sciences owe their original to pudding or dumpling what is a bagpipe the mother of all music but a pudding of harmony and what is music it self but a palatable cookery of sounds to little puddings or bladders of colors we owe all the choice originals of the greatest painters and indeed what is painting but a wellspread pudding or cookery of colors  the head of man is like a pudding and whence have all rhimes poems plots and inventions sprang but from that same pudding what is poetry but a pudding of words the physicians though they cry out so much against cooks and cookery yet are but cooks themselves with this difference only the cooks pudding lengthens life the physicians shortens it so that we live and die by pudding for what is a clyster but a bagpudding a pill but a dumpling or a bolus but a tansy though not altogether so toothsome in a word physic is only a puddingizing or cookery of drugs the law is but a cookery of quibbles and contentions the cat run away with this part of the copy on which the author had unfortunately laid some of mother crumps sausages                                 is but a pudding of                           some swallow every thing whole and unmixed so that it may rather be called a heap than a pudding others are so squeamish the greatest mastership in cookery is required to make the pudding palatable the suet which others gape and swallow by gobs must for these puny stomachs be minced to atoms the plums must be picked with the utmost care and every ingredient proportioned to the greatest nicety or it will never go down  the universe it self is but a pudding of elements empires kingdoms states and republics are but puddings of people differently made up the celestial and terrestrial orbs are decypherd to us by a pair of globes or mathematical puddings  the success of war and fate of monarchies are entirely dependant on puddings and dumplings for what else are cannonballs but military puddings or bullets but dumplings only with this difference they do not sit so well on the stomach as a good marrowpudding or breadpudding  in short there is nothing valuable in nature but what more or less has an allusion to pudding or dumpling why then should they be held in disesteem why should dumplingeating be ridiculed or dumplingeaters derided is it not pleasant and profitable is it not ancient and honorable kings princes and potentates have in all ages been lovers of pudding is it not therefore of royal authority popes cardinals bishops priests and deacons have time out of mind been great puddingeaters is it not therefore a holy and religious institution philosophers poets and learned men in all faculties judges privycouncellors and members of both houses have by their great regard to pudding given a sanction to it that nothing can efface is it not therefore ancient honorable and commendable  quare itaque fremuerunt auctores why do therefore the enemies of good eating the starvegutted authors of grubstreet employ their impotent pens against pudding and puddingheaded alias honest men why do they inveigh against dumplingeating which is the life and soul of goodfellowship and dumplingeaters who are the ornaments of civil society  but alas their malice is their own punishment the hireling author of a late scandalous libel entitled the dumplingeaters downfall may if he has any eyes now see his error in attacking so numerous so august a body of people his books remain unsold unread unregarded while this treatise of mine shall be bought by all who love pudding or dumpling to my booksellers great joy and my no small consolation how shall i triumph and how will that mercenary scribbler be mortified when i have sold more editions of my books than he has copies of his i therefore exhort all people gentle and simple men women and children to buy to read to extol these labors of mine for the honor of dumplingeating let them not fear to defend every article for i will bear them harmless i have arguments good store and can easily confute either logically theologically or metaphysically all those who dare oppose me  let not englishmen therefore be ashamed of the name of puddingeaters but on the contrary let it be their glory for let foreigners cry out never so much against good eating they come easily into it when they have been a little while in our land of canaan and there are very few foreigners among us who have not learned to make as great a hole in a good pudding or sirloin of beef as the best englishman of us all  why should we then be laughed out of pudding and dumpling or why ridiculed out of good living plots and politics may hurt us but pudding cannot let us therefore adhere to pudding and keep our selves out of harms way according to the golden rule laid down by a celebrated dumplingeater now defunct be of your patrons mind whatever he says sleep very much think little and talk less mind neither good nor bad nor right nor wrong but eat your pudding fool and hold your tongue prior  the author of these excellent lines not only shows his wisdom but his goodbreeding and great esteem for the memory of sir john by giving his poem the title of merry andrew and making merry andrew the principal spokesman for if i guess aright and surely i guess not wrong his main design was to ascertain the name of merry andrew to the fool of a droll and to substitute it instead of jack pudding which name my friend matt could not hear with temper as carrying with it an oblique reflection on sir john pudding the hero of this dumpleid  let all those therefore who have any regard to politeness and propriety of speech take heed how they err against this rule laid down by him who was the standard of english elegance and be it known to all whom it may concern that if any person whatever shall dare hereafter to apply the name of jack pudding to merry andrews and suchlike creatures i hereby require and empower any stander or standers by to knock him her or them down and if any action or actions of assault and battery shall be brought against any person or persons so acting in pursuance of this most reasonable request by knocking down bruising beating or otherwise demolishing such offenders i will indemnify and bear them harmless  finis namby pamby or a panegyric on the new veresification addressed to a  p  esquire nauty pauty
