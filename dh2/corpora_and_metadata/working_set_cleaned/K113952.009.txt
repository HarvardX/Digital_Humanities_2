poetical calendar september an ode farewell the pomp of flora vivid scene welcome sage autumn to invert the year  farewell to summers eyedelighting green her verdure fades  autumnal blasts are near the silky wardrobe now is laid aside with all the rich regalia of her pride and must we bid sweet philomel adieu she that was wont to charm us in the grove must natures livery wear a sadder hue and a dark canopy be stretched above yes  for september mounts his ebonthrone and the smooth foliage of the plain is gone libra to weigh the harvests pearly store the golden balance poizes now on high the calm serenity of zephyr over sols glittering legions to the equator fly at the same hour he shows his orient head and warned by thetis sinks in oceans bed adieu ye damask roses which remind the maiden fairone how her charms decay ye rising blasts oh leave some mark behind some small memorial of the sweets of may ah no  the ruthless season will not hear nor spare one glory of the ruddy year no more the waste of music sung so late from every bush green orchestre of love for now their winds the birds of passage wait and bid a last farewell to every grove while those whom shepherdswains the sleepers call choose their recess in some sequestered wall yet still shall sage september boast his pride some birds shall chant some gayer flowers shall blow nor is the season wholly unallied to purple bloom the haler fruits shall grow the stronger plants such as enjoy the cold and wear a livelier grace by being old an autumnal ode to mr hayman yet once more glorious god of day while beams thine orb serene o let me warbling court thy stay to gild the fading scene thy rays invigorate the spring bright summer to perfection bring the cold inclemency of winter cheer and make the autumnal months the mildest of the year ere yet the russet foliage fall i will climb the mountains brow my friend my hayman at thy call to view the scene below how sweetly pleasing to behold forests of vegetable gold how mixed the many checkered shades between the tawny mellowing hue and the gay vivid green how splendid all the sky how still how mild the dying gale how soft the whispers of the rill that winds along the vale so tranquil natures works appear it seems the sabbath of the year as if the summers labor past she chose this seasons sober calm for blandishing repose such is of wellspent life the time when busy days are past man verging gradual from his prime meets sacred peace at last his flowery spring of pleasures over and summers fullblown pride no more he gains pacific autumn mild and bland and dauntless braves the stroke of winters palsied hand for yet a while a little while involved in wintry gloom and lo another spring shall smile a spring eternal bloom then shall he shine a glorious guest in the bright mansions of the blessed where due rewards on virtue are bestowed and reaped the golden fruits of what his autumn sowed autumn an ode alas with swift and silent pace impatient time rolls on the year the seasons change and natures face now sweetly smiles now frowns severe twas spring twas summer all was gay now autumn bends a cloudy brow the flowers of spring are swept away and summers fruits desert the bough the verdant leaves that played on high and wantoned in the western breeze now trod in dust neglected lie as boreas strips the bending trees the fields that waved with golden grain as russet heaths are wild and bare not moist with dew but drenched in rain nor health nor pleasure wanders there no more while through the midnight shade beneath the moons pale orb i stray soft pleasing woes my heart invade as progne pours the melting lay from this capricious clime she soars o would some god but wings supply to where each morn the spring restores companion of her flight i would fly vain wish me fate compells to bear the downward seasons iron reign compells to breathe polluted air and shiver on a blasted plain what bliss to life can autumn yield if glooms and showers and storms prevail and ceres flies the naked field and flowers and fruits and phoebus fail oh what remains what lingers yet to cheer me in the darkening hour the grape remains the friend of wit in love and mirth of mighty power haste press the clusters fill the bowl  apollo shoot thy parting ray this gives the sunshine of the soul this god of health and verse and day still still the jocund strain shall flow the pulse with vigorous rapture beat my stella with new charms shall glow and every bliss in wine shall meet autumn by mr brerewood though the seasons must alter ah yet let me find what all must confess to be rare a female still cheerful and faithful and kind the blessings of autumn to share let one side of our cottage a flourishing vine overspread with its branches and shade whose clusters appear more transparent and fine as its leaves are beginning to fade when the fruit makes the branches bend down with its load in our orchard surrounded with pales in a bed of clean straw let our apples be stowed for a tart that in winter regales when the vapors that rise from the earth in the morn seem to hang on its surface like smoke till dispersed by the sun that gilds over the corn within doors let us prattle and joke but when we see clear all the hues of the leaves and at work in the fields are all hands some in reaping the wheat others binding the sheaves let us carelessly strole over the lands how pleasing the sight of the toiling they make to collect what kind nature has sent heaven grant we may not of their labor partake but oh give us their happy content and sometimes on a bank under shade by a brook let us silently sit at our ease and there gaze on the stream till the fish on the hook struggles hard to procure its release and now when the husbandman sings harvest home and the corns all got into the house when the long wished for time of their meeting is come to frolic and feast and carouse when the leaves from the trees are begun to be shed and are leaving the branches all bare either strewn at the roots shrivelled withered and dead or else blown to and fro in the air when the ways are so miry that bogs they might seem and the axletrees ready to break while the waggoner whistles in stopping his team and then claps the poor jades on the neck in the morning let us follow the cry of the hounds or the fearful young covey beset which though skulking in stubble and weeds on the grounds are becoming a prey to the net let us enjoy all the pleasure retirement affords still amused with these innocent sports nor once envy the pomp of fine ladies and lords with their grand entertainments in courts in the evening when lovers are leaning on styles deep engaged in some amorous chat and it is very well known by his grin and her smiles what they both have a mind to be at to our dwelling though homely wellpleased to repair let our mutual endearments revive and let no single action or look but declare how contented and happy we live should ideas arise that may ruffle the soul let soft music the phantoms remove for it is harmony only has force to control and unite all the passions in love with her eyes but half open her cap all awry when the lass is preparing for bed and the sleepy dull clown who sits nodding just by sometimes rouzes and scratches his head in the night when it is cloudy and rainy and dark and the laborers snore as they lie not a noise to disturb us unless a dog bark in the farm or the village hard by at the time of sweet rest and of quiet like this ere our eyes are closed up in their lids let us welcome the season and taste of that bliss which the sunshine and daylight forbids upon my hairs falling few and easy in your stay never curled and hardly gray hairs adieu though falling all blameless harmless may you fall light and trifling though you be more deserving poetry than the dream of guilty power than the misers gathered ore than the worlds most serious things murdering victors haughty kings if your moral fall presage death the certain end of age if a single hint you give well to die and soon to live an evening ode to delia evening now from purple wings sheds the grateful gifts she brings brilliant drops bedeck the mead cooling breezes shake the reed shake the reed and curl the stream silvered over with cynthias beam near the checkered lonely grove hears and keeps thy secrets love thither delia let us stray lightly over the dewy way phoebus drives his burning car hence my lovely delia far in his stead the queen of night sheds around a lambent light light that serves but just to show breasts that beat and cheeks that glow let us there in whispered joy all the silent hours employ silence best and dusky shades please the heart that love invades other passions then at rest love possesses all the breast reflections on a watch let vain philosophy hence learn to bind the lawless operations of the mind and teach us to obey that power unseen that framed and first informed our wise machine then shall we know what schools have idly taught to guide each act and regulate each thought like this mechanic wonder shall we move unvaried by ambition anger love constant in each vicissitude of care not urged by hope nor yet repressed by fear alike in health disease in age or youth our equal judgment still will point at truth no longer shall we live whole years in vain nor one sad hour be marked with grief or pain freedom and joy our measured time will fill guiltless unerring and assured our will till the last pulse shall beat and life stand still autumn i at my window sit and see autumn his russet fingers lay on every leaf of every tree i call but summer will not stay she flies the boasting goddess flies and pointing where the espaliers shoot  deserve my parting gift she cries  i take the leaves but not the fruit let me the parting gift improve and emulate the just reply as lifes short seasons swift remove ere fixed in winters frost i lie health beauty vigor now decline the pride of summers splendid day leaves which the stem must now resign the mournful prelude of decay but let fair virtues fruit remain though summer with my leaves be fled then not despised i will not complain but cherish autumn in her stead the fireside a parody on the second epode of horace by isaac hawkins brown esquire  thrice happy who free from ambition and pride in a rural retreat has a quiet fireside i love my fireside thither let me repair and drink a delightful oblivion of care oh when shall i scape to be truly my own from the noise and the smoke and the bustle of town then i live then i triumph whenever i retire from the pomp and parade that the many admire hail ye woods and ye lawns shady vales sunny hills and the warble of birds and the murmur of rills ye flowers of all hues that embroider the ground flocks feeding or frisking in gambols around scene of joy to behold joy that who would forego for the wealth and the power that a court can bestow i have said it at home i have said it abroad that the town is mans world but that this is of god here my trees cannot flatter plants nursed by my care pay with fruit or with fragrance and incense the air here contemplative solitude raises the mind least alone when alone to ideas refined methinks hid in groves which no sound can invade save when philomel strikes up her sweet serenade i revolve on the changes and chances of things and pity the wretch that attends upon kings now i pass with old authors an indolent hour and reclining at ease turn demosthenes over now facetious and vacant i urge the gay flask with a set of old friends  who have nothing to ask thus happy i reck not of france nor of spain nor the balance of power what hand shall sustain the balance of power ha till that is restored what solid delight can retirement afford some must be content to be drudges of state that the sage may securely enjoy his retreat in weather serene when the ocean is calm it matters not much who presides at the helm but soon as clouds gather and tempests arise then a pilot there needs a man dauntless and wise if such can be found sure he ought to come forth and lend to the public his talents and worth whatever inclination or ease may suggest if the state wants his aid he has no claim to rest but who is the man a bad game to redeem he whom savoy admires who has prussias esteem whom the spaniards have felt and whose iron with dread haughty lewis saw forging to fall on his head holland loves him nor less in the north all the powers court honor revere and the empress adores hark what was that sound for it seemed more sublime than befits the low genius of pastoral rhyme was it wisdom i heard or can fumes of the brain cheat my ears with a dream ha repeat me that strain yes wisdom i hear thee thou deignst to declare me me the sole atlas to prop this whole sphere thy voice says or seems in sweet accents to say haste and save sinking britain  resigned i obey and o witness ye powers that ambition and pride have no share in this change  for i love my fireside thus the shepherd then throwing his crook away steals direct to st jamess and takes up the seals the dryads or woodnymphs a philosophical poem by mr diaper bacchum in remotis carmina rupibus vidi docentem credit posteri nymphasque discentes et aures capripedum satyrorum acutas evae recenti mens trepidat metu hor forgive ye nereids if i sing no more the uncertain sea but choose the safer shore and leave the restless waves for steady hills to sit on grassy plots or dream by rills the wanton muse the meaner thorn prefers to coral twigs and ambers costly tears again i may when tired of leavy woods haste to the sea and court the rolling floods no loved amusements here but soon will cloy the dearest bliss becomes a worthless toy and we must shift our pleasures to enjoy sick of the town i left the busy place where deep concern broods on the thoughtful face where factious cits with nods and roguish leer are whispering nothing in attentive ear where knaves strange lies invent and fools retail and homemade treason find in every mail falsehoods their credit gain though illcontrivd and scandals often disproved are still revived imagined ills in frightful shapes appear while present evils we with patience bear phantoms and empty forms are feared the most as those who scorned the man yet dread the ghost no longer plagued with faction spleen and noise how was i blessed when first my ravished eyes sucked in the purer day and saw unclouded skies how happy when i viewed the calm retreat and groves oerlookd by winchcombs ancient seat here the smooth a river in barkshire kennet takes his doubtful way in wanton rounds the lingering waters play and by their circling streams prolong the grateful stay here good old chaucer whilom cheered the vale and sootely sung and told the jocund tale bright was the moon and her reflected beams spangled the dewy leaves with trembling gleams while stars by conscious twinklings seemed to know what waking lovers acted here below careless i walked where prowling beasts had made a path that led through a lone silent glade the moon with doubtful rays deceived the sight and waving boughs gave an uncertain light when my chilled spirits sunk with sudden fear and trembling horror bid the search forbear my heedless steps had touched the hallowed ground where airy demons dance the wanton round where fairy elves and midnight dryads meet and to the moon the sylvan song repeat tall rifted oaks and circling elms had made a central void amidst surrounding shade with hollow vaulted cells and rising heaps in which by day the wearied badger sleeps thick thorny brakes grew round the lonesome place and twining boughs enclosed the middle space here dryads in nocturnal revels join while stars through shaking leaves obscurely shine and here i saw blessed with a kinder fate where in a beauteous ring the nymphs were sat wellpleased the elfins smiled but she who guards pomaceous fruits and orchardcares rewards down pensive leaned her head no ruddy streaks mixed with the languid paleness of her cheeks cast on the ground her withered garland lay whose shrivelled leaves seemed conscious of decay thyrsis that muchloved youth the goddess mourned thyrsis who once silurian plains adorned the rural powers confessed their meaner lays when thyrsis sung and owned his juster praise he ariconian swains industrious taught to strain rich must and press the racy draught since he is gone the trees are all decayed with moss bedight and blossoms illarrayd the pensive owner mourns the tedious weeks and wants the generous bowl that paints the flushing cheeks men led by sense and partial to themselves nor roving demons own nor wandering elves but who can know the intelligible race or guess the powers that fill the aerial space often the tired horse is forced to scour the plain when fairies ride fixed in his twisted mane and i ye gods have wondrous circles seen where wanton sprites in midnight dance have been and pressed their rounding steps on every newmowd green ye demons who in lonely forests rove and friendly powers that human arts improve ye careful genii that over men preside direct their counsels and their actions guide the grateful muse shall your assistance own and tell of heavenly forms as yet unknown blessed beings whom no earthy fetters bind nor to the pressing weight of clay confined of unmixt either formed their beauty fears no pale disease nor change of coming years be kind ye powers and tune my artless tongue while i repeat the dryads pleasing song nape began a nymph with careless mien clad like autumnal leaves in yellowish green her round plump cheeks a deeper purple died such as ripe fruits boast on their sunny side a wreath of platted moss curled round her head cheerful she smiled and thus the elfin said  tall sycamores the noisy insects love and buzzing round the leaves incessant move while the day lasts the worthless creatures play and mourn the evening dusk and wing their silent way but forest nymphs prefer the peaceful night when solemn gloom and dewy seats invite while drowzy man in sleep unactive rests not half so happy as the watchful beasts who silent leave their dens and secret home and on the prey intent through all the forest roam the raging sun with his too scorching beams burns up the herbs and lessens all the streams but the kind moon reflects a milder ray and makes a night more lovely than the day nor darts fierce flame but innocently bright leaves all the fire and gives the purer light no noisome vapor or dark cloud exhales but gentle drops fresh dews and pleasing gales so woman is but rougher man refined has naught of him that is fierce but all that is kind now falling drops like shining pearls are seen and dewy spangles hang on every green refreshing moisture cools the thirsty mead extends the stalk and swells thunfolded seed restores the verdure of the tarnishd leaves and every herb the ripening juice receives day always is the same but wanton night boasts a more grateful change of harmless light below the glowworms wondrous orbs are seen that stud with burnished gold the shaded green these little wandering comets never shed or baneful ill or dire contagion spread their shining tails foretell no falling state nor future dearth nor sad disease create bright lambent flames and kindled vapors rise sweep glaring through the dusk and strike the wondering eyes in oblique tracks the meteors blaze around and skim the surface of the marshy ground unseen by day when tyrantlike the sun envious admits no splendour but his own the liquid drops that ooze from weeping trees and sparkling stones with starlike luster please even sapless wood improved by age grows bright and what it wants in moisture gains in light while ripened fruits and milder seasons last and only empty clouds the skies overcast nymphs in lone deserts chant the rural lay till the winged hours bring on returning day but when fierce wintery storms the forest rend and rattling hail or fleecy snows descend when conscious birds who know succeeding times haste from the cold and seek for milder climes the elfin powers who can at pleasure leave aerial bodies and new forms receive cast off their vehicles and freed from sense nor dread the storms nor cold when too intense the earthy gnomes and fairy elves are seen digging in lowest mines with busy men there labor on the fruitless work intent while deeper snows the wonted dance prevent but foolish swains the blooming spring prefer the infant glory of the budding year nature as yet is but imperfect seen and her weak products show a rawish green the flowers look gay but lovely autumn treats with ripened beauties and substantial sweets nor wants its flowers while poppies grace the corn and azure cups the waving fields adorn fruits loved by rustic tastes of pleasing show on the wild hedge and scented briar grow and yellow leaves the fairy elfins bed fly with the wind and on the ground are spread the frisking satyrs squeeze the clustered grape and the chaste dryad fears the coming rape ripe mellow heaps from every tree are shook and bending corn expects the sharpened hook soon will the nodding sheaves be borne away and the drawn net enclose the unguarded prey the friendly powers who laboring peasants aid nymphs and lightfawns frequent the woody shade but often cursed fiends quit their infernal home and hated guests in gloomy forests roam with glaring eyes affright the howling beasts and little birds shrink closer in their nests earth would be heaven if we might here enjoy pleasure unmixt and leave the base alloy the greatest good has its attending ill and doubtful bliss distracts the uncertain will so teeming autumn boasts her luscious fruits and plants of grateful taste and healing roots but ripens with like care the growing seeds of baneful aconite and noxious weeds the deadly nightshade wanton youth deceives with shining berries and with spreading leaves the accursed fruit invites with pleasing show fair as the damsen or the skydyd sloe but ah not rashly trust the tempting ills too well you know that beauty often kills swift through the bones the spreading venom flies a deadly sleep hangs on his closing eyes and the lost wretch in raging frenzy dies now round its pole the spiral hop entwists like thyrsi borne by bacchus ancient priests the husband elm supports the embracing vines and round its oak the ivy closer twines to bacchus sacred all and prone to love they show what fuel must the flame improve love blind himself the mark would hardly know but bacchus takes the aim and sets the bow autumnal days a constant medium boast nor chap the ground with heat nor dry with frost nature on all her finished labor smiles and the glad peasant reaps the grateful spoils winds shake the ripened seeds on parent earth and thus impregnate for succeeding birth the tufted cod with future harvest swells while weighty seeds fall from their native cells and near their motherstem but smaller kinds far from their homes are borne by sweeping winds the atoms fly wafted on every breeze hence mossy threads enwrap the tallest trees herbs of strange forms on highest rocks are found and spreading fern runs over the barren ground but goddess you neglect your wonted care while blighted orchards mourn the nymphs despair nor love as once to see the handed bowls when tippling rustics cheer their droughty souls and tread with faltring steps the unequal ground while humble cots with wayward mirth resound succeeding bards in rural secrets skilled shall teach the swain to enrich the barren field the prophets inspiration never ends but with a double portion still descends poets like rightful kings can never die heavens sacred ointment will the throne supply and tityrus when he draws his latest breath will to some darling youth the valued pipe bequeath so tuneful insects fed by morning dew who in warm meads the daily song renew true poets they laugh at approaching want and careless sing and mock the laboring ant but soon bleak colds the wanton throng surprise and the whole race ah too unpitied dies and yet returning heat and sultry days restore the species and new songsters raise the goddess will not long forget her care but loss of fruit with future crops repair no more shall blasting winds the harvest grieve or blighted buds autumnal hopes deceive the youth wellpleased will daily thanks repeat while laden branches groan beneath their weight as from salt waves are drawn the sweeter rains and cheerful streams that swell the fattend plains so from our griefs succeeding pleasures flow grafted on crabs the fairest apples grow bitters and sweets in the same cup are thrown and prickly thistles have the softest down thus said the nymph and psecas thus replied psecas who gives the herbs their various pride she nature aids and is the sylvan power that shapes the leaf and paints the woody flower she blanches lillies to their loveliest white whose skinlike beauty pleases human sight hence the blue vervains grace the humble shade and drowzy poppies are in scarlet clad unerring forms the growing plant receives she rounds the stem and points the indented leaves  who said the nymph would sing of bleating flocks or hanging goats that browze on craggy rocks when ancient bards have rifled all the store and the drained subject can afford no more nor cuddy now nor colin would engage eclogue but ill becomes a warlike age in ancient times the shepherds song would please when pious kings enjoyed the shepherds ease and monarchs sat beneath the shadowing trees when those first happier ages were no more but cursed ambition still increased with power when crowded towns filled the deserted plain and craving passions a new life began the peaceful woods were not so soon forgot the uneasy soul her wonted pleasure sought reason when free and undisturbed approves the pleasing pensiveness of thoughtful groves hence twisted bowers and cooling grots were made to imitate at least the rural shade but men by furies urged and cursed by fate all that is calm and inoffensive hate guilt must prevail and bloodshed never cease nations are said to be undone by peace too well you know who often unseen repair to whispering courts enwrappd in finest air in closets sit and unsuspected hear what the great vulgar feign the little fear by night while swains dream of successful loves the forestgenii wanton in their groves and over the platted heath the fairydemon roves but when gray dawn awakes from pleasing rest the yawning peasant and disturbs the beast through streets and noisy crowds they range unknown and mark the conduct of the factious town britannias sons like those of monstrous birth when serpents teeth were sown in furrowed earth enflamed with rage and prone to mutual hate with baneful strife distract the endangered state war is now thought the panaceal good quacks know no other cure but letting blood even when the expiring wretch already faints and not a lancet but a cordial wants those who could wish all temples shut beside never think the gates of janus set too wide for endless slaughter as a blessing pray farewell the humble muse and shepherds peaceful lay she said and all the nymphs with sorrow heard when clad in white an heavenly form appeared a leavy crown adorned her radiant head majestic were her looks and thus she said  unbodied powers are not confined to floods to purling rivulets or to shady woods kind demons on ungrateful man attend observe his steps and watch the hated fiend the same good genii guard the harmless sheep when wearied damon lies in thoughtless sleep the same whose influence aids the unsettled state and gladly hastens on the work of fate romes second king enjoyed a fairy dame to lonely woods the royal pupil came to numas lessons and the elfinbride rome all her grandeur owed and future pride blessed powers and beings of the highest rank nor love the flowing stream nor flowery bank clad in etherial light the purer mind scorns the base earth and was for heaven designed inferior orders have a meaner home and here in wilds and woody mazes roam to learned magi we strange spells impart mysteries disclose and tell the secret art with sacred misletoe the druids crowned sung with the nymphs and danced the pleasing round but vulgar thoughts confound celestial forms with envious fiends who raise destructive storms and harmless elves that scuttle over the plain are ranked with furies doomed to endless pain mortals to earth and mean delights inclined no pleasure in abstracted notions find unused to higher truths will not believe aught can exist but what their eyes perceive though to good demons they their safety owe few are those happy who their guardians know but hear ye nymphs indulge no causeless fears i know the lasting joys of coming years i britains kind egeria will protect the loyal patriot and his schemes direct all do not hate the plain nor fly the woods fields have their lovers and the groves their gods if bolingbroke and oxford with a smile reward the song nor scorn the meaner style each bleeding tree shall tell the shepherds flame and in its wounds preserve the growing name swains to transmitted pipes shall long succeed and sort with artful hand the unequal reed the birds on every bough will listening throng and noisy strive to drown the envied song echo to distant rocks shall waft the tale and reach with borrowed sounds the lowest vale while the glad lambs pursue the circling round frisk wanton and over grassy ridges bound would prior he again the better choice approve who once of henry sung and emmas love would he a grateful guest to woods repair and private ease prefer to public care the nymphs would learn his song their own forget and little fawns the moving tale repeat peace from neglected pipes will wipe the dust when useless arms are doomed to cankering rust no dreaded sounds shall scare the finny race or fright the triton from his loved embrace the busy naiads cleanse polluted floods and nymphs frequent the longdeserted woods the rivergods hug the declining urn all to their streams or to their shades return when civil wars disturbed the roman state and brutus hastened on his juster fate while falsenamd liberty and doubtful claim madded the world and fanned alectos flame the swain was injured and his song forgot and tityrus only by his flocks was sought but when octavius had the nations freed and every realm its rightful lord obeyed the god looked down on the neglected groves and deigned to hear of peace and softer loves fields and their owners were with leisure blessed and mantuas shepherd had his wrongs redressed so first the mountain tops are touched with light and from the gloomy vales the swain invite while mists below and intervening clouds cast a deep dusk on all the frowning woods the shaded meadows view with envy round the distant splendour of the rising ground but soon the spreading rays expanded move and streaming like a deluge from above sweep over the gladsome field and dart through every grove by foreign wars intestine factions thrive the dam destroyed the imps not long survive tumultuous hurry an advantage gives both to the little and the greater thieves a guilty act is in confusion hid when busy times a nicer search forbid so crafty fish of clearer streams afraid lie hid in eddies which themselves have made touched with the rose the jetty beetle dies and from the spicy hills the vultur flies so baser souls abhor the sweets of peace whose private gains by public loss increase when noisy storms deluge the dropping leaves the pensive lark retires and silent grieves but chattering birds joy at the expected flood and with mixed clamours watch the teeming cloud for then a grateful prey the horned snail and worms over moistened clouds their folding bodies trail designing men the public welfare hate who cannot rise but on a ruined state base souls will always keep their native stain and rooted passions will the ascendant gain the worm when once become a spotted fly and borne on gaudy wings it mounts on high unchanged admires the ordure whence it sprung and feeds with pleasure on its native dung but steady patriots will just schemes pursue nor fear the rage of the discarded few who prone to causeless change unwearied strive old crimes repeat and baffled plots revive eternal infamy rewards their pains and though the flame is out the stench remains what speciouscolourd fraud or secret snare can st johns prudence scape or oxfords care diseases often prove fatal when concealed but ripened sores if lancd are soonest healed slow lentulus and rash cethegus join and with ambitious catiline combine wretches who only in destruction skilled try to pull down what they could never build but when intent to spring the sudden mine one cicero can blast the base design so when black storms cast up the boiling deep and envious winds disturb the tritons sleep the shepherd who the watery conflict hears shuddering at distance for his pasture fears thinks with himself when will the tumult cease or what kind power can warring floods appease but the oceangods roused from their oozy beds the trident grasp and nod their reedy heads the waves rebuked fear to approach the shore and all is hushed and winds are heard no more peace guides her steps as st john leads the way and all her little loves around him play when he arrived france the first time confessed her court eclipsed by a politer guest unwilling owned britannia has her charms and is as strong in eloquence as arms when st john speaks who would refuse to hear mars smooths his brow and pallas drops her spear a thousand graces on his lips are hung and suada sips her nectar from his tongue when wild suspicions cause distracting hate and partyclamours sway the warm debate such eloquence the tumult overrules like falling drops it softens and it cools it calms thenragd and draws the stubborn minds and to the unwilling breast a passage finds nervous yet smooth the heart it gently steals like wine it sparkles but like oil it heals he with his country shares one common fate all st john love but who britannia hate kennet of late neglects his broken urn and st johns absence all the dryads mourn not gallus once in woods was so beloved whose luckless flame the nymphs to pity moved heaven has its chosen favorites and on those with partial hand its doubled gift bestows while common souls like coarser stuffs laid by are not prepared to take the brighter dye the kingly oaks engross the honeyd dews whose viscous sweets the meaner shrubs refuse and every neighboring tree neglected grieves but willing spreads in vain its tasteless leaves st john the woods and breezy forest loves where natures pride presuming art reproves new beauties show themselves to nearer views and themes untouched expect the skilful muse the vegetable worlds neglected lie and flowers ungatherd fall and nameless die thousands escape hid in the pressing throng unknown to macers or to cowleys song you psecas know in seedy labor skilled what various herbage fattend pastures yield and what unnumberd kinds adorn the field whose fading beauties pass without regard while every drooping herb upbraids the bard what learned song will natures care impart by what kind instinct and unstudied art the numerous natives of the sheltering wood avoid their dangers or procure their food what verse has told how smaller rivals wage unequal war and with the toad engage they arguslike are set around with eyes and hung on silken threads the foe surprise spit on the poisonous wretch more deadly bane who deeplywounded feels the raging pain swift up her pendent womb arachne climbs while he scarce trails along his tortured limbs but careful will the healing plantain find plantain to undeserving creatures kind whose sovereign herb the venomed juice expels and now the bloated wretch with innate poison swells or how the speckled snakes their prey surprise and with hot fennel rub their weaker eyes they when the bloom of warmer spring begins cast off as wornout clothes their sloughy skins with early youth returning vigor blessed brandish the tongue and raise the azure crest ants prudent bite the ends of hoarded wheat lest growing seeds their future hopes defeat and when they conscious scent the gathering rains draw down their windy eggs and pilferd grains with summers toil and ready viands fill the deepest caverns of their puny hill there lie secure and hug their treasured goods and safe in labored cells they mock the coming floods a thousand kinds unknown in forests breed and bite the leaves and notch the growing weed have each their several laws and settled states and constant sympathies and constant hates their changing forms no artful verse describes or how fierce war destroys the wandering tribes how prudent nature feeds her various young has been if not untold at least unsung to the insectrace the muse her aid denies while prouder men the little ant despise but though the bulky kinds are easy known yet natures skill is most in little shown beside that man by some kind demon taught has secrets found that were of old unsought labourious wights have wondrous optics made whose borrowed sight the curious searcher aid and show what heaven to common view denies strange puny shapes unknown to vulgar eyes so shadowy forms and sportive demons fly wafted on winds and not perceived when nigh unseen they sweep along the grassy plains and scud unseen before the whistling swains but to those seers in northern isles confined inured to cold and hardened by the wind the indulgent powers have given a second fight that kens the airy sylph and wandering sprite no flitting elf the subtle eye escapes when wanton genii sport in antic shapes men nature in her secret work behold untwist her fibers and her coats unfold with pleasure trace the threads of stringy roots the various textures of the ripening fruits and animals that careless live at ease to whom the leaves are worlds the drops are seas if to the finished whole so little goes how small the parts that must the whole compose matter is infinite and still descends man cannot know where lessening nature ends the azure dye which plums in autumn boast that handled fades and at a touch is lost of fairest show is all a living heap and round their little world the monsters creep who would on color dote or pleasing forms if beauty when discovered is but worms when the warm spring puts forth the opening bud the wakened insects find their ready food but when the summerdays dilate the gem stretch out the leaves and fix the growing stem they die unknown and numerous kinds succeed that bask in flowers or eat the ranker weed wanton in sultry heat and keep their place till autumnfruits produce a different race but though a thousand themes invite the muse yet greater subjects will from mean excuse they claim the grateful song whose prudent care has quenched the wasting flames of endless war late civil rage alarmed the trembling woods and bursting sulphur scared the sylvangods war felled the trees and spreading havoc made the nymphs could hardly find a sheltering shade now with less frightful sounds the fields are blessed the swains have leisure and the land has rest faction that hydra is no longer feared her heads are lopped and all the wounds are seared when innovating schemes

tacitus on a fair mead a dunghill lay that rotting smoked and stunk away to an excessive bigness grown by nightmens labors on him thrown ten thousand nettles from him sprung who ever came but near was stung nor ever failed he to produce the baneful hemlocks deadly juice such as of old at athens grew when patriots thought it phocions due and for the man its poison pressed whose merit shone above the rest not far from hence strongrooted stood a sturdy oak itself a wood with friendly height oertopt the grove and looked the favorite tree of jove beneath his hospitable shade the shepherds all at leisure played they feared no storms of hail or rain his boughs protected all the plain gave verdure to the grass around and beautified the neighboring ground the gracious landlord joyd to see the prosperous vigor of his tree and often sought when in distress this oaks oracular redress sprung from the famed dodonian grove which told to men the will of jove his boughs he often with chaplets crowned with azure ribbons wreathed them round and there in golden letters wrought  ill to the man who evil thought with envious rage the dunghill viewed merit with honor thus pursued the injustice of the times he moand with inward jealousy he groaned a voice at length pierced through the smoke and thus the patriot dunghill spoke  if a proud look forerun a fall and insolence for vengeance call do

thou slave of a tiberian reign empson and dudley  star and garter  a knez  a menzicoff  a tartar the astonished farmers all around stood gaping at the impetuous sound the dunghill in high triumph lay and swore the oak had naught to say his work was done  the farmers all might gather round and see him fall no so the event  the oak was seen to flourish more in fresher green by scandal unprovoked he stood and answered thus the heap of mud  when folly noise and slander rage and calumny reforms the age they in the wise no passions raise their clamours turn to real praise yet sure hardfated is the tree reduced to spatter dirt with thee soon should a branch from off my side chastise thine insolence and pride did not the wise obtain their ends as well from enemies as friends thus some increase

the theory of tears a fragment by william stevenson esquire sunt lachrymae rerum   tears which the barrangd orators command are tears of pleasure for the fee in hand the greater this the more abundant those rated by price as wine by measure flows but wines a due hilarity impart their tears add gladness to the heavy heart grief when sincere by no vain proof appears too vast for the parade of formal tears so in the skies when deepchargd thunders brew no clouds descend in rain or melt in dew on tullys words when listening senates hung charmed by the living magic of his tongue few tears sufficed for tears then learned to flow less at the call of lucre than of woe once from the offered hand your fee withdraw that key which opes the cabinet of law tears then no more shall their full sluices break nor eyes amid the dew of rhetoric  speak thus when the sky a gloom of vapors shrouds thunders would mutter words through watery clouds alike so far each here the verse confines that both are empty marks and passive signs these from the touch of flames etherial rolled those from the no less subtle touch of gold this maxim then how much the truth beyond  hearts must with eyes for ever correspond reverse the adage and behold it true if you mankind through no false optics view the doctors tears if doctors weep at all that soon his patient will recover fall each salient vein that vibrates still to health beats in repugnance to the pulse of wealth each sign that to a happy crisis tends a tear resistless to its orbit sends but here the pointed satire fain would stop joy too like sorrow boasts her pearly drop from fleecy clouds on which the sunbeam plays often falls the dewshower interspersed with rays let candor then who scorns the partial plan sometimes mistake the doctor for a man  all hope is gone see how the doctor cries  his tears ah speak in silence from his eyes  good tender man  but say dear doctor say  is it too certain what your looks betray  has physic now no last resource to try  and must the sweet the lovely patient  die  but sure the dire disease in luckless hour  over youth and strength can scarcely boast the power  not yet attained the fevers wonted height  to make our noonday hopes all set in night  no heaven be praised with fervorlifted eyes  my tears are tears of joy the doctor cries  no more the fevers heats internal burn  no more deliriums big with fate return  mix those few cordials and your fears abate  our patients in a convalescent state short triumph his lank purse so empty felt each eye would fain from other motives melt now certain hopes healths kind prognostics give so soon cured patients how shall doctors live men must debauch take fevers faint and rave few hopes attend them and late periods save their fatal snares must wine and women spread or doctors go a begging for their bread but useless is the hint if meant as such mankind are sure too complaisant by much to suffer those who kindly them preserve from fell disease and death itself to starve now to the pulpit turns the muses eye there happily tears from proper fonts to spy for sure if such us any where overtake although withheld for friendships pressing sake though rarely found in rostrums it must be where god descends and mortals bend the knee where tears sincere in heavens pure eye disclose a finer twinkle than the diamond shows where all confess a tale that still begins how much religion suffers by their sins religion that sublime and gracious plan by which for angel we exchange the man but hold  all honor to the sacred gown though less revered the gemencircled crown a scoff contemptuous here or laugh of scorn were virtue to decry celestialborn were to defame the volume of the skies which penned by hand divine expanded lies far more for devils act less monstrous parts were to eraze gods image from our hearts degrade the gown religion and the text you must dread thought dethrone jehovah next the person from the office we divide to shun the stigma or of guilt or pride pride that betrays a littleness of mind and guilt indeed of an enormous kind tears gushing forth the parsons sight bedim his eyes like stars in mists uncertain swim nor wonder tears his cautious lids beguile for oh the melting pathos of his style who can behold him and refrain from tears none but the marblehearted wretch who  hears his head his heart his eyes all correspond like mutual friends of one another fond but had he been from selfcomplacence freed his head his heart his eyes had disagreed not joy but grief in tears had then indulged expressed her feelings and her doubts divulged this vain parade of partial tears is shown because the preachers to himself unknown in big effusive consciousness they run for what his pen not wicked heart has done his pens the sinner nor less oddly true his pens the generous expiator too yet stranger still dry eyes had shown his sense had he surpised his pen in one offense what could he all awake to feeling more had he himself been faulty over and over for acting ill who can in all excel sure heaven will pardon him for writing well his sins indeed are multiplied he owns as are his flocks which hourly he bemoans but say ye adepts how things fit to call has not his quill allpotent cancelled all but this not natures but the preachers law no tears can once but sacerdotal draw hence though the rapt selfconscious parson weeps no social tear a wellbred cadence keeps or if a courteous drop with his consents the cheek alone but not the heart relents they weep because they see but listen not or if they heard the substance all forgot thus womens eyes abundant use to flow ask them the reason why  they do not know but shall coarse satire quite engross the page and through the numbers spend its gloomy rage no let some gentle subject close the song to the soft passions softer strains belong the muse increasing ardors too may feel and kindle onward like a chariotwheel but not as chariots raise the dust around truth to obscure or reason to confound tears are the eyes pellucid dews that fall at pitys summons or at mercys call though ruthless eyes ofttimes affect them too as stones themselves distill a breathing dew as springs to earth allgently they impart a kindly genial softness to the heart tears when the mind enjoys unruffled ease for formsake shed or from desire to please are like those rains through sunshine often sent down from partial clouds when nature wears no frown tears are the special messengers akin to oracles on errands from within to tell mankind beyond conjectures vain those secrets friendship only can explain what active passions rise in tender strife what soft affections touch the springs of life tears are the silent language of the heart that more far more than empty sounds impart by which it loves oerburdend to complain when words would but offend or prove in vain tears ease the soul in anguish and despair leaving a sadlypleasing languor there thus closepent clouds dissolve in hasty showers by which the thunder loses all its powers by which the sky far as the view unfolds a temperature serene and softened holds tears are the gentle streams that off convey those floods that would overwhelm us by delay the hearts big swell much by misfortunes grieved that heaving soon would burst if not relieved tears are the tender proofs of love sincere in silence shed whence no reports take air shed as the tribute of congenial minds while each a more than vulgar transport finds false eyes indeed may weep if fame divulge but true affection only can indulge tears are the debt in pearly drops conveyed but more than pearls in price to merit paid in which none act the base insolvents part but those whom nature formed without a heart tears wait on vice and often on virtue too as winterclouds dissolve in summerdew tears though the cheek a partial mark retain wash out if shed aright a fouler stain which as it fainter and more faint appears makes angels envy humankind their tears tears are the silent arguments to tell that mans immortal though at first he fell immortal  for he weeps for joy ofttimes free from the sting of recollected crimes and what can natures law thus counteract what thus sensations springs reversed affect o thought sublime strong proofs inculcate hence how much inferior to the mind the sense dissolved in tears that feebly it reflects back to the soul what rapturous she expects as cynthia though in fullorbd glory bright but faintly represents her parent light thus men infer the soul superior must exist apart when dust returns to dust for if the body impotent withstands those transports she to infinite demands reason dare promise her desires immense as virtues longexpected recompense but when or where it is not for man to know that full enjoyment sense can never bestow when matter lives in various forms no more and all the farce of human life is over on the illness of dr turner president of c c c oxford by

entertainment neat and kind soon put these dangers out of mind with social friends we past the day and gaily laughed our cares away  at six we march but first provide to shun bad roads a faithful guide and shortly over the rising steep we saw the spire of bugden peep at breakfast near an hour we waste twas coffee grateful to the taste with dulcet cream and nutbrown toast then bid a valeas to our host over level roads we drive amain roads as the wellrolld terrace plain and soon reached stilton safe and well  we chose the inn that bears the bell on mutton charming food we dine and cheer our
