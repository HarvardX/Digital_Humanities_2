night an epistle to robert lloyd by the author  contrarius evehor orbi ovid london printed for the author and sold by w flexney near graysinn gate holborn m dcc lxi  price one shilling  night when foes insult and prudent friends dispense in pitys strains the worst of insolence often with thee lloyd i steal an hour from grief and in thy social converse find relief the mind of solitude impatient grown loves any sorrows rather than her own let slaves to business bodies without soul important blanks in natures mighty roll solemnize nonsense in the days broad glare we night prefer which heals or hides our care rogues justified and by success made bold dull fools and coxcombs sanctified by gold freely may bask in fortunes partial ray and spread their feathers opening to the day but threadbare merit dares not show the head till vain prosperity retires to bed missortunes like the owl avoid the light the sons of care are always sons of night the wretch bred up in methods drowsy school whose only merit is to err by rule who never through heat of blood was tripping caught nor guilty deemed of one eccentric thought whose soul directed to no use is seen unless to move the bodys dull machine which clockwork like with the same equal pace still travels on through lifes insipid space turns up his eyes to think that there should be among gods creatures too such things as we then for his nightcap calls and thanks the powers which kindly give him grace to keep good hours good hours  fine words  but was it ever seen that all men could agree in what they mean florio who many years a course has run in downright opposition to the sun expatiates on good hours their cause defends with as much vigor as our prudent friends the uncertain term no settled notion brings but still in different mouths mean different things each takes the phrase in his own private view with prudence it is ten with florio two go on ye fools who talk for talking sake without distinguishing distinctions make shine forth in native folly native pride make yourselves rules to all the world beside reason collected in herself disdains the slavish yoke of arbitrary chains steady and true each circumstance she weighs nor to bare words inglorious tribute pays men of sense live exempt from vulgar awe and reason to herself alone is law that freedom she enjoys with liberal mind which she as freely grants to all mankind no idol titled name her reverence stirs no hour she blindly to the rest prefers all are alike if they are alike employed and all are good if virtuously enjoyed let the sage doctor think him one we know with scraps of ancient learning overflow in all the dignity of wig declare the fatal consequence of midnight air how damps and vapors as it were by stealth undermine life and sap the walls of health for me let galen moulder on the shelf i will live and be physician to myself whilst soul is joined to body whether fate allot a longer or a shorter date i will make them live as brother should with brother and keep them in good humor with each other the surest road to health say what they will is never to suppose we shall be ill most of those evils we poor mortals know from doctors and imagination flow hence to old women with your boasted rules stale traps and only sacred now to fools as well may sons of physic hope to find one medicine as one hour for all mankind if rupert after ten is out of bed the fool next morning cannot hold up his head what reason this which me to bed must call whose head thank heaven never aches at all in different courses different tempers run he hates the moon i sicken at the sun wound up at twelve at noon his clock goes right mine better goes wound up at twelve at night then in oblivions grateful cup i drown the galling sneer the supercilious frown the strange reserve the proud affected state of upstart knaves grown rich and fools grown great no more that abject wretch disturbs my rest who meanly overlooks a friend distressed purblind to poverty the worldling goes and scarce sees rags an inch beyond his nose but from a crowd can single out his grace and cringe and creep to fools who strut in lace whether those classic regions are surveyed where we in earliest youth together strayed where hand in hand we trod the flowery shore though now thy happier genius runs before when we conspired a thankless wretch to raise and taught a stump to shoot with pilserd praise who once for reverend merit famous grown gratefully strove to kick his maker down or if more general arguments engage the court or camp the pulpit bar or stage if halfbred surgeons whom men doctors call and lawyers who were never bred at all those mightyletterd monsters of the earth our pity move or exercise our mirth or if in tittletattle toothpick way our rambling thoughts with easy freedom stray a gainer still thy friend himself must find his grief suspended and improved his mind whilst peaceful slumbers bless the homely bed where virtue selfapprovd reclines her head whilst vice beneath imagined horrors mourns and conscience plants the villains couch with thorns impatient of restraint the active mind no more by servile prejudice confined leaps from her seat as wakned from a trance and darts through nature at a single glance then we our friends our foes ourselves survey and see by night what fools we are by day stripped of her gaudy plumes and vain disguise see where ambition mean and loathsome lies reflection with relentless hand pulls down the tyrants bloody wreath and ravished crown in vain he tells of battles bravely won of nations conquered and of worlds undone triumphs like these but ill with manhood suit and sink the conqueror beneath the brute but if in searching round the world we find some generous youth the friend of all mankind whose anger like the bolt of jove is sped in terrors only at the guilty head whose mercies like heavens dew refreshing fall in general love and charity to all pleased we behold such worth on any throne and doubly pleased we find it on our own through a false medium things are shown by day pomp wealth and titles judgment lead astray how many from appearance borrow state whom night disdains to number with the great must not we laugh to see you lordling proud snuff up vile incense from a fawning crowd whilst in his beam surrounding clients play like insects in the suns enlivening ray whilst jehu like he drives at furious rate and seems the only charioteer of state talking himself into a little god and ruling empires with a single nod who would not think to hear him law dispense that he had interest and that they had sense injurious thought beneath nights honest shade when pomp is buried and false colors fade plainly we see at that impartial hour them dupes to pride and him the tool of power god help the man condemned by cruel fate to court the seeming or the real great much sorrow shall he feel and suffer more than any slave who labors at the oar by slavish methods must he learn to please by smoothtongud flattery that cursed courtdisease supple to every wayward mood strike sail and shift with shifting humours peevish gale to nature dead he must adopt vile art and wear a smile with anguish in his heart a sense of honor would destroy his schemes and conscience never must speak unless in dreams when he has tamely borne for many years cold looks forbidding frowns contemptuous sneers when he at last expects good easy man to reap the profits of his labored plan some cringing lacquey or rapacious whore to favors of the great the surest door some catamite or pimp in credit grown who tempts anothers wife or sells his own steps cross his hopes the promised boon denies and for some minions minion claims the prize foe to restraint unpracticed in deceir too resolute from natures active heat to brook affronts and tamely pass them by too proud to flatter too sincere to lie too plain to please too honest to be great give me kind heaven an humbler happier state far from the place where men with pride deceive where rascals promise and where fools believe far from the walk of folly vice and strife calm independent let me steal through life nor one vain wish my steady thoughts beguile to fear his lordships frown or court his smile unfit for greatness i her snares defy and look on riches with untainted eye to others let the glittering bawbles fall content shall place us far above them all spectators only on this bustling stage we see what vain designs mankind engage vice after vice with ardour they pursue and one old folly brings forth twenty new perplexed with trifles through the vale of life man strives against man without a cause for strife armies embattled meet and thousands bleed for some vile spot which cannot fifty feed squirrels for nuts contend and wrong or right for the worlds empire kings ambitious fight what odds  to us it is all the selfsame thing a nut a world a squirrel and a king britons like roman spirits famed of old are cast by nature in a patriot mould no private joy no private grief they know their souls engrossed by public weal or woe inglorious ease like ours they greatly scorn let care with nobler wreaths their brows adorn gladly they toil beneath the statesmans pains give them but credit for a statesmans brains all would be deemed even from the cradle fit to rule in politics as well as wit the grave the gay the fopling and the dunce start up god bless us statesmen all at once his mighty charge of souls the priest forgets the courtbred lord his promises and debts soldiers their same misers forget their pelf the rake his mistress and the fop himself whilst thoughts of higher moment claim their care and their wife heads the weight of kingdoms bear females themselves the glorious ardour feel and boast an equal or a greater zeal from nymph to nymph the state infection flies swells in her breast and sparkles in her eyes over whelmed by politics lie malice pride envy and twenty other faults beside no more their little fluttering hearts confess a passion for applause or rage for dress no more they pant for public rareeshows or lose one thought on monkeys or on beaux coquettes no more pursue the jilting plan and lustful prudes forget to rail at man the darling theme caecilias self will choose nor thinks of scandal whilst she talks of news the cit a commoncouncilman by place ten thousand mighty nothings in his face by situation as by nature great with nice precision parcels out the state proves and disproves affirms and then denies objects himself and to himself replies wielding aloft the politician rod makes p  by turns a devil and a god maintains even to the very teeth of power the same thing right and wrong in half an hour now all is well now he suspects a plot and plainly proves whatever is is not fearfully wise he shakes his empty head and deals out empires as he deals out thread his useless scales are in a corner flung and europes balance hangs upon his tongue peace to such triflers be our happier plan to pass through life as easy as we can who is in or out who moves this grand machine nor stirs my curiosity nor spleen secrets of state no more i wish to know than secret movements of a puppetshew let but the puppets move i have my desire unseen the hand which guides the masterwire what is it to us if taxes rise or fall thanks to our fortune we pay none at all let muckworms who in dirty acres deal lament those hardships which we cannot feel his grace who smarts may bellow if he please but must i bellow too who sit at ease by custom safe the poets numbers flow free as the light and air some years ago no statesman ever will find it worth his pains to tax our labors and excise our brains burdens like these vile earthly buildings bear no tributes laid on castles in the air let then the flames of war destructive reign and englands terrors awe imperious spain let every venal clan and neutral tribe learn to receive conditions not prescribe let each newyear call loud for new supplies and tax on tax with doubled burden rise exempt we sit by no rude cares oppressed and having little are with little blessed all real ills in dark oblivion lie and joys by fancy formed their place supply nights laughing hours unheeded slip away nor one dull thought foretells approach of day thus have we lived and whilst the fates afford plain plenty to supply the frugal board whilst mirth with decency his lovely bride and wines gay god with temperance by his side their welcome visit pay whilst health attends the narrow circle of our chosen friends whilst frank good humor consecrates the treat and  makes society complete thus will we live though in our teeth are hurled those hackney strumpets prudence and the world prudence of old a sacred term implied virtue with godlike wisdom for her guide but now in general use is known to mean the stalkinghorse of vice and follys screen the sense perverted we retain the name hypocrisy and prudence are the same a tutor once more read in men than books a kind of crafty knowledge in his looks demurely sly with high preferment blessed his favorite pupil in these words addressed would thou my son be wise and virtuous deemed by all mankind a prodigy esteemed be this thy rule be what men prudent call prudence almighty prudence gives thee all keep up appearances there lies the test the world will give thee credit for the rest outward be fair however foul within sin if thou will but then in secret sin this maxims into common favor grown vice is no longer vice unless it is known virtue indeed may barefaced take the field but vice is virtue when it is well concealed should raging passions drive thee to a whore let prudence lead thee to a postern door stay out all night but take especial care that prudence bring thee back to early prayer as one with watching and with study faint reel in a drunkard and reel out a saint with joy the youth this useful lesson heard and in his memory stored each precious word successfully pursued the plan and now room for my lord  virtue stand by and bow and is this all  is this the worldlings art to mask but not amend a vicious heart shall lukewarm caution and demeanor grave for wise and good stamp every supple knave shall wretches whom no real virtue warms gild fair their names and states with empty forms whilst virtue seeks in vain the wished for prize because disdaining ill she hates disguise because she frankly pours forth all her store seems what she is and scorns to pass for more well  be it so  let vile dissemblers hold unenvied power and boast their dearbought gold me neither power shall tempt nor thirst of pelf to flatter others or deny myself might the whole world be placed within my span i would not be that thing that prudent man what cries sir pliant would you then oppose yourself alone against an host of foes let not conceit and peevish lust to rail above all sense of interest prevail throw off for shame this petulance of wit be wise be modest and for once submit too hard the task against multitudes to fight you must be wrong the world is in the right what is this world a term which men have got to signify not one in ten knows what a term which with no more precision passes to point out herds of men than herds of asses in common use no more it means we find than many fools in same opinions joined can numbers then change natures stated laws can numbers make the worse the better cause vice must be vice virtue be virtue still though thousands rail at good and practice ill would thou defend the gauls destructive rage because vast nations on his part engage though to support the rebel caesars cause tumultuous legions arm against the laws though scandal would our patriots name impeach and rails at virtues which she cannot reach what honest man but would with joy submit to bleed with cato and retire with pit steadfast and true to virtues sacred laws unmoved by vulgar censure or applause let the world talk my friend that world we know which calls us guilty cannot make us so unawed by numbers follow natures plan assert the rights or quit the name of man consider well weigh strictly right and wrong resolve not quick but once resolved be strong in spite of dullness and in spite of wit if to thyself thou can thyself acquit rather stand up assured with conscious pride alone than err with millions on thy side finis
