a collection of poetical essays  consisting of i an elegy on a pile of sacred ruins imitating the manner of mr cunninghams celebrated elegy ii elegiac reflections written in the vault of st nicholas church newcastle upon tyne iii fragment written among the ruins of tinmouth castle and monastery iv ode for the nativity of the messiah v miras despair an elegy vi ode to peace etc   by j b of newcastle upon tyne  newcastle upon tyne printed by i thompson esquire       and sold by the booksellers in town and country  preface contemplations on the fluctuating uncertainty of temporal things and the various evils and vicissitudes of human life as they have in all ages claimed the attention of the good and serious part of mankind so are in a more particular manner beneficial to the interests of christianity  they may be considered i presume as so many addenda to throw light and moral confirmation upon those volumes of revealed will which though presented to us in the medium of a critically imperfect translation proceed in their divine originals from the immediate inspiration of unerring and eternal wisdom  by way of preface to these elegiac essays i have chosen to premise a few observations of this kind which to me at least appear the natural result of every candid and impartial enquiry after truth  whosoever takes an unprejudiced survey of the faculties of the human mind must necessarily acknowledge their constitution to be in many respects enigmatical and contradictory and indeed whether we examine the public annals of society or have regard to the private information of our own consciences whether the characters of the learned or illiterate become objects of our consideration the truth of this assertion is made equally clear and conspicuous  separately we may discern the same longing desires after happiness and yet voluntary subjection to misery the same boasted imaginary strength and weakness when tested by experience  the same love of truth and leaning credulity toward error  in a word the same diametrically opposite inclinations of virtue and vice  though varied in proportion to an endless variety of circumstances producing them may be easily traced through the general tenor of the actions of mankind and upon the whole form so intricate a knot of contraricties as unassisted reason shall by no means be able to unloose  if we further add to this seemingly unaccountable composition of the mind that multiplicity of disorders pains and disastrous accidents to which the body stands particularly exposed we may with hippocrates almost venture to affirm  the whole man from his birth is a disease we may exclaim with the poet o life tremendous interval of birth and death who shall recount thy ills what hand shall pen the immeasurable logarithm of woes mental anxieties corporeal pains that twixt these solemn periods intervene and with all possible justness and propriety may denominate man the riddle of the creation  i would infer from these observations the apparent necessity of divine revelation how highly it behooves us to listen to the infallible dictates of this great conductress whose peculiar province it is to point out the hidden causes of all the inevitable miseries and misfortunes of human life as also how diffident we ought to be in trusling solely to the directions of this so much boasted rational faculty which is but moleeyd at best and whose chief constituent seems to be an inherent pride which refuses to put on the christian yoke and of consequence secludes us from being objects of the favor of the supreme benignity  this blind reliance on our own strength loosens insensibly the ties of our dependence upon him who is allsufficient  we imperceptibly become ashamed of conversing with him by prayer  regard as superfluity the tributary incense of gratitude and praise  and at length wilfully shut our eyes against the midday beams of the sun of righteousness  hence irreligion profaneness grovelling sensuality and all that black catalogue of crimes which are the evident marks of the benighted unregenerate mind  hence the beau monde the papilios of the human race place their chief happiness in contemplating the finery of their own dress the prude or coquette is more solicitous of admiration in a brilliant assembly upon earth than studious to adorn herself for the inexpressibly magnificent assembly of the firstborn in heaven  upon the whole pride may be justly styled the primum mobile of evil the sire of sin the source of mischief and the bane both of temporal and eternal felicity  j b  argument elegy may be termed with metaphorical propriety the eldest daughter of meditation and highly merits the veneration of the learned and benevolent as being a species of the greatly diversified science of poetry every way adapted to the serious taste or solemn temper of the human soul when her theme contemplates the short duration of all earthly grandeur in the awful ruins of temples towers and other superb edifices become a prey to time we are naturally led by her to a reflection on the empty efforts of ambitious art the imbecility of mortal power and the changing inconstancy and vicissitude of all sublunary things   the public candor is here more particularly requested as the following essays are the first offspring of a juvenile muse and on many accounts of time person and circumstance have been liable to hinderance and unavoidable difficulties if the attempt merits the least shadow of approbation let the censorious criticisins of the injudicious be its encomium  an elegy on a pile of sacred ruins the solemn temples yea the great globe itself and all which it inherit shall dissolve and like the baseless fabric of a vision leave not a wreck behind shakesp i in a lone villa the oncelovd retreat where cloyed with crowds wealth sought the silvan shade near the fallen rubbish of some rural seat a ruined temple towers its tottering head ii the mossgrown walls high pild in gothic pride stand timedefacd with many a widerent flaw nor fails the prospect viewed on every side timprint the musing mind with solemn awe iii sadly sequestered mid the dreary waste a row of blasted yew trees gloom around redoubling terror and the peasants haste that treads perforce the longuntrodden ground iv soon as cool evening closed the sunscorchd day i left the laughing throng in

thy fruitful womb though teemed unnumrous short lived victims fall alike the rockreard tower and trophied tomb meet dissolution at thy crumbling call xxii thrice happy he in calm contentments dale far

elegiac reflections wrote in the vault of st nicholas church newcastle this vault is said to have been the place of interment for the perey family in past ages but without warrantable authority as the shrine of henry earl of northumberland who was tumultuously massacred at cockslodge near york in the  th year of the reign of henry vii is asserted to have been in the northeast corner where the beautiful and magnificent tomb of sir george selby lately stood however from a parity of circumstances it must undoubtedly have been the receptacle of some ancient and illustrious family  mista senum

her headlong way love or that soft interchange of affection between the sexes so called when it acts in due subordination to the superior love duty veneration and gratitude owed him who for wise purposes has implanted it in our breasts is productive of the most happy and beneficent effects but on the other hand when the possession or enjoyment of the object beloved is made the summum bonum of our happiness may be termed the origin of much evil and an enthusiasm which too often leads its unhappy followers like mira in the elegy to plunge themselves from the rocky precipices of despair into an ocean of ruin and irretrieveable misery  ode to peace i hail born of heaven thou source of social store britannia hails thee to her seagirt shore with laureled wreaths and conquest crowned her
