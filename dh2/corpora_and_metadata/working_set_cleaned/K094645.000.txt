sympathy or a sketch of the social passion  a poem  the third edition  london printed for t cadell  m dcc lxxxi  introduction the reader is requested to consider the following poem as nothing more than what a part of its title page expresses  a sketch and only a sketch of the social passion or sympathetic principle applied first to the authors particular situation and thence extended more generally as influencing the whole animal creation  upon visiting the villa of a friend and finding it deserted by a family extremely dear to the author he experienced precisely the sensations he has endeavored to describe it was natural for him to pass beyond his own case and contemplate that of others under similar circumstances the fairest productions of animated nature were before him they occupied the same spot he was seated in the midst of them his heart dilated if as seems to be admitted a virtuous enthusiasm be necessary to the proper enjoyment of such scenery the critic of nature will hardly know how to be offended should he find that here and there have been indulged effusions which if closely examined when the mind is cold may be sound not altogether in strict connection  it were easy to have thrown out from the argumentative parts some sentiments not quite in keeping with the theme but zealous to prove the powers of universal sympathy the writer felt the sollicitudes of an author united with those of a philanthropist of course the idea of obliterating what had any chance of cementing the social affections was too painful to be adopted  if therefore candor should urge that in stepping occasionally out of his path his intention has been rather to gather flowers than weeds he will be forgiven the poetical license becomes a matter rather of right than of courtesy when an author pleads his privilege in the cause of benevolence he pretends not to have preserved an exact correspondence between the several members  immethodical however as the poem confessedly is the lucidus ordo of composition has not been by any means wantonly discarded nor ought the author to conceal what it is indeed his chief pride to acknowledge the obligations he is under to some of the first and greatest writers in this country for many valuable hints of which he has availed himself in the course of the performance  sympathy book i oer you fair lawn where often in various talk the favoring muses joined our evening walk up yonder hill that rears its crest sublime where we were wont with gradual steps to climb to woo the dewbathd zephirs on the wing and hear the lark her earliest matin sing fast by you shed of roots and verdure made where we have paused companions of the shade in yonder cot just seated on the brow whence unobserved we viewed the world below whence often we culled fit objects for our song from land or ocean largely stretched along the morning vapors passing through the vale the distant turret or the lessening sail the pointed cliff which overhangs the main the breezy upland or the opening plain or down yon footway saunterd by the stream whose little rills ran tinkling to the theme more softly touched the woe in hammonds lay or lapsed responsive to the lyre of gray over these dear bounds like one forlorn i roam over these dear bounds i fondly called my home and yet to touch me various powers combine here summer revels with a warmth divine the bloomy season every charm supplies from earths rich harvest crowned with cloudless skies or future plenty bursting through the grain from golden sheaves that circle round the swain here as i stop beneath elizas tree far oh beloved associate far from thee some little change thy absence to declare i pray to find and friendship forms the prayer less bright the sunbeams or less soft the showers some essence wanting to the fruits or flowers those fruits and flowers alas more ripe appear and the lawn smiles as though my friend were here from the soft myrtle brighter blossoms spring in mellower notes the plumy people sing near yonder church where we retired to pray the good mans modest cottage i survey the pious pastor who each sabbath taught the listening rustics noblest reach of thought that modest cottage and its garden still seek the soft shelter of the friendly hill the columnd smoke still curls its wreathes around and not one lessened beauty marks the bound as near you bower with pensive steps i go to view the shrubs your culture taught to grow the fair exotics boast a happier bloom than when their patron shared the rich perfume the orange still its tawny luster shows the late rose reddens and the balsam blows while roving over the hedge the woodbine fair embalms with heavens own essence heavens own air not softer and not sweeter flew the gale when we together trod this blooming vale when far beyond the busy worlds control nature our guide we opened all the soul whence this neglect say in thy loved domain where all the virtues in thy presence reign where gathering round thee youth and age conspire while some as brother court thee some as sire where all the social passions softly blend to give the similing neighborhood a friend where somewhat of thy gentle heart is seen a grace or goodness adding to the green where the babe lisps thy mercies on the knee and second childhood leans it is crutch on thee whence this neglect ingratitude retreat go and in shades less sacred fix thy seat go to the treacherous world thy proper sphere but oh forbear to scatter poisons here about this dwelling and these harmless bounds friendship and love alone should take their rounds fair as the blossoms which the walls sustain rich as the fruits and generous as the grain secure as yonder warblers nesting near like honor steady and like faith sincere but soft my friend though shrubs and bowers remain the fixed productions of the unconscious plain though these no gentle sympathies can know but as the planter bends them learn to grow to higher parts as nature lifts her plan the kinder creatures happily feel for man the tame domestics which attend his board happily partake the fortune of their lord his presence hail his absence long deplore droop as he droops and die when he is no more pleased at the thought still onward let me tread where flocks and herds diversify the mead where breathing odours winnowd by the gale fan the soft bosom of the smiling vale behind the rooks their brawling councils hold and the proud peacock trails his train of gold around the doves their purple plumage show and clucking poultry saunter pleased below while there the housedog with accustomed glee fawns on the hind  and never remembers thee these crop the food those press the flowery bed nor weep the absent nor bewail the dead their stinted feelings seem but half awake dull as you steer now slumbering in the brake whence then the gloom that gathers in the sky whence the warm tear now starting to the eye whence then the apparent change when friends depart it is fancy striking on the feeling heart it is varied fancy whose aetherial wand bids plastic nature move to her command oh should i follow where she leads the way what magic meteors to her touch would play far far from thee this sun which gilds my brow in deep eclipse would darken all below the herds though now plain reason sees them feed smit by her touch would languish in the mead the breeze which now disports with yonder spray the flocks which pant beneath the heats of day the pendent copse in passing shadows dressed the scanty herbage on the mountains crest the balmy powers that essence every gale the glassy lakes that fertilize the dale struck by her mystic scepter all would fade and sudden sadness brood along the shade thus chloe weds but she the garland twines thus bacchus revels but she twists the vines thus falls a friend but she around the grave bids willows whisper and the cypress wave as poets sing thus fancy takes her range whose fairy fables can the system change soon as the generous master leaves his home behold how thick the alterations come soon as the muchloved mistress quits the scene the earth be sure no longer smiles in green in solemn sable every flower appears and skies relent in sympathizing tears scarce had the bard of leasowes loved domain closed his dimmed eye upon the conscious plain ere birds and beasts and hills and dales it is said mourned his sad fate and funeral honors paid his gay parterres a serious habit wore his larks would sing his lambs would frisk no more a deeper cadence murmured from the floods and elegiac sorrow shook his woods a solemn dirge the sable raven sung the muses wept their lyres were all unstrung but chief his bowers their verdant honors shed and every laurel knew that he was dead yet separate facts from fairy scenes like these nature we find still keeps her first decrees the order due which at her birth was given still forms the unchanging law of earth and heaven in one fair tenor on the circle goes and no obstruction no confusion knows when shenstone nay when shakespeare pressed the tomb the shrubs that saw their fate maintained their bloom clear ran the streams to their accustomed shore nor gave one bubble less one murmur more nor did a single leaf a simple flower or fade or fall to mark their mortal hour but is it fancy all what no reserve from one dull point can nature never swerve is change of seasons all the change she knows from autumns sickly heats to winter snows from chilling spring to summers dog star rage from boy to man from man to crawling age these her transitions lingering sad and slow whence then embraced by flowers my bosoms woe ah is it fancy that with silent pace impels me thus to range from place to place on every side to see an harvest bend yet look on every side to find my friend or is it fancy makes the village train for now it is evening sport around in vain that plighted pairs amidst the hazel boughs to me unseen impart their tender vows while unsuspicious of a witness near they mix with natures language natures tear that twilights gentle gray which now comes on to wait a sober handmaid on the sun to watch his parting tinge his softened fires then blush with maiden grace as he retires the crescent moon which now ascended high her silver mantle throws across the sky the still serene that seems to lull the breeze soft in a leafy cradle midst the trees the lessened sound of yonder requiem bell with resignation in each mournful knell the dropping dew that settles on my cheek the frugal lights that from each cottage break the justdroppd latch the little lattice closed to shield from eves damp air the babe reposed and note the hour when temperance and health give the pale vigils of the night to wealth say is it fancys vision works the charm when these blessed objects lose their power to warm ah no from other sources springs the smart its source is here hard pressing on my heart yes it is the heart which rules the roving eye and turns a gloomy to a cloudless sky the soft magician governs every scene blossoms the rock or desolates the green along the heath bids fancied roses blow and sunshine rise upon a world of snow yes it is the heart endears each smiling plain or to his native mountain binds the swain his native mountain where his cottage stands more loved more fair than all the neighboring lands for though the blast be keen the soil be bare his friends his wife his little ones are there oh had the brother of my heart been nigh when morning threw her mantle over the sky or when gay noon a gaudier robe displayed or modest evening took her softest shade then had each shrub breathed forth its full perfume and like the flowers the feelings been in bloom for still to prove the natal bias right the senses with the season must unite the bias social man with men must share the varied benefits of earth and air the leading law of life which governs all to some in large degrees to some in small to lowest insects highest powers a part wisely dispensed to every beating heart to every creature just proportions given from the moles mansion to the seraphs heaven see the winged legions which at noontide play together clustring in the solar ray there sports the social passion see and own that not an atom takes its flight alone the unwieldy monsters of the pregnant deep the savage troops that through the forest sweep the viewless tribes that populate the air the milder creatures of domestic care the rooks which rock their infants on the tree the race which dip their pinions in the sea the feathered train gay tenants of the bush the glossy blackbird and the echoing thrush the gaudy goldfinch which salutes the spring winnowing the thistle with his burnished wing joves eagle soaring to you orb of light auroras lark and cynthias bird of night all these the laws of sympathy declare and chorus heavens first maxim born to share instinct or sympathy or what you will the social principle is active still of every element it glows the soul touches pervades and animates the whole floats in the gale surrounds earths wide domain ascends with fire and dives into the main whilst dull or bright the affections know to play as full or feebly darts this social ray dimly it gleams on insect fish and fowl but spreads broad sunshine over mans favored soul mans favored soul then trace through every state and see it fitted for a social fate behold how nature to connection tends each seeks from each his relatives and friends you spacious dome which earth and sea commands where titus dresses his paternal lands where water gushes and where wood extends to share each beauty titus calls his friends a naked waste till they adorn his flowers a desert scene till they partake his bowers nor this though sweet the greatest bliss he feels that greatest bliss his modesty conceals pass the green slope which bounds his fair domain and seek the valley dropping from the plain there in a blossomed nook by pomp unseen an aged couple lead a life serene and there behind those elms a sickly pair exchange their labors for a softer care twas titus gave to sickness this repose and placed lifes second cradle near the rose in his own hall though louder joys prevail a dearer transport whispers from the vale though mirth and frolic echo through the dome in those small cots his bosom finds a home fame fortune friends can providence give more go ask of heaven the blessings of the poor a greater comfort would you still supply then wipe the tear from sorrows streaming eye for social kindness to another shown expands the bliss to make it more your own lo the rude savage naked and untaught shares with his mate what arts and arms have caught when winter darkness clouds his long long night see how he strives to find the social light his woodland wife his forest children dear smooth the bleak storms that sadden half his year for them he tracks the monster in the snow for them he hurls his sling and twangs his bow nor scorching sunshine nor the driving shower the vollied thunder nor the lightnings power nor climes where sickness pants in every breeze nor worlds of ice where nature seems to freeze checks the fair principle which bursts away like sol when clouds attempt his noontide ray hence ever lean the feeble on the strong as tender sires their children lead along while by degrees as transient life declines and florid youth to withering age resigns the social passion shifts with place and time and tender sires are led by sons in prime the guide becomes the guided in his turn while child and parent different duties learn not then from fancy only from the heart pours the keen anguish on the immortal part and truth herself destroys the bloom of may when death or fortune tears a friend away from virtuous passion virtuous feeling flows the grief that dims the lilly and the rose drops a soft sorrow for a friend in dust there truth and fancy both may rear the bust while one pours forth the tribute of the heart the other plies her visionary art potent she calls her airy specter round and bids them instant consecrate the ground in magic circles lo the illusions come to shroud the earth in monumental gloom fancy presides as sovereign of the scene and dark is every leaf of every green whilst reason loves to mix with here is the tear and the fair mourners form a league sincere her airy visions fancy may impart and reason listen to the charmers art in lifes fair morn i knew an aged seer who sad and lonely past his joyless year betrayed heartbroken from the world he ran and shunned oh dire extreme the face of man humbly he reared his hut within the wood hermit his beard a hermits was his food nitchd in some corner where the gelid caves with chilling drops the rugged rockstone laves hour after hour the melancholy sage drop after drop to reckon would engage the lingering day and trickling as they fell a tear went with them to the narrow well then thus he moralizd as slow it past this brings me nearer lucia than the last and this now streaming from the eye said he oh my loved child will bring me nearer thee when first he roamd his dog with anxious care his wandrings watched as emulous to share in vain the faithful brute was bid to go vain sought the sage a solitary woe the pilgrim paused the attendant dog was near slept at his feet and caught the falling tear up rose the pilgrim up the dog would rise and every way to win a master tries then be it so come faithful fool he said one pat encouraged and they sought the shade an unfrequented thicket soon they found and both reposed upon the leafy ground mellifluous murmrings told the fountains nigh fountains which well a pilgrims drink supply and thence by many a labyrinth it led where every tree bestowed an evening bed skilled in the chase the faithful creature brought whatever at morn or moonlight course he caught but softest pity gave the sage to all nor saw unwept his dumb associates fall he was in sooth the gentlest of his kind and though a hermit had a social mind and why said he must man subsist by prey why stop you melting music on the spray why when assailed by hounds and hunters cry must half the harmless race in terror fly why must we work of innocence the woe still shall this bosom throb these eyes overflow a heart too tender here from man retires a heart that aches if but a wren expires thus lived the master good the servant true till to its god the masters spirit flew beside a fount which daily water gave stooping to drink the pilgrim found a grave all in the running stream his garments spread and dark damp verdure ill concealed his head crouchd in the water the survivor stood sickening with sorrow and rejecting food the faithful servant from that fatal day watched the loved corpse and piteous pined away five nights he filled the forest with his moan five nights he joined the passing spectres groan at length the screechowl flapping boded death and soon the servant yielded up his breath his head upon his masters cheek was found while the obstructed waters mourned around but sordid souls are ever in distress to bless himself each must a second bless then kindle on till he the world embrace and in loves caestus gird the human race thus social grief can finer joys impart than the dull pleasures of a miser heart thus with more force can melancholy warm than wild ambitions solitary charm and oh just heaven what gift can thou bestow what gem so precious as a tear for woe a tear more full of thee oh power divine than all the dross that ripens in the mine as man with man with creature creature keeps in summer feeds in view in winter creeps more close but take the lamb apart from its loved mother then the social heart plains in its voice while sad the dam around bleats over the theft and leaves uncropt the ground in yonder huts at this profound of night the twelfth hour striking as these lines i write in yonder scattering huts now every swain with every maid and matron of the plain in sleeps soft arms on wholesome pallets pressed breathe forth the social passion as they rest but should dire fate the father make its prey or snatch untimely one loved child away should the fair damsel sicken in her bloom or bear the faithful housewife to the tomb no aid from fancy seeks the sorrowing heart but truth with force unborrowd points the dart for me as weary of myself i rise to seek the rest which wakeful thought denies over the long mansion as i lonely range condemned at every step to feel the change through each apartment where so often my heart has shared each grace of nature and of art where memory marks each object that i see and fills the bosom oh my friend with thee through each apartment as i pass along pause for relief and then pursue my song for me who now with midnight taper go in sleep to soothe a solitarys woe no greater good my closing thoughts can bless ere this remembered little couch i press than the sweet hope that at this sacred hour my friend enjoys kind natures balmy power than the soft wish that on my bended knee i offer up eliza warm for thee wife of my friend alike my faithful care alike the object of each gentle prayer far distant though thou art thy worth is near and my heart seals its blessing with a tear end of the first book book ii and now again it is morn the orient sun prepares once more his radiant course to run over you tall trees i see his glories rise tinge their green tops and gain upon the skies the social principle resumes the shade basks on the banks or glides along the glade see how it pants my friend in yonder throng where half a village bear thy sheaves along low stoops the swain to dress his native soil and here the housewife comes to soothe his toil while heavens warm beams upon her bosom dart she strains her wedded husband to her heart or from his brow the labored drop removes and dares to show with what a force she loves wherever the mother moves her race attend and often cull the corn and often bend or bear the scrip or tug the rake along or catch the burden of the reapers song or shrinking from the sickles crescent blade cling to the gown half pleased and half afraid while he who gave them life looks on the while and views his little household with a smile imprints the kiss then blessing every birth carols his joy and cultivates the earth but not to scenes of peasantry confined though happily those more free and unconfined not to this spot the object of thy care nor to the neighboring greens that checquer fair the views which stretch beyond the western main and mark the district of a different plain not circumscribed to these the social plan which more extends as more pursued by man just as you pathway winding through the mead grows broad and broader by perpetual tread the social passion turns the foot aside and prompts the swains to travel side by side both edge by turns upon the bordring sod and the path widens as the grass is trod in cities thus though trades tumultuous train spurn at the homely maxims of the plain not all the toss of rank the trick of art can chase the social passion from the heart nay more a larger circle it must take where men embodying larger interests make and each perforce round each more closely twine where thousands lean their weight upon the line as slow to yonder eminence i bend gradual the views of social life extend where benches soften the ascent i stray and stop at each to take a just survey at every step as sinks the vale behind a wider prospect opens on mankind far to the lest where those blue hills arise and bathe their swelling bosoms in the skies the barks of commerce set the flapping sail and the dark seaboy sues the busy gale there the deep warehouse shows its native store and there flame riches of a foreign shore thick swarm the sons of trade on every hand and either india breathes along the strand gold give me gold each bustler cries aloud as hope or fear alternate seize the crowd to careless eyes the love of pelf alone seems to drain off the golden tide for one but closer viewed a various course it takes and wide meanderings in its passage makes through many a social channel see it run and carry plenty down from sire to son from thence in many a mazy stream it flows and feels no ebb nor dull stagnation knows gain pleasure passion property induce each single man to study general use thus nature and necessity agree the social chain to stretch from land to sea thus even the miser opes his sordid soul loves but himself and yet befriends the whole ask you a stronger proof place wealth alone with some hard niggard lock up all his own pile bills and bags and bonds upon his shelf and a close prisoner chain him to his pelf unhappy man from family and friends from all which heaven in soft compassion sends from touch of kindred tune of tender speech and exiled from the social passions reach how would he sigh his station to regain and buy a glance at man with half his gain how at some chink or crevice would he ply and envy each poor beggar limping by far happier he who breasting every wind lives on the common mercy of his kind who roams the world to tell his piteous case and dies at last amidst the human race ye friends to self ye worshippers of gold who deem a passion lavished if unsold who farm the principles with statesmans art and like a usrer traffic with the heart who to that idol in its nich confine the holy incense due at natures shrine say can your sordid merchandise deny the sacred force of heavenborn sympathy ah no the generous spirit takes a part as goodness glory pity move the heart else why at every virtue do we glow else why at sorrow do the eyes overflow why with the fabled hero do we bleed and scorn the base and love the generous deed why every turn of fortune do we share as with old homers chiefs we rush to war why with the wife of hector do we mourn weep with poor priam with achilles burn attentive hear apollos priest complain or join our griefs for good patroclus slain spite of your arts the sympathies arise and aid the cause of all the brave and wise spite of your little selves when virtue charms to nature true the social passion warms vain to resist imperial nature still asserts her claim and bends us to her will hence the great principle to all expands thaws laplands ice and glows on indias sands above below its genial splendours play wherever an human footstep marks the way oh for one trace of man upon the snow the track of sweet society to show oh for one print on swarthy africs shore thus prays the wanderer escaped from oceans roar in every clime is felt the throb divine by land by water here and at the line nor climates only for each age imparts the kindly bias to our social hearts see the swathed infant cling to the embrance and feel instinctive fondness for its race see it ascending strengthen as it grows till ripe and riper the affection glows then view the child its toys and trinkets share with some loved partner of its little care behold the man a firmer bond requires for him the passion kindles all its fires next see his numerous offspring twining near now move the smile and now excite the tear terror and transport in his bosom reign succession sweet of pleasure and of pain as age advances some sensations cease some lingering leave the heart while some increase thus when lifes vigorous passions are no more selflove creeps closest to the social power the stooping veteran of the silver hair crawls to the blazing hearth and wicker chair there huddled close he fondly hopes to spy his goodly sons and daughters standing by to the lispd tale he bends the greedy ear and over his childrens children drops a tear or every friend survived himself half dead frail nature still demands her board her bed and these some kindred spirit shall bestow his wants supply or mitigate his woe still symphathy shall watch his fleeting breath and gently lead him to the gates of death yet more even war the scourge of human kind but serves more close the social links to bind confederate courage forms the embattled line firm on each side connecting passions join it is social danger either troop inspires it is social honor either army fires it is social glory burnishes the van it is social faith spreads on from man to man these all combining agitate the breath stake life on life and hazard death for death as front to front the warring parties meet for social ends they dare the martial feat as breast to breast and eye to eye they fix for social ends they separate or mix king country parents children prompt the fight for these alone they bleed resist unite and happily first hostilities arose from nice distinctions made of friends and foes some scornful slight where nature most can smart some stinging insult sorest to the heart some wrong detected forfeited some trust a treaty broken or a barrier burst bade sympathy call justice to her aid till laws were fashioned and till wars were made affection sought from power the wished relief to smite the assassin and to hang the thief and over those who faiths fair league invade to wield the battleaxe or lift the blade or from the spoilers hand to fence the flowers that sweetly blossom round lifes private bowers it is thus the steady eye of reason finds what seems to snap the chain more closely binds and thus each peril like each pleasure tried unites the rosy bonds on either side but less do arms than arts assist the plan if those defend it is these embellish man these softly draw him nearer to his kind and mark distinct his seraph form of mind lo in firm compact hand and head and heart to aid the system take a helping part their various powers by various modes they lend and serve in union as one common friend hence by consent men clear the unthrifty wood new model earth and navigate the flood and hamlets grow into the citys pride while the soul opens like the talents wide by social pleasure profit passion swayed some soar to learning and some stoop to trade studious to gain the love of human kind the social sage at midnight stores his mind robs weary nature of her just repose nor drinks the dew that bathes the morning rose nor when the sun to cynthia gives the night eyes the soft blessing of her tender light but over the taper leans his pensive head and for the living communes with the dead the dusky artizan his effort made asserts his rights and leaves the sickly shade at eve he quits the spot where glooms annoy and seeks the bosom of domestic joy the social faggot and the light repast await to cheer him when his toils are past hence too each class of elegant and great art decks the dome and commerce crowds the street the heavenborn muse impetuous wings her way when her loved seward seeks the realms of day the painter hence his magic pencil plies and reynolds bids a new creation rise fair kauffman sketches lifes loved forms anew and holds the mirror of past times to view restores each grace that marked the grecian age and draws her lovely comment on the page and still to cheer the solitary hour for this has a very ingenious and rising artist who has painted for the author an admirable portrait of the gentleman to whom this poem is inscribed mr beach now resides at bath where he is gaining that celebrity which is due to uncommon genius and which nothing but uncommon modesty could so long have impeded beach displayed his happiest power when far from thee i hail his generous art and bless the hand which thus relieves my heart i see my friend upon the canvas glow and feel the smile that lightens every woe all sympathy is thine the immortal strung for thee that more than golden harp the tongue the spheres best music taught it to impart and bade each soft vibration strike the heart thine too the varied fruitage of the fields the clustering crops which yonder valley yields the mossy down which feeds a thousand sheep the bowers umbrageous and the cultured steep the still smooth joys that bloom over lifes serene and all the bustle of the public scene these several efforts slow or rapid rise as men are good or bad or weak or wise here quick there slow the impulse but the whole points to this center sympathy of soul nor think the dull cold reasoner can disprove these varied powers of sympathetic love nor hope ye cynics sedulous to find from partial spots a flaw in human kind as well the panther might you charge with sin and call each streak a blemish on his skin allow to self the broadest scope you can still breathes the social principle in man often when pride whispers that he stands alone his strength proceeds from other than his own often when he seems to walk the world apart anothers interest twines about his heart and call his project rash his effort vain still social pleasure is the end to gain or say this builds for pomp that digs for bread this shows you pictures that a pompous bed this toils a niggard at his lonely trade that rears the bower but asks not to its shade say for himself this bids the arches bend or that directs the column to ascend this through his grot commands the streams to glide as that for avarice braves the tossing tide that this for vanity his wealth displays as that for pride unravels learnings maze trace but their purpose to one general end you see it work the good of wife or friend parent or child their privilege still claim and social comfort springs from what we blame frailty itself our sympathy may spare a graceful weakness when no vice is there who hopes perfection breaks down natures fence and spurns the modest bounds of sober sense when strawlike errors lean in the former edition printed leap very improperly to virtues side ah check ye bigots check your furious pride some venial faults like clouds at peep of day blush as they pass and but a moment stay those venial faults from sordid bosoms start and spring up only in the generous heart as florid weeds elude the labourers toil from too much warmth or richness of the soil while meaner souls like zemblas hills of snow too barren prove for weeds or flowers to grow this then is clear while human kind exist the social principle must still subsist in strict dependency of one on all as run the binding links from great to small man born for man some friendly aid requires the contract strengthening till the soul retires nor then even then it breaks for still we pay a brothers homage to the breathless clay jealous of destiny the heart would save its favored object from the closing grave its favored object chosen from the rest in grief in joy the monarch of the breast to earth we trust what fondness would retain and leave the corpse to visit it again or unconsind by partial ties of blood brave sternest peril for a strangers good once and no second stroke of fancy this a truth too tender for the heart to miss once and not far from these loved feats serene just where you white huts peep the copse between a damsel languishd all her kin were gone for god who lent resumed them one by one disease and penury in cruel strife had ravished all the decent means of life even the marked crown her lovers gift she gave in filial duty for a fathers grave that so the honored clay which caused her birth might slumber peaceful in the sacred earth chimd to its grassgreen home with pious peal while hallowed dirges hymn the last farewell at length these searching woes her sense invade and lone and long the hapless wanderer strayed over the bleak heath around the unmeasured wood up the huge precipice or near the flood or mount the rock at midnights awful hour enjoy the gloom and idly mock the shower now scorn her fate now patient bend the knee and call on every star to set her free then starting wilder think those stars her foes now smite her breast now laugh amidst her woes or childlike chase the be or braid the grass or crop the hedgeflower or disordered pass else would she loiter in the midway mead sing to the birds at roost the lambs at feed or if a nest she found the brakes among no hand of here is destroyed the promised young and when kind nature brought the balmy sleep too soon she woke to wander and to weep across her breast the tangled tresses flew and frenzied glances all around she threw the unsettled soul those frenzied glances speak and tears of terror hurry down her cheek yet still that eye was bright that cheek was fair though pale the rose the lilly blossomed there a pilgrim swain the beauteous maniac found her woes wild warbling to the rocks around a river rolled beside aghast she ran her vain fears starting at the sight of man and save me god my fathers ghost she cried then headlong plunged into the sparkling tide the pilgrim follows strikes each eager limb but these alas his first essays to swim attempt how vain full wild the waters rose and over their heads in circling surges close he grasps the damsel struggling with the wave till both untimely find a watery grave and lives the man oh nature tell me where whose rebel bosom knows no triumph here whose coward cheek no tinge of honor feels flushed with no pride at what the muse reveals lives there who all unconscious could have stood to see the victim buffet with the flood if such a man if such a wretch there be thanks to this aching heart i am not he hail lovely griefs in tender mercy given and hail ye tears like dewdrops fresh from heaven hail balmy breath of unaffected sighs more sweet than airs that ventilate the skies hail sacred source of sympathies divine thine every social pulse each fiber thine hail symbols of the god to whom we owe the nerves that vibrate and the hearts that glow loves tender tumult friendships holy fires and all which beauty all which worth inspires the joy that lights the hopeillumind eye the bliss supreme that melts in pitys sigh affections bloom quick rushing to the face the choice acknowledged and the warm embrace oh power of powers whose magic thus can draw earth air and ocean by one central law join bird to bird to insect insect link from those which grovel up to those which think oh ever blessed whose bounties opening wide fill the vast globe for mortals to divide whose heavenly favors stretch from pole to pole encircle earth and rivet soul to soul cease then to wonder these loved scenes impart no more the usual transport to my heart though modest twilight visit eve again at whose soft summons homeward steps the swain though from the breath of oxen in the vale i catch the spirit of the balmy gale and from the brakes the answering thrushes sing while the gray owl sails by on solemn wing nor wonder if when morning blooms again in discontent i quit the flowery plain thus the poor mariner his traffic over crowds every sail to reach his native shore with smiles he marks the pennons stream to port and climbs the topmost mast to eye the fort dim through the mist the distant land appears and far he slopes to hail it with his tears from foreign regions foreign faces come anxious he seeks his muchloved friends at home warm and more warm the social passion glows as near and nearer to the place he goes quick beats his heart as pressing on he sees his own fair cottage canopyd with trees for there in blessed health he hopes to find his wife and cradled infant left behind panting he plucks the latch that guards the door but finds his wife his cradled babe no more like some sad ghost he wanders over the green droops on the blossomed waste and loathes the scene yet happily you by sympathy may know that here awhile i paused to paint my woe for sure if ever silph or silphid bore one true friends message to a distant shore if ever spirit whispered gentle deed in such an absence most its aid we need perhaps for now let fancy take her flight my friend like me may wander through the night amidst a different scenery may roam and many a gentle sigh address to home even now where moonbeams tremble on the wave and circling seagulls their long pinions lave where anchored vessels in the harbor ride to wait the flux of the returning tide where the salt billow beats against the strand my friend may take his solitary stand or on the rock projecting to the main may sit him down to mark the social strain along the frothing beach may bend his way and suit like me his sorrows to his lay farewell my hour approaches with the dawn and up i spring to leave the flowery lawn the pain increases as i stay to trace another sunshine rising over the place adieu then balmy shrubs and shades adieu this passing incense over your leaves i strew adieu thou dear and hillscreend cottage fair adieu thou decent dome of sunday prayer to each to all adieu your lonely guest retires the social passion speaks the rest the end
