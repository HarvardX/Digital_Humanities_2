an essay on cutaneous diseases and all impurities of the skin  proposing a specific and method of cure  by john gowland apothecary to his royal highness frederick late prince of wales the princess dowager of wales and also to his present majesty  london printed for the proprietors no    long acre and sold by mr johnson st pauls churchyard and mr murray in fleet street  price one shilling  entered at stationers hall  introduction innumerable are the agents which disturb our health and make us liable to a wonderful variety of disorders and diseases and it has ever been the business of the good physician to exert his application study and diligence in proportion to their danger and malignancy  physicians i say whose lives are occupied in destroying the existing causes of the different maladies to which we are subject and of reestablishing the good order of the animal economy are certainly the most noble portion of society the most useful and as cicero has expressed himself who nearest approach the divinity  cutaneous eruptions although an affection so very general an affection common to all ages all constitutions all cities and countries have from the enlightened received little more than mere theoretical discussion and thus unhappily they are not even yet advanced a long way in this branch of their art  the only reason of their not having made progress in this part of the science arises from an error which till lately was universally adopted concerning the origin of these diseases  every one seemed sure that a vice did exist in the blood which when carried to the surface of the body produced the different morbific appearances and each as vainly endeavored to determine the character and qualities of this imaginary vice their labors were necessarily abortive and as will ever be the case where the criterion cannot be found a variety of opinions necessarily arose  from these erroneous and false principles they deduced their medical indications or in other terms their method of cure and these methods were not unique but as numerous and as different as had been their particular opinions consequently by pursuing the false the true means were neglected this accounts for their backwardness and universal want of success in these complaints  the case is now different i say different because in those latter times physicians have known that the diseases of the skin are a local affection produced by a depraved and altered secretion of the extreme arterial vessels or the cutaneous glands which are in a preternatural state consequently this knowledge has led them to attempt the cure with topical or external medicines the effects have often corresponded with their expectation but often also their expectations have been frustrated for want of a specific remedy  experience only could bring forward this specific which physicians by simple reasoning alone never could discover  as all new doctrines in medicine amount to an impeachment of and directly militate against the judgment and practice of the day in which they are proposed they have therefore not only mens prejudices to encounter but also their pride and frequently nothing but the determination of the patients themselves can make their adoption general this was particularly instanced in the introduction of the bark inoculation etc etc  the situation of mr gowland as apothecary to the three royal households was particularly favorable and gave more frequent occasion to his experience in the complaints of which we are about to speak than most others and he laudably availed himself at an early stage of this doctrine with that alertness and observation which eventually produced the specific in question  he had observed the treatment employed on miss chudleigh by the physicians under whose care she was and the inefficacy with which it was attended and although his lotion was not administered until their efforts had failed of success its wonderful effects went beyond his own or even his patients hopes for a more particular account see the proprietors eleemosynary pamphlet  this fact alone was not sufficient to canonize the lotion and ensure to it the reputation of specific but a long use a scrutinizing and judicious observation was further necessary the fact however being known a great number of afflicted persons the more readily concurred to try the remedy this afforded him the opportunity of verifying and establishing the vast power of his lotion and at the same time was the most complete defense of his doctrine and his reputation against the invidious attacks of those interested men of his time whose practice it so directly militated against  this happy discovery of mr gowlands has been much more interesting and more useful to mankind than all the volumes written to this day upon eruptions of the skin as they contain nothing but theories and have always been defective in the most essential part namely the manner of curing etc  it is not enough to speak well upon diseases the thing more important is to relieve them  this recalls to my recollection the history of those two greek sculptors who were called by the senate in order to learn from them how they would execute a statue which might be allusive to an hero of greece and erect it to his glory one of them made a long discourse which showed him to have an exquisite taste and proved that he was completely master at least of the theory of his art as he finished the opinion of the other was required he answered in a few words i will do what my colleague has said and he was chosen by the senate because they desired the work and not a dissertation upon the work  i have no doubt that many physicians have spoken with more elegance and eloquence upon the impurities of the skin than mr gowland has done  but mr gowland relieved his patients  nor is this the only advantage enjoyed by him it will appear by this essay that he was acquainted with the true causes of this disease  the many reasons and proofs which both demonstrate his knowledge and the truth of the doctrine have received additional weight from having since appeared in the works of the most enlightened physicians of the present day and which prove incontrovertibly that the cutaneous affections are mere local affections  it is to be lamented that medical works are chiefly confined to the readings of medical men and of course however indispensable and wholesome the doctrine may be are therefore never thoroughly disseminated especially when repugnant to the general consumption of medicine how far that has been the case in what has formerly been written on this subject is left to the discernment of the reader this remark however may be made that the use of a topical remedy in cutaneous diseases must entirely supersede the use of internal medicine for these complaints from its pleasantness ease and certainty of cure hence some opposition may be expected from the selfish as well as the ignorant characters unhappily too common even in this profession  characters on whom the remark of cicero should be reversed there exists in this country a very vulgar but at the same time a very universal error respecting the term humor it is never used or thought of but we have an idea of virus or acrimony whereas the term literally means a fluid and this fluid is as likely to be good as bad the blood itself is a humor there is also a fluid or humor of the pericardium and of all cavities fit and necessary for preserving the viscera etc from friction and many others these are not morbid or vicious but absolutely good the only place in which the term is generally properly understood is when we speak of the humidity of the weather meaning a dampness in the air here the idea is just see any dictionary humor wet moist watery  humidity moisture  humid moisture watery etc and thus the ignorance of charlatans i say the ignorance of some and the wickedness of others in distorting this senseless term merely to frighten or alarm us thereby into a course of useless internal medicine and instead of forwarding to deter us from the only means of cure falls beneath our pity and are deservedly objects of our abhorrence and contempt     in the course of this essay the term secretion is of necessity often used  on a thorough knowledge and indeed intimate acquaintance with this term and the exact meaning of it in its fullest extent depends all the information the reader can gain and in proportion to his acquaintance therewith will be his information and acquaintance with the subject  by the term secretion people generally understand no more than certain secreted fluids or matters without considering at all the organs that produce them or the power of those organs to alter their properties from a natural state and according to the circumstances impress them with new characters and frequently characters of disease  by the term secretion physiologists understand a particular operation performed by the extremities of arterial vessels from which results a new animal product or in other terms a fluid which is furnished with new characters and properties sui generis and of their own distinct kind for instance the bile is elaborated in the liver and is not in the blood nor are its characters to be found in any other part of the human body again the fat is not in the blood but the arteries which terminate in the cellular membrane elaborate and compose it by a secret and inimitable combination of principles the poison of vipers is not found in the mass of their fluids on the contrary they are very innocent but it is created by particular organs endowed with that power  the same observation applies to all the secretions particularly that which takes place and is performed in the skin or surface of the body called perspiration  these operations are themselves very surprising and difficult to be understood it is however enough to know the effects and these effects are as has been observed generally of their own proper and natural kind  nor is this doctrine confined to animals alone it is the same in greens plants and flowers themselves their different colors smell taste etc are from a specific combination of parts the consequence of different secretions  since then the earth from which they have their nourishment has not in itself all the different principles qualities salts and juices which they themselves possess so it is necessary to allow that this combination is the result of the vessels of those vegetables adapted to an inherent power in them the same as the secretions of animals and if it is absurd to assert as it certainly is that these different products and matters exist ready performed in the earth so it should be equally absurd to think that the different secreted fluids in animals exist ready performed or that their characters are in the blood  in the perusal of this little work the intelligent reader it is presumed will find reasoning and fact founded on reflection and experiment agreeing with the truest principles of the art and not on simple speculation nor is it doubted but the truth and candor of mr gowlands essay will entitle his specific to that confidence which the experience of fifty years and the testimony of thousands in the first ranks of society have proved it to deserve  that the following pages had been intended for publication by mr gowland in his lifetime is evident  why it did not take place we are at a loss to surmise they were found among other ms papers after his death and have been submitted in that manuscript to a gentleman who from his philanthropy and medical talents is an ornament and a blessing to the country in which he lives the truth of the doctrine he declared was such and withal so little known that he should regret extremely if it was withheld this observation determined the present proprietors of his specific on its publication and they conceive they are doing no more than their duty to the public and to themselves in demonstrating also that this remedy has not suffered any diminution or lost any of its virtues in its mission from the inventors hand to theirs in proof of which they here adduce the following general testimony  certificate of the efficacy of the genuine gowlands lotion prepared by robert dickinson under the inspection of his fatherinlaw thomas vincent we whose names are hereunto subscribed being well satisfied that the use of the genuine gowlands lotion is calculated and adequate to cure the most violent eruptions of the face etc and also to cleanse and clear the skin in general we seel as if promoting a general benefit in permitting the proprietors to refer any person to us who may desire such satisfaction and also in authorizing them thus publicly to use our names  a cruger son to the member of parliament for bristol tho mayer of queensquare westminster and

patterson anstruther of ely house fifeshire and sisterinlaw to the member of parliament has savoured the proprietors with this very expressive declaration  i have found it a great cleanser and clearer of the skin though at first it occasioned rather an alarming scurf a p w anstruther  the respectability of those testimonies is such as must supersede the necessity of all further remark  preliminary observations among the chronical diseases the eruption of the skin is one affection the most common and at the same time the least dangerous it is not preceded by any causes capable of inducing a disorder in the animal economy and those who are thus afflicted always enjoy the best state of health this excludes the idea of that humoral vice to which some physicians ascribe every disorder when the cause thereof is unknown to them some learned english physicians however of the present day have taken away the veil to this species of imposture and have brought to light the vacuum that did exist in the hypothesis of humors and yet notwithstanding their efforts the same prejudices nevertheless exist and indeed are almost general from their works having been chiefly confined to the reading of medical men the humourists have never been able to support their opinion beyond the most simple conjecture the strongest of which is that the work of chylification and sanguification or of chyle and blood is often ill performed and consequently the fluids remove more or less from their natural state one might answer these gentlemen that if the aliments are not all converted into chyle the lymphatics or lacteal vessels of the intestines do not absorb the remainder and that they refuse admission to all matters which have either an acid or alkaline quality that is these vessels have a power of attracting what is proper for them and of repelling what is not thus their mouths become shut the instant their outer extremities are approached by these substances and except to some violent medicines open only to what is neutralised and fit for nutrition in order to demonstrate this we need but observe that there are always matters in the intestinal canal which are naturally in a corrupted state namely the residium of the chylification or excrements and which are refused upon the same principle  there is also in the intestines a quantity of gaz really mixed with the aliments and chyle but this is never absorbed by the lymphatics in the pure state of gaz i say never because if it should happen immediate death would be the certain consequence of such absorption in fact when this gaz or ethereal fluid are injected into the cellular of the skin or into the vessels of any animal the most dreadful disorders ensue and in general death itself this has been demonstrated by the experiments of the abbe vassalli and as to the sanguification it is demonstrated that the atmosphere makes this admirable process  changes and converts the fluids into animal substances and renders them proper for nutrition it is for this reason that in individuals who have a bad temperament or constitution the blood is as good as in the most robust and healthy this fine and precious observation is made by dr ballonius the hyppocrates of france  there are also positive vital powers in the life of the animal which prevent the degeneration of humors as is demonstrated by experiments and facts from which it results that the circulating fluids though they are not refreshed by new aliments preserve themselves innocent v haller physiolog  tit de fame et siti etc and lastly many organs exist in the animal body which continually purge and purify the mass of blood if by any accident heterogeneous matter should intermix therewith but without stopping any longer on this question i return to my subject  i have said that the cutaneous eruptions do not originate by any acrimony of the fluids their proximate cause is an altered secretion which takes place in the skin  that the perspiration be a secretion sui generis is a fact which wants no proof and it would be ridiculous to doubt and question upon any physiological point so evident as this is that every secretion is liable to be changed and more or less altered by a variety of circumstances there are many instances individuals who are seasick often bring up a great quantity of bile which is black and corrosive and is very far from being in a natural state it also happens frequently that children when cutting their teeth have very fetid diarrhoea from the stimulus of the gums communicating with the intestines it is an observation of sydenham that hysterical women sometimes vomit bilious and depraved matters which did not exist before the paroxism in the stomach nor in the bowels but which had been separated during the paroxism itself  in the same women as well as in the hypochondriacal when afflicted by their maladies a very copious quantity of urine is instantaneously separated and it is as limpid and clear as spring water this secretion is the sure or as physicians say the pathognomonicon sign of this disorder sometimes fear alone will suddenly arrest the menstrua sometimes anger will provoke an hemorrhage of the uterus grief and sorrow constantly occasion a greater secretion of bile and this fluid is sometimes so acrid as to produce convulsions or the more dreadful effects of melancholy or pains in the intestines or colic and if it be by any accident absorbed and brought into circulation excites some serious or fatal disorders the secretion of the milk by violent pathemata or passions of the mind has been on several occasions stopped and it often happens that its qualities are changed and vitiated in the last case the child is violently purged or affected with convulsionfits and other indispositions and disorders in a word every organ which nature has destined to perform any secretion is subjected to the influence of the nerves and as a certain consequence receives and partakes of all the affections of this system  now nothing is more certain than that those organs which are supplied with the greatest share of sensibility and which have a more intimate connection let me say with the nervous system will suffer more than other parts in exact proportion to the closeness of that connection i will now ask what part in the animal body has so much connection with or dependence on the nerves as the skin certainly none it is from the innumerable quantity of nerves which are interspersed throughout and actually terminate in the skin see the anatomy of the skin page     that this dependence and connection exists and thus it is that the anxieties emotions and troubles of the mind  the morbific state of the viscera the toothache a bad digestion and a hundred other causes are capable of influencing the transpiration and thereby materially affecting the health of the skin besides that the action of the atmosphere must be calculated and considered as one of the most obvious and powerful agents  the causes last spoken of do not always act for instance they do not act when the tone of the cutaneous vessels is above the irritability of the muscular fiber and sometimes although an impression be made upon those vessels nevertheless no eruption takes place because in this case the other secretions are augmented in the same proportion as the cutaneous secretion is diminished this is especially observable in cold weather every person must have remarked in themselves an unusual discharge of urine under this circumstance of cold  hyppocrates says  cutis densitas ventris laxitas it is not only by the belly that this compensation of secretion is executed but the reins are also another canal by which the superfluous fluids are commonly evacuated  persons of an irritable temper a great mobility a fine a delicate skin and a disposition to the cutaneous eruptions suffer very much from the humidity and vicissitudes of the air and every kind of irritation the animal powers in such individuals are very often insufficient to prevent the disorders in question  one reflection ought here to be made it is that a great number of persons are ignorant of the cause of their complaint although it really exists in themselves but where the causes are so extremely numerous it cannot be expected i should enumerate them all yet in order to be understood i shall instance a few facts and at the same time observe that the effects frequently remain when the primary cause has ceased  there are many women who in certain delicate circumstances are frequently troubled with efflorescences pimples etc in their faces hands legs etc but who not perceiving any sensible unusual trouble or inconvenience do not immediately think of the stimulus that exists in the internal organs and are therefore far from conceiving it to be the cause of the present cutaneous affection  a great eater who vigorously executes all the functions of life and is perfectly well never suspects that his stomach is stimulated by the farrago of aliments with which it is continually assailed but seeing the surface of his body covered with eruptions is disposed to attribute them to any cause rather than the true one but there is a variety of stimulus of which our internal organs are sensible that we do not perceive thus we have no sense of the stimulus excited by the blood circulating in the heart nor of that which the juices of the stomach occasion in its nervous membrane and which the bile and other juices occasion in the intestines etc etc  if these different stimulus and many others i do not speak of are increased and become violent then not only the proper organ where the specific fluids are separated and collected but other parts are by sympathy sensible thereof without any knowledge or consciousness of the mind it is from effects that a knowledge of the wonderful laws of the animal economy is obtained and in order to prevent mankinds being any longer mistaken as to the real sources of cutaneous eruptions i have endeavored to explain them the more fully that they may be the better understood  i have said that the sensibility and mobility of the arterial vessels are so very great in the anatomy of the skin page    it is seen that all the nerves of the body interweave themselves and actually terminate in the skin  that they sympathize extremely with all the nervous system but particularly with the stomach the intestines and the womb etc and also of the peculiar influence which the passions of the mind affecting the nerves have upon the skin nor must we forget what is still greater the action of the atmosphere to which the face particularly is always exposed since then there are so many agents to disturb the functions of the skin it is not extraordinary to see the surface of the body and particularly the face so often affected with lumps blotches pimples efflorescence herpeys etc etc  indeed it would be more extraordinary if it was otherwise  the action of stimulus directed now to one part and now to another gives occasion to partial eruption and the character of this eruption differs according to the nature of the stimulus its duration and of the sensibility of the person affected  these appearances sometimes resemble scorbutic spots and the practitioner not well instructed often confounds the one with the other but without reason because the real symptoms of scurvy never attend the affections we are speaking of  it is truly important to determine the true cause of this disorder for from hence one ought to deduce the medical indications and i have endeavored in my little work to fix this point assisted by reason experience and authority  in order then to demonstrate the severe consequences which obtain by a wrong and false principle we need but reflect upon the ordinary method of humourists in the case in question they always begin by purging and bleeding and so prepare the body to the use of remedies which they call sweeteners and balsamicks  this plan is as infamous as their theory as it serves merely to weaken more and more the constitution and from hence the cutaneous affections take a greater extent and its character becomes more hurtful severe and uneasy experience so fatal ought to teach them to renounce a practice which is always useless and frequently dangerous  another remark must be made on the method of humorists it is that they attempt to cure in the same manner all the unhappy persons which fall into their hands however various may have been the cause if in their opinion an acrimony does exist it cannot be the same in all individuals nay it must extremely differ from one another from their tempers constitution age customs and passions and to be corrected its nature should be known etc it is another argument of the absurdity of the treatment employed by the humorists and is also equally a proof that they have not an idea nor just nor false of the acrimony which they undertake and pretend to destroy and that they exercise the art blindly  the good practitioners instead of occupying themselves to correct an imaginary vice of the blood direct their thoughts to the skin as there is the focus and seat of the disorder  the qualities of the eruption are not always the same nay they differ materially not only in different subjects but also in the same individual for a person may have spots herpeys blotches etc etc all at the same time which could not happen if the vice was in the blood for then they would be all of the same species of eruption which is not here necessary as it proceeds from an altered secretion and this secretion is not every where the same but changes in different parts in the same body because every part nay every point of the body is furnished with its own sensibility and as the physiologists say  sua fruntur vita  it might seem contradictory and paradoxical that we should propose one remedy as the specific in all these cases but it is not so for we are not intending by this remedy to attack the bad qualities of the matters which occasion the local disorder because we know not their intrinsic nature there is another way for us to take that is more short easy and at the same time sure it is to alter the action of the vessels which prepare it improperly  it is to change the cutaneous secretion by applying to the vessels themselves the small arteries which filtrate the perspirable matter are affected with spasm i say with spasm for i see that the remote causes of the eruption act upon the skin as stimulants and i observe that if the stimulus be momentary the eruptions almost always disappear spontaneously with swiftness and facility when the stimulus has been of long continuation the spasm continues though the stimulus has subsided and exists no more  from the foregoing reflections it is easy to perceive that the principal indication in the cutaneous affections is to resolve the spasm from which the preternatural secretion depends and to give a bland tone to the cutaneous vessels  the lotion produces this effect by calming the spasmodic contraction and restoring the tone of the excretories and the cutaneous vessels  it often happens that in the first moments the use of the lotion increases the eruption because the action of the skin becomes more easy and natural this symptom besides being demonstrative and satisfactory announces always a very quick recovery  generally the recovery is not rapid but comes on slowly and in proportion as the vessels approach their former state and usual manner of acting  the anatomy of the skin its impurities and the causes thereof nature has been no less bountiful and attentive to the structure of the external covering than to the more noble parts of our frame it is no less remarkable for its general use than for its beauty it is composed of two parts viz the epidermis or scarfskin which is the external and the cutis or true skin which is underneath the first is inorganic the other is what anatomists call highly organized being made up of arteries veins and nerves and exquisitely formed to convey to the mind the various impressions we receive which impressions we call feeling  it is beset with many small glands for separating the perspirable matter and with others also which furnish a different and a more mucilaginous fluid contained in a fine reticular or network substance between the outward and inward skins to sheath the nerves from injury and regulate the sense of feeling which would without such protection be too exquisite the internal surface becomes insensibly of a less firm texture and at length degenerates into the cellular membrane a great number of arteries and still greater number of veins extend themselves within its substance the lymphatics distributed upon it are also very numerous as well as the nerves the extremities of which evade the observation of the most discerning anatomists  the scarf or outward skin is a very fine transparent membrane in the composition of which neither vessels or fibers are observable it is in itself not endued with a sense of feeling  easily separated from the parts beneath  is renewable when it peels off or is destroyed by any accident  it is pierced by an infinite number of pores which afford a passage to the hairs and in which terminate the lymphatics and excretory ducts of the sebaceous glands it is preserved soft and supple by the mucus secretion below it and by the perspirable matter opening on it through those innumerable pores it is generally imagined by anatomists that this membrane is formed by the condensation of a fluid furnished by the extremities of the capillary arteries  under the true skin and over the muscles nature has placed another covering called the membrana cellularis or cellular membrane between this membrane and the true skin lie a number of small glands called sebaceous glands these glands have one or more excretory ducts every where opening on the surface of the skin through which is transmitted the fluid the glands secret to lubricate the skin and keep it lax and a very important office they do perform other glands separate a fatty matter of the skin of the nature of suet and these are found in those parts of the body which are most exposed to the action of the air in other parts it does not contain any  the skin is capable of being distended and of contracting itself to a surprising degree it has a variety of uses but we shall confine ourselves to that one only which is most particularly interesting to our subject namely the secretion of the matter of perspiration i must not here be understood as speaking of a fluid floating in and circulating with the blood but of a fluid which the vessels and glands themselves prepare and elaborate upon which they impress characters of a greater or lesser degree of malignity according to the degree of stimulus with which they are oppressed this matter in its natural state is only a watery fluid but when by any exciting cause its quantity is increased its nature is changed and it immediately appears to contain a saline principle along with a certain quantity of inflammable air  in acute diseases convulsions and epilepsy its alterations are frequently very remarkable so that its smell becomes disgusting and intolerable from numberless other causes it frequently happens that this secretion is wonderfully changed so that the matter furnished by it adheres to and corrodes the skin and forms a chronic cutaneous disease  this last subject is meant to be investigated in this treatise  of cutaneous eruptions the appearance of cutaneous eruptions varies considerably either on account of the different sensibility of the persons affected or of the different character of the secreted fluid  sometimes they present themselves as a red efflorescence under which a white powder is formed which after some time falls off and leaves the skin apparently healthy the efflorescence however again makes its appearance and again goes off in the same way these alterations continue for life unless cured by a topical remedy  at other times there are very small pustules or pimples like milletseed filled with a transparent water which when shed condenses and forms crusts or scabs these detach themselves but the skin underneath being inflamed pours out fresh matter which undergoes the same change as the first  sometimes likewise there are pustules containing serum which at first is white then becomes yellow excudes and is converted into crusts at other times the disease puts on the appearance and symptoms of the itch what is called black worms frequently appear on the nose the chin the cheek bones etc this is the sebaceous matter of the glands obstructed and lodging in the ducts which when squeezed out have the appearance of worms the blackness at the outward extremity is dirt too much insinuated to wash off and the reason they infest these parts particularly is owing to the ducts being larger on those extremities than in other parts  and lastly in other instances there is only a redness in the skin or spots which prove extremely troublesome from the itching which attends them sensations of pricking and itching almost constantly attend diseases of this nature and it scarcely ever happens that they go off of themselves  that these diseases of the skin are in general simply local affections was an opinion entertained by dr cullen one of the most enlightened physicians of the present age and from the numerous remote causes it evidently appears that a depraved secretion in the cutaneous capillary arteries and the vicious elaborated matter by the cutaneous glands are the proximate cause of the disease  i this acrid and corrosive matter could not exist in the mass of blood without exciting grievous disorders in the animal economy but as the latter does not exist there is not any reason for supposing the existence of the former  ii those persons who are subject to eruption generally enjoy good health and execute their functions without inconvenience  iii those who have a bad constitution and in whom one might with some appearance of probability suppose an acrimony existing in their fluids are least of all subject to eruptions they are never met with in cases of chlorosis and cachexy  iv the eruption is generally confined to some one particular part as to the nose the cheeks the breast or the extremities but almost always to the face alone  if it were true that the arteries received from the blood the matter which occasioned the eruption and that they discharge it upon the surface of the body why do they not discharge it in equal proportion upon every part of it would it not be absurd to suppose that the artery a or the artery b alone should have a power of selecting every thing viciated from the general mass whilst all the other vessels of the system receive their blood from the same source  v cutaneous disorders are not peculiar to any particular class of individuals but attack all without distinction  thus we meet with them alike in the voluptuary and the ascetic in those who are little sensible to the allurements of wine or the still softer ones of love in those who do not work as in those who do in a word the disease attacks persons of all temperaments characters and passions this precludes every suspicion of a specific acrimony of the humors as it could not be found in the midst of circumstances so opposite to each other  vi and lastly if there really existed a disease in the fluids some advantage might be derived from the use of those means which physicians have characterised under the titles of edulcorants refrigerants balsamic and antisceptic medicines but on the contrary experience has unfortunately shown that instead of the patients receiving benefit from their employment the disease is uniformly exasperated and becomes worse and worse for confirmation of this fact i have only to appeal to the tribunal of those who have been the victims of their credulity the skin is therefore the source of the eruption  m lorry a very ingenious french physician who has written a very voluminous work upon cutaneous diseases adduces many instances of persons who the instant after having eaten of certain kinds of aliment or taken certain liquids had the face or some other part of the body covered with pimples which disappeared as soon as the irritation of the stomach had subsided  eruptions also frequently appear in a very remarkable short time after drinking cold liquors particularly cider when heated this is one eruption which often finally becomes a real chronical cutaneous disease  riverious hoffman and all eminent practitioners have remarked that the saburra of the alimentary canal frequently occasions erysipelatous affections which go off as soon as the saburra is evacuated  pechlin quotes examples of instantaneous eruptions produced by violent emotions of the mind and the history of medicine teems with similar examples  a woman hyppocrates tells us had during pregnancy an exanthematous affection of the face which went off immediately after delivery  there are many women as m lory has observed who in certain delicate circumstances have eruptions which last as long as their cause continues to exist and no longer  from these observations it is evident that the skin has a consent or sympathy with every part of the nervous system  that every impression whether physical or moral may easily become an indirect stimulus to the skin and that this stimulus is capable of altering its functions in such a way as to give rise to a secretion of an acrid matter and consequent eruption  since we are here in possession of causes which explain in the most satisfactory manner the origin of cutaneous diseases it is by no means necessary to seek for another in the blood and gratuitously suppose the existence of an universal acrimony  the term acrimony is in its application extremely analogous to the occult qualities so much in use among the ancients that is to say a term void of sense a term to which physicians only associate false and arbitrary ideas  the acrimony which is generally accused is that of the scurvy  it is commonly the want of sound fresh animal food with the want of vegetables which gives rise to the scurvy but in london neither of these is wanting we are provided with excellent fermented malt liquors as beer and porter with brandy rum and other spirits and foreign wines which may all be considered as so many antiscorbutics see vanswieten millman lind etc etc on the scurvy  we are not in the neighborhood of marshes salted or smoakdryed flesh or fish do not constitute any considerable part of our food neither do we drink putrid or stagnated water which give the disposition to scurvy in a word however it may have suited the interest of regulars or irregulars to insist upon it our mode of living and our situation are by no means favorable to its production  scurvy is preceded or accompanied by symptoms which are never met with in the cutaneous affections of which we are speaking in fact the scurvy begins by a spontaneous weakness or sense of weight in the whole body pain in the muscles inability to walk a difficult and laborious respiration the color of the face of scorbutic patients is pale and sallow the mouth exhales a fetid smell the gums become red painful and flabby and liable to bleed upon the slightest pressure the teeth fall out flying pains are felt in different parts of the body bleedings come on and lastly and not till then ulcerations make their appearance particularly in the legs and the skin becomes covered with an itchy eruption pustules and crusts  the matter which produces the eruption is so acrid as to corrode the skin and its smell is highly disgusting and alkaline this short sketch evinces the enormous difference which obtains between simple affections of the skin and the real scurvy  those who confound them together either are unacquainted with the causes and nature of these diseases or they abuse the confidence which the world without sufficient examination may repose upon their talents or integrity  having laid down these principles which are supported both by reasoning and facts i may advance without running a risk of being accused of temerity that cutaneous affections being a local disease require a local treatment  note the single authority of mr gowland upon this point may not perhaps be of sufficient weight to carry along with it conviction and persuasion but the world surely will not refuse to accord its confidence to that of men of science the proprietors therefore take the liberty of adducing the authority of one of the most respectable surgeons this or any other country can boast of and whose works are known in every part of europe we mean the professor bell of the university of edinburgh  it was says he till lately believed that eruptive diseases of this nature herpetic could never appear but in consequence of some general morbid affection of the system and accordingly a great variety of internal remedies have been recommended by almost every author who has written upon the subject it has even been commonly considered as an unsafe and dangerous practice to attempt the cure of such eruptions in any other way than by correcting the fluids which at first were supposed to have produced them it is somewhat singular however that the opinion should have remained so long uncontroverted by regular practitioners as from the writings of many old authors it appears that complaints of this kind were constantly and easily cured as they still are by every itinerant with local external application only  this we should imagine ought very soon to have overturned the general notion which prevailed with respect to the nature of those disorders and which seemed all along to have no other foundation than antiquity for its support modern practitioners however not being shackled by such authority have in many instances ventured to dispute and boldly to deviate from the opinions of their predecessors and the improvements which have universally resulted from such a free spirit of enquiry have never yet given them reason to repent their having done so  this in no instance has been more remarkable nor attended with better effects than in the treatment of cutaneous disorders which from having been very perplexed and intricate will soon it is hoped become a very simple and easy part of the practitioners employment  instead of the tedious and debilitating courses of medicines which patients went through formerly and which perhaps they are still too frequently obliged to undergo it is now found that the greatest number of these complaints are more certainly and speedily removed by the use of local remedies merely than they ever were by a contrary course  bell on the theory and management of ulcers  sect ix page     the proprietors may here be allowed to remark that mr bell had no specific to recommend no view or interest whatever but the benefit of his fellow creatures   bell became convinced by long experience that the external application of medicaments rarely disappoint the expectations of the physician and patient he enumerates several of those employed as well by him as others and observes that the principle dependence is to be placed upon those which are of an astringent and drying quality  i have been able to discover a remedy which i may with the greatest propriety style the specific for cutaneous diseases it has a great advantage over those which have generally been employed namely that so far from possessing any the slightest repellant quality it is the very reverse and acts in a mode diametrically opposite thereto its operation confists in taking off the spasm of the extremities of the capillary arteries removing the inflammation where it exists and gradually bringing back the excretorious vessels to the discharge of their natural functions  some days after its employment the inflammation disappears and consequently the transudation after which the skin resumes its natural state and complexion if there are any pustules they become in the first place less troublesome which show that the lymph they contain has lost somewhat of its malignant properties  lastly they disappear altogether and never appear again in any part of the body except some new cause arises or that the natural texture of the skin should be inadequate to resist the power of the external air in which case its application should be sometimes repeated  in those cases which actually owe their rise to some specific virus as the scrofulus venereal etc even though the morbific cause be destroyed the local disease of the skin is incapable of curing itself vessels which have been in the habit of making a depraved secretion do not of themselves change this disposition although the mass of blood and the constitution be in a healthy and natural state van swieten when speaking of venereal ulcers has made this observation here the necessity of a topical treatment becomes particularly evident that is the application of a remedy to the part affected thus the lotion is productive of the greatest advantage even in scrofulus and scorbutic cases  we have said that there are sebaceous glands in the skin the excretory ducts of which throw out a suetty matter and that there is likewise a great number of excretory vessels which are a continuation of the capillary arteries  these ducts and vessels are frequently constricted by sudden cold so that the matter which ought to be exhaled is pent up and if not evacuated by the intestines or kidneys it forms tubercles or hard knots and small vissicles as has been observed by the celebrated ludwig  the face is the most common seat of the eruption of which we are speaking on account of its being exposed more than any other part of the body to the action of the air eruptions will sometimes frequently remain after the cause has ceased for nature is not always equal by its own power of reestablishing these minute organs in their natural functions in consequence of which the skin remains disfigured not only by a partial redness but by scabious irregularities on its surface and even by matter contained in pustules and by crusts which arise from the condensation of the lymph escaping from the vesicles  if this affection be unfortunately neglected on its first appearance it soon overleaps its first limits extends its sphere of action and every day gives additional force to its malignity this disease commits horrid ravages on those persons whose general system is in a state of debility  the female sex the endearing bond of society when once attacked by these disorders suffer more from them than men on account of their skin being possessed of a far greater degree of delicacy and sensibility  how distressing must it not be to a fine woman to the perfecting of whose face nature has lavished all her power to find the beauteous fabric spotted and discolored with disgusting pimples which destroy the effect of all her charms it is in this case that the imagination whose influence on the softer sex is so very extensive takes the lead exasperates the disease and renders it a thousand times more obstinate and yet i can assure my readers from long and assiduous observation drawn from the experience of many years that these impurities arising from obstructed perspiration are the easiest of all others to overcome the vessels when once freed from the matter contained in them and which has become foreign and vitiated by stagnation readily resume the tone and energy necessary for cutaneous secretion  the lotion constantly produces this effect it washes and cleanses the surface and by penetrating within the small obstructed vessels dissolves the condensed fluids contained in them and facilitates their expuision  when this is executed the skin resumes its natural state becomes smooth and polished and exhibits that brilliancy of tint which depends upon the free circulation of the fluids in the cutaneous arteries and the continual afflux of those furnished by the different glands and vessels which are found in the skin  in addressing my reflections to the public i have advanced that simple cutaneous diseases are local affections only and i have given proofs of the truth of this assertion i have said that the mode of treating them ought to be local and both authority facts and reasoning have confirmed what i have advanced  i have asserted that my lotion is a specific for these eruptions and i appeal to those who have experienced its efficacy after they had been disappointed by internal means thus the goodness and infallibility of my specific is a sufficient answer to and completely confutes the invidious attacks that have been made against me for its introduction  finis advertisement although this medicine was originally invented for diseased skins yet every impurity or defect however trifling being a degree of disease it has been found the only composition capable of cleansing and clearing the thickness and opacity of the skin and of restoring it to its original state of nature clearness and perfection an account of its efficacy in this particular with the most undeniable evidences of this fact may be had in a pamphlet gratis of  the proprietors no    longare london
