memorial concerning the surgeons hospital   february         memorial concerning the surgeons hospital we the surgeonapothecaries in edinburgh erectors of the surgeons hospital there having lately set up and brought to some bearing this new hospital do think it our duty to publish this short account of our proceedings before we call in the money subscribed for  we have with pleasure observed the good effects of that pious and laudable erection of the royal infirmary but have it to regret that though the funds of their hospital be considerably increased and managed with great care and frugality by the directors yet we were often called to vast numbers of poor miserable sick people who could not be received into the infirmary because their stock is no ways answerable to the number of the diseased poor  how often did we see poor servants or workmen cast out of business by indisposition confined to a bed of straw unable to help themselves or hire others destitute of meat drink fire and all other things necessary for their condition which made it impossible for us though never so willing to give that relief by medicine which their cases required  miserable objects of this kind were so numerous that in town and suburbs they amounted to some hundreds of which nine or ten only could be taken in to the infirmary at a time what then must be the number in scotland here pity and compassion charity and brotherly love love to our country and even common humanity set us a thinking how to provide some relief in such calamitous cases  it was for this purpose that we frequently conveened and conferred together but finding it impossible for us to attend and provide any considerable number with fuitable accommodation as they lay scattered in so many different and distant places we concluded that the erection of a new hospital was the only proper mean by which such numbers could be duly taken care of by us  therefore we resolved and determined to afford them all the aid and assistance which our surgery and circumstances would admit of by laying the foundation of a new hospital for curing and taking care of such whose cases in a peculiar and proper sense require a surgeon  for this purpose we concerted to enter into a bond of erection obliging each of us to contribute money and medicines sufficient to set this good work agoing and to give our attendance gratis during our life  our next step was to lay our whole scheme before our brethren at a meeting of the corporation for their further advice or approbation as well as to invite as many of them as inclined to join us  at which time our design was approved of and they agreed to call our house by the name of the surgeons hospital  as soon as we had projected the erection of an hospital it immediately occurred to us that the erecting a new or enlarging the old one might equally serve the same ends therefore it was expressly stipulated amongst us that as soon as we should enter into a bond of erection we should confer with and make proposals to the managers of the infirmary concerning an union of the two hospitals  accordingly proposals of this kind were made to them in writing conferences held for that purpose a memorial given in to us by the said managers and a reply to that memorial was delivered to them by mr kennedy our preses and at that time deacon of the surgeons upon the first monday of july      to which we have got no answer these eight months  this we thought fit to mention to show the world our willingness to unite the two hospitals  about this time it was often objected to us that when the whole corporation was invited and desired to serve the royal infirmary when newly erected we refused to concur and give our assistance  here we must deny the fact and we cannot but wonder how so many people fall into this mistake so directly contrary to a public deed of the corporation of surgeons who at that time obliged themselves by an act of their society to serve and furnish medicines to the infirmary gratis with as great security for the performance thereof as ever was given by them as a society which act is recorded in the books of the calling dated the  0th february       when things were brought this length we began to contrive how to make our scheme more extensive than what could be expected immediately from such small funds therefore it was made an article in our constitution not only to take care of as many as our hospital and funds could accommodate but likewise to give our advice with all proper medicaments and dressings to any who should be able to come to or lodge near the hospital  and in the next place we appointed that our students and apprentices should pay something into the hospitalfund yearly which they have hitherto done most cheerfully and we hope that by their help and other charitable donations we shall be able to make this hospital a school of practical surgery not only advantageous and instructive to them and their succeffors in our shops but profitable to our country and in particular to this metropolis for it is certain that as the surgeons of this country have been much employed and had considerable fame throughout the world so this improvement of their education will add to that fame and make edinburgh an excellent nursery for physicians and surgeons and by being such how many thousand pounds will be saved to our country in a few years which now are spent in leyden and paris  add to this what sums of money we may expect will be returned to scotland by our own surgeons yearly returning home from all corners of the world some have calculated l  00000 sterling remitted to scotland this way within these twenty years past and if we judge of what may be by what has been it will be no inconsiderable branch of trade to our indigent country  another advantage which we beg leave to say will arise from this school of surgery is that our country will hereafter be better served by surgeons at home when all of them may have the advantages of hospitals at edinburgh where their education may be completed at an expense all of them can afford which never was the case before  from what we have observed concerning the advantages of this school of surgery it is evident that if this piece of education be confined to a few surgeons and their apprentices secluding all the rest whatever private benefit might arise to these few surgeons by such a monopoly it would not only be prejudicial to all those who were secluded but manifestly so to the nation in general  if this piece of education be confined to a few the benefit arising from it to our country must be limited proportionally suppose for example one fourth of our apprentices and students get their education completed by hospitals and that the remaining three fourths must want it then of consequence a few of those who go to serve abroad may perhaps bring money and credit to our nation while the greatest part of them go unfinished to cast the balance the other way  as for those who stay at home to serve in their own country a few of them likewise may be sufficiently qualified for their business and fit to be trusted with the lives and health of the lieges while three fourths of them for want of a complete education do more than overbalance the good done by the few skilful  this is pretty obvious and of this we were all sensible at the beginning and it had no small influence on our first resolutions therefore we agreed to make our scheme as extensive likewise in this view and as useful to all the surgeons and apprentices in edinburgh as possible by inviting the whole corporation to join us and to which they still have access  but to return to the further progress of this affair we next laid down rules for the right economy of the house much the same with these observed in other hospitals and opened our house to patients on the first of july last since which time we have been receiving in and taking care of as many as our house could accommodate where two of us have attended punctually every day from eleven to twelve in the forenoon except sunday when we attended from four to five afternoon and the same attending surgeons examine all accounts every monday  in this place we think it not improper to take notice that however much we were convinced of the necessity of this hospital when first it was projected yet the short experience we have had since the first of july has set this necessity in a much stronger light than we could possibly have imagined before this trial for although we have been by the blessing of god useful to and cured many yet if the rest of the world were to see what numbers we are obliged to dismiss purely for want of larger funds were they likewise to see from what slight strains or inconsiderable bruises incurable diseases arise when not taken care of timeously they would very much lament our having neglected this piece of charity so long  the gain of the most part of servants is but daily subsistence and few of them can afford to be many days idle hence it is that so many of them are made lame and mutilated not to mention those who die purely because they could neither afford themselves proper diet rest nor medicine at the beginning of the disease when they might have been speedily and easily cured so that in truth they may be more properly said to derive all this misery from want than disease  if no provision is made for the diseased poor and if they are left to linger out a miserable life without expectation of any other relief than death they are in some respect in a worse condition than the beasts of burden the proprietor for his own sake taking care of them while the poor mechanic or daylabourer is cast out naked and destitute to struggle with pain sickness poverty and death  it is with pleasure that we reflect upon the public spirit which prevails at present for encouraging trade and manufacture and we hope hospitals may be justly esteemed useful that way for as the riches of a trading nation chiefly consists in the number of well employed hands so of consequence those who die through want of timely help are so many working hands cut off from the community and the lame and the mutilated are often not only miserable themselves and a burden to their afflicted friends but if we consider their number throughout the nation they will be sound no inconsiderable tax upon the country  our next and great care about this hospital was to settle it upon a lasting foundation that it might not possibly prove abortive before considerable contributions could be raised this we have done in such a manner as to make the stability of our present scheme pretty certain  now our last and constant concern is how to make it more extensive for the number of the diseased is great and our present fund small  hitherto we have done our part and shall continue to do according to our ability  every tradesman employed in fitting up the house has contributed something and now we apply to all who shall see this memorial hoping none will be so hardhearted as to discourage or so wicked as to oppose an undertaking so charitable so necessary for the poor and so beneficial to our country  therefore generous readers  we now call upon you all by the titles of men brethren and christians to denote our common tie of humanity and yet nearer tie of christian charity by what arguments shall we persuade you to extend your bounty to a poor hospital in its infancy  if you value the prayers of those you may restore to health and happiness if pity and compassion the interest of your country or the approbation of our savior can have influence come like the good samaritan pour wine and oil into and bind up the wounds of your afflicted brethren by your charity imagine your selves given up to pains and want like theirs or rather come and see the miseries and untimely deaths which you might so easily prevent for there is an eloquence in visible distress beyond what can be imagined and we hope there will be no need of other solicitations to dispose all of you to contribute according to the circumstances with which god has blessed you  n b all the money that is subscribed for is payable to mr william wardrop surgeon our treasurer  subscribers for l   or upwards may be chosen directors  the names of subscribers for l   or upwards will be printed in due time
