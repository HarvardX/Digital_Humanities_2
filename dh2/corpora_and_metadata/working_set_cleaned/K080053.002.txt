a view of northumberland with an excursion to the abbey of mailross in scotland  by w hutchinson anno       vol ii    newcastle printed by t saint for w charnley and messrs vesey and whitfield  mdcclxxviii  advertisement my adoption of the word pater in the hexham inscription engraved and facing page    vol i having been objected to by an anonymous writer in order to show it was by no means improper or singular i beg leave to refer the reader to the  d volume of the archaeologia page   0 where in the salisbury inscription commented on by mr gough the words are pater ecclesiae salisbiriensis and that writer gives it the antiquity of the beginning of the   th century the supposed personage for whom that tomb was erected roger third bishop of salisbury having been elected a d   0  to that see his munificence to his infant church entitled him to the name of pater ecclesiae salisbiriensis are his words the era and occasion agree critically in the two instances others might be pointed out but this from its pertinence may seem sufficient  in my account of blanchland page     by former writers i was led into an error touching the family of forsters to whom it formerly appertained this i presume will appear to be duly rectified in the account of bambrough in this volume  the liberal minded reader i flatter myself will make allowances for such errors as appear in this work which consistent with its title is a view of the county  a view of northumberland we repassed the tweed by coldstream bridge a handsome structure of seven arches having had  wark castle in view for several miles of our passage down the banks of the river a small part of it standing forms a rude pillar which at a distance appears of some consequence a platform lays to the west with a trench called gullys nich a mean village to the east from whence you approach the castle this fortress stood on a circular eminence formed by art its founder is not positively known nor is any certain date fixed to it in lelands collectanea part   p     it is said king henry the   causid the castle of work to be made from several circumstances of history it appears that it was formidable so early as the beginning of the   th century work castle on the southe syd of twede a praty town there  lel itin v   p      near this place are several intrenchments some of which are defended by mounds of earth these mounds have a trench cross the crown of each there is a spot adjoining called the battle place but from what particular event it obtained that denomination is not known as being on the borders this castle was subject to repeated assaults  on king stephens usurpation of the english crown david of scotland with great indignation entered the borders and among other fortresses assaulted and took carrum which richard of hexham says was by the english called werk this is an error in the historian the places are distinct and separate a considerable distance on a treaty held whilst stephen lay at durham and david at newcastle these conquests were restored by the scotch king who took as a compensation carlisle and some other places of less import as additions to the earldom of huntington which was then ratified to him stephen also engaged that before any disposition was made of the earldom of northumberland he would cause the claim of henry davids son thereto in right of his mother to be fairly heard by his judges david received in marriage from king henry i of england his brotherinlaw maud the eldest daughter of waltheof earl of northumberland from whom henry his son derived his pretensions to that earldom henry by the resignation of his father and king stephens ratification held the earldom of huntington  the determination of henrys claim to northumberland being suspended and stephen unwilling to bring it to a fair discussion sensible of the great power it would give to the scotch crown irritated david to support his sons pretensions by force of arms stephens absence in normandy favored his purpose and soon after easter in the year      he levied a great army with intent to invade england the northern barons with thurstan archbishop of york assembled the english forces at newcastle and the archbishop proceeding to roxburgh then in the possession of the scotch king in conference with david and his son prevailed on them to enter into a truce till stephens return when it was presumed the matter in contest would be honorably accommodated but stephen persisting in a denial of henrys right war immediately ensued  the winter was set in when david flattered with hopes of an insurrection in england a plot ordericus vitalis  l    p     having been laid to massacre all the normans and deliver the kingdom to him who was nearest heir in the saxon line not regarding the rigor of the season dispatched his nephew william son of duncan with part of his army against the castle of wark richard of hexham john of hexham  redpaths border history   william invested this fortress early in the morning and david with a numerous army and engines of war advanced soon afterward to maintain the siege this investiture continued three weeks during which time the most vigorous assaults were sustained by the garrison under command of jordan de bussis nephew of walter despec lord of wark walter despec had great estates in yorkshire and was founder of the abbey of rievalle which he filled with monks from st barnard the site of this abbey is by ancient writers described to be melancholy and desert on a tract of land called blackowmor on the banks of the river rye from whence the monastery had the name of rievalle rye empties itself into derwent the abbey of which there are fine remains to this day stands near helmsley in yorkshire we find a particular description of walter despec given by ethelred or ailred second abbot of rievalle an elegant and spirited writer in his history of the battle of the standard he is there represented as a person of the first eminence and esteem in the english army haranguing them before the battle from the carriage in which the famous standard was erected vir senex et plenus dierum acer ingenio in

of the dispositions made by both armies before the battle known by the name of bellum standardi as collected from historians of character may not be disagreeable to the reader in this place though not pertinent to this work  this expedition of davids was unfortunate to the scotch they were joined by eustace fitzjohn lord of alnwick who resented stephens taking from him bambrough and who hoped to have regained that fortress by the arms of the scottish king the castle sustained the assault of the whole army and remained impregnable david with fire and sword laid waste the country to durham where he was joined by the men of galloway cumberland and carlisle augmenting his army so that it consisted of   000 men at the least he was opposed near northallerton by a much smaller number chiefly consisting of the nobles and men of yorkshire headed by their archbishop thurston whose presence animated them to the highest pitch of bravery the mast of a ship having on its top a cross wherein was the consecrated host in a silver pix and the banners of st peter st john of beverley and st wilfrid of ripon waving below it was erected on the beam of a vast chariot around this standard and some of them upon the carriage on which it stood were placed the more aged of the english barons and with these roger de moubrai the infant earl of northumberland roger was the son of negel de albanei who at the battle of tinchebrai in normandy took duke robert prisoner for which and other great services king henry rewarded him by a gift of the lands of robert de moubrai earl of northumberland which had been forfeited on account of his rebellion against william rufus his presence drew around him all his vassals who made no inconsiderable part of the english army immediately before the battle ralph bishop of the orkneys deputed by the aged and infirm thurstan having assured the army that by fighting bravely they would purchase the remission of their sins did on receiving their confessions actually pronounce their absolution joining to it his benediction at the same time the priests in their white vestments carrying crosses and relics went among the ranks encouraging the soldiers by their exhortations and prayers these pious acts were accompanied with a wise arrangement of the english warriors adapted to sustain and repel the first fierce onset of their enemies the abbot of rievalle relates that david was prevented making the disposition he intended by the obstinacy of the gallwaymen who claimed it as their right to fight in the van a station which david and his best officers perceived they were not fit for on account of their wanting heavy armor such as was borne by those who stood in the first rank of the english army the king however fearing sedition at a time when it might have proved so fatal was obliged to grant these troops their request the next line was commanded by prince henry consisting as aulred says of knights and archers or according to huntington of english and norman horsemen who belonged to his fathers household and with them the men of cumberland and tiviotdale in this division was also eustace fitzjohn the third line consisted of the laodomains with the islanders and lavernans the king had in his own line the scots and murraymen and for his body guard a band of english and scotch knights robert brus and bernard baliol both of whom besides the great estates they possessed in england did also hold lands of the scottish king went to him before the battle and endeavored to persuade him to retire assuring him that northumberland should be delivered to his son henry but not being able to prevail they renounced their fealty to david and returned to fight under the english standard richard hagulst  ailz abb rev c      lord lyttleton  sir james dalrymple      david was obliged to raise the siege with disgrace his forces were much reduced and his standard bearer fell among the slain the border conflicts were all after one mode rendered horrible by ravage and rapine david after his departure from before wark led his forces to the western parts of northumberland where he spread desolation and ruin and marked his progress as far as tyne with acts of savage cruelty  to oppose these invaders stephen at the head of a numerous army advanced to wark which obliged david to abandon northumberland and prepare to defend his own territories but stephen apprized of a plot which was laid to entrap him at roxburgh returned to england without effecting any thing against his enemy david seeing the english forces had abandoned the border after taking and demolishing norham advanced against wark to revenge an insult the garrison had committed by taking some baggage and giving annoyance to his troops marching under his son henry his success in this second attempt was no better than in his former assault he exerted his powers employed every engine the art of war had introduced and with much bloodshed persisted in the siege till conceiving the fortress was impregnable to every other maneuver than a blockade which could cut off provisions and reinforcement he determined thereon and marching southward with the main body of his army left there a circumvallation of troops under the care of two of his barons  david soon after had a dreadful defeat near northallerton at the battle of the standard after which he retreated with the shattered remains of his troops to carlisle through a country enraged at the barbarities he had been guilty of in his former incursion the peasants in every avenue revenging on his flying troops the sufferings their families had sustained after a short respite and a collection of his scattered army at carlisle he commanded the siege of wark to be resumed in which many newinvented engines and machines were employed the besieged with unparallelled fortitude sustained the shock their skilfulness is as admirable as their courage for they lost but one knight whose intrepidity in attacking a machine exposed him to numbers of assailants in the midst of whom he fell after testifying the highest human valor the slaughter made by the garrison was terrible insomuch that david relaxing his rigorous command ceased all assaults and again formed a strong blockade the garrison were reduced to great extremities they had killed their horses and salted their flesh for food and when that was nearly consumed resolved as soon as all provision was exhausted to make a general sally and cut their passage through the lines of the assailants or die sword in hand during this interval walter despec their lord willing to preserve so brave a corpse sent the abbot of rievalle with his command that the garrison should surrender the place on whose arrival a treaty was entered into in consequence of which the garrison capitulated and were permitted to march out of the castle under arms with  0 horses provided them by the scotch king on this evacuation the castle was demolished and the fortifications were rased  king henry ii to strengthen the frontiers of his kingdom against the scots ordered the fortifications of the castle of wark to be restored ad      iterum

levied a great army advanced toward the scotch borders and halting at bamburgh received intelligence that robert de ross lord of wark had abandoned his castle and gone over to the scots being enamoured of a scotch woman whose affection he preferred to his duty and allegiance his brother william remaining in the fortress dispatched a messenger to require immediate aid of the king as he apprehended robert would attempt to deliver wark to the enemy king edward immediately ordered  000 men to march to sustain william and his garrison who on their arrival were attacked in their quarters in the night in a small village called prestfeu by robert de ross with a detachment from roxburgh who burnt the village and put the reinforcement to the sword king edward soon after this disaster marched with his whole army to wark where he continued to celebrate the festival of easter  in the reign of king edward ii      wark was taken by the scots under king robert brus by assault in lelands collecta p     it is said that the scotts came into the marches of england and destroyed the castelles of wark and harbottle  as king david bruce with his victorious army was returning from durham in the summer of the year      where he had imbrued his hands in the horrid massacre of all ages and both sexes had spoiled and plundered the sacred places and put the religious to miserable deaths the rear of his army passing the castle of wark laden with spoils were seen by the garrison with the greatest indignation sir william montague was then governor and the countess of salisbury whose lord the fortress then belonged to resided there the governor with  0 horsemen made a sally attended with considerable slaughter bringing into the castle   0 horses laden with booty king david incensed at this insult led his army against the castle and made a general assault but met with a repulse attended with great bloodshed david then prepared to fill up the ditches and bring his battering engines to play upon the walls the imminent danger of the garrison rendered it necessary to send information of their situation to the english monarch who was approaching the borders with a considerable army the place being close invested rendered such an attempt perilous but it was effected by the governor himself on a fleet horse in the darkness and tumult of a stormy night he passed through the enemys lines and carried intelligence to king edward who redoubled his speed to relieve the place the scotch chieftains unwilling to hazard the treasures they had reaped in their expedition persuaded the king to raise the siege and pass the tweed which was done only six hours before the van of the english army appeared the joy of the countess of salisbury for this relief and her pleasing deportment whilst she entertained the king at wark were the beginning of an amor to which the famous institution of the order of the garter is said to owe its origin  in the reign of king richard ii      a d

accession of king henry iv the truce made with richard ii expiring the scots made an incursion in which they took the castle of wark and after holding it some time utterly demolished the works it was a fortress of too much consequence to be neglected and therefore we find it soon after restored and in a state of defense for in the same reign it sustained many shocks with various degrees of fortune in      in the absence of the king of england who was then in france hostilities being commenced on the borders william haliburton of fast castle took the castle of wark which was then in the keeping of robert ogle and put all the garrison to the sword but it was soon recovered by the english who from a perfect knowledge of the place made their way by a sewer which led from the kitchen into the tweed and surprising the garrison put them all to death in revenge for their cruelty on ogles troops  in the reign of henry vi    0 the scots gathered great booty on the marches and among many other castles which they assailed wark was taken and demolished  the castle was afterward repaired by the earl of surry and in the year      in the   th year of the reign of king henry viii the scotch army laying at coldstream resolved to attempt the reduction of wark under the command of the duke of albany sir john lisle being then governor buchanan the historian being present at the siege gives the following description of the castle in the innermost area was a tower of great strength and height this was encircled by by two walls the outer including a large space into which the inhabitants of the country used to fly with their cattle corn and flocks in time of war the inner of much smaller extent but fortified more strongly by ditches and towers it had a strong garrison good store of artillery and ammunition and other things necessary for defense the duke of albany sent against it battering cannon and a chosen band of scots and french to the number of  000 under the command of andrew ker of fairnherst the french carried the outer enclosure at the first assault but they were dislodged by the garrison setting fire to the corn and straw laid up therein the besiegers soon recovered it and by their cannon effected a breach in the inner wall the french with great intrepidity mounted the breach sustaining great loss by the shot of those who possessed the tower or keep and being warmly received by the forces that defended the inner ballium were obliged to retire after a great slaughter the attack was to be renewed the succeeding day but a fall of rain in the night which swelled the tweed and threatened to cut off the retreat of the assailants to the main army and the approach of the earl of surry who before lay at alnwick with a large force obliged the duke to relinquish his design and repass the tweed  the present remains of wark do not in any wise strike the traveller with an idea of so formidable a fortress as it assuredly was for many centuries at what time it was dismantled and thus totally destroyed i have not been able to learn but it is probable it was one of the strongholds ordered to be demolished by king james vi of scotland on his accession to the crown of england  the great convention for the settlement of the tenths demanded by king henry ii in the year      was held at brigham near wark hugh bishop of durham was the chief of king henrys envoys and was met by king william the lion of scotland his bishops earls barons and a vast concourse of inferior vassals when the scotch rejected the demand with the utmost contempt in the

unaccountable anecdote gained acceptance  that they were guilty of injurious conduct toward their charge by denying them social intercourse on the information of an english physician they were punished baliol by a large sum in mulct and ross by confiscation of his estates king henry and his queen from their parental feelings made a journey to edinburgh to see them possessed of their wishes

lieutenant of northumberland and newcastle upon tyne charles the present earl of tankerville    who took their title from the place in lord whartons proposals for better protection of the marches it seems that the castle of wark was then held by the crown on the accession of king james i all the fortresses on the borders were ordered to be reduced and dismantled and it is most probable that was the period when wark went finally to ruin   in the descendants of which family it has continued to the present time being now the property of lord tankerville mr pennant remarks from the life of lord keeper guildford that after the union of the two kingdoms by the accession of king james i lord greys estate rose from  000l to   or  000l a year so instantly did these parts experience the benefit

the scots being driven from their ground and returning again five several times in the end sir john and his brother were made prisoners  we arrived at  cornhill noted for the valuable spaws near it by the escheats of the  st year of king edward i we find this place mentioned as the possession of william de cornhill the castle of cornhill i presume was the fort or tower near cornhill bridge and opposite to linnel house the remains are surrounded with a ditch called the castle stone nich it has been well situated for defending the passage over the river here is a seat house of henry collingwood esquire commanding a view of the ground we had traversed on the north side of tweed extended to the helton mountains and on the southern side of the river having a prospect of a wide country over which many gentlemens seats are dispersed the whole closed by a range of mountains of which cheviots are supreme in      on an incursion of the scots they took the castle of cornhill

the old foundation a coffin of stone about eight feet long in which were two urns of coarse pottery and the shank bones and scull of a person of great size  southeast of cornhill is a remarkable encampment but to what people or to what particular event they appertained i have gained no certain information the several lines are of great extent but as they form no regular figure in their present state do not merit a particular description what is worthy of notice is the mode in which the works are defended by ranges of conic eminences a thing singular and what rather confounds my judgment as to the antiquity of the place and who were its occupants mr wallis says they are sepulchral tumuli from which opinion i must beg leave to dissent  in branxton west field is a column placed as a memorial of the battle fought there on the  th of september in the  th year of the reign of king henry viii called the battle of flodden field from the scotch encampment on flodden hill the disposition of the earl of surrys forces was such as to oblige the scotch to come to an engagement their retreat into their own country being cut off  james iv had wasted much time at ford captivated as it is said by the beauties of the daughter of sir william heron so as give the earl of surry time and opportunity for advancing toward the borders with a large army the scottish nobles were averse to hazarding a battle and strenuously insisted on the policy of their return into their own country loaded as they were with spoils and having gathered many laurels in their campaign but james fired with resentment at the challenges sent by surry determined to engage the english and for that purpose made choice of an advantageous situation for his army in the neighborhood of ford the eminence called flodden lays on the opposite side of the river till it is the last and lowest of those hills that extend on the northeast of the great mountain of cheviot toward the low grounds on the side of the tweed from which river flodden is distant about four miles the ascent to the top of it from the side of the river till where it takes a northerly direction just by the foot of the declivity on which the castle and village of ford stands is about half a mile and over the till at that place there is a bridge on the south of flodden lays the extensive and very level plain of milfield having on its west side high hills the branches of cheviot on the north flodden and other moderate eminences adjoining to it on the south and east a tract of rising grounds nigh the foot of which is the slow and winding course of the till the nearest approach for the english army to flodden was through this plain in every part whereof they would have been in full view of the scots where they had a great advantage in possessing an eminence which on the side toward the english had a long declivity with hollow and marshy grounds at its foot while its crown contained such an extent of almost level ground as would have sufficed for drawing up in good order the forces that occupied it surry encamped on wooler haugh on the  th of september      sent a herald with a challenge to join battle in the plain the next day between the hours of twelve and three this challenge was dated the  th of september   oclock in the afternoon as appears by stowe p     the names of the subscribers were surry and his son thomas dacre clifford henry scrope ralph scrope richard latimer william conyers john lumley r ogle william percy edward stanley william molineux marmaduke constable william gascoyne william griffith george darcy william bulmer thomas strangeways etc james did not accept the challenge but lay in his intrenchments whilst surry advanced his army near to barmoor wood about two miles distant from the scotch army and lay there all night a little hill on the east of ford covered the english army from the observation of their enemies whilst from this eminence the lord admiral obtained a distinct view of all the scottish army and of all the eminences near it the next morning the english made some marches to amuse the enemy and then gained the ground which cut off jamess retreat to scotland by this position of his forces surry had an access opened to the scottish camp much less difficult and dangerous than on the other side of flodden the batteries raised by the scotch to command the bridge of of ford of which the vestiges still remain were now rendered of no use the scots deluded either by the treacherous advice of one giles musgrave who engaged the kings confidence and abused the royal ear or depending that surry by his mode of marching the army intended to gain berwick and avoid a battle appeared now to be confounded by the maneuvers of the english which bespoke their determination to come to an engagement in order to receive them with the greater advantage and to gain the ground they supposed the english would attempt to possess on the western side of the hill the scots set fire to their huts on the eastern side and made a motion to the west the smoke being driven between the armies concealed the progress the english were making till they had almost gained the foot of the hill surry observed the confusion his approach had occasioned among the scotch troops and finding the ascent of the hill short and moderately steep determined not to delay the onset  the english were disposed in three divisions the van under thomas howard the generals eldest son lord admiral of england the right wing being led by sir edmund howard brother to lord thomas and knight marshal of the army the middle division or main battle was led by the earl of surry in person and the rear by sir edward stanley the lord dacres commanded a body of reserve consisting of horsemen the ordnance was placed in the front of the battle and in the openings of the several divisions after they had passed the little brook of sandyford the lord admiral perceiving the scots approaching toward him drawn up in four great bodies armed with long spears like moorish pikes sent to his father the agnus dei that hung at his breast as a token accompanying a request that as the van of the army was not sufficiently strong or extensive to receive the brunt of the whole scottish army his father would bring up the forces of his division and range them in a line with the van the english general convinced of the expediency of this disposition immediately came forward with his forces and drew them up to the left of those of his son the mode in which the scots advanced to battle is variously described paulus jovius says they were formed in five square bodies so that the third of those in which the royal standard was erected and all the chief men fought was enclosed on each side by a double line forming as it were two wings comparing the several accounts it seems most probable that the battalia was thus arranged the van of the scotch army led on the right by alexander gordon earl of huntley and on the left by the earls of crawford and montrose and some say lord hume the king was in the center or main body a third division was commanded by the earls of lenox and argyle with whom were mackenzie maclean and the highlanders adam hepburn earl of bothwell with his kindred and clan and the men of lothian formed a body of reserve they had with them a large train of artillery the english artillery began to play which made a dreadful carnage whilst the scotch cannon from their high situation took little or no effect the shot going over the heads of the english this obliged the scotch to advance the earls of lenox and argyle together with lord hume moving with a body of ten thousand spearmen supported by some horse down the hill toward branxion made a fierce attack on the wing commanded by sir edmund howard the shock was violent the scots prevailed and sir edmund was reduced to the last extremity himself beaten to the ground the third time and in imminent peril of death when lord dacres and heron the bastard who had joined the english army with a troop of fierce outlaws his followers came in time to his rescue sir edmund thus relieved immediately joined the body commanded by his brother lord thomas and they advancing against the earls of crawford and montrose whose troops were armed with spears put them to the rout and both the earls were slain on the other side of the field sir william stanley with the forces from lancashire and cheshire being bowmen forced the scots to break their array and descend to closer fight in more even ground where they were soon thrown into confusion and put to flight after leaving the earls of argyle and lenox with the slain the english attributed this success to the archers but the scotch writers allege the miscarriage of this part of their army was owing to the undisciplined ferocity of the highlanders who animated by the success of the attack made on that wing of the english army commanded by sir edmund howard could not be restrained from rushing impetuously forward in an irregular and open manner notwithstanding the signals cries and menaces of the french ambassador la motte who perceived the consequence of such an improper and loose attack the king of scotland whose bravery kindled to extravagance of courage at the perils which now seemed to surround him deaf to every advice and remonstrance pressed forward and exposed his royal person to all the dangers of the field being sustained by bothwell and his band he charged on foot at the head of the best of his troops whose armor resisted the arrows of the english archery he pressed forward to the standards of the earl of surry and with such ardour and valor that they were nearly gained by this heroic phalanx but at length the wings of the scotch army being totally routed all the english forces were employed against this valiant band who were surrounded by the coming in of lord dacres horse in the rear  a considerable body of borderers commanded by lord hume stood aloof during the most arduous part of the battle and when he was required by huntley to attempt the kings deliverance from the circle of his enemies he answered that the man did well that day that stood and saved himself before the battle the old earl of angus anxious to dissuade the king from engaging was told by his sovereign that if he was afraid

army but when that was ended he would fight the king on horseback or on foot adding that if he took the king prisoner in the combat he would release him without any ransom and that if the king should vanquish him he would then pay such a sum for his liberty as was competent for the degree of an earl in the year   0  the earl was lord high treasurer in june   0  margaret the kings daughter a

commonly called bedlingtonshire anciently have been and still continue parcels of the body of the said county palatine and the inhabitants resort to durham for justice in all matters of law and civil jurisdiction as members of the palatinate anciently norham island and bedlingtonshires had several courts and officers of justice within their respective limits under the commissions of the bishop of

originally feasts of dedication in commemoration of the consecration of the church in imitation of solomons great convocation at the consecrating the temple of jerusalem the religious tenor is totally forgotten and the sabbath is made a day of every dissipation and vice which it is possible to conceive could crowd upon a villagers manners and rural life the manner of holding these festivals in former times was under tents or booths erected in the churchyard where all kinds of diversions were introduced interludes were there performed being a species of theatrical performance consisting of a rehearsal of some passage in holy writ personated by actors this kind of exhibition is spoken of by travelers who have visited jerusalem where the religious even presume to exhibit the crucifixion and ascension with all their tremendous circumstances on these celebrations in this country great feasts were displayed and vast abundance of meat and drink from whence we adopted the custom is not ascertained but it seems probable and by some authors it is insisted upon that we had it in very great antiquity and derived it from the easterns all their holydays were distinguished by great feasts the celebrations we read of were performed with all the pomp of procession approaching the temple of the gods with offerings in great magnificence and splendor where the cattle were consecrated and then delivered over to feast the multitude the feast of the translation of st cuthberts body is celebrated every year with great reverence by the inhabitants of norham on the first sunday and monday after the  th day of september o s  st gregory in his letter to king ethelbert in the year  0  had enjoined him to destroy the heathen idols their temples and high places that their influence might be taken away from the people and their memory effaced but on reviewing the estate of the inhabitants their superstitions and settled and habitual customs he thought it expedient not to pursue measures so violent and alarming at first and therefore in a letter wrote to mellitus an abbot who was upon his voyage to britain he orders him upon his arrival to inform augustine that on more mature deliberation he had resolved that the pagan temples in britain should not be pulled down it being sufficient that the idols were taken away therefore the places of the heathen worship were to be purified with a libation of holy water altars were to be erected therein and relics placed under them for if these temples were well built it was fit the property of them should be altered the worship of devils abolished and the solemnities changed to the service of the true god that when the natives perceived those religious structures remained standing they might keep to the place without retaining the error and be less shocked upon their first entrance upon christianity by frequenting the temples they had been used to esteem and his injunctions were that since it had been their custom to sacrifice oxen to the devils they adored this usage ought to be refined on and altered to an innocent practice he recommends that on the anniversary of the saints whose relics are lodged there or upon the return of the day on which the church was consecrated the people should erect booths about the churches lately rescued from idolatry provide a feast and keep a christian holiday not sacrificing their cattle to evil spirits but killing them for their own refreshment and praising god for the blessing and thus by allowing them sensual gratifications they may relish christianity the better and be raised by degrees to the more noble pleasures of the mind for unpolished and ignorant people are not to be withdrawn from their habits all at once god when he discovered himself to the israelites in egypt did not forbid them the customary rites of sacrificing but purified the service to himself greg epist lib   epist    thus the pope thought it expedient to bend to the prejudices of

territories by the emissaries of the sea of rome driven to dreadful dilemmas john was at length obliged to make his peace with the holy see the interdict which had continued six years was revoked and the lands of those who had adhered to the papal authority against their sovereign and had been pronounced forfeitures to the crown of which those of eustace de vesey were part were restored soon after this event succeeded that glorious combination of the barons under which the great charter and charter of the forests were obtained from the reluctant hands of this miserable tyrant to those patriots whose names ought to be engraven on the hearts of every briton we owe every thing valuable upon earth the liberty we possess and our authentic right to the properties we enjoy to men of the north the memory of eustace de vesey richard de percy robert de ros peter de bruis nicholas destoutesille william de moubrai and oliver de vaux northern barons in this combination should be immortal  by hemingford and under his authority by knighton it is alleged that the violations and injuries the barons had sustained as well touching their liberties and properties as in their private and family concerns urged them to appear more readily in the promotion of this great work the necessity for which had indeed long been experienced the base tyrant was not content with public oppressions but in his meanness of vice even descended to the violation of the wives and daughters of his barons to which purpose he practiced the vilest artifices he had by stratagem possessed himself of the signet of eustace de vesey by means of which he attempted to delude his lady that he might violate her chastity vesey by a happy discovery gained a knowledge of the kings intentions and concerting measures with the lady had address enough to put a common prostitute into the arms of the tyrant and preserve the honor of his family exulting in the success of his project and amidst the fervor of a generous resentment he reproached the king to his face with his baseness reviled him for the possession of a strumpet and defied his wrath  but to return to the history of norham  william king of scotland dying was succeeded by his son alexander ii a youth not more than    years of age the barons of northumberland had recourse to him for protection and thereupon paid their homage at felton this incensed king john so much that he prepared for a northern expedition in the year      king alexander came before norham with a mighty army and after an investiture for  0 days was obliged to raise the siege this circumstance is thus mentioned in lelands collectanea v   p     alexander king of scotts sun to king william did enter ynto england and did much despite to king john he assegid the castle of mitteford and norham and took homages  in      king henry iii had projected a scheme for surprising alexander iii king of scotland and rescuing him from the government of those who had taken him from those ministers approved of by king henry the government of the castles of norham and wark was conferred on robert de neville lord of raby whose commission from king henry was to provide himself with horse and arms to march with the forces designed to rescue alexander from the restraint in which his rebellious subjects held him dugdales peerage vol   but this project was rendered abortive by the assembling of a great army of scots in the forest of jedburgh and a treaty ensued this robert de neville was the second lord of raby of the name of neville being the grandson of robert fitz maldred lord of raby who was the lineal male heir of uchtred earl of northumberland  a convention was appointed to be held at norham on the  0th day of may    0 previous to king edward the firsts entering upon a decision of the claims made by the several competitors for succession to the crown of scotland on the death of margaret of norway the infant heiress the assembly that day is said to be held in the parish church of norham when were present the king and many nobles and prelates of both nations the king declared that the purpose of his coming was in quality of superior and direct lord of scotland to maintain the tranquillity of that kingdom and to do impartial justice to those who laid claim to the crown but previous thereto he demanded their recognition of such his pretended sovereignty and it is alleged that his claim was historically deduced with great skill and artifice by anthony beck then bishop of durham after which three weeks were given for the scotch nobles to deliberate on the demand on the  d day of june then next eight competitors with several of the prelates nobles and community of scotland appeared and held their council on this important matter congregatis ex opposito castri de norham ex alia part fluminis tweedae in quadam arda viridi rot turri when all the competitors made the required recognition and absolute submission of their several claims and pretended right to the scottish crown to his decision  on the same day the competitors together with the whole company came to the king in the church of norham and several subsequent meetings were held there for settling preliminaries and the second day of the succeeding august was appointed for hearing all claimants at berwick  after judgment was given at berwick in favor of john baliol on the  0th of november      he swore fealty to king edward in the castle of norham in the presence of many nobles of both nations and a commission was thence issued for enthroning him at scone  in the following reign in the year      it was besieged by the scots sir thomas gray being then governor in lelands collectanea we have the following curious particulars of this siege  the scotts came in to the marches of england and destroyed the castles of werk and herbotel and overran much of northumberland marches  at this time thomas gray and his friends defended norham from the scotts  it were a wonderful process to declare what mischefes came by hungre and asseges by the space of xi years in northumberland for the scotts became so proud after they got berwick that they nothing esteemed the englishmen  about this time there was a great feste made in lincolnshir to which came many gentlemen and ladies and among them a lady brought a heanlme for a man of were with a very rich creste of gold to william marmion knight with a letter of commandment of her lady that he should go into the daungerest place in england and there to let the heanlme to be seen and known as famous so he went to norham whither within   days of cumming came philip moubray guardian of berwicke having in his band   0 men of arms the very flour of men of the scottish marches  thomas gray captain of norham seying this brought his garrison before the bariers of the castle behind whom came william richly arrayed as al glittering in gold and wearing the heanlme as his ladys present  then said thomas gray to marmion sir knight ye be cum hither to fame your heanlme mount upon your horse and ride like a valiant man to yown even here at hand and i forsake god if i rescue not thy body dead or alyve or i myself will dye for it  whereupon he took his cursore and rode among the throng of enemies the which laid sore stripes on him and pulled him at the last out of his sadel to the ground  then thomas gray with all the hole garrison let pryk in among the scotts and so wondid them and their horses that they were overthrowen and marmion sore beten was horsid again and with gray persewid the scotts in chase there were taken  0 horses of price and the women of norham brought them to the foot men to follow the chase  sir thomas gray himself killed one cryne a fleming an admiral and great robber on the se and in hy favor with robert bruise the residew that escaped were chased to the nuns of berwick  adam de gordon a baron of scotland came with   0 men to dryve away the cattle pasturing by norham but the young men of the country thereaboute encountered with them whom thomas gray seeing to stand in jepardy went out with only  0 men and killed most part of the scotts and their horses  the same thomas was twice assiged in the castle of norham by the scotts one time by the space almost of an year the other   monithes his enuemies made fortresses before the castle one at upsedlington another in the church of norham this castle was twice vitailied by the lord percy and neville that he came with very noble men and rich and great socorers of the marches of england  the utter ward of norham castle was ons taken in thomas grays time on the vigill of st catherine but they kept yt by   days for their purpose in myning fayllied them   by whose brave defense and the timely aid of the lords percy and nevil it was preserved from the hands of the enemy in order to carry on the siege the scots raised two forts against the castle one at the church of norham and the other at upsitlington on a succeeding siege in      the scots became masters of this fortress but held it not long for king edward retook it after an assault of ten days he having brought before it a very powerful army  in      on the night of king edward the thirds coronation the scots made an assault on the castle robert manners then governor had received previous intimation of the intended attempt and permitting    of the assailants to scale the outward wall put them to the sword  in      soon after their march from weardale in the county of durham the scots laid siege to norham and took it by storm three knights of great military fame in the scotch army fell in the attack william de montalt or montraud robert bruce king of scotland had assegid the castle of norham where robert manners was capytane which with his garrison issuid out one day and discomfited the scotts killing william monhaud a baron of scotland  lel coll v   p   0 john de clapham and mailis de dobery another party made an unsuccessful attempt on the castle of alnwick near the same time in      a party of scots under the command of sir william ramsay burnt and plundered the town of norham and adjacent country  in the   th year of the reign of king henry vii the scots led by king james in person besieged norham castle which had been put into good repair by fox then bishop of durham and was well garrisoned the bishop came in person to its succor the besieged making a valiant defense many of the outworks were destroyed some authors assert the scotch did not raise the siege till the earl of surry with an army of  0000 men came to its support and obliged the assailants to retire in the  th year of the reign of king henry viii the castle was assaulted by the scots previous to the battle of flodden field we have this mentioned in the poem of the battle of flodden part   fit   line      it was the kings express command to waste with cruel sword and flame a field of blood he made the land till he to norham castle came     which soon with siege he did beset and trenches dug without delay with bombard shot the walls he beat and to assault it did essay     the captain great with courage stout his fortress fiercely did defend but for a while he lashed out till his ordnance did spend   0 his powder he did profusely waste his arrows he hailed out every hour so that he wanted at the last and at the last had none to pour     but yet five days he did defend though with assaults they him assailed though all their strength they did extend yet all their power had not prevailed     had not there been a traitorous thief who came king jamess face before that in that hold had got relief the space of thirty years and more                   o king quoth he now quit this place and down to yonder valleys draw the walls then shall you rend and raze your batteries will bring them low     which as he said so did the king and against the walls his ordnance bent it was a wretched dismal thing to see how soon the walls were rent     which made the captain sore afraid beholding the walls how they reeled his weapons all then down he laid and to king james did humbly yield         0 so when the scots the walls had won and rifled every nook and place the traitor came to the king anon but for reward met with disgrace           therefore for this thy traitorous trick thou shall be tried in a trice hangman therefore quoth he be quick the groom shall have no better place the battle of flodden the king by the advice of this traitor descended from lady kinkbank into the flat ground near the tweed now called the gin haugh whence with his cannon he threw down the north east corner of the castle wall a large fragment of which now lies by the side of the river bishop tunital in queen elizabeths time rebuilt the wall this is now very distinguishable from the old work there is a field near the castle in which this traitor was hanged now called hangmans land this fact is not mentioned by the historians by the account of it in the poem we shall more readily understand the following epigram of sir thomas more lord high chancellor in the time of king henry viii  in regem scotiae qui arcem norhamam proditam sibi tamen oppugnavit dissimulans proditam esse  scote quid oppugnas norhamam viribus arcem ante tibi falsa proditione datam artibus ergo malis capta fuit arce voluptas magna tibi forsan sed brevis illa fuit

cui proditor hostis invicta in satis arx habet ista suis i take this to be the meaning of the two last verses which are the most difficult  there is a tradition here that the king was told where the castle wall was weakest by a letter fixed to an arrow shot over the tweed into his camp  lambs notes to the poem of the battle of flodden and part of the outworks were destroyed  in order to entertain a just idea of those conflicts on the borders i will extract from the letters of the commanders in the year      a short state of their progress and proceedings in the mers and tiviotdale the progress of the berwick garrison was as far as dunglass the garrisons of wark and cornhill proceeded as far as the hills of lammar muir and over the dry march of tiviotdale the chief commanders were sir george

dawcove and stotherick on the river tiviot    among which were the friars near kelso the towers of roxburgh and ormeston and the two towers of boon jedburgh    places on the roll water    on jed among which the abbey friars and town of jedburgh    places on the kayle and between it and the tweed    on bowbent alias bowmont the sum total of the places destroyed or laid waste in the whole inroad was     of which monasteries and friar houses   castle towers and piles    market towns   villages     mills    spitals and hospitals    in the   d year of the reign of king henry viii norham was surprised by the scotch and soon after recovered by one franklin archdeacon of durham  in the year      a treaty was signed in the church of norham the scotch commissioners were robert bishop of orkney robert lord maxwell thomas master of erskine and louis de st gelais lord of lansac knt those for england were thomas bishop of norwich robert bows leonard beckwith and thomas chaloner knt  in      the castle of norham which from the time of bishop flambert had appertained to the sea of durham appears from lord whartons proposals for the better protection of the marches to be vested in the crown the deprivation of cuthbert tunstal happened on the   th of october in this year soon after the accession of queen mary before which time we have no public record to show how norham might come into the power of the crown the infamous law for the dissolution of the bishopric is the first act of any notoriety i have been able to discover which could effect the matter and notwithstanding that law it appears from several records that in the reign of queen mary the castle was repaired and again fortified by bishop tunstal and that some very short time before his death in the year      he held a treaty there with the scotch when were present thomas earl of northumberland william lord dacres of gilsland and croft commander of the fortress of berwick on the behalf of the english and for scotland the earls of morton and hume with the dean of glasgow  camden describes norham castle in his time to be situate on the top of a high steep rock and fortified with a trench the outward wall of great circuit was guarded by several turrets in a canton toward the river in which another wall much stronger encircled the keep or tower of great height this description gives a perfect idea of its figure after the repairs made by bishop tunstal toward the river the ruins now hang upon the very verge of the precipice part of which by the washing of the torrent has given way and carried with it the superstructure on that side which with the decay incident to the length of time has occasioned a wide breach in the outward wall spoken of by camden the turrets as he is pleased to style them appear to be no other than demibastions a mode of fortification peculiar to the age in which this erection arose a perfect model of which still in good preservation appears at hartlepool in the county of durham of near the same date being the palatinate port of the bishopric  the wall of the castle of norham which extended from the water on the south side was guarded with a gateway and tower having square turrets on each side and thence ascending the steeps stretching eastward was also defended by another gateway of superior dimensions fortified by two heavy round flanking towers the remains of which are still considerable this appears to be the chief entrance and fronts a plain of considerable extent it was defended by a draw bridge over a very wide moat which began here and was extended round the land side of the castle enclosing a spacious area or ballium with a very strong wall garnished with demibastions at intervals within the area of this outward wall are the remains of a chapel and several other structures to defend the keep or main tower a very strong wall encloses a narrow area or interior ballium which is entered by a gateway guarded on each hand by square towers the keep is a very large heavy square building vaulted underneath like most structures of this kind part of the vaults and some of the prisons remain entire but all the interior parts of the tower above are laid open and demolished the remains of an exploratory turret are seen on one corner of the keep it may be presumed it was originally uniform bearing a turret at each corner the height of the great tower is about  0 feet containing four stories or ranges of apartments the whole building is constructed of red freestone of a soft nature and subject to decay there is not the least ornament about it and the whole aspect is gloomy to the greatest degree it wears the countenance of the times of king stephen without any embellishments of the age in which bishop tunstal lived  this has been a very formidable fortress inaccessible from the tweed and before the use of fire arms from its present remains appears impregnable if fully garrisoned and duly provided with stores against a siege when the outward walls were in repair and filled with troops when the oillets and other devices for the garrisons fighting and defense were properly supplied with experienced archers and the bastions were kept by men of valor it seems almost incredible that this place could ever be taken by assault but when there was a regular blockade and time for mining and raising engines the defense then consisting of different maneuvers would consequently harrass the most powerful garrison frequent sallies becoming necessary by which the troops are exposed to the superior numbers of besiegers incessant watchings and severe duties wear down the greatest fortitude of soul and scarcity of provision with perpetual anxiety subdue the most vigorous heart such are the calamities of a siege and such were many times experienced here but of all the distresses the valiant know none equals that which proceeds from a defection in his partisans and the corruption of his colleagues so prone is the human heart to evil that we find in the history of every state and people such horrid tales of treachery that the stain upon the human character leaves so disagreeable a sentiment upon the mind of the reader as with its bitterness and gall almost overwhelms the pleasures we receive by the images of virtue i forbear to search into this part of the history of norham a fishery in tweed near the castle called hallywell for one night and one day adjudged by commissioners to settle claims on the borders      to be the inheritance of lord hume  a mile below norham the tweed forms an island of    acres near a place called st thomass den  a little to the west a lofty terrace on the banks where the tweed forms a serpentine canal the seat of james ker esquire of kersfield on the other side  further down the river is the pedestal of a cross with some of its fragments and about  00 yards further in a direct line another with steps round it a place of sepulcher or barrow crosses were erected by the road side

prostrate with the earth  monsieur jorvin wrote a description of england and scotland published at paris a d      which the editor of the antiquarian repertory thought worth inserting in that work the account given of berwick and the adjoining country contains several particulars which claim a place here  barrwick is the first town by which i reentered england and being a frontier to england has been fortified in different manners there is in it at present a large garrison as in a place of importance to this kingdom it is bounded by the river tweed which empties itself into the sea and has a great reflux capable of bringing up large vessels was it not prevented by sands at the entrance into its port i arrived here about ten of the clock on a sunday the gates were then shut during church time but were opened at eleven as is the custom in all fortified places here is an upper and a lower town which are both on the side of a hill that slopes toward the river on its top there is a ruined and abandoned castle although its situation makes it appear impregnable it is environed on one side by the ditch of the town on the other side by one of the same breadth flanked by many round towers and thick walls which enclose a large palace in the middle of which rises a lofty keep or donjon capable of a long resistance and commanding all the environs of the town  the high town encloses within its walls and ditches those of the lower from which it is only separated by a ditch filled with water in the upper town the streets are straight and handsome but there are not many rich inhabitants they rather preferring the lower town in which there are many great palaces similar to that which has been built near the great church and in all the open areas are great fountains and in one of them the guard house and public parade before the town hall or sessions house over which is the clock tower of the town so that by walking over barwick i discovered it to be one of the greatest and most beautiful towns in england  the greatest part of the streets in the lower town are either up or down hill but they are filled with many rich merchants on account of the convenience and vicinity of its port bordered by a large quay along which the ships are ranged there is not a stone bridge in all england longer or better built than that of barwick which has    large and wonderfully well wrought arches it is considered as one of the most remarkable curiosities of the kingdom i passed over it in leaving the place adjoining to it is a large suburb from whence the country is covered with heath and briars to ashton where there is a castle bowklin where the sea appears on the left and a small island not far off which forms a pretty good harbor near a village having a castle all this sea coast is covered with sand banks and the interior country to belford an entire desert as it is far above  0 miles round about being only fitted for feeding cattle occasioned by diverse rivulets which run through meadow where great herds of all sorts of cattle may be seen feeding  the town of berwick lays on the inclination of an easy slope toward the river most of the buildings are ancient and make but a mean appearance the streets are narrow except that only in which the town house is placed the fortifications are modern and said to be excellent being constructed agreeable to the modes adopted since the use of cannon in the year    0 these new works were begun by which the ancient fortification was greatly reduced for this purpose many houses were taken down and a tower which stood in a street called hide hill the ancient chief fortress or castle which adjoined to the southwest corner of the old town wall was left at the distance of several hundred yards from the modern works camden speaking of berwick says it is munitissimum totius brittaniae oppidum the manner of fortifying with bastions was a french device begun in the time of francis i and charles v or at the soonest of louis xii  the lord gray of wilton was the first that bore the title of governor of berwick in commission there are excellent barracks for the garrison the building plain and neat consisting of a center and two wings the public walk is on the rampire where the gaity of the inhabitants is chiefly displayed and to which the soldiery contribute greatly the church is a neat plain structure built in the time

an exception is made nisi fuera nativus not translated does it mean that these oaths were unnecessary where the fugitive was a bondsman  his lord might seize him upon giving his own oath accompanied by the oath of six others  iv moreover it was found that if any of the rank of a bondsman si nativus aliquis nativus is here rendered according to its usual signification in the laws and deeds of that time but native seems to be the juster term of the one kingdom had delivered pledges for a debt he owed in the other he might recover these pledges within thrice    days upon finding sureties for payment one out of each kingdom namos suos replegiabit per inbrocht wood et utbrotcht wood ms wred wred is a surety inbrotcht et utbrotcht nativos et extraneos not in nicholson  and pay the sum itself within    days immediately following but if the sum was not then paid the creditor might seize the pledge of his debtor and detain it until he received full satisfaction for the debt owing him but if the debtor denied his debt he was obliged to purge himself of it on the marches within the first succeeding    days by the oaths of seven cum septima manu this interpretation is given upon a presumption that the meaning is the same here with what is more fully expressed in the conclusion of the former article by these words per jurameatum sex virorum et se septimo et per sacramentum sex virorum et se septimo in art viii  his own included and this was also to be understood of the surety when the creditor could not be found but if he confessed his debt and had no goods wherewith to pay it he was obliged to declare himself not possessed of goods exceeding the value of five shillings and fourpence and must further swear that he will pay the said debt as he may be able to acquire or gain the means of paying it reserving only his own sustenance  v in the next place they found that all climants on either side should in person give their oaths in support of their claims with the exception only of the two kings and their heirs and the bishops of st andrews and dunkeld the person who ought to swear in the place of the king of england was his standard bearer and the constable of his army on the other hand the priest of wredale wredale  vallis doloris ford is the same with stow so mill is the description of mellrose  was to swear for the king of scotland and the bishop of st andrews and the prior of the isle for the bishop of dunkeld prior de insala probably of lockleven where the convent was governed by a prior the head of the convent at inchcalm was an abbot spotswood         if instead of dunkeld durham is to be read the prior de insula will be the prior of holy island   vi it was further declared that no person beside these had a right to depute facere attornatum another to swear for him in any quarrel touching life or limb unless such deputation was made with consent of both parties but without this consent the failure of either in appearing in person to give his oath lost him his cause for ever  ita pro uno solo defectu vii they next found that if there were any plea on the marches between a plaintiff and a defendant that affected life or limbs and if the defendant happened to die within the    days preceding the day of trial his body should be carried to the marches at the time and to the place appointed between the parties because no man can be essoigned by death again when the appellant delayed his appearance beyond the appointed day the defendant the word defendant is not in the original but the sense seems necessarily to require its being understood ought to pass to the marches and obtain an attestation accipere manum de wardshiel wardshiel ms hame wardshiel i do not understand this seventh is a very obscure article and it is doubtful if the translation expresses its exact meaning from three barons witnessing that he had regularly made his appearance on the day prefixed and this being attested by them he was to be in all time coming free from challenge in that case but if any or all of these barons refused to give testimony of the above fact he might oblige them to decide the truth of this charge by a combat and the same rule was to hold with regard to the appellant  viii it was also found that if any scottish robber stole in england an horse oxen or cows or any other thing and carried the goods stolen into scotland the person whose property they were wherever he discovered them might in the court from this it is probable there were not at that time any warden courts of the lords in whose lands he found the stolen goods and should there recover them by his own oath and the oath of six persons besides unless the person possessing the goods affirms them to be his own in which case the question must be decided by a combat on the marches  ix the next article fixed was that in any trial on the marches that affected life or limb as for robbery theft or murder where the defendant was convicted by the issue of a combat his sureties ought not to be answerable for a greater sum than the plaintiff mentioned in his charge but from this to the end of the article from the ms in the advocates library if a person accused was convicted of slaying a man and his sureties were dead he was obliged to make good the forfeiture respdebit die de monteple the learned sir james foulis of collington gave the editor the following probable meaning of the word montoplen i take montplen to be a contraction for manto plenitudine a barbarous law term to express the full time of waiting manto is a contracted word for mansito the frenquentative of manco so respenebit de manto plenitudine is that he shall answer when the full time of waiting is expired that is when the legal term comes  if his own money and that of his sureties together with the produce of their corns exposed to sale were sufficient for that purpose the lives of different ranks of men at that time being appretiated and if the sureties were not dead and the accused was convicted by combat all the goods he possessed at the time of attacking him ought to incur forfeiture to the pursuer but debout se purgare tanquam exeuntes de carcere quibus plegius defuerit all such persons ought to purge themselves in the same manner as those who having no sureties are suffered to go out of prison  x it was next declared that if a malefactor passing from one district or province of the kingdom into which he had entered into another desired to obtain protection hebere voluerit pacem the article is si aliquis malefactor existens in una regione in altera part ms alteram partem regei in quo intravit habere volueris pacem etc perhaps it may be understood of a malefactor passing over the march that divides the counties from one kingdom to the other and the sense according to this interpretation seems better probably the text is corrupt he should receive it from those having power to grant it viz from the sheriff of the county into which he had entered and if he could not find the sheriff he might obtain peace at the first church by ringing the bells and should remain in peace there until protection was granted by the sheriff but if before thus obtaining his peace he was attacked he might be brought back without any opposition  xi it was further agreed that if any inhabitant of either kingdom affirmed in opposition to a claimant of the other that a horse ox cow or hog in his possession was his own he should have the usual respite of days established between the kingdoms habebit ditie omnes inter regna statutes ut ultimas dies litis  before the matter was brought to a trial and on the day fixed for that if he chose to avoid a combat and knew that the thing was not his own he was obliged to bring it to the marches and inform the opposite party that he was satisfied upon enquiry that the horse etc was the property of that party and after this declaration he was bound to drive it into the water of tweed or esk and the defendant should then be free from the claim or challenge brought against him but if it was drowned before it reached the mid stream of the water so rendered in ms translation mentioned by dr nicholson  the defendant ought according to the custom of the marches to be still answerable for it and this extended to an ox cow or swine or other things only nothing was established about a load de sar   xii they further agreed that no inhabitant quod cullus de reg anglie potest probare aliquam rem aliquiem reum in printed copy de regno scotiae per testes  verse nisi tantum do per corpus hominis of either kingdom could prove his property in any thing possessed by an inhabitant of the other by witnesses but solely by the body of a man e by his own body or that of his champion in combat a combat of this kind on the marches was called by a particular name acra in a remonstrance of the clergy of england presented to the legate otho in      for procuring redress from the king of several encroachments on their liberties they complain of an abuse arising from an establishment of the kings of england and scotland by which not only simple clerks but also abbots and priors in the diocese of carlitle when challenged for any thing by an inhabitant or subject of scotland or reciprocally were compelled to fight with spears and swords a combat called era on the confines of the two kingdoms inter fores utriusque regni so that the abbot or prior of whatever religion or order was obliged either to a personal combat or to have a champion to combat for him and if this champion was defeated the abbot or prior was to undergo capital punishment of which there had been a recent instant in the prior of lidely the clergy supplicated the legate to admonish or if admonitions could not prevail to employ his legative authority to compel the kings not to suffer so detestable an abuse to be extended to ecclesiastical persons  whence many combats must needs ensue from the strifes that arose from time to time on the marches  xiii they further agreed that any person in their kingdom pursuing for the recovery of a debt due to him in the other ought according to the laws of the marches if the person indebted to him were a clerk to seek justice clericos inde monere ms manare from the clerks if a knight from the knights and if a burgess from the burgesses by which classes alone judgment et de illis et non aliis judicari ms sic de aliis et non alios judicari is respectively to be given where their brethren are concerned  finally they agreed that the magistrates within and without burghs in burgh et out burgh potestatem habebunt ms in burgh et in suth burgh  should have power to distrain the inhabitants of each kingdom in order to enforce the observation of the aforesaid customs between the kingdoms   happily those intestine miseries are swept away from the face of the land and the strength of these walls is opposed only to the hostility of strangers when this place first arose to importance is not known whether it was of any considerable strength during the conflicts between the britons with their roman allies and the northern nations is not easy to determine camden with other antiquarians have not offered any thing but conjecture ex libello quodam incerti autoris quem mutuo sumpsi a domino monjoro and erat de origin scottorum  berengus interfecto rodrico domino suo obtinuit locum habitandi in brittannio a mario et poltea edificavit villam de berwic  lel col v   p      some authors allege it was known to ptolomy the geographer who wrote in the time of antoninus by the name of tuesis but the situation described by him does not correspond with that of the present town  according to hector boethius berwick existed as a place of strength in the days of osbert the northumbrian king it is reasonable to conjecture when tweed became the boundary between scotland and england that berwick would arise as a barrier town be fortified and have an armed garrison in the account given of the danish invasion under hubba about the year     berwick is mentioned as the landing place of the invaders whilst the saxons possessed the country north of tweed berwick was not likely to have risen to any great importance being so near the royal seat of bamburgh except it should have had a fortress as a safeguard to the episcopal seat of lindisfarn  the same author relates that king donald having defeated the army of osbert near the river jedd marched down the tweed to berwick which the saxons then had in possession and which they abandoned on the news of their sovereigns overthrow donald seized three saxon vessels in the bay with great riches on board upon which event he and his followers gave themselves up to riot and revelling of this the saxons took advantage and made an unexpected assault on the town in the night when many of the scots were slain and their king was taken prisoner he also tells us that king gregory the great took berwick then possessed by the danes and put the garrison to the sword after which the scotch monarch spent his winter there  berwick continued for many ages part of the dominions of scotland and was one of the four original scotch burghs conjectures on the rise of borroughs from the manuscripts of the late roger gale esquire opinions concerning the aboriginal form of human habitations in general and british in particular founded upon the word buroughs by the rev mr conyers place of dorchester  borough and its contraction burgh of which also i take burrow barrow and bury to be so many corruptions is an allowed note of the antiquity of the place so called as well by cambden himself as those who are the authors of the annotations upon him nor can there be a more effectual confirmation of that note than that those old and mother towns that have the privilege of sending members to parliament are particularly distinguished by that name and are called buroughs or allowed to be so the whole title of many of them to their present enjoyment of that right in the state of decay they are now reduced to seems to rest in their claim to that title and in the respect and veneration which the evidences of antiquity inserted in that name bespeaks for them  i cannot perceive that the name borough or burgh was instituted to denote any kind of eminence in the place so called beyond others so as to mean a fort or castle or place any way fortified with ramparts or otherwise distinguished by any peculiar advantages as is often suggested by camden or that the name puts the place called by it under any distinction whatever unless accidentally besides that of common habitation the bare antiquity of which it only implys because it is often confounded with such appellatives to ascertain and distinguish it as burgh castle burgh fort etc and that it signifies no more than house houses or a town a settlement where one or more families dwelt borough was the habitation and bour was the inhabitant hence neighbor i e a nighbour or one that lived in a borough not far off  but the name borough though at first it directly meant only one common habitation yet carries in it monumental evidences of the original form of such habitation and indirectly lets us into that for our application of the name borough to the habitation of such animals whose natures are incapable of making improvements in their manner of dwelling that is still retained among us discovers the native and simple signification of the name borough when our ancestors gave their own dwellings that name for we appropriate it only to the underground lodgings of animals as to the holes of foxes badgers and rabbits from whence i infer that when it was first applied to human habitation whether in an allusive sense from them or theirs from it or whether both were simple and equally original that it signified the very same or what nearly resembled the habitations of those creatures and consequently that the inhabitants of this land when the name was given dwelt chiefly underground and lived not in houses raised from the ground but in holes dug in it which sense of the word seems still to obtain as to the dead though it has lost its native idea as to the living for hence we may call putting a corpse into a hole underground to bury or borough it a barrow or borough being a place dug for that purpose though the custom of monumental tumulation has abused the word to express the contrary to what it was instituted to express and to signify a hill instead of a hole  our original buroughs in the primitive simplicity were but as so many human warrens consisting of a set of underground caverns the lodging part and body at least of each dwelling run in and was underground and this is but suitable to the savage way of life of the old britons in other respects such as their going naked which alone cuts off all the ends almost of raising houses for to what end should men raise houses who had neither clothes nor furniture nor wanted any guard against the inclemency of the air nor had any intent of retirement to answer but security from wild beasts or noise whilst they slept their painted or rather smokebound hides looked as if they lived in rooms where smoke had no vent by windows or chimneys to which we may add as an inducement to natural simplicity that underground lodgings were both cooler in summer if our clime is ever too hot and warmer in winter for which latter reason it is pretty near kept to in iceland lapland etc purchase says of the icelanders all their houses are under ground lib   ca     nor were the inhabitants of this island singular in this matter so no derogation to them because it seems to have been natures primitive mode of dwelling common with them to most nations the various notions of  of old that took their names from the custom of living in holes or buroughs strictly such is an instance of it hence it is that the old giants are represented to us as underground livers all of them as polyphemuss cave cacuss den etc the rustic divinities of the heathen such as pan faunus the satyrs etc are proposed to us as residing in underground seats and your sibylls trophonius and the rest of them made choice of caverns to vent their oracles from as more awful and venerable by their resemblance of primitive and simple times when heaven and earth corresponded together more familiarly and i am apt to think that the notion of your  and terrae filii men springing out of the earth did arise hence and that a great many suddenly bolting out at once from their buroughs like the tinners in cornwall from their mines might first give occasion to those fables and fancies of crops of armed troops starting up from dragons and serpents teeth to the great surprise of cadmus and jason ovid reckons mens building houses and living above ground as an improvement or rather a degeneracy gradually introduced after the golden age and in process of time tum primum subiere domos domos antra fuere et densi frutices aut junctae ortice virgae following to be sure the tracks of history and traditionary chronology at least from the creation in this matter  after the deluge the terror it had struck and the fear of its return made men keep chiefly to the mountains as the safest besides that the plains and flat countries must be all so mixed and thereby puddled that a century would scarce harden and settle them again sufficiently for safe and convenient habitation for till the waters had wrought themselves drains after such a thorough blend they must be drawn off very leisurely and when the fertility of the plains invited them down the distrust of the floods returning first put them upon building upwards from the level of which new project babel seems to have been the first instance followed by others built after the same new mode by nimrod in the plain of shinar nor does it appear that any such thing had been practiced before by the antediluvians and mosess way of mentioning that piece of architecture does intimate the project to have been entirely new and that the tower or town of babel was the first building that men had raised above ground for habitation for cains building of a city may be accounted for by forming a society only or surrounding the place where he dwelt with trenches ramparts or fortifications such as his fears put him upon and does not determine it to any mode of building digging downward for habitation both before and long after the flood appears to have been the common and general practice and natures first genuine method which men departed from either through distrust or ignorance of gods providence lest there should be a second deluge or as the fear of wild beasts or of each other grown wild or savage prevailed over natures present or more simple recourse for habitation or as the local inconveniences of the foundering in the natural mould might put them here and there upon artificial walls and roofs or as suffocating damps or sulphurous steams and exhalations made them continue building upwards as an expedient or as the nearness of the springs would not permit them to sink houses but forced them to aboveground habitations this not being a thing of choice but necessity a violence offered to natural dictate and disposition men went no further nor faster into them than just in the simplest manner to avoid inconvenience that put them upon it so as to live above ground with as much resemblance still as possible to living under ground either raising an artificial bank and then scooping out the earth from the side for even mud walls were not presently invented till some superior and happy genius discovered the tempering of the artificial paste and the use of it now so vulgar and universal which was once the secret and rarity of the age however now the prejudices from the reverse of custom and the modern refinements of artificial dwellings has turned the ideas and very thoughts of subterraneous living within walls and under roofs of earth of natures disposing into contempt and ridicule and we laugh at the simplicity and extreme awkwardness of the thing yet we continue to pay regard to the name and while we spurn the substance load the shadow with dignity and preeminence and make it a title of preference to all that culture and elegance of modern architecture that has succeeded it  all the first settled habitations were caves nor is it likely there were houses unless stationary places of defense before or for some generations after the flood had architecture been presently from the creation invented or been natural yet it is not likely there were any materials in the first ages to build withal for they would require considerable time for their generation there being few stones and still fewer quarries to be supposed perfectly formed the rocks requiring ages to bring them to a firmness beyond paste nor were the mines of metals hastily ripened to a hardness for tools nor are we sure that woods or timber trees were created mature or enew to be employed in building till they had by gods command propagated their several kinds brick therefore or naked earth was of necessity probably not choice the first material of architecture and the only one which nevertheless must have been unserviceable had not the natural exstation of bitumen upon the spot luckily supplied the want of cement to the first undertakers for from the creation to the building of the tower of babel they had none at all of an artificial sort it is plain from the text so never had built  the best therefore that we can suppose of our top british mansions and towns when the name of borroughs was imposed on them in the barbarous state the inhabitants were then in is that they came up to the uts of the hottentots or indian savages or other uncultivated tribes of men and if their houses stood above ground yet they were such congesta culmina espite or extempore hovels as our beggars now but make against banks of the road side one degree removed from subterranean if at all they lived under earth if not under ground and indeed what are our houses still but supplemental caves above ground  nor does the antique mode of living under ground seem to have gone off at once but by degrees by little and little since it is hardly yet quite worn out it is but lately that the fashion of ascending to houses has much prevailed most old houses may be observed to be descended into by steps and floors laid a good deal below the level with expense to have them so which is to be ascribed either to nature or to a remain of the old british genius and custom of underground living still icking in us  the old pavements of your opus tesselatum are generally found so low in the ground that i cannot see how they can be so well supposed to be either so far overgrown or sunk beneath the surface but rather to have been designedly at first laid under ground though by roman hands in compliance with the natives mode of underground habitations  nor is it an unlikely conjecture that the vast and various cavities under ground such as those of the peak and wookey or oey hole near wells these are without doubt natural and never could be habitable and a great many others less famous may not be all the work of nature but in great measure the effects of underground architecture by mens cultivating the dispositions of nature and as they look like the palaces of some old giants so they might be the windsors and hampton cour of their times when underground dwellings were in fashion and once admired no less for magnificence than now for prospects of wildness and horror i know no hypothesis that can account so well for all those odd hollows sinkings in the ground and pits that are every where to be met withal and in some places too many and too regular to have happened there by chance as just by nottingham and yet one cannot imagine that they should have been made there for any purposes above ground but as they are the manifest foundering in of subterranean caves by length of time why might they not be the work of men for habitation when borough life was in fashion abundance of these kinds of large basins i remember when i was a boy in ripon common in yorkshire and a great many in a neighboring heath and hard by here etc dorchester   after underground living was generally quitted as to natural and civil life yet we find how devotion and superstition still loved to keep it on by underground cells chapels and oratories nor is it to the disadvantage of borough life that so many of those of whom the world was not worthy are said to have dwelt in dens and caves of the earth some of choice and others for refuge grotius notes on lots dwelling in a cave genesis xix  0 that strabo relates there were abundance of caves in that country which being one of those that were first inhabited strengthens the thought that they came not there by chance but were made by the men for habitation though by change of custom difused and the abundance of them in all countries that admit of it confirms the same truth as to their several aborigines  that there are fewer buroughs in our lower and flat countries and part of the nation though otherwise more populous and better stocked with modern towns than the hilly parts may also proceed from their being less commodious for the borough life then in vogue which may be one reason why cornwall has in it more buroughs in proportion than any other county and where the aboriginal inclination to borough life very remarkably also exemplified itself among the inhabitants as many of which almost are said to live in buroughs in the old sense of the word as in those above ground  the romans indeed represent the britons when they found them as living in huts of reeds or wood and their towns as so many woods but the britons who knew themselves best cannot be supposed without reason and propriety to have given a name to their habitations that speaks them to have been of another nature against which no foreign testimony can so far prevail as to make us think otherwise but that in some period of time or other either then before or since the inhabitants notions of dwelling were agreeable to what that name expressed and that considerable dispositions were made actually among themselves accordingly  the name borough appears to have traveled hither from germany and the north whence we were first peopled and where a great many of their oldest and most considerable towns carry burgh and borough in their name and the thing itself in the colder climates as i have hinted is pretty near kept up to the infamous custom of incestuous community of wives which caesar takes notice of among the britons and says they had ten or twelve of them wives together in common especially brothers with one another and parents with their children very well agrees with borough living for families cohabiting in one common room together without partition and that suited such works of darkness must of course fall by that means into such unnatural practice he must mean gaved for by borrough english the inheritance goes to the youngest child only and that sort of odd tenure which they call borough english must as naturally as necessarily arise again from mens having community of wives for where men could not know which were their own which others children it of course drew them into the agreement of letting all fare alike  the invention of this tenure of borough english has likewise raised a thought in my head concerning the etymology of the name england itself that falls in with what i have said of buroughs from an old word still in use in the north which is angle and signifies a hole that runs under ground on the branch of a mine from the old word that worm takes its name whose use for baits has given the name of angling when we fish with it it is not unlikely but the name of england and angleland might also come from living in subterraneous caverns a borough differing from an angle as a part from the whole a house from a town or one room from a house if we suppose some of those buroughs like the cave of machpelah double genesis chapter xxiii but there is nothing said of its being double there that is running in several ways from one common mouth so that englishmen was as much as to say burroughmen or cavernlivers the very same as  which example makes it more likely and which i think is a much better conjecture than from angulus or their living in a corner or from angling or from angelus the story of the popes admiring the english boys which paultry etymologies yet are thought worthy of a place in our antiquities that the name of england or englishman by this argument the britons could never be called burroughlivers as he before supposes since the name of england was unknown till long after the arrival of the saxons as it is thus of cognate signification may come from the word angle which is the same thing almost as borough is still more likely from hence that the angles or anglelivers have their original fixed in that same quarter whence as has been observed borough came and so the two words give mutually light to one another and strength to what i have observed the native force of the one supports the denominative title of the other and with an equal propriety had arbitrary custom happened to have made the counterchange of application the kingdom might have been called burroughland and our towns for buroughs angles     edgar king of scotland gave it to the sea of durham according to hollingshead in honor of st cuthbert under whose banner he had obtained an important victory this donation was

whilst the chief part of the garrison was employed in defending the town nearest the haven he is charged by fordun and other scottish writers with using a delusive artifice in detaching a body of men under the cover of some rising grounds to gain an approach on another quarter and by displaying scotch colors induce the garrison to permit their advancing near the fortifications under a presumption that they were a reinforcement for the town the english authors take no notice of this stratagem it appears from the best authorities that the fortifications of this place at that time consisted chiefly of a ditch and a rampire of earth with a barricado of timber through these the english army made their entrance with very little difficulty and the garrison and inhabitants astonished at the suddenness of the event and overwhelmed by superior force were slaughtered without much resistance the chief opposition that was made was by  0 flandrian merchants who held out a strong tower called the red hall till the evening when fire being set to it the building was consumed and all within perished in the reduction of this tower the brother of the earl of cornwall a valiant knight was slain by a spears piercing his eye as he looked up to those who fought above all the gentlemen and fighting men of fife are said to have been put to the sword the castle commanded by william douglas surrendered the same day and its garrison consisting of  00 men were permitted to march out armed on swearing from thenceforth not to fight against the king or kingdom of england but their governor was detained a prisoner fordun says the number of slain was   00 that the streets ran with blood two days and in such quantities as to make mills go boetheus says also the slain were about  000 in number and says that mills were actually set agoing with the blood matthew westminster says that all were slain without distinction of sex or age in number  0000 in the instructions from the regency and council of scotland to their procurators at rome a d   0  it is said that after taking berwick the king and his army committed the most barbarous cruelties on the inhabitants who to the number of almost  000 were slain without distinction of character sex or age the churches afforded no protection to those who fled thither after being defiled with the blood of the slain and spoiled of all their ornaments the king and his followers made stables of them for the horses of the army in these instructions there is the following charge against king edward  that he had violently seized baliols person and kingdom and compelled his chancellor to resign his great seal and after baliol and his son were sent prisoners to london he caused letters of resignation to be forged and afterward published them to the inhabitants of scotland although they never were nor should be ratified by baliol this carnage may be ascribed to a resentment of the cruelties committed the preceding year by the men of berwick and the fighting men of fife in attacking certain english vessels that had entered the port setting fire to the ships and putting the several crews to death  on the   th day of august a d      the king received the homage the oath of fealty then administered  because we are under the subjection of the thrice noble prince and our dear lord sire edward king of england lord of ireland and duke of aquitain we do faithfully promise for ourselves and for our heirs upon pain of body and estate that we will serve him truly and loyally against all manner of people that may live

his avarice neglected putting the kings commands in execution for building a stone wall along the side of the new fosse and applied the kings treasures to his own appropriations so that berwick was apparently in so defenseless a state as not to be esteemed tenable by the garrison against wallaces troops  cressingham was slain at the battle of sterling bridge and was flead by the soldiers who divided his skin among them as a trophy  the castle of berwick was so strong and well maintained that the scots were not able to reduce it the regency levied a great force the army consisting of  000 armed horse   00 light horse and  00000 foot on the approach of this formidable armament the scots deserted the town and the faithful garrison in the castle who had sustained a long blockade were happily relieved one of the towers in berwick castle called hogs tower was at this time the prison of sir william douglas where it is said he died   the alarm occasioned by wallaces insurrection and the invasion with which england was then threatened brought forth excellent fruits which still bless this kingdom and are the felicity of the present age the ratification of the great charter and charter of the forests with a most inestimable addition a grant and concession that no tallage or aid should thenceforth be imposed on the people without the assent of the prelates nobles knights burgesses and other freemen  king edward in the year   0  mustered that victorious army here with which he penetrated the remotest parts of scotland and completed its conquest  in the year   0  wallace having been betrayed into the hands of his enemies suffered an ignominious execution and half of his body was ordered to be exposed on berwick bridge in the succeeding year neal bruce brother of robert bruce was taken in the castle of kildrummy with many other persons of great distinction who were sent prisoners to berwick where king edward ordered them to be tried by justices sent thither by whom they were condemned and sentenced to be hanged drawn and quartered the countess of buchan sister to the earl of fife eloped from john common her husband and carried in her retinue all his warhorses with which she repaired to robert bruce at scone and in the absence of the earl her brother who was then with the king of england and whose hereditary office it was to place the crown on the heads of the scotch monarchs she assumed that high duty and put the diadem on the head of bruce king edward senteaced her to be shut up in a wooden cage in one of the towers of berwick castle redpats border hist p     from the order set forth by rymer it appears that the chamberlain of scotland or his lieutenant at berwick was to cause this cage to be made of sufficient strength in which she was to be attended and served by one or two english women of the town of berwick and no scotch man or woman or any other person except the servant or servants appointed her were to be suffered to have access to her another author westminster says that the king declared as she did not strike with the sword she should not die by it but ordered her to be shut up in an habitation of wood and iron shaped like a crown and to be hung out at berwick in the open air for a spectacle and everlasting reproach both living and dead to all that passed mary a sister of bruce was ordered to be shut up in like manner at the castle of roxburgh the countess of buchan lived in this confinement six years when by the royal mandate she was released from her cage and given in charge to henry de beaumont  in the year   0  the stores ordered by the king of england to be delivered by the citizens of london at berwick for the use of the forces against the scots were  0 barrels of honey  00 barrels of wine

returning thither from his scotch expedition the dearth was so great in scotland this year that the people fed on horseflesh and other carrion ibid     during the kings residence here he confirmed the election of richard de kellow to the sea of durham on the death of anthony de beck  in      robert bruce attempted to surprise berwick by a scalade in the night but after ladders of ropes were fixed the place was saved by the barking of a dog which alarmed the garrison and the assailants were repulsed with considerable loss  in the year      king edward ii rendezvoused his army at berwick consisting of  0000 horse three thousand of which were completely armed horses and men and   000 foot they were in part lodged within the town and the rest in tents without the walls the carriages attending this army were numerous as no supplies could be drawn from a country desolated by war and wasted by famine malmsbury says if they had passed in one line they would have extended sixty leagues in length most authors agree that so fine an army had not in the memory of man marched from england the army of the scots consisted of  0000 advantageously posted and waiting the approach of the english on the banks of bannocks burn i seem to be led involuntarily to a relation of this battle famous for the establishment of robert bruce on the throne of scotland in its event  sterling castle had sustained a long siege and blockade and the governor was at length obliged to accede to certain articles under which if this fortress was not relieved before an appointed day it was to be surrendered to bruce king edward determined to march to its relief and with all possible expedition moved his army from berwick robert bruce informed of the intention of the english monarch resolved to abide the event of a battle rather than raise the siege he had viewed the ground and fixed upon a part near the castle where he should have only just sufficient room to marshal his troops with advantage according to their arms this place was defended on the one hand by inaccessible rocks and on the other by a morass having the water of bannokburn in front king edward being informed the country near sterling was full of morasses and difficult to be passed so that his horse could not be of the service he wished he levied a reinforcement of foot  000 from yorkshire   00 from northumberland   00 from durham and  000 from derby and nottingham in the advance the army was divided into ten columns  0000 men in each commanded by leaders of the most distinguished character the earls of gloucester and hereford led the van the center was led by the king in person sir giles dargentein and aymer de valence earl of pembroke generals under him the army under these divisions is said to have covered a large tract of country and was a sight august and solemn the whole scene made resplendent by burnished arms and displayed ensigns  as the english approached bruce led his troops to occupy the chosen ground on the saturday before the battle to strengthen the station he caused pits to be dug in front armed with pointed stakes within covered with hurdles or flakes and concealed by turfs and rushes on the morning of sunday being midsummer eve bruce with his lords and chieftains attended solemn devotions and mass in the front of the army and the priests went through the ranks exhorting each soldier to exert his powers for the relief of his country and rather die a martyr in the virtuous cause than see the english again become tyrannical taskmasters as they had been in the time of king edward i of detested memory such arguments and exhortations served to inflame the scotch army with enthusiastic ardour the english were ordered to advance so near bruces station on sunday evening that though harrassed with a tedious march they were obliged to lay under arms all night for fear of a surprise this evening was not without several skirmishes and reencounters in which the english were worsted in one of these robert bruce engaged and slew sir henry boynton cleaving his head with a battle ax a party of  00 horse under the command of lord robert clifford and henry beaumont attempting to gain the castle were engaged by a chosen band of spearmen led by earl murray and put to the rout sir william dayncourt was slain and thomas gray made prisoner lel coll the earl of gloucester was unhorsed but rescued malmsbury   the disposition of the scotch army on the day of battle was in four divisions sir thomas randolph commanded the van edward bruce the right wing and sir james douglas the left robert bruce was with the body of reserve or rear the scotch were all on foot that by making the danger and distress of the engagement equal the ardour of each might by example be exhilerated the soldiers of the body of reserve were covered with light coats of mail which a sword could not penetrate they carried an ax in the belt and lances in their hands malmsbury describes the scotch army moving as thick as a hedge the leaders were men of that skill and valor that they possessed the confidence of the troops in the english army the foot consisting of spearmen and archers were in the van the horse were on each flank and in these positions the armies engaged  the onset was vigorous and well maintained on both sides the earl of gloucester commanded that part of the line which was attacked by sir james douglass corpse consisting of  000 borderers and  000 irish scots or katerans vulgarly called redshanks a fierce and valiant race the english unable to sustain the shock began to give way when the earl impatient of disgrace and inflamed with ire accompanied by a chosen band rushed into the thickest of the foes where he was beaten from his horse and slain the covered pits deterred or frustrated his knights from effecting his rescue malmsbury says with great warmth confundat eos dominos they were  00 in number and in the emergency  0 might have effected his relief sir giles dargentein a man much esteemed by robert bruce and of great military fame one of the commanders of the gens d arms who guarded the king advanced to gloucesters relief but died in the attempt robert de clifford payen de tiptoft william marescal edmund mayley and several other eminent leaders were equally unfortunate in those parts of the army where they commanded and were soon numbered with the slain the english archers who had so often carried victory with them in former conflicts were attacked in flank and put to the rout by a troop of light cavalry close armed who were remounted for this critical service and led by sir robert keith marshal of scotland the confusion among the archers and the fall of such eminent leaders struck the english army with a panic which was not a little increased by the sight of a large body of men advancing over the summit of a distant eminence who were no other than the attendants on the carriages and baggage drawn up in martial array and displaying pieces of linen on the ends of spears which at that distance appeared like a crowd of banners confusion and uproar soon took place and the english monarch was advised to secure his retreat as victory was declaring on every hand for bruce and the english forces wearied and fainting were giving way the king with great reluctance and shame consented to move the royal standard the sight of which completed what the valor of the scotch phalanx had so gloriously begun the rout became general and multitudes fell as well under the sword in the pursuit as in the waters of bannockburn and forth the effusion of blood was greatly spared by the avarice of plunder the rich baggage of the english army affording immense booty to the victors of the scots only two leaders of note fell william vipont and walter ross seven hundred english gentlemen were missing after the battle the greatest part of whom were among the prisoners sterling surrendered to the king of scotland who ordered the fortifications to be destroyed to their foundations redpath in his border history says the rout of the english was indeed very entire but neither the number they brought to the field nor the loss they sustained appear to have been nigh so great as the scottish writers represent them  king robert bruce treated the prisoners with great humanity and buried the dead with all due decorum the bodies of the earl of gloucester and lord robert clifford he sent to the king at berwick to be interred with the honors due to their rank and military fame on account of a personal friendship which had formerly subsisted between them he liberated without ransom his prisoner lord ralph de mounthermer husband to the countess of gloucester the king of englands sister  king edward with a body of horse fled toward berwick pursued by sir james douglas with a party of light cavalry who effected nothing but taking up a few stragglers who fell off from the kings troop he first took shelter in the castle of dunbar from whence he was conveyed by sea to bambrough or berwick it is certain he was at berwick the third day after this defeat as he issued a proclamation from thence to advise his subjects of the loss of his privy seal which was restored to him by mounthermer on his return  after this victory various bands of scots ravaged northumberland  in the year      the scots attempted to take berwick by surprise by means of their shipping with which they entered the river under false colors but being discovered by the garrison before they began an attack suffered considerable loss ever they could effect an escape  in the following year the dearth was so great in northumberland that the people were obliged to eat the flesh of horses and dogs a quarter of wheat sold for  0 shillings  berwick had continued in the possession of the english for  0 years when the commander in the town being corrupted betrayed it to the earl of murray in the year      who led a body of robert bruces forces james duglas by the help of patrike count of march and peter spalding of berwike got berwike out of the englischmennes hands but the castle kept a xi wekes after and then for lak of vitaile and rescue was gyven up then roger horseley the captain of the castle for the englischmen lost one of his yes  lel col v   p       barber the historian of bruce says that one spalding incensed against the governors cruelty toward the scotch inhabitants had determined to betray the town into the hands of bruces party and accordingly having intimated his design and assigned the time and place for the enterprise when it was his turn to mount guard at the cowgate randolph and douglas with a chosen band repaired to dunse park and under cover of the night advanced to a part of the wall which was left unguarded and by ladders entered the town unperceived by any but spalding they lay concealed till daylight when other forces coming up upon the assault were aided by those within and gained the place by noon many of the garrison and townsmen retired into the castle from whence they made a sally presuming the scotch forces were weak from the thin display of banners but they were repulsed with some loss the news of regaining berwick was soon spread over the adjacent country and numbers of scotch crowded thither to maintain the place and assist in the siege of the castle which stood out six days this differs widely from lelands account and then capitulated on terms for the garrison to march out with their arms and depart for england the scotch king robert bruce soon after arrived and with his court resided some time in the castle he made his soninlaw walter steward of scotland governor who ambitious of possessing a settlement on the borders where he might display his youthful courage called out  00 gentlemen his dependents with others of inferior rank skilful in shooting with bows and working engines for the more effectual defense of the place sir john crab a fleming of high reputation in his art was made chief engineer  king edward in the succeeding year prepared to recover berwick and on the first of september approached with a large body of troops having with him lancaster pembroke arundell hertford warren and the earl marshal the kings brother hugh despencer roger de tammori and hugh deudeley parceners to the earldom of gloucester by marriage of the coheiresses the late earls sisters this force was accompanied by a fleet from the cinque ports laden with provisions and all kind of stores the english fortified their camp and then proceeded to an assault the walls of the town are described to be so low that an assailant might strike the people that defended them with a spear on the seventh of september they attempted an escalade at different parts in the same time and a ship was directed to approach with an engine to attempt the walls on the side next the haven but all these were fruitless the ship was left on ground by ebb of tide and burnt by the garrison in the next general assault which was made on the   th of september the english employed a great machine called a sow constructed for holding and defending men who were moved in it toward the foot of the wall in order to undermine and sap its foundation devices were used to burn this machine but by throwing a stone of vast weight from an engine the sow was split and her occupiers dislodged on an attack of marygate the draw bridge was burnt and the gate in great danger but forces from the castle coming to its defense the assailants were obliged to retire these efforts harrassed and weakened the garrison considerably and the town must on another assault have fallen into the hands of the english if lancaster had not withdrawn his forces from the camp exercising his malignant spirit at this critical time against the king whom he hated most inveterately the earl of murray and lord douglas had entered england with  0000 chosen men and penetrated almost to the city of york the queen escaping with difficulty these circumstances determined edward to raise the siege of berwick  king robert bruce perceiving the importance of this place strengthened the walls and raised them considerably in height giving also many new towers and additional bulwarks to the whole  in the year      king robert bruce at this place ratified the treaty of peace entered into with king edward iii by his plenipotentiaries at bishop thorpe near york  in      joan the sister of king edward iii being contracted to david the son and heir of king robert bruce was conveyed to berwick with a splendid retinue where she was received by the earl of murray and lord douglas representatives of the king he being sick and the nuptials were celebrated with great magnificence she was called make peace and carried with her the ragman roll and all records which had been seized by king edward i to be again deposited in the scotch archives  at this ceremony a magnificent parade was made by the nobles of each nation and a sumptuous pageant crowded the place with all that solemn pomp which in the days of chivalry decked out public spectacles sumptured horses and men braced in shining arms forming long trains of steel effigies stiffened in coats of mail and strapped like inanimate beings to the saddle were the chief objects lord mortimers retinue alone consisted of nine score knights properly caparisoned with their esquires gentlemen and yeomen  the expedition of lord henry beaumont and his associates into scotland in the year      being attended with remarkable success became an object of serious attention with the english monarch in so much that edward baliol supported by this party in his pretensions to the crown of scotland as successor of his father john baliol having gained the castle of roxburgh king edward received his letters patent issued from thence in which he acknowledged the king of england supreme lord of scotland and ceded to him the town castle and county of berwick to be annexed to his kingdom with many other advantageous cessions and terms of amity and alliance of such weight and consideration that the king summoned his parliament to meet at york to deliberate thereon as many of the states especially the prelates were absent nothing was determined in general it was thought expedient to treat with the guardian and nobles of king davids party for which purpose commissioners were instructed to require homage and fealty from the scotch king and a cession of berwick but these requisitions were rejected with the utmost disdain baliol during this time had a perilous escape from annan and was obliged to take refuge in england his party being thrown into the utmost confusion king edward was too far advanced in the cause to recede and therefore accepted the terms proposed by baliol at roxburgh and ratified them on his part edward baliol gave up berwick roxburg dedinburg pebilles and dunfres to king edward and promisid to make him homage for the resideu after that the hole englisch host had faught with the scotts and had so great a victory of the town of berwick was gyven up to king edward  lel col v   p       the english did not recover berwick till the  th year of the reign of king edward iii after the battle of halydoun hill where the slaughter of the scottish forces was terrible   earls  00 knights  00 esquires and   000 common men died in the field a carnage dreadful to recount and from the very idea of which the soul recoils with horror  king edward the third on being refused the homage of david bruce and restitution of berwick ordered his herald to proclaim his defiance of the scotch king the english army began to besiege berwick on the   th of april      the scots knowing the reduction of this place would be one of the first and chief enterprises of their adversaries to the utmost of their power put it in a state of defense to resist the great shock they presumed it would necessarily sustain they filled it with a garrison of chosen veterans and made sir william keith governor of the town and patrick earl of dunbar the keeper of the chief fortress or citadel the king soon arrived and remained in person before the walls about a month when perceiving from the strength of the garrison and the vigorous defense they made that it would not be easy to reduce the place he marched part of his army into scotland carrying the horrid ravages of war as far as scone dundee and dumbarton the most savage cruelties mark those times the wild american never devised more shocking barbarities than stained these borders each nation was ingenious in torture in modes of devastation and in the prosecution of revenge having glutted their avarice of blood and being loaded with pillage they again returned to berwick which king edward still found unsubdued after receiving reinforcements he declared his determination was either to be master of berwick or effect something of consequence by bringing his adversaries to battle the siege was changed into a strict blockade the besieged distressed by the cutting off supplies made many sallies with various fortune they made a vigorous attack upon the fleet and most of the navy then before berwick was burnt the garrison still entertained hopes of relief and refused to capitulate presuming this key to the kingdom was of too great consequence to the scotch at that time to be neglected and suffered to fall into the hands of the enemy lord douglas had levied a powerful army with which he marched to the neighborhood of berwick but to the great distress of the garrison who believed their day of deliverance was at hand instead of attacking the english douglas crossed the tweed and in sight of the town marched along the coast toward the castle of bambrough which being esteemed impregnable was chosen by the king of england as a secure residence for his queen the scotch wasted several days in blocking up that fortress and ravaging the adjacent parts hoping that king edwards solicitude for his queen would induce him to raise the siege of berwick  the device which had been practiced with effect in the year      did not now take place king edward was not to be moved from his determined purpose the garrison reduced to extremities for want of provisions and dispirited by the apparent neglect of douglas proposed a treaty which king edward readily attended to and the capitulation was concluded on the   th day of july under the following conditions that the town and castle should be surrendered to king edward on the  0th if not relieved with  00 men at arms or by a battle that in the interval there should be a cessation of arms that in case of a surrender the lives and properties of the garrison and inhabitants should be protected with liberty to such as were so inclined to leave the place and that the governor should have safe conduct granted him to the scotch army to communicate the articles sir william keith repaired to the scotch camp without delay and there prevailed that an attempt should be made to relieve the place a measure totally disapproved by some of the oldest and most experienced of the scotch leaders  in this interval a transaction is said to have taken place which sullies the luster of edwards military character and stamps an odium on his memory it stands recorded to the following effect by buchanan boece and other scotch authors of great credit  hostages were given by the scots for performance of their part of the treaty one of whom was the eldest son of sir alexander seeton who was deputy governor and took command on keiths resorting to the camp king edward had also in his camp seetons younger son taken a prisoner at the assault made on the navy the king apprehending that by the approach of the scotch army he might probably be deprived of the capture of berwick an object of so great importance soon after the departure of keith contrary to the faith of princes the sacredness of treaties the common policy of nations and all private honor demanded an immediate surrender of the place threatening if seeton refused that he would immediately hang up his two sons the hostage and the prisoner before the walls seeton remonstrated but edward regardless of all the charges made against him for the violation of public faith caused a gibbet to be erected in full view of the town to put in execution his infamous threat seeton struggling between honor and parental feelings between duty to his country and love for his children suffered all the pangs arising from a conflict in which every sentiment was on the rack nature would have prevailed and seetons children been saved by a sacrifice of his countrys honor and his own had not the mother with all the virtue and heroism of a roman matron and the greatness of the most exalted mind argued forcibly to support his principle and sustain his fainting soul and when yet he seemed to relax she withdrew him from the horrid spectacle that he might retain his rectitude though his sons were the inestimable price by which it was maintained edward unrelenting put them to death and seeton kept the town  this transaction is denied by the english historians who affirm that the scotch army came in fight before the truce was expired and therefore edward could have no pretense for demanding a surrender smollet vol   p     tyrell says on expiration of the truce mentioned by boece and buchanan king edward summoned the town to surrender to which seeton replied he could not consent thereto as he had assurances of speedy relief the king insisted on the terms of the truce by which the surrender was stipulated and the time was now expired seeton still refused would have prevaricated and argued which so incensed the king that by advice of his council he executed one of seetons sons this act is said to have induced the townsmen whose sons were hostages to solicit new terms and additional days for cessation of arms which king edward granted  it does not appear that seetons son was an hostage his name is not in any record of that treaty but presuming there was a former treaty which was renewed or prolonged and of which no record is now in being this difficulty ceases fordun expressly says king edward caused seetons son thomas to be executed on a gibbet in sight of his parents but agrees with tyrell that it was not done till after the time of the treaty was expired   this argument is futile and seems weak in opposition to the uniformity of the scotch historians  on the   th of july lord douglas led his army over the tweed and encamped at a place called bothull or bothville the english possessed halydown hill a very considerable eminence on the west of berwick having an easy declivity toward the river the other sides were steeper the scotch disregarding this apparent advantage determined to engage on the scotch side of the hill not only to secure a retreat but in case of victory to take advantage of the flow of tide which would render the tweed impassable to the english if they should be routed  the scotch army was disposed in four grand divisions john murray commanded the first with lord andrew frazer and his sons simon and james the second was commanded by robert lord high steward of scotland with the principal men of his kindred and the earl of monteith the third by the earls of ross sutherland and strathern and the fourth by lord archibald douglas guardian of the kingdom of scotland and commander in chief accompanied by the earls of lenox and carrick the whole army amounted to   000 the number of king edwards army is not positively mentioned by any author it is supposed the number of the scotch was not so great as historians have asserted and that they were nearly equal to their adversaries king edward also disposed his army in four divisions each of which was flanked by choice and skilful archers  when both sides were ready to engage the onset was a while suspended by the appearance of a scotchman of gigantic stature who had gained the name of turnbull on account of a gallant exploit by which king robert bruce was saved from the attacks of a wild bull which had unhorsed him as he was hunting turnbull attended by a great mastiff some of the borderers on the western marches kept mastiffs or bulldogs which were let loose on the ravaging parties  nicholson and burns hist west approached the english army and gave a challenge for single combat after a short pause which the singularity of the circumstance occasioned the challenge was accepted by sir robert benhale a young norfolk knight much inferior in stature to the scotch champion but of great strength and adroitness in military achievements the mastiff immediately flew forward and was received by the knight with a stroke upon the loins with his sword which severed his body the scotch champion advanced benhale with great agility and skill eluded the heavy blows aimed at him and first cut off the left arm of his adversary and at last struck off his head stowe   the scotch army began to ascend the hill about the hour of vespers with great impetuosity their leaders chieftains and men at arms dismounted the more to animate the troops by rendering the danger equal they were soon out of breath in consequence of ascending the steep the english archers were advantageously placed in different stations on the hill so as to pour down such showers of arrows on the close bodies of the scotch troops as made a terrible slaughter they were

intelligence at the instant of his landing from calais he tarried in london only three days before he set forward for berwick before which place he came on the   th day of january with a large army attended by a great naval power with which he laid siege to the town both by sea and land the king entered the castle which still held out for him and meditated a sally at the time his troops began the assault on other quarters sir walter manny with miners brought from the forest of dean was employed at the same time in advancing a mine below the wall these vigorous measures induced the garrison to surrender the town some of the scotch historians say the garrison on the approach of king edwards army evacuated the place having first plundered it and beat down the walls the king added greatly to the fortifications and strengthened the fortress with several new works the surprise of berwick by the scotch is spoken of with some incredible circumstances steward earl of angus with earl march having collected a powerful navy from different parts of scotland in which they embarked a chosen band of soldiers entered tweed in a dark night and landed the forces under the walls unperceived by break of day with scaling ladders they mounted the wall at cowgate and overpowered the guard after which they soon made themselves masters of the whole town it seems probable there was some treachery in favor of the scotch assailants patric of dunbar count of march and thomas le seneschal that caulled himself count of angus one and twenty days after this prepaired themself upon a night with scaling laders cumming to berwick and with in vi days after tok be assaute one of the stronges toures of berwik and enterid the town  this tydinges was brought to king edward at his very landing at

the scots to the sword who were increased to the number of    but this was not effected till the small garrison had held out eight days against  000 english archers and  000 horse and during the assault lost only two of their number the northumbrians soon after ravaged the territories of lord march in revenge for his destroying the town of roxburgh the abovementioned surprise was effected in the night before the feast of st andrew the leader some authors say was the valiant sir john gordon but the english historians allege it was alexander ramsey when the earl of northumberland summoned them to surrender they answered with insolence that they would not yield it either to the king of england or scotland but would retain and defend it for the king of france  in      the scotch gained berwick by corrupting the deputy governor the duke of lancaster then in enmity with henry percy earl of northumberland possessing the kings ear improved this circumstance greatly to the earls disadvantage and he was in consequence attainted of high treason as having been guilty of treachery and consequently his possessions were forfeited the earl thinking his immediate presence before berwick was of the first consequence with a numerous army besieged the town but bloodshed was spared by the secret application of  000 marks which regained the place this event operated so powerfully

son who fell at the battle of shrewsbury and the execution of his brother he had the mortification to see the kings third son john assume the office of high constable which the king had conferred on the earl for life with the wardenship of the east marches he also was deprived of the office of warden of the west marches in favor of the earl of westmoreland the king demanded the resignation of the castles of berwick and jedburgh and in contempt of the general act of grace for the remission of all offenses passed after the battle of shrewsbury sent out commissioners to compound with the earls adherents and grant them separate charters the archbishop and earl marshal were apprehended before the earl of northumberland could join them with his forces and suffered execution at york the earl of northumberland held the castle of berwick on the kings arrival at pontefract he ordered a confiscation of all the earls estates and commanded the sheriff of yorkshire to summon the whole military power of his county to rendezvous at newcastle the force with which the king proceeded on this expedition was no less than   000 men with engines and artillery for a siege this powerful armament alarming the earl with his grandson the son of henry hotspur and bardolph he retired privily from berwick and took refuge in scotland sir william greystock was left to command the fortress king henry on his march summoned the castle of warkworth to surrender but it was not yielded to him till after a siege of eight days when the garrison capitulated on the honorable terms of departing with their horses and accoutrements he made the like summons to the garrison of the castle of alnwick to which he received for answer hard p  0  that win berwick ones he should have his intent the army advanced to berwick and made the usual preparations for a regular siege whilst the governor on his part pursued the necessary maneuvers for a vigorous defense in hopes of receiving succor from scotland which had been promised him by the earl on his departure the royal army had some pieces of ordnance engines of destruction which had never before appeared against the fortifications of berwick and which speed by the authority of walsingham says were on this occasion for the first time employed in britain a shot of an enormous size discharged from a cannon of large bore the first construction of cannon was by iron bars bound together with hoops shattered one of the principal towers which threw the garrison into such consternation that they immediately surrendered the governor sir henry bolton

mentioned who had expended a large sum in strengthening and rebuilding the walls of the town repairing the castle and furnishing it with a complete arrangement of artillery the assailants flattered themselves from the newness of the works they should be able to beat them down without much difficulty and easily win the place but although considerable breaches were effected the garrison made so brave a defense that after spending a great part of the winter in carrying on the siege the english were obliged to raise it and retire with disgrace  king edward iv in the year      about the

to the dean and chapter of durham which in rent and tithe of fish brings in   0l per annum for all the other fisheries are liable to tithe the common rents of these are  0l a year for which tenants have as much shore as serves to launch out and draw their nets on shore the limits of each are staked and i observed that the fishers never failed going as near as possible to their neighbors limits one man goes off in a small flatbottomed boat square at one end and taking as large a circuit as his net admits brings it on shore at the extremity of his boundary where others assist in landing it the best fishery is on the south side very fine salmon trout are often taken here which come up from the sea to spawn and return in the same manner as the salmon do for a fuller account of this fishery vide british zoology iii     to it may also be added that in the middle of the river not a mile west of the town is a large stone on which a man is placed to observe what is called the reck of the salmon coming up  historians have differed greatly in the etymology of the name of berwick camden seems to determine in favor of the saxon  the town of the bernicians  after having mentioned the evidences of antiquity it is requisite before i quit the subject i should speak of berwick in its natural state being built on an angular point of land at the mouth of tweed on two sides it is bounded by water the sea in this part of the channel is tempestuous and rough the tide setting in very strong occasions a heavy surge which increased by frequent storms renders the coast tremendous the prospect of the ocean conveys to the contemplative mind a grand association of images which describe the might and majesty of the creator as i walked the banks imagination roved at large but took a melancholy strain i conceived i heard the alarm guns fired at bambrough castle and the signal of distress waved in my fancys eye from some vessel at a distance the ocean which before had affected my soul with a scene of magnificent delight now seemed full of horror and dismay the rolling billows became tremendous the yawning gulf an object of gloomy terror the whole conveyed the apprehension of imminent peril and distress and in the end all the agonies of a distracted crew who labored for life filled my imagination and the wanderings of fancy were replete with dismay and misery  the inhabitants of berwick have enough of such horrid scenes the coast is terrible to mariners after having once been witness to so melancholy an event one would scarce ever look upon the sea again with pleasure  the land prospect does not produce a scene wild enough to be called romantic or sufficiently cultivated to be smooth placid and agreeable the banks of tweed loss much of their sweetness in the environs of the town and flora reserves most of her beauties for the neighborhood of kelso and coldstream below berwick bridge there is not enough either of trade or tranquillity it possesses the middle station neither busy enough nor enough at rest is dullness above bridge in the fishing season the scene is beautifully enlivened below some few vessels are moored but too often the heavy hulks are turned up on the dry sands with masts unrigged waiting for trade and tide such are dull objects to the eye and have no other effect upon the spectator than to promote weariness and impatiency  over the arm of the sea which breaks upon the bar of tweed the lands to the southward are extended for several miles upon the view varied with the happy colorings which succeed to cultivation but the distance is so great that objects are indistinct and the beauties of the landscape lay in confusion two often indeed the whole is enveloped in sea vapor  i cannot take my departure from the banks of tweed without passing some few thoughts on the carnage and bloodshed which for ages rendered them famous to the arms of both the scotch and english and to posterity made their history a subject of horror and detestation  alberic bishop of ostia being sent as legate from pope innocent ii on his visitation at carlisle is said to have taken great pains to remonstrate to the army of king david of scotland after the retreat from the battle of alerton that they ought to wage war with greater humanity and prevailed with them so far as to gain the release of the female captives whom they were carrying as slaves into scotland he also obtained their solemn engagement that in future inroads they would not violate the churches and religious houses and would also spare from the sword women infants and the aged these show to us what were the infamous enormities committed in these expeditions  the war carried on between the two nations was as brutal as any in the annals of the caribbees or any savages under the sun the public injuries of states the policy of empires the balance of trade the peace of europe or the equilibrium of power were not the objects of warfare like the wild arabs the estate of the people was that of robbers rapine and plunder their objects as if devoid of all religious sense of oaths and moral obligations the compacts of states and the ties of honor and moral honesty they often forsook every principle for plunder and like barbarians levied war for the sake of pillaging of reprisal and retribution when the wolves descend the alps upon the villages it is the effect of hunger in its extreme but here the blood of the peasant was shed without any cogency of cause but the lucre of his herds flocks and possessions the immortal king john burnt laid waste and destroyed half the island from york northward alexander in all his glory never exhibited a more noble conflagration edward contaminated his honors with many of those achievements torrents of blood have issued from these borders they were the common charnel of the two nations thirtythree thousand souls fled in one day to the gates of eternity dispatched by the command of princes who could not account to heaven what it was they fought for the petit massacres were equally as inconsiderate the heroes of those bands walked forth with their adherents imbruing their hands in human gore burning and destroying laying waste towers towns and villages and spreading desolation in the most savage manner for the reward of savages reciprocal slaughters devastations and cruelties marked both people when the most valiant achievements were performed even in the presence of their princes revenge appeared to be the only instigation and common justice was seldom considered what was the battle of allerton in the reign of stephen when david with a mighty slaughter was overthrown after having ravaged northumberland and durham returning like a disappointed miscreant with his hands red in the blood of thousands of his band of robbers william king of scotland was a prisoner on one of his incursions he witnessed a cruel slaughter of his people our edward i slew  0000 at falkirk edward iii slew his tens of thousands at hallydown hill and penrith and durham witnessed to the succeeding destruction made of the scots in this reign under their unfortunate david who in the battle at the lastmentioned place was made prisoner the battles of otterburn and flodden field were upon the same principles as the others  how does this retrospection fully the hero stain the luster of his arms and the honor of his valor yet it is too true such were the conflicts on the borders and such the arms that waged the inglorious warfare on this once wretched but now most happy country at this time abounding with wealth flowing from peace by the channels of cultivation manufactory and trade where the brethren of one climate and one island under the blessed protection of one common father and a constitution admired and envied by all the world are acting together in a state of mutual offices to contribute to the general opulence and felicity  how baneful and obnoxious is he to the common interests of this now united family who attempts to sow the seeds of dissatisfaction and jealousy and through calumnies arising in the venom of malevolence and disappointed ambition endeavors to cultivate contempt and aversion between the brethren of this land the strength of this and every nation is the union of its inhabitants  he who blows up the embers of extinguished feuds is particularly an enemy to both parties and a foe to the state at large  the accession of king james the vi to the crown of england operated powerfully toward the felicity of this part of the island cultivation immediately took place the country so often desolated by war received new inhabitants who brought with them not only flocks and herds but also manufactories and commerce the works effected in peace were soon distinguished the barren wastes were put under the plough share towns and hamlets diversified the scene and increasing population enlivened every valley which for ages had been marked by works of hostility yet it was not till the union of the two kingdoms that these effects of peace were brought to the happy eminence now discovered on every hand as to political advantages it is evident their discussion comes not within my plan in this work i am persuaded of their vast importance to both nations mrs macauley says on very sound principles of policy the union had been several times rejected by both nations and which was with great difficulty coerced on the scots though as burnet observes the advantages which were offered to scotland in the whole frame of it were great and visible the scots were to bear less than the fortieth part of the public taxes and they were to have the eleventh part of the legislature trade was to be free all over the island and to the plantations private rights were to be preserved and the judicature and laws of scotland were still to be continued lord marchmont having been pointed at by historians as being one of those corrupt partisans who effected the union from sinister views the following authentic letter in the authors custody among many state papers found in the cabinet of the late lord wharton will be thought worthy a place here to which some historical notes etc are added  from the earl of marchmont to lord wharton nov      0  edinburgh my lord i had the honor of your lordships letter of the   st july last by the lord ross who did me the kindness to call at my house on his way to edinburgh and gave me the satisfactory account of your lordships hearty inclinations to the union and of your prudent diligence to advance it in the treaty such as i would have expected from your understanding and parts  i have been long wishing an opportunity to assist in that design being convinced that an union of the kingdoms is the only solid way to secure the religion and liberty the duke of hamiltons speech was spirited what shall we in one day give up what our forefathers maintained with their lives and fortunes for many ages are here none of the descendants of those worthy patriots who defended the liberty of their country against all invaders who assisted the great king robert bruce to restore the constitution and revenge the falsehood of england and usurpation of paol where are the douglasses and campbels where are the peers where are the barons once the bulwark of the nation shall we yield up the sovereignty and independency of our country when we are commanded by those we represent to preserve the same and assured of their assistance to support us to increase the power and significancy of this island and to establish the peace of it  i would have written to your lordship sooner but delayed till i might observe the motions of our parliament i had discovered some time ago that in all corners of the country endeavors were used to possess the people with fears about it and great prejudices against it as if it would bring slavery upon them destroy the little trade they have and make them miserable beyond a possibility of remedy the processors were the duke of athol earl marshal marquis of annandale lord belhaven earl of buchan lockhart of carnwarth sir walter stuart the earl of errol and some of inferior rank  those who promoted the union were headed by the dukes of queensberry and argyle the earls of montrose seafield and stair  smollet says they found means partly by their promises and partly by corruption to bring over the earls of roburgh and marchment with the whole squadron who had hitherto been unpropitious to the court  from this letter the reader must entertain a more favorable idea of its author   but especially that it would overturn the church government established here which the people are so addicted to that they can suffer as much for it as i think they would for christianity itself  some had influenced the most part of our preachers to whom the people have great regard that it is scarcely possible to persuade them to a true notion of the union or to any good thoughts of it though there has been much pains taken by others to do it  when the parliament met it was easy to find out who had been the somenters of the fears and doubts causing the aversion and it is evident enough the opposers in parliament have been the authors of very bad impressions upon the clergy and lower people mr flemings voyage to scotland printed with hooks negotiation says the same evening i arrived at lord nains in the county of perth who expressed great zeal for the service of the k  and as i had a letter of the earl of errol for him that he might inform me of the most proper measures to see his brother the marquis of athol he undertook to conduct me to him we found that lord in such a temper as we could wish for five months before he had all his vassals ready to take arms upon the first news o the k  s arrival  in this collection we have the two following letters  from the earl of errol lord high constable of scotland stains   th may   0  may it please your m  the satisfaction which i feel on receiving your m  s orders answers to my zeal and hopes of being one day  in your service i have left nothing undone to restore your m  y to the throne of your ancestors and though our design of doing it by the parliament has not had the success your faithful subjects wished for yet the arrival of colonel hook and his diligence in the execution of his orders have been so useful that i hope in consequence thereof to have the happiness of seeing your m  y in this country an happiness after which we have so long sighed to be delivered from oppression most of your m  s friends having left edinburgh before the arrival of colonel hook all that we could do was to act in concert in signing the memorial and as the memorial is not so ample as some of us could have wished we have desired the colonel to supply what is wanting therein by representing several things concerning which we have instructed him he will also inform your m  how much this nation is generally well affected to your service and with how much pleasure we shall venture our lives and fortunes for so just a cause no one will concur more heartily than i who constantly pray for your m  s prosperity i am  may it please your m  y your m  s most faithful subject and most obedient most humble servant signed errol   extract of the letter from the countess of errol to the queen of england may   th   0  all the delays which we have suffered have not diminished our zeal though they have prolonged our miseries and misfortunes  colonel hook has been so well received among us that he is able to give an exact account of his negotiations which will not displease your m   i confess that after having waited for him for a long while our servour began to diminish in proportion to our hopes but his prudence and good conduct joined to his indefatigable diligence has revived our ardor and he has put our affairs into so good order that we hope they will come to an happy issue the present opportunity is looked upon by all as the best that has ever offered and the last that will offer for a long time  all ranks of people earnestly demand their k  and the scots will certainly return universally and unanimously to their duty toward their lawful s   though the relations of mr murray are very considerable and able to do much for your m  s service yet he has not thought proper to promote it in the country on account of the situation he is in with respect to the government beside colonel hookes activity has been such that he has not stood in need of assistance however mr murray has always been ready to do every thing in his power and has followed exactly the advice of the colonel etc etc    yet i am of opinion that the fancies they have taken up will soon vanish and will not be the hinderance of concluding a treaty  upon the  th current the house came to a question approve the first article of the treaty or not  with this provision that if other articles be not adjusted by the parliament the agreeing to the first should be of no effect  the voters present were     of which     were approvers    were opposers of these    entered their dissent and protested     would not join in the dissent because they differed from the approvers only in that they were not for putting a question upon the first article till votes should pass on the  th  th and some other following articles and i think the most part of if not all the    are for an entire union if the terms please them  several very understanding and well affected members find difficulties in some of the articles whereof they apprehend some to be insuperable unless they meet with a remedy from the wisdom of england  many of the more judicious members are little moved by the cross humor raised among the people by the pains of illdesigning men while it is founded only upon speculation for they think that will vanish but if the mulitude of the lower people shall at the beginning feel a sensible prejudice by the execution of any article then the danger may prove greater among a hot stubborn vulgar than can well be foreseen  i cannot yet condescend upon particulars which i will do when i am able to explain them more distinctly this i can say in the general that i am only apprehensive of such things as may universally affect the common people before they can have much relish of the advantages which certainly will in course be the product and fruit of an union  in the beginning of this session those who in the last were called the new party made up of the peers and gentlemen who were laid aside from public employment and the council in the year   0  and others their friends upon whom they have influence who have still stuck together above    in number were suspected that they would go cross to the ministers but god be thanked they have not done so for which they merit esteem and thanks from all who wish well to her majesty and her kingdoms they have carried themselves and concurred as persons of honor and understanding for promoting the common good without any appearance of resentment toward those now employed whereas if they had joined with the opposers of the union the promoters of it here were not able to carry it through  as for the protesters i am confident the far greater part if not all of them are designing to make way for the st germains youth and to divide these kingdoms voltaire speaking of the tories attempting to replace the stuart family on the throne of england is thus noted by his translator smollet we can affirm on the very best authority that the tories never harbored any such design there might indeed be some jacobites among them who secretly entertained notions of that kind but these they carefully concealed from the party with which they associated some too were driven into jacobitism by hard usage but the tories in general had no intention to alter that succession which they themselves had established they well discern that an union extinguishes all hopes of that sort and therefore they will certainly embrace any means that can prevent an union but as the friends to it cannot miss to outvote the other if insuperable difficulties of the kind i have mentioned be not found in some of the articles or if found be removed or redressed by the prudent assistance of your lordship and such as you in your parliament i doubt not the treaty will be brought to a happy conclusion which i heartily wish and wherein i shall labor to be as much assistant here as can be in the power of  my lord your lordships most obedient and most humble servant signed marchmont turn over  if your lordship neds to write to me the gentleman who delivers this has a way to have it brought with certainty to me  my shaking hand serves me not to write therefore i make use in this of my son sir andrews        november my lord the difficulties and warm debates which happened in the house led me to delay the sending my letter till i could give you this further account  the  d  d and  th articles of the treaty are approved with the like provision as the first is but the carrying of these votes was with a great deal of wrangle and contest even as much upon the  th wherein we expected little resistance as upon any of the former whereby it is easy to discern the design of the opposers yet our greater difficulty is to keep many by whom we must carry our votes from being misled by the designing opposers with the subtle pretenses they make so plausible as are of danger to prevail upon the less understanding sort of wellmeaning persons  the  th article is this day approved with this alteration the diet is changed from the time of signing the treaty for the union to the time of ratifying the treaty  i know not how your parliament may like this but i am hopeful that an affair of so manifold advantages to this island as an entire union may prove will not stop upon differences of lesser moment  what i foresee of this sort brings to my remembrance a very old treaty betwixt reheboam and the tribes of israel and of the wise advice which the old counselors gave him this similitude halts as commonly all do yet i believe your lordship will find something in it that may be of use  i shall add no more now but that i am  your lordships humble servant signed m e      whether the security pretended to be obtained by england by this union was worth purchasing at so high a price whether the union has answered the expectations of those who prophefied that it would be the means of extending the bounds of the british empire and of enlarging the happiness of its citizens by cementing in the closest bands of friendship two nations who had ever regarded each other with the eyes of jealousy and aversion will be differently determined by men who from their different connections in both or either countries have contracted different prejudices but whether as the series of these times predicted it will be attended with consequences no less fatal than the destruction of the laws and constitution of england the space of a very few years will in all probability determine beyond a doubt  we passed by the sands to  holy island the morning was calm the sea smooth and the land prospect gilded with the sun very beautiful though not much variegated  the description given of this island symeon p    is to the following purport that in circumference it comprehends eight miles in which was a noble monastery famous for its prelates among whom was st cuthbert whose bodies were there deposited and whose memory would live for ever it has the name of lindisfarn from a small rivulet called lindis which from the opposite continent empties itself into the sea in mr groses works we find these particulars relative to this island  bid calls it a semi island being as he justly observes twice an island and twice continent in one day for at the flowing of the tide it is encompassed by water and at the ebb there is an almost dry passage both for horses and carriages to and from the main land from which if measured in a straight line it is distant about two miles eastward but on account of some quick sands passengers are obliged to make so many detours that the length of the way is nearly doubled the water over these flats at spring tides is only seven feet  this island was by the britons called inis medicante also lindisfarn from the small rivulet of lindi which here runs into the sea and the celtic word fahren or recess also on account of its being the habitation of some of the first monks in this country it afterward obtained its present name of holy island it measures from east to west about two miles and a quarter and its breadth from north to south is scarcely a mile and a half at the northwest part there runs out a spit of land of about a mile in length the monastery is situated at the southermost extremity and a small distance north of it stands the little town inhabited chiefly by fishermen this island though really part of northumberland belongs to durham and all civil disputes must be determined by the justices of that county   by bid it is described qui locus accedente ac recedente reumate bis quotidiae instar insulae maris circumluitur undis bis renudato littore contiguus terrae redditur lindis dicitur flumen quod in mare excurrit duorum pedum latitudinem habens quando ledon fuerit id est minor aestus and videri potest quando vero malina fuerit id est major aestus maris tum nequit lindis videri farne autem insula est

cultivated land upon the island with some few acres of good pasture ground capable of improvement and the rest by the violence of tempests is covered with sand the island chiefly consists of one continued plain inclining to the southwest the land on which the village stands rises swiftly from the shore at the southern point is a rock of a conical figure and almost perpendicular near  0 feet in height having on its lofty crown a small fortress or castle which makes at once a grotesque and formidable appearance i did not observe one tree upon the island  holy island depiction of holy island  the village consists of a few scattered houses two of which are inns the rest chiefly inhabited by fishermen the shore is excellent for bathing and the situation at once healthy and romantic it is surprising it should be so little resorted to the north and east coasts of the island are formed of perpendicular rocks the other sides sink by gradual declinations toward the sands the rock on which the castle stands is accessible only by a winding pass cut on its southern side the narrow limits of its crown will not admit of many works the whole strength consisting of a single battery on the southeast point mounted with seven or eight guns which commands the approach to the island from the sea but would be of little consequence against a ship of any considerable force the rest of the summit is taken up with a house for the governor and guard the walls of which stand on the very brink of the precipice this fortress before the use of gunpowder from its situation appears to have been impregnable the superstructures being above the reach of any engine and the rocks too high to be scaled the antiquity of this castle is not known but i should presume it is coeval with the abbey and was used as a place of resort in times of peril and a stronghold for the religious whenever they were disturbed in their holy retreat the present fortifications appear to be the work of the last century in the military establishment made by queen elizabeth for berwick in      the castle is noted and a patent for life was granted to sir william read as keeper of the fortresses of holy island and farn with a yearly payment of    l   s  d per annum  the ingenious mr gross gives the following anecdotes relative to this castle  camden mentions it so that it is evidently as old as his time probably it has been the scene of very few remarkable events history being nearly as silent with respect to them as concerning its origin the first time it occurs is in the history of the civil war in the time of charles i when it appears to have been seized for the parliament and according to rushworth in an order of the house of commons may  th      for sending forces thither this reason is assigned it being of such consequence to the northern parts of the kingdom probably this consequence arose more for the convenience of its harbor than the strength of the castle  in the year      one captain batton was governor of the island for the parliament to whom sir marmaduke langdale after the taking of berwick wrote the following letter but without success the letter together with the captains refusal were transmitted to the house of commons for which they voted their thanks to captain batton and that he should be continued governor of the place  sir you have the good opinion of the counties to be a sober discreet man amongst them which emboldeneth me a stranger to you to propose that which every man in his duty to god and the king ought to perform the veil of these horrid designs plotted by some that men may run and read the misery and thraldom they intend upon the whole nation it is believed by many that know you that you are sensible of the imprisonment of his majesty and the violation of all our laws if you please to consider the ends being changed perhaps for which you first engaged and comply with the kings interest by keeping the fort now in possession for the kings use i will engage myself to see all the arrears due to yourself and the soldiers duly paid and to procure his majestys favor for the future and that i only may receive some satisfaction from you that this motion is as really accepted as intended by  your humble servant marmaduke langdale berwick april  0th       holy island does not appear ever to have fallen into the hands of the royalists for it continued in the possession of the parliamentarians anno      when it was as may be seen in rushworth relieved with necessaries by colonel fenwicks horse and some dragoons from that time nothing memorable seems to have been transacted here till the rebellion in the year      when the seizure of this castle was planned and performed by two men only in which exploit such policy and courage were exerted as would have done them much honor had they been employed in a better cause the following particulars of the story were communicated by a gentleman whose father was an eyewitness to the facts and well knew both the parties  one lancelot errington a man of an ancient and respectable family in northumberland and of a bold and enterprizing spirit entered into a conspiracy for seizing this castle for the pretender in which it is said he was promised assistance not only by mr forster the rebel general then in arms but also by the masters of several french privateers at this time the garrison consisted of a sergeant a corporal and  0 or    men only in order to put this scheme in execution being well known in that country he went to the castle and after some discourse with the sergeant invited him and the rest of the men who were not immediately on duty to partake of a treat on board of the ship of which he was master then lying in the harbor this being unsuspectingly accepted of he so well plied his guests with brandy that they were soon incapable of any opposition these men being thus secured he made some pretense for going on shore and with mark errington his nephew returning again to the castle they knocked down the sentinel surprised and turned out an old gunner the corporal and two other soldiers being the remainder of the garrison and shutting the gates hoisted the pretenders colors as a signal of their success anxiously expecting the promised succors no reinforcement coming but on the contrary a party of the kings troops arriving from berwick they were obliged to retreat over the walls of the castle among the rocks hoping to conceal themselves under the sea weeds till it was dark and then by swimming to the main land to make their escape but the tide rising they were obliged to swim when the soldiers firing at lancelot as he was climbing up a rock wounded him in the thigh thus disabled he and his nephew were taken and conveyed to berwick gaol where they continued till his wound was cured during this time he had dug a burrow quite under the foundations of the prison depositing the earth taken out in an old oven through this burrow he and his nephew with diverse other prisoners escaped but most of the latter were soon after taken the two erringtons however had the good fortune to make their way to the tweedside where they found the customhouse boat they rowed themselves over and afterward turned it adrift from thence they pursued their journey to bambrough castle near which they were concealed nine days in a peastack a relation who resided in the castle supplying them with provision at length traveling in the night by secret paths they reached gateshead house near newcastle where they were secreted till they procured a passage from sunderland to france a reward of  00l was now offered to any one who would apprehend them notwithstanding which lancelot was so daring as soon after to come into england and even to visit some of his friends in newgate after the suppression of the rebellion when every thing was quiet he and his nephew took the benefit of the general pardon and returned to newcastle where he died about the year      as it is said of grief at the victory of culloden  the remains of the old abbey in the next place require my attention such parts of this cathedral are standing as give a perfect idea of its original form and appearance the monastery is in ragged ruins and not worthy to be delineated the walls having been robbed for the buildings in the village and the erection of the present parochial church  it is said by some authors that the monastery was built by st cuthbert of a plain model without ornament and enclosed with a high wall in order that outward objects might not withdraw the attention of the society from their divine contemplations  in mr wests antiquities of furness abbey we have this short account of the rise and origin of monastic orders soon after the christian religion had made some considerable progress in the east the policy of the roman empire exposed the professors of it to many and great inconveniences and a succession of bloody persecutions the two last under decius and dioclesian more especially obliged many to betake themselves to mountains deserts and solitary places to secure themselves from the unrelenting fury of these bloody tyrants there they found a safe retreat with time and liberty to give themselves up to the exercises of piety and divine contemplation in a course of most rigorous mortifications and preternatural austerities this kind of life which necessity gave rise to was afterward in the time of the christian emperors embraced through choice and pacomius about the middle of the  th century committed to writing rules for regular societies and founded some monasteries in the environs of thebes in egypt  the introduction of monks into england is spoken of as a masterpiece of policy in the court of rome as endeavoring thereby to secure her authority by an increase of property which would arise to her by the pious donations and offerings of the faithful and the founding of many religious houses to be occupied by such as were from the nature of their institute attached to the holy see and might occasionally serve every purpose of spiritual tyranny and it is alleged that the monks by the austerity of their religion and morals fascinated the minds of the people and by their pretension to extraordinary sanctity secured a submission to all their decisions and an implicit obedience to all their doctrines this is a heavy charge and if well grounded should have prevented the monastic rule from ever taking effect in any kingdom or occasioned its ruin as soon as the discovery was made or the charge formed  this he obviates by monasteries being established here before austins time and takes for his authorities gildas and bid as to their being schools of christian learning he adds in all this we hear nothing of foreign connections of sinister inventions or hypocrisy  the roman pontiff knew how to draw from the circumstances of williams afrairs advantages which the conqueror never intended and which his immediate successors could not prevent as they were equally or more obliged to the church for her support than he himself had been the foreign ecclesiastics which the norman king lindisfarn n aspect depiction of lindisfarn abbey introduced readily gave up the liberty of a country to which they were strangers and a happiness the sweets whereof they had never known but from that consequence of which the conqueror and his sons had made them they soon became sensible of there own importance the foreign monks from the great property conferred upon them soon found of what weight they were in the scale of government and readily turned it to their own advantages as occasion offered  the introduction therefore of so many new orders of monks into england by the norman kings was according to their own policy and not that of the court of rome  he then takes occasion to mention the good offices of the church in favor of the conquerors younger sons and the earl of moreton and king john  the court of rome could have no direct hand in all this and the monastic institute of its own nature can have no part in either a civil or a spiritual tyranny unless where perverted as the best of institutes may have been by the malice of men  i have been led to lengthen the quotation beyond the bounds i at first intended to show with what arguments this subtle author and other writers of the like class can put a plausible countenance on facts which reflected dishonor on the sea of rome but to return from this digression  the cathedral is in the form of a cross the east and west limbs of which are yet standing the other parts totally in ruins and almost level with the ground the order of building in this structure is rude and heavy and most of it in the worst mode of the early saxon architecture mr gross says probably it was the work of different periods great part of it seems very ancient the arches being circular and the columns very massy and much like those at durham but richer on the north and south walls there are pointed arches which proves that part of it at least was built since the reign of henry ii the pillars on which the arches rise in the center of the cross are clustered and plain capitalled each forming the corner of the great tower these arches are of few members there are two side ailes the columns of which are heavy and the arches

ambassadors unto donald iv then reigning in scotland and entreated him by the old familiarity that had been among them to help him with some worthy and learned men that could instruct his people in the faith of christ the king recommending the matter to the clergy one cormanus was elected to go thither but his labors proving unprofitable he returned about the end of the year and in a synod of the bishops and clergy informed them that they were a people so indocile and froward that the pains taken upon them were lost they neither being desirous nor capable of instruction  it grieved the synod exceedingly to hear this and while they were consulting what to do aidanus a learned man and reverend preacher is said to have advised them not to give over the work at any hands for that the bad success of cormanuss labors might possibly proceed from himself that had not used the people tenderly nor according to the apostles rules fed them at first with milk and therefore desired some other approved man might be employed of new who would probably do good among them  this opinion allowed by all none was thought fitter for this service than he who had given the advice and so with common consent was aidan ordained bishop and appointed to that charge being come thither he set himself to amend the fault which he supposed corman had committed and so tempered his doctrine as multitudes of people daily did resort unto him to be instructed it was great hinderance unto him at first that he was not skilled in the saxon tongue neither did the people understand his language but this defect the king himself supplied interpreting to the auditory all that aidanus delivered in his sermon so by the kings zeal and aidanuss diligence such numbers were brought to the christian profession as in the space of seven days   000 persons were by him baptized  whether this people were more happy in their king or in this bishop it is difficult to say for the king he did so excel in piety and prudence that as beda writes all the nations and provinces within britain were at his devotion and not the less his heart was never lifted up within him but still he showed himself courteous and affable and of the poor most compassionate among examples of his liberality toward these the same beda related that sitting at table on easter day and aidanus by him when it was told that a number of poor men were at the gate expecting his alms he commanded to carry the meat that was set before him unto them and the platter of silver wherein it was to be broke in pieces and distributed among them aidanus beholding it took the king by the right hand and kissing it said nunquam marcesca haec manus never let this hand consume or wither which as he writes came also to pass for being killed in battle and his arm and his hand cut off the same was enclosed in a silver shrine and remained for many years uncorrupted in the church of st peter at bambrough  as to aidanus he was an ensample of abstinence sobriety chastity charity and all other episcopal virtues for as he taught so he lived was idle at no time nor did he admit any of his retinue to be so but kept them in a continual exercise

retained than till a fit opportunity offered to distribute it to the poor places of entertainment for potentates and princes were unnecessary for they were visited only for their doctrines and the holy offices of the church the king himself when he came thither from his royal residence had no other object in view than to partake of the rites of religion and departed immediately after the service if perchance he took refreshment it was of the common fare of the monks the attention of these pastors was on spiritual matters only temporal affairs were deemed derogatory of their holy appointment and thence arose the high veneration which was paid by all ranks of people to the religious habit when any ecclesiastic went from his monastery it was to preach the word of salvation and he was every where received with joy as a messenger of the divinity on the road the passengers bowed the head to receive the sign of the cross and his benediction with pious reverence noting his precepts as documents of the most salutary purport the churches were crowded with a devout audience and when a monk was seen entering a village on his travels the inhabitants flocked about him entreating for his admonitions and prayers on their visitations riches and donations were not their pursuit when a religious society received any augmentation of the revenues of the house it was

of hexham and its prelates he was a northumbrian by birth and received his education at lindisfarn being recommended by queen eanfleda to a nobleman called cudda who retired to this monastery he attended him thither as his companion and continued there from the   th to the   th year of his age during this prelates episcopacy there happened great revolutions and changes in the sea of lindisfarn the death of king oswy was only a part of the calamities which fell upon northumberland in his time egfrid not only obtained the throne of the deceased sovereign but by his powerful interest and efforts deposed alfred assuming the second scepter and uniting the whole in one sovereignty wilfred was a proud aspiring man and debased the pall of the prelate with ambition he became obnoxious to theodore who determined to humble him and in a short time got his deposition effected theodore had great interest with egfrid which he used on this occasion to gratify his malice and resentment and under that ordinary craft of ecclesiastics a specious pretense for the advancement of religion and the honor of the church he obtained the royal mandate to divide the kingdom of northumberland into two dioceses on a presumption that one bishop had too much power and authority this ancient diocese then underwent a severance and the two parts were distinguished by the names of york and lindisfarn that of york comprehending the district of deira and lindisfarn that of bernicia the adopted supremacy of rome gave opportunity for appeal and wilfred burning with resentment and disappointed ambition fled thither where a chapter being readily obtained he returned with the popes resolution in form for his restoration big with the supreme mandate he obtruded himself abruptly on the royal presence but to his great mortification found the king exasperated at his insolence and impudent appeal not being the vassal of the sea of rome he professed his contempt of its commands reproached wilfred for having procured his credentials by bribery and as a presumptuous offender against the royal dignity he cast him into prison his lamentable situation excited the intercession of the devout ebba st ebba daughter of edilfrid king of northumberland was prioress of coldingham in scotland she with others cut off their noses that their beauty might be no bait to the lustful danes aunt to the king who obtained his liberty with an injunction that he never afterward should enter the kingdom of northumberland after his release wilfred became a member of the monastery of glastonbury under the then abbot berthwald of the royal house of mercians but egfrids wrath and resentment was not subsided he continued his persecution of him even in his retreat and obtained his expulsion from that house he then fled to the court of adelwack king of sussex whose subjects were just receiving the light of conversion and that king gave him a bishopric called selsey upon egfrids demise the crown of northumberland devolved upon alfred and theodore declining in health and strength as he approached the grave in the steps of old age grew anxious to acquit or relieve his conscience of the severities he had exercised against wilfred sought to gain his friendship and by his interest with the crown and earnest solicitations obtained his restoration to the sea of york wilfred had no sooner reassumed his ecclesiastical dignity than his ungovernable ambition and arrogance blazed out anew the sea of york at his first assumption of the episcopal dignity held in unity the kingdom of northumberland at his restoration it was dismembered by a triple severance by the disunition of lindisfarn and the new constitution of hexham wilfred made injudicious pretensions and claims to effect a reunion which so exasperated the king and was a thing so inconsistent with the politics of the times that he was again expelled and obliged to fly the realm he now sought refuge in the court of mercia where he won upon the ear of etheldred and gained from him the bishopric of leicester adversity is said to be the school of wisdom but it proved not so with wilfred for in this new institution he conducted himself with that insolence and impropriety that he soon incurred the displeasure of the mercian king and the archbishop of canterbury who brought him to trial before a synod and deposed him he was now  0 years of age and yet his powers were so little debilitated and his passions remained so warm that he again journeyed to rome and in spite of the character of a turbulent and contentious prelate which he carried with him obtained a decree for his restoration he returned a second time with the powers of rome in his favor and at a more favorable season to obtain the rewards of his labor the archbishop found it convenient at that time to adhere to the mandate of supremacy the mercian king had fallen into a state of enthusiasm and assumed the habit of a monk the king of northumberland was under the attacks of a dangerous disease and feeling compunctions for the sufferings wilfred had undergone became reconciled to him appearances were now much in the prelates favor and the propitious hour seemed to await him but fate snatched off alfred before a restoration was effected he obtained a council to be held upon the banks of the river nidd under the mandate of

threw on it the more fiercely it seemed to burn and all efforts to put it out seemed ineffectual the saint missing so many of his auditors enquired the cause when leaving off his preaching and

reported upon the creditt of a legend but these are enough to show what advantage the monks took of the blind devotion of that age whose study and whole practice was to devise and relate miracles of their saints which as superstition is always credulous were as easily believed thus to gain from the pagans a reverend opinion of christianity they thought it but a pious fraud to cosen the people with volumes of wonders who whiles they defended truth by forgeries their impostures discovered to wiser ages have rather made religion suspected then any way advanced it but if i should proceed in this discourse i should leave st cuthbert too solitary in his cell at farne where for want of other auditors i find him in the history preaching to birds that eat his corn who so confuted them out of the text with aliena non concupisces that they never after touched his harvest in like manner he reclaymed two crows from their wonted stealing and rapine that pulled thatch of his anchorage for to build their nests and made them so penitent that they lay prostrate at his feet for absolution  in this isle he voluntarilye suffered nine years imprisonment from the society of men so wholly devoted to heaven that he remembered not he was upon earth and for a whole year forgott to put off his shoes but he could not live so obscurely in his cell as his same was resplendent abroad and in a synod at alne upon twysord he was in his absence chosen bishop this dignity was prophesied to him long before whiles he was a child by an infant of three years old who gravely reproved him fie saint cuthbert what a presbyter and a bishop and playing among boys as if at that time he had seen him in his myter and crosier staff but st cuthbert had so wedded his affection to a solitary life that neither letters nor ambassadors from the synod could persuade or command him to take upon him the government of the church till king egfrid himself attended with both the lords temporal and spiritual sailed to his hermytage and with the same company might have besieged and taken a city whiles they were conquering his resolution  the king to enlarge his diocese gave him a great part of the city of york and the village of creca with three miles compass about it as also the city of carliel with the circuit of fifteen miles about it but for all this st cuthberts mind was still on his anchorage whither shortly he betook himself again and in contempt of honor edded his life in his cell but it shall be no part of his funeral praises thus to unman himself to contemplate himself into a god or silvanus for what was this else then to excommunicate himself from the commonweal and to finne against the definition of a man to whom society is as natural as to be a creature and surely religion cannot be the motive of such an unnatural act but rather in all such anchorites a melancholy distemper is usually mistaken for devotion  his last will and testament was to his monks to bury him at the east side of his oratory in a coffin that venerable cudda the abbat gave him which they should find hid in the ground at the north side of his cell and to putt his corpse in the shirt that verca abbatesse of tinmouth had sent him for a token which for the reverence of that holy woman he had never worn in his life time and lastly if the pagans should invade them and force them to fly that they should carry with them his bones all these desires were performed only at the weeping request of the monks he permitted that his body should be transported to lindisfarne where in st peters church at the right side of the high altar he was solemnly enshrined anno domini      but to return to saint cuthbert who had now an eleven years lain in his sepulcher when the monks thought to place his bones by this time dry and disrobed of flesh among their other relics for kisses and adoration but behold a wonder they look for a skeleton but found an entire body with joints flexible and flesh so succulent that there only wanted heat to make his body live without a soul nay his very funeral weeds were so fresh as if putrefaction had not dared to pluck him by the coat this was rather to pay his debt to heaven then to nature who after he had restored his soul to god should keep back the payment of his body from corruption in other men it is true that sleep is the image of death but here the grave suffered a cheat and death was the image of sleep  this miracle st beda reports who was an eleven years old at st cuthberts death in relating whereof he made no lie but perhaps told one the history of whose life and death he writ from the information of the monks of lindisfarne who had defloured all the miracles of saints in holy writ and bestowed them upon their st cuthbert who like man in paradise had the beasts to do him homage and the sea monsters to ask him blessing like abraham he entertained three angels at the monastery of rippon a raven brought elias flesh and an eagle brought st cuthbert fish as he sailed with his mother from ireland his native soil into scotland he let the book of psalms fall into the sea which forthwith was swallowed up of a sea calfe and by the same fish delivered to them at their landing take here the psalter for a man and the sea calfe for a whale and you have the history of jonas with many such histories of wonder with which the monks delighted the superstition of the times  after this illustrious miracle of st cuthberts incorruption lindisfarne raised itself to that height of renown that ceolwolphus the king to whom bid dedicates his english history resigned an earthly crown to gain a celestial one and took upon him the habitt of a monk in lindisfarne a welcome man you may be sure to that monastery for whose sake it was granted the monks there to drink wine or ale who before were only to drink milk or water though they that drank after saint cuthbert in his cupp found sometimes water turned into wine without a miracle  many kingly treasures did this devout prince bestow upon that monastery with such large possessions as he seemed rather to resign his kingdom to the church than to his successor and became a monk to make st cuthbert a king for he endowed that monastery with all the land between the rivers of tees and weer and many towns and lordships as warkworth castle billingham gedworth where ceolwolphus built the church and diverse other villages as woodcestre hutingham bresgen edulingham names that for ought i know have outlived their towns or towns that have changed their names  after the manifestation of this miracle of bodily immortality after death eadfrid then bishop caused him to be laid in a new sepulcher and to be advanced for state and reverence above the pavement in the sanctuary for it was not fit that he should have his grave among the dead whose body lived by sanctity when his soul was gone  now they began to worship the very ground st cuthbert had troad upon whose sanctity was such that he made every place he came in a church and eadfrid in honor of st cuthberts presence there built up his hermitage where as if a genius of sanctity had frequented that place ethelwald a monk of rippon lived an hermit twelve years  thus for a long time flourished the monks of that church in great repute and prosperity till the danes disturbed their peace who now began to make incursions upon the frontiers of this land for many years continueing their piracies till they had made a final conquest which at length yielded to the norman sword those were the times when so many monasteries which the devotion of former ages had erected had their funerals then perished that famous emporium of hartlepoole where the religious hieu built a nunnery of which i may speak as hildebert of rome quam magna fueras integra fracta doces whose ruins show how great she was in her glory but now remayns to passengers both a monument of devotion and hostility then were demolished the two monasteries of st peter and st paul at weremouth and jarrow built by the reverend abbats celfrid and benedict  the fury of the danes still increasing continued by the sea costs to tinmouth so that it was now time for the monks of lindisfarne to look about them for they well understood by the lamentable usage of their neighboring abbyes that the danes would not like the devil be affrighted with holy water and saw by the bad success of other monasteries that it was not safe trusting to the protection of a saint and so concluding upon flight putting all their relics into st cuthberts coffin they left the pagans the spoil of an empty church anno domini      it was eardulphus his fortune to be bishop in these troublesome times who with his whole clergy and families of people followed this sacred bier which besides seven monks as deputed esquires of his body none durst presume to touch these miseries had been enough to have unfainted st cuthbert when pursued both by foreign foes and overtaken with an homebred enemy famyne he could afford them no releife they were now come to the first sea and might complain as the old brittanes did to actius the consul repellunt nos barbari ad mare repellit mare ad barbaros inter haec duo oriuntur genero functum aut jugulamur aut mergimur but because the disrespective sea would not divide itself at the approach of st cuthbert the bishop with some few of his monks determined privily to sail over into ireland with his corpse that there he might find rest for his toumbe where he first had his birth but they had not far sailed from the shore but the winds and the sea were both up in arms against their ship which both aeolus and neptune might have reverenced for her sacred carryage of a bishop and his clergy but the sea roared so loud that noe prayers for st cuthbert could be heard but threatened them so near with shipwreck as they had not that confidence in their saint as to encourage the mariners as caesar did ne metues cuthbertum vehis who now himself wanted some other saint to invocate for help and was in danger to be drowned after he was dead where had then been the church of durham and the devotion of kings to his sepulchur where had then been the tutelarie deity against the scotts and the land of the church called st cuthberts patrimony how then should his halywarkefolk be freed from tribute and service in war and the monks of durham fed so many years with ease and fatt revenues if now their saint had been entombed in the sea and erected his episcopal seat among the fishes this sacrilegious storm struck this ship with such a palsy that it shook out the texts of the evangelists into the sea this book eadfrid bishop of lindisfarne had writ out with his own hand and belfrid the anchorite had curiously painted and gilded it in which art the monks were admirably expert not that i tax in them this quality but only it argued the monks were at great leisure thus whether the sea as envying the land such a precious jewel as st cuthbert or he himself to show his dislike for ireland had raised this storm it was not long till in a calm they were carried to the shore from whence they set forth but great sorrow you must imagine was for the drowned book till one hundredus one of the seven that carried the coffyn was bid in a night vision by st cuthbert to go seek it on the shore at whitterne where he found it in its former beauty and splendor which was kept in prior turgots time in durham in memory of the miracle when the water seemed to run out of herself to do homage to st cuthbert and would rather loose her nature then wett his book if this were true then i am sure that st cuthberts books had twice better fortune in the sea then they have now in his library at durham which was once a little vatican of choice manuscripts but now rather a  than a library rather a sepulcher fr books than a place to conserve them but this is the disease of most church libraryes since the inventing of printing by which men finding a more compendious way and a cheaper passage to superficial learning have bequeathed old manuscripts to the mothes and jackdawes the only students at this day in such libraries  but to return to the forenamed monks who had another oracle by night from st cuthbert to repair to a certain tree whereon he should find a bridle at the sight whereof a dunne horse should proffer his service for ease of the monks to draw st cuthberts body laid upon a wagon but this was not to steal an horse because it was an horse of st cuthberts providing the conduct whereof as if he understood more of st cuthberts mind than the rest they followed whither soever he drew him and at length by the providence of the horse they came to the monastery of creca where for four months they were kindly entertained by the abbat and his covent and had leisure to tell stories of their travailes  from this abbey in a revelation by night st cuthbert sent aeadred abbat of luell upon an embassage to the camp of the danes that they should crown guthredus king whom they had sold to a widow a thing in those days not practiced by the pope to dispose of kingdoms but what authority he had to nominate a king or what reason they had to believe a dream must be ranked amongst st cuthberts miracles for guthred thus to be made a king what was it else then to become st cuthberts subject and to oblige his royalty to those monks that as boldly encroacht upon so fair an advantage for first they require the restoration of their episcopal seat in cuncacestre where eardulphus first ascended the pontifical chair and it was but another dream for the foresaid abbot to go to the king from st cuthbert and bid him give all the lands betwixt weer and tyne for ever to his church this modest request must be granted or else the monks would be ready to upbrayd him with ingratitude ah poor prince to be thus robbed of his kingdom and to receive a diadem to set it upon st cuthberts head thus was the religious king cheated of his sovereignty by those monks that had now got the art of anslaving the devotion of princes to their private ends for at this time also the great alfred swore fealty to st cuthbert and his clergy by whose help they persuaded him that he had got the victory over the pagans this made them bold also to ask the privilege of a sanctuary for their church to reskue offenders    days at st cuthberts sepulcher that neither justice should curb the freedom of sinning either against heaven or the state for noe other use was commonly made of asylums than that men might offend more securely and disloyally appeal from the king and the laws to the protection of a saint neither was this enough till king alfred must by his royal charter free the inhabitants of st cuthberts land from tribute to the king which he sealed with fearful anathems to his successors that should infringe the said liberties what else was this than for a king to be a traitor to his own majesty and deprive himself of that service which even by the law of nature is due from a subject to his prince  now in what reverend esteem this saint was to king alfred i gather from the consecration of the chapel to st cuthbert in university college in oxford where he is said to be the first founder in an ancient window whereof king alfred and st cuthbert are painted together the king bespeaking the saint in a pentameter hic in honor tui collegium statui and st cuthbert thus replying in an hexameter quod statuisti in eo pervertentes maledico and by such curses the monks maintaynd their lands in a better tenure than under the kings broad seal the like malediction you may read in a distick in trinity college in oxford engraven in wooden letters over the screene terras cuthberti qui non spoliare verentur esse queant certi quod morte mala morientur which college was founded by thomas hatfield bishop of durham anno domini    0  thus after eardulphus the last bishop of lindisfarne and the first of chester had shared with st cuthbert both in his prosperity and adversity and had seen this new church sprung up like a phoenix out of the ashes of the former he ended his life in a full age and was solemnly enterred anno domini     in which year also died the victorious alfred who on his death bed bequeathed his love of st cuthbert as a precious legacy to his son edward chargeing him to be as well heir to his devotion to that saint as to his kingdoms king edward also as if it had been ex traduce to those princes to honor st cuthbert left his son athelsian executor of his love to that church  an anthem for st cuthbert exscribed out of a manuscript of a monk of durham splendour christi sacerdotis et vicinis et remotis preeminet cum gloria lux cuthberti fulget late corporis

amen  an emphatic and clear expression poignant wit and eloquence and engaging manners with such natural advantages it is not to be wondered that his doctrines were persuasive or rather irresistible for twelve years he governed the priory of lindisfarn where he lived an exemplary life for piety and selfdenial and never ceased his exhortations to religion and virtue frequently taking journies into the desert and mountainous parts of the country to instruct and convert the most barbarous of the inhabitants at length conceiving that the luxury or ease of a monastic life afforded too selfish enjoyments to allow his spirit due attendance on contemplations and the service of the deity he retired from lindisfarn and commenced the life of an anchorite in the largest of the farne islands laying opposite to bambrough and within sight of lindisfarn being distant from thence about two leagues anno incarnationis dominicae sexcentesimo septuagesimo sexto qui est annus imperii regis

stormy coast surrounded by rocks over which the sea breaks incessantly with great tumult destitute of fresh water without tree for shelter or fruitbearing shrub or where withal to sustain human life and worse than all said to be possessed by devils bid says the cell of st cuthbert was surrounded with a trench perhaps the meaning is by a fence of earth but the happy and miraculous change which took place on cuthberts taking up his solitary residence there is too singular to escape observation verum illo quoque virum dei comitante miraculorum gloria de rupe saxosa precibus fontem elicuit de tellure durissima segetem produxit host antiquo cum satellitum turba fugato locum ipsum habitabilem fecit postquam enim inhabitator sancti spiritus suam ibidem habitationem instituit in tantum

he desired to have wheat brought him and tools to till the ground and when he had prepared the land with infinite labor and sown it in due season in the summer there appeared neither blade or ear when he was again visited by his brethren he required of them barley for seed and having sowed it in the same field out of all sowing season and without hope of fruit there grew up an abundant crop etc trees and shrubs bearing fruit decked the smiling shores the troubled waters clapped their hands for joy the plains assumed a mantle of green embroidered with flowers the evil spirits were bound in eternal darkness and angels of light communed with the anchorite such are the records of the religious of those ages in this dreary solitude st cuthbert remained several years during which time he had a variety of combats with the devil the print of whose feet is it is said to be seen in many places if any persons out of devotion came to visit him he retired to his cell and discoursed with them only through his window once indeed to oblige a lady the abbess of coldingham he paid her a visit at the isle of coquet where going down to the sea shore as was his custom every night two sea monsters presented themselves kneeling before him as if to demand his benediction which having received they returned to the deep gross credis huic quod dicat  this life of severity excited the reverence and admiration of those ages of ignorance whether enthusiasm alone could determine the human mind to such undertakings or there was a degree of pride mixed in the influenza i cannnot determine the vices of those times i presume were not attended with such degrees of despair as are unknown to us the inducements must have been more complicated than the outward countenance of piety expressed how different the manners of the religious of the same church in modern times an ambitious or hypocritical religious who makes a profession of humility whilst he is puffed up with pride a man meanly clad and who only seeks after riches a pretender to devotion who gives himself out as a servant of god while he is no more than a slave to his passions is a monster both in church and state  every intriguing monk or friar who thrusts himself into families for the purpose of prying into secrets regulating marriages or wills is as despicable as he is dangerous  these are the liberal sentiments of the immortal ganganelli pope clement xiv whose works have placed the romish church in a more amiable point of view than it has appeared in several past ages  i have frequently ruminated on mans several affections and this severity of st cuthberts restores to my memory some distant ideas i have always considered friendship as comprehending the most excellent feelings of the human heart how a social and generousminded man could live without the enjoyment of friendship and totally withdraw himself from all attachments with the world is to me truly a severity little to be comprehended i presume the saint must have held the very argument mr hume humes eassays not hist of religion vol   p     adopts to account for the austerities of superstitious men nor is it satisfactory to say that the practice of morality is more difficult than that of superstition and is therefore rejected for not to mention the excessive pennances of the bachmans and talaponis it is certain that the rhamadan of the turks during which the poor wretches for many days often in the hottest months of the year and in some of the hottest climates in the world remain without eating or drinking from the rising to the setting sun this rhamadan i say must be more severe than the practice of any moral duty even to the most vicious and depraved of mankind the four lents of the muscovites and the austeries of some roman catholics appear more disagreeable than meekness and benevolence  perhaps the following account may be received as a true solution of the difficulty the duties which a man performs as a friend or parent seem merely owing to his benefactor or children nor can he be wanting to these duties without breaking through all the ties of nature and morality a strong inclination may prompt him to the performance a sentiment of order and moral obligation joins its force to these natural ties and the whole man is truly virtuous is drawn to his duty without any effort or endeavor even with regard to the virtues which are more austere and more founded on reflection such as public spirit filial duty temperance or integrity the moral obligation in our apprehension remove all pretension to religious merit and the virtuous conduct is deemed no more than what we owe to society and to ourselves in all this a superstitious man finds nothing which he has properly performed for the sake of his deity or which can peculiarly recommend him to the divine favor and protection he considers not that the most genuine method of serving the divinity is by promoting the happiness of his creatures he still looks out for some more immediate service of the supreme being in order to allay those terrors with which he is haunted and any practice recommended to him which either serves to no purpose in life or offers the strongest violence to his natural inclinations that practice he will the more readily embrace on account of those very circumstances which should make him absolutely reject it it seems the more purely religious because it proceeds from no mixture of any other motive or consideration and if for its sake he sacrifices much of his ease and quiet his claim of merit appears still to rise upon him in proportion to the zeal and devotion which he discovers in restoring a loan or paying a debt his divinity is in no wise beholden to him because these acts of justice are what he was bound to perform and what many would have performed were there no god in the universe but if he fast a a day or give himself a sound whipping this has a direct reference in his opinion to the service of god no other motive could engage him to such austerities by these distinguished marks of devotion he has now acquired the divine favor and may expect in recompense protection and safety in this world and eternal happiness in the next  but i will quit this review to return to the more interesting features of friendship  if we compare friendship to the other affections of man we see love has a powerful influence on the human heart but its bounds are confined and its conclusions selfish it has but one object to possess its attachments are rigorous indeed but full of prejudice and its whole influence centers in an egoity wherein generosity and honor lose much of their luster  gratitude is an excellent operation of the soul our obligations are therein duly estimated it is a confession of our former indigence and selfimportance is refined by such humiliation it depends on the comparison which is drawn between our own wants and the bounty received gratitude is a branch of moral honesty a confession of the debt of obligation  yet friendship is abundantly superior to love and gratitude it is an affection of the heart in which benevolence presides it is accompanied by an openness of mind wherein generosity and honor are exemplary without selfishness or price or consideration of reward in friendship the bosom is expanded and elated secrecy guile and concealment are expelled and probity truth and virtue reign in their place there is an energy in friendship to which every faculty contributes it fires the soul with fervor and fills the heart with gladness you act therein from the same principles as would conduct your own nearest and most momentous affairs it is that divine perfection to which we are peculiarly exhorted love your neighbor as yourself with our friend all disguise is thrown off the political guise of politeness which masks sincerity is taken away the heart leaps with affection the eyes gaze with rapture approbation and esteem the countenance glows with expressions of delight the bosom is unlocked the treasures of the bosom are thrown abroad you fear no treachery you are open and confident you communicate with the same joy you receive instruction and all is pleasure  such were the feelings my youth experienced in the possession of a friend how often has the young mind hung enraptured in the association of my friend the cordiality that then took place was as dear as life riper manhood has retained the whole though in a graver degree  i think i hear the saint reply the warmth of our sociability freezes up with declining youth our cordiality cools as age advances and our openness of heart decreases as the frauds of mankind and disappointments of life advance upon experience we grow afraid of the hidden dangers our confidence has often prompted and we gradually treasure up in our memories the lessons of example and the inferences of experience which like the sepulchers of the dead only remind us how many friends are departed how many disasters are incident to life how little dependence there is on man and how vain is all human confidence in the things of this world  if such is the consequence of age if the delightful taste of friendship passes away i will cling to the departing footsteps i will grasp at the sacred verge from whence to fall is to depart from the first and the finest enjoyment of human life the only possession on earth which gives an idea of the communion of angels  to return to our saint he was elected by the synod of aln cuthbertus in synodo apud twiford juxta alne flu a theodoro archiepiscopo cantaur in episcopum

added carlisle with a large district to this see  some short time preceding the consecration of st cuthbert the monastery of coldingham was consumed by fire the religious society of this house consisted of monks and nuns this association of monks and nuns is said to be grounded on the words of our savior john xix       who occupied separate parts of the edifice but the severities of a devoted life and the strict rules professed in such societies were not sufficient to prevent a shameful relaxation of discipline and many gross abuses and enormities took place insomuch that the destruction of this stately edifice was regarded as a judgment for the crimes and pollutions of its inhabitants the monastery of lindisfarn looked upon the event with religious horror and soon after cuthbert was made bishop he forbid the approach of women to the convent and even denied them access to the church where the monks performed their devotions he caused a small chapel to be erected in a distant plain on the island for the reception of the female sex from its situation taking the name of greenchurch from thenceforth the women were excluded the churches or cemeteries where st cuthberts body rested and some miraculous punishments are related which attended infringements on this injunction in the cathedral church at durham the pavement is distinguished by a cross of black marble beyond which women were not allowed to advance toward the choir  cuthbert enjoyed his change of life and dignities but a very short time for within two years finding his health declining and his mind being by habit tempered more for solitude and silence than the duties of this high office he resigned the sea and returned to his cell in farne where he survived only two months yielding his spirit to god on the  0th day of may     in the   d year of the creation of the sea of lindisfarn and    years after he had assumed the monastic habit at mailross he directed by his last will that his body should be buried at the east end of the oratory in a stone coffin given him by the holy tuda and wrapped up in a sheet presented him as a token by virca abbess of tynemouth which out of reverence to that holy woman he had never used and lastly if the island should be invaded by pagans he ordered the monks to fly from them and carry his bones away with them these directions were none of them performed his body was transported to lindisfarn where in st peters church at the right side of the high altar he was solemnly laid in a tomb of stone but the monks left behind them the coffin for which he expressed such regard which still continues to be shown at farne island and it is highly probable they were not more mindful of the sheet  gross his body was brought from farne to be interred at holy island where his remains were deposited with great funeral pomp first in the cemetery of the old church and afterward on the right side of the high altar on the cathedrals being rebuilt and for his exemplary piety and virtue the church enrolled him in the table of saints in the philosophical transactions a curious painting of st cuthbert is described found near ashelney in somersetshire

corpus and seeds episcopalis permanserunt this invasion happened in the   th year of the reign of osbert king of northumberland by some authors it is ascribed to the resentment of bruern brocard a northumbrian nobleman king osbert having come to bruerns castle in his absence was most courteously received and entertained by his lady of whom he became enamoured and in defiance of all the principles of humanity hospitality and justice constrained her to receive his embraces bruern on his return being informed of the irreparable injury and disgrace he had sustained by this royal rape went to court attended by his kindred and dependents and solemnly renounced his allegiance and the lands he held of the king then taking his passage immediately to denmark he fell at the feet of king guthred to whom bruern was related describing his injury in such pathetic terms and uttering his grief with that energy that the danish monarch readily hearkened to his requests fitting out a powerful fleet and great army for the coasts of northumberland under two generals who were brothers inguar and hubba matthew of westminster says the principle view of this danish expedition was against the dominions of edmund king of the east angles who was falsely charged with putting to death the father of the danish chieftains who had been assassinated by an exiled traitor they had proposed to land this author says on the coasts of edmunds kingdom but by contrary winds being driven northwards they landed at berwick upon tweed the convent of coldingham having been restored after a former conflagration was then possessed it is said by nuns under an abbess called ebba of royal blood she dreading the barbarities these invaders exercised in their former descent on all ranks of religious in an assembly of her nuns representing the hazard their chastity was in communicated a device which she presumed would preserve them from these violators without hesitation they vowed that her rules should be strictly observed forthwith she drew out a razor and as an example with the greatest fortitude cut off her nose and upper lip she was followed by the whole sisterhood when the danes entered the convent in the morning they were shocked with the horrid spectacle and disappointed in their lusts set fire to the edifice wherein the abbess with all her whole convent were consumed there is the greatest improbability in this relation touching the massacre of ebba and her nuns in the time of ebba who was of royal race the society consisted of monks and nuns and she was dead before st cuthbert was consecrated bishop of lindisfarn and made the regulation noted in regard to the female sex  the reader will correct the note at p   0 if the name of the abbess of coldingham at the time of this descent of the danes was ebba it could not be ebba daughter of edilfrid king of northumberland this is the story of matthew of westminster but other authors chron sax sym dunelm etc whose relations are attended with greater probability fix the place of this danish descent at the mouth of the humber from whence the invaders marched to york osbert at their approach led forth a powerful army and engaged them near the city where he fell amongst the slain and his troops were totally routed aella who had held a conflict of five years for the kingdom of northumberland with osbert under the support of bruern and his allies is said upon the danish invasion to have come to a compromise with osbert and joined with him against the common enemy and that in the battle he also fell with osbert this account gains greater credit than that of bruerns application to the danes and it seems most probable the object of this invasion was no other than rapine and plunder the danes after this victory having laid waste the country between york and the tyne made egbert king of northumberland north of tyne to hold his crown as their dependent being afterward employed in expeditions against the southern parts of this island the northumbrians dethroned this vassal king and gave the crown to ricsig not long after this the danish king embarking his troops in some of the southern counties sailed for the mouth of tyne and landed at the town of tynemouth where he wintered it being too late in the year to attempt any thing against the northumbrians on the opening of the spring they began their

plantations greatly ornament the scene but the situation is far from eligible there being none of that rural variety that elegant simplicity or its reverse those wildnesses in nature which constitute a pleasing country prospect the hills rise tamely the enclosures are large and ill wooded the hamlets are very distantly scattered and nothing appears singular or attracting upon the whole view but

possession of the family of bows of streatlam near budle at a place called spindleston the poem of the laidly worm of spindleston heughs inserted in the following notes seems to be of an historic nature but wrapped up in such dark allegory the humor of those times as to render it unintelligible in this age the fortifications are danish and it is probable that the ballad relates to the conflicts of that people with the garrison of bambrough is a danish camp circular in form and fortified with a triple ditch and vallum two mounts are seen from it which appear to be outposts and not tumuli as some writers have conjectured to the westward is another intrenchment which forms a crescent and seems not to be the work of the same people who had constructed the former fortifications it is defended by a triple ditch and vallum the interior vallum composed of uncemented stones as was the british custom this commands a lookout to sea and has in view the castles of bambrough and holy island opposite to this fortification is a square camp apparently roman called ulchester the manor of budle was formerly a member of the barony of wooler and was the possession of sir robert de

the traveller an idea of the state of palaces and strongholds in the remotest era of our saxon ancestors in britain the site of this fortress is on the crown of a high rock triangular in figure one of the points projecting into the sea many of the buildings stand on the very brink of the rocks to the land side the aspect toward the sea is very lofty being near   0 perpendicular feet above the level of low water mark part of the most ancient fortifications on the land side are broken and defaced by the falling of the cliffs on which they were erected the same consisting of a soft red stone which perishes much by the weather on this side a circular tower remains of very antique construction its base projecting in several tiers many of the other buildings appear to be the work of more modern ages till you approach the gateway which is on the only accessible part of the rock it was defended by a deep ditch cut through a narrow neck communicating with the main land having a draw bridge this lays to the southeast and on the brink of the precipice above the sea shore the gateway is strengthened by a round tower on each side from whence passing about    paces which space appears to have been formerly a covered way you approach a second and machicolated gate of a much more modern order of building having a portculice after you have passed the second gate on the left hand on a lofty point of the rock stands a very ancient round tower of great strength commanding the pass assailants having won this approach entered upon a situation of imminent danger on a tremendous precipice subject to every kind of annoyance from the besieged who possessed the round tower this part of the fortress wears the most ancient countenance and challenges the saxons for its origin the ingenious mr bambrough castle depiction of bambrough castle gross says this is the spot where according to the monkish historians stood the castle or palace of the kings of northumberland built as it said by king ida who began his reign a d     part of the present ruins are by some supposed to be the remains of king idas work  on the whole though there was undoubtedly a fortress or palace here in the saxon times and perhaps earlier every part of the present buildings seems to have been the work of the normans on what circumstances mr gross grounds this general determination i cannot discover most of the northern norman structures are of excellent masonry the buildings here are various in figure materials modes of arching windows bases and other parts the round tower i have noted is different in all those matters from the greatest part of the works and it is to a common observer marked with much greater antiquity than the keep or main tower which i shall next describe it is impossible to prevent a disagreement in opinion on subjects of this kind where there is no certain rule to fix determination it must be the case i pay the greatest deference to mr groses judgment but think he has passed this determination hastily the keep or chief tower of this fortress is a lofty square structure of the same model with many norman fortresses founded in or near the time of the conqueror it stands on the crown of the rock having an open area round it but most extensive toward the north and northeast points mr wallis says that from the style of the architecture of its base being of the doric order it is believed to be of roman work he adds that it is well known the saxons erected their castles when they could on roman foundations and gave them the name of burg or brough it is very probable the romans held this part of the country to be of singular importance to their navy but that they built castles here is not by any means admissible they might erect small towers like those whose remains appear on the wall of severus on places of special import i do not doubt the saxons would enter upon the roman fortifications for the same reasons the normans after them made such choice the northern counties furnish a multitude of instances that the normans possessed themselves of such situations but in those places the roman vallum and fosse only served for outworks to the norman structures the remains of the roman station are visible at many of those fortresses in most of the places i have observed the roman works are retained as a platform or outward area to the south sides of the castles in the northern stations of the largest size there are no remains of castles whether the saxons or normans entered upon those places i do not presume to determine the site of the praetorium is to be traced in many but without any other appearances than of erections for domestic uses not showing a sufficient quantity of ruins to give the least idea of a decayed castle mr gross says some assert the keep to have been a roman structure for which supposition they give the following reasons its great similarity to the keep of dover castle and the white tower of london both allowed to be roman  the shape of its arches which are either flat or semicircular  a doric base round its bottom and the great depth of its well sunk    feet through a whinstone rock  the first of these is evidently founded on a mistake neither the white tower nor the keep of dover castle being roman but built since the conquest the last in the time of king henry ii proofs of which are to be met with in dugdales monasticon the textus roffensis and diverse other authentic records nor is the proof drawn from the shape of its arches more conclusive semicircular and flat arches are found in almost every building erected before the time of king henry ii and from the argument deduced from its doric base it is not at all wonderful or uncommon to find the members of grecian architecture employed in norman buildings one instance of this among many may be seen at the cathedral of canterbury where a massive column placed in the undercroft to support some vast weight has a rude sort of ionic capital besides it is well known most of the architects of those days learned their art at rome where they had the grecian architecture continually before them of which indeed the saxon was only a debased kind after the stupendous works carried on by our norman ancestors it seems extraordinary that the digging of the abovementioned well should appear so arduous an undertaking as to be deemed possible to the romans only besides in beeston castle cheshire there is a well full as deep cut through the solid rock and that is universally known to be the work of the normans  the following remarks extracted from the same work will not be unacceptable to the reader the stones with which the keep or great tower is built are remarkably small and were taken from a quarry three miles distant from their smallness it has been conjectured they were brought hither on the backs of men or horses the walls to the front are    feet thick but the other three sides are only nine the original roof was placed no higher than the top of the second story the reason for the side walls being carried so much higher than the roof might be for the sake of defense or to command a more extensive lookout both toward the sea and land the tower was however afterward covered at the top here were no chimneys the only fire place in it was a grate in the middle of a large room supposed to have been the guard room where some stones in the middle of the floor are burned red this floor was all of stone supported by arches this room had a window in it near the top three feet square intended to let out the smoke all the other rooms were lighted by slits or chinks in the walls six inches broad the outworks are built of a very different stone from that of the keep being a coarse free stone of an inferior quality ill abiding the injuries of weather taken from the rock itself in all the principal rooms in the outworks there are chimneys particularly in the kitchen which measures  0 feet by  0 feet where there are three very large ones and four windows over each window is a stone funnel like a chimney open at the top intended as it is supposed to carry off the steam in a narrow passage near

siege to it and not being able to take the place by storm attempted to burn it by raising huge piles of wood against the walls and setting them on fire but when his machines were fully prepared and his piles were burning the wind suddenly changed and blowing a storm the blazing faggots were carried into his camp and made a great destruction insomuch that he was obliged to raise the siege this deliverance was ascribed according to the superstition and bigotry of those times to the prayers of aidan bishop of lindisfarn who for the sake of greater retirement and an uninterrupted devotion was

colores arrectis horret squamis et sibilat ore arduaque insurgens navem de littore pulsat  a song  00 years old made by the old mountain bard duncan frasier living on cheviot a d    0 from an ancient manuscript the king is gone from bambrough castle long may the princess mourn long may she stand on the castle wall looking for his return she has knotted the keys upon a string and with her she has them taken she has cast them over her left shoulder and to the gate she is gane she tripped out she tripped in she tript into the yard but it was more for the kings sake than for the queens regard it fell out on a day the king brought the queen with him home and all the lords in our country to welcome them did come oh welcome father the lady cries unto your halls and bowers and so are you my stepmother for all that is here is yours a lord said wondering while she spoke this princess of the north surpasses all of female kind in beauty and in worth the envious queen replied at least you might have excepted me in a few hours i will her bring down to a low degree i will liken her to a laidley worm that warps about the stone and not till childy there is a street now called the wynd at bambrough wynd comes back shall she again be won the princess stood at her bower door laughing who could her blame but ever the next days sun went down a long worm she became for seven miles east and seven miles west and seven miles north and south no blade of grass or corn could grow so venomous was her mouth the milk of seven stately cows it was costly her to keep was brought her daily which she drank before she went to sleep at this day may be seen the cave which held her folded up and the stone trough the very same out of which she did sup word went east and word went west and word is gone over the sea that a laidley worm in spindleston heughs would ruin the north country word went east and word went west and over the sea did go the child of wynd got wit of it which filled his heart with woe he called straight his merry men all they thirty were and three i wish i were at spindleston this desperate worm to see we have no time now here to waste hence quickly let us sail my only sister margaret something i fear does ail they built a ship without delay with masts of the rowntree mountain ash  with fluttering sails of silk so fine and set her on the sea they went aboard the wind with speed blew them along the deep at length they spied an huge square tower on a rock high and steep the sea was smooth the weather clear when they approached nigher king idas castle they well knew and the banks of bambroughshire the queen looked out at her bowerwindow to see what she could see there she espied a gallant ship sailing upon the sea when she beheld the silken sails full glancing in the sun to sink the ship she sent away her witchwives every one their spells were vain the hags returned to the queen in sorrowful mood crying that witches have no power where there is rowntree wood her last effort she sent a boat which in the haven lay with armed men to board the ship but they were driven away the worm leapt up the worm leapt down she plaited round the stane and ay as the ship came to the land she banged it off again the child then ran out of her reach the ship on budle sand and jumping into the shallow sea securely got to land and now he drew his berrybrown sword and laid it on her head and swore if she did harm to him that he would strike her dead oh quit thy sword and bend thy bow and give me kisses three for though i am a poisonous worm no hurt i will do to thee oh quit thy sword and bend thy bow and give me kisses three if i am not won ever the son go down won i shall never be he quitted his sword he bent his bow he gave her kisses three she crept into a hole a worm but stepped out a lady no clothing had this lady fine to keep her from the cold he took his mantle from him about and round her did it fold he has taken his mantle from him about and it he wrapped her in and they are up to bambrough castle as fast as they can win his absence and her serpent shape the king had long deplored he now rejoiced to see them both again to him restored the queen they wanted whom they found all pale and sore afraid because she knew her power must yield to childy wynds who said woe be to thee thou wicked witch an ill death may thou dee as thou my sister have likened so likened shall thou be i will turn you into a toad that on the ground does wend and won won shall thou never be till this world has an end now on the sand near idas tower she crawls a loathsome toad and venom spits on every maid she meets upon her road the virgins all of bambrough town will swear that they have seen this spiteful toad of monstrous size whilst walking they have been all folks believe within the shire this story to be true and they all run to spindleston the cave and trough to view this fact now duncan frasier of cheviot sings in rhyme lest bambroughshire men should forget some part of it in time    in the next reign it was entrusted by king henry i to eustace fitzjohn who was dispossessed of it and his other employments by king stephen jealous of his attachment to maud daughter of king henry i irritated at this injury fitzjohn attached himself to david king of scotland and levied a great force from his barony of alnwick with which he openly joined the scotch invader they marched toward bambrough and made a regular attack but so far from being able to possess the place they only forced an outwork which had been lately erected and put to the sword about  00 of the defenders by whose reproachful speeches they were irritated to the assault after destroying the corn hamlets and erections in the adjacent country they marched southward and in the county of durham being joined by a large body of forces from galloway and cumberland with king david at their head they advanced to northallerton and soon after were defeated at the battle of the standard  in the conditions of peace made between king stephen and king david i of scotland it was stipulated that the earldom of northumberland should be conclusively settled on prince henry davids son with all its appendages except bambrough and newcastle which the english monarch was to retain on henrys receiving a compensation by lands in the south of england all the barons within this earldom did homage to prince henry for their estates with a salvo for the fealty they had sworn to king stephen it having also been premised that the laws and customs established by king henry i in northumberland should remain in force this treaty was ratified at durham in the month of april a d      in the presence of maude queen of england and a great assembly of the barons of both nations and thereupon the king of scotland and his son entered into compact for the maintenance of peace with england during their lives for the observance of which cospatric earl of march hugh de morvill fergus mel and mac were given as hostages  king henry ii in the third year of his reign had restored to him by malcolm iv king of scotland the northern territories which king stephen had granted to david king of scotland and therewith king henry was put in possession of the city of carlisle the castle of bambrough and newcastle upon tyne it is presumed by some authors that david having taken advantage of the broils in which king stephen was involved had seized the castle of bambrough as in the treaty when the earldom of northumberland was resigned to prince henry this fortress and newcastle were expressly reserved to the crown of england  in the   th year of king henry the seconds reign some great work seems to have been added to this fortress as in madoxs history of the exchequer under the article of amercements it appears one william son of waldef was fined five marks for refusing his assistance in the kings works at baenburg castle he was fined also  0s to have a respite touching the said works perhaps at this time the keep was built its great similarity to that of dover the work of that reign makes it at least probable gross   in the time of king richard i hugh bishop of durham held this castle but his power was of short date for the king being offended at his insolence disseized him of this place together with the county of northumberland and imposed on him a fine of  000 marks  william heron son of jordan heron who held a barony in this county by the service of one knights fee as his ancestors had done from the conquest was in the   d year of king henry iii constituted governor of bambrough castle and of pickering and scarbrough in yorkshire in which appointments he was succeeded in the   th year of the same reign by john lexington knt chief justice of the forests north of trent  in      king edward i summoned john baliol king of scotland to renew his homage at this castle but the proud vassal forgetting his fidelity contemned the command and levied an army to resist the english arms if edward entered his kingdom edward burning with indignation at this insolence marched to berwick which he took by storm and put the garrison to the sword from thence proceeding to dunbar near which place the scotch army waited his approach an engagement ensued in which the english were victorious the field of battle was covered with innumerable carcasses   000 scots some historians assert fell that day dunbar was taken and baliol was made prisoner the great trophy of this victory was the stone chair in which the kings of scotland had been crowned from the earliest times this was the palladium of the scotch the loss of which shook the superstition of the whole empire this chair was brought in triumph to england with the king in chains and was placed in the abbey of westminster where it has remained for regal honors ever since  a degree of appropriation which nothing but the bigotry and superstition of that age could have decreed to it in england to increase the superstitions import of this palladium of monarchy it is reported that it contains or is composed of the stone of bethel on which jacob slept when he had the beatific vision and received the promises of inheritance from the voice of the supreme   isabel de beaumont related to eleanor queen of edward i sister to lord henry beaumont and widow of john de vesey afterward wife of john duke of brabant had a grant of this castle for her life on proviso that she did not marry again during her possession piers de gaveston earl of cornwall was protected here from the vengeance of an injured and incensed nobility in      he was dragged from the castle of scarbrough and given up to the hands of his adversaries  in the year      this castle on the marriage of the lady vesey was reassumed by government and given to lord percy carte ii   0 dug i       in      earl murray being taken prisoner by king edward iii was committed prisoner to this castle from whence he was removed to nottingham and lastly to windsor  it was held for a short time by roger heron a younger son of william heron before mentioned after which it was conferred on henry percy for his good services in the scotch wars in this family it continued for several ages and a grant of this castle together with the manor and fee farms of the town was made to his grandson for life in the reign of king henry vi henry percy earl of northumberland was constable during the contention between the king and the house of york there were diverse governors according to the party which happened to be victorious sir ralph gray and john lord wenlock were both of them constables for henry vi the latter in the   th year of that king he nevertheless sided with king edward iv and served under him at towton  in the second year of the reign of king edward iv an insurrection of the lancastrian party appearing in the north the king advanced to northumberland and at once laid siege to the three castles of alnwick dunstanburgh and bambrough ten thousand forces invested the latter under the command of the earl of worcester the earl of arundel the lord ogle and the lord montecute the duke of somerset the earl of pembroke lord roos and sir ralph percy maintained the fortress until christmas eve when it was surrendered the lords pembroke and roos effected their escape and the duke of somerset and sir ralph percy received the royal pardon the queen still struggling against the torrents of adversity such in the whole as royalty seldom ever experienced again made head in northumberland sir ralph gray surprised the castle of bambrough which was then in the keeping of sir john astley and he garrisoned it with scotch troops but the battle of hexham levels soon put a final end to these commotions and gave a conclusive blow to the hopes of the house of lancaster sir ralph gray and sir humphrey nevill were excepted in the general pardon nevill soon afterward suffered at york but sir ralph gray knowing his perilous estate held out the castle of bambrough until july the lords montecute and warwick conducted the siege a tower being beat down by the canon sir ralph received such bruizes by its fall that he was taken up for dead and the garrison dismayed at the catastrophe immediately surrendered it was sir ralphs fate to survive the day and afterward to suffer death as a traitor at york  the damages the castle had sustained were not repaired in that or the succeeding reigns king henry vii and king henry viii both esteemed those castles as places of refuge only for malcontents from the time of king edward iv there is a total suspension of its history by the escheats of the  0th of queen elizabeth it appears to be in the crown with the adjoining castle of dunstanburgh sir john foster of bambrough abbey was then governor of this castle his grandson john foster esquire had a grant of the manor of bambrough from king james but in the year      his descendant forfeited and it was purchased by his uncle lord crew i am indebted to ralph spearman esquire of eachwick in the county of northumberland for the following curious survey taken by

drawbridge and gates so broken that there is noe usual enter on the fore part save at a breach on the wall that has been well walled and yet has walls much decayed standing and is of three wards in the two utter wards whereof nothing is but walls much decayed in the innermost ward is one tower of    yards square by estimation standing upon the topp of the rock and in the same a well of fresh water the walls whereof are upright but much worn and decayed with weather the roof whereof which has been timber and swintime covered with lead as it seemed is utterly decayed and gone within the said ward has been also the principal lodging of the house and as it may appear all offices belonging thereunto which for the more part as it seame have been long in decay save the remotese walls do

occupation and manuring of the said demayne lands and also that every two tenants should bring every year one carte load of wood from rochwood and one foother of turves from the kings moore to said castle to be spent with certain other accustomable services to the said castle also belongs a certain peace of ground which as it seems has been enclosed because there remains yet about it the mencon

this service has of late engaged the attention of antiquaries the following definitions are worthy a place here  drenches or drenges drengi were tennets in capite says an ancient ms doomsday tit lest

vel per drengagium tenure sua incoluisse  te advtur nanran  sr matthew have in his exposition of the vetripont charter says there is no such tenure in the southern part of england and observes from the records before him that it drew wardship and relief sir henry spelman reites several records wherein these words had occurred to him and conjectures upon the whole that the drenges were free tenants holding by military service but there are other records which had not fallen under the inspection of that learned author that destroy this notion entirely mr denton from the red book in the exchequer observes that sir hugh moril in westmoreland changed drengage into free service several instances are quoted at clifton also in this county and other neighboring parts there were drengage tenants and in the   st edw   gilbert de eugain of clifton granted by indenture to roger de clifford lord of westmoreland the services of diverse persons there by name with their bodies and all that belonged to them cum eorum corporious et little equlis during the life of the said roger so that they seem to have been drudges to perform the most servile and laborious offices and of these roger had great use at brougham for of him the countess of pembrokes memoirs take notice that he was a lover of building and a great repairer of his ancient castles the seats of his ancestors they seem to have been tenants in pure villenage who were bound to the lord as members of and annexed to the manor and were usually sold with the farm to which they belonged  nicholson and burn hist of westmoreland the work from whence the last quotation is made is marked with many forced and uncouth etymologies and derivations the above of ruges from oreges not a little remarkable a more perfect knowledge of the feodal tentes would have discovered the sutility and inconsistency of the above argument there were certainly villains in cfton yet it does not follow that the drenges and they were one  we do not find these tenants mentioned in blakistons commentaries or sullivans lectures the villains or lazzi held no lands but at the will of the lord and were in absolute vassalage when they bettered their condition they became base copyholders it would be a change not instanced in records of the feodal tenures for a villain to be raised to free service the original acceptance of the old word dre is not known to us or to what language it belongs balley in his dictionary supposes it derived from the saxon  a drone   and the same towns also do make appearance at the head courts or in default thereof

that his bequests have furnished the most exalted degree of charitable distribution that ever flowed from a private donation in this country  lord crews will bears date the   th june    0 and he died the   th of september in the   th year of his age at stene the seat of his ancestors in northamptonshire the appropriations which particularly relate to bambrough are the sole objects of my present attention i cannot describe them to the reader in more expressive language than that of the worthy and learned traveller mr pennant from whose works i will select a few sentences  the castle and the manor belonging it was once the property of the forsters but purchased by lord crew bishop of durham and with other considerable estates left vested in trustees to be applied to unconfined charitable uses three of these trustees are a majority one dr sharp of them makes this place his residence and blesses the coast by his judicious and humane application of the prelates generous bequest he has repaired and rendered habitable the great square tower the part reserved for himself and family is a large hall and a few smaller apartments but the rest of the spacious edifice is allotted for purposes which make the heart to glow with joy when thought of the upper part is an ample granary from whence corn is dispensed to the poor without distinction even in the dearest time at the rate of four shillings a bushel and the distressed for many miles round often experience the convenience of this benefaction  other apartments are fitted up for shipwrecked sailors and bedding is provided for  0 should such a number happen to be cast on shore at the same time a constant patrol is kept every stormy night along this tempestuous coast for above   miles the length of the manor by which means numbers of lives have been preserved many poor wretches are often found on the shore in a state of insensibility but by timely relief are soon brought to themselves  it often happens that ships strike in such a manner on the rocks as to be capable of relief in case numbers of people could be suddenly assembled for that purpose a cannon once belonging to a dutch frigate of  0 guns which with all the crew was lost opposite to the castle about  0 years ago is fixed on the top of the tower which is fired once if the accident happens in such a quarter twice if in another and thrice if in such a place by these signals the country people are directed to the spot they are to fly to and by this means frequently preserve not only the crew but even the vessel for machines of different kinds are always in readiness to heave ships out of their perilous situation  in a word all the schemes of this worthy trustee have a humane and useful tendency he seems as if selected from his brethren for the same purposes as spenser tells us the first of his seven beadsmen in the house of holiness was  the first of them that eldest was and best of all the house had charge and government as guardian and steward of the rest his office was to give entertainment and lodging unto all that came and went not unto such as could him feast again and doubly quite for that he on them spent but such as want of harbor did constrain these for gods sake his dewty was to entertain that all seamen may be informed of the circumstances of this charity a printed account is published under the direction of the trinity house in newcastle upon tyne and which is subjoined in the notes an account of the signals made use of at bambrough castle in the county of northumberland in case ships or vessels are perceived in distress and of the charitable institutions established there for their assistance and relief now published by the direction of the trustees of nathanael late lord crewe with the approbation of the master pilots and seamen of the trinityhouse in newcastle upon tyne signals i a gun a ninepounder placed at the bottom of the tower to be fired as a signal in case any ship or vessel be observed in distress viz once when any ship or vessel is stranded or wrecked upon the islands or any adjacent rock twice when any ship or vessel is stranded or wrecked behind the castle or to the northward of it thrice when any ship or vessel is stranded or wrecked to the southward of the castle in order that the customhouse officers and the tenants with their servants may hasten to give all possible assistance  as well as to prevent the wreck from being plundered  ii in every great storm two men on horseback are sent from the castle to patrol along the coast from sunset to sunrise that in case of an accident one may remain by the ship and other return to alarm the castle whoever brings the first notice of any ship or vessel being in distress is entitled to a premium in proportion to the distance from the castle and if between twelve oclock at night and three oclock in the morning the premium to be double  iii a large flag is hoisted when there is any ship or vessel seen in distress upon the fern islands or staples that the sufferers may have the satisfaction of knowing their distress is perceived from the shore and that relief will be sent them as soon as possible in case of bad weather the flag will be kept up a gun fired morning and evening and a rocket thrown up every night from the north turret till such time as relief can be sent these are also signals to the holy island fishermen who by the advantage of their situation can put off for the islands at times when no boat from the main land can get over the breakers premiums are given to the first boats that put off for the islands to give their assistance to ships or vessels in distress and provisions and liquors are sent in the boats  iv a bell on the south turret will be rung out in every thick fog as a signal to the fishing boats and a large swivel fixed on the east turret will be fired every fifteen minutes as a signal to the ships without the islands  v a large weathercock is fixed on the top of the

make their humane intentions public by order thomas aubone secretary   it is much to be lamented that this example has not induced the benevolent to adopt the plan on the southern coasts by which many acts of barbarity might be prevented and valuable lives saved to the public  the reader will form a perfect idea of the extent of lord crews charity in a department distinct from that of seamen under

were canonized for trifling acts of benevolence compared to this but although the resources were given by lord crew yet the disposition was not of his arrangement to the benevolent heart of the rev dr sharp the chief part of the blessings derived from his lordships will is to be attributed he resides many months in each year in the castle of bambrough superintends the works of charity has his eye open upon every new channel by which he may give relief or consolation to his suffering fellow creatures the shipwrecked and the diseased are comforted by his visitation and the calamities of life are all alleviated by his care it is an exalted duty the blessed spirits of heaven are described to us as dispensing the gifts of universal benevolence  in regard to natural strength there is not a situation in all northumberland equal to that of bambrough or one in any wise so well adapted to the ancient rules of fortification from the great tower there is an extensive sea and land prospect you overlook the whole group of farn islands you view the castle of holy island which from thence makes a very formidable appearance and on the more distant peninsula you discern the town and fortifications of berwick on the other side dunstanborough castle crowns the nearest cliffs behind which a winding shore is seen with many little promontories creeks and bays beautifully mingled and graced with multitudes of small vessels laying in their ports or under sail the extreme point of view is tynemouth whose ruined monastery gives an obelisk to terminate the landscape all the inland prospect gradually inclines toward the sea banks with many considerable swells displaying a fine cultivated scene to the eye varied with innumerable villages and hamlets  the farn islands possess little matter of sufficient consequence to tempt a traveller to sea especially where there is so constant a ripling and breaking of the waves as is to be found between them and the continent the effect of oil on troubled waters mentioned lately as a modern and accidental discovery was known in very distant ages it was practiced in this country and esteemed a miracle indeed most of the miraculous works of the religious were deduced from some knowledge of the simplest principles of nature discovered and displayed in ages of profound ignorance in bedes third book of the history of the church of england touching the miracles wrought by aidan this practice is thus mentioned a certain priest named utta a man of great gravity and sincerity and one who for his qualities and truth was well esteemed was commissioned to go into kent for eanflede king edwines daughter who after her fathers death had been sent thither in order to her espousal with king oswin he was to travel by land to kent but to return by sea on which account he addressed bishop aidan beseeching him to put up fervent prayers to god to prosper their voyage the bishop gave them his blessing and having recommended them devoutly to the protection of god he also delivered to utta some jars of hallowed oil saying i foresee that whilst you are at sea a sudden tempest will come upon you remember to cast into the troubled waters the oil that i give you and and speedily the tempest shall be assuaged the sea be calmed and you shall have a pleasant passage all these things were fulfilled according to the prophecy at the beginning of the tempest when the waves and surges chiefly raged the sailors endeavored in vain to cast anchor but the storm increased and the waves multiplied so fast that the vessel was almost filled with water and nothing but immediate death presented itself in this distress the priest had recourse to the bishops directions and took the pot of oil some of which he cast into the sea and the sea was immediately calmed the sun soon after shone forth and the ship proceeded with a prosperous voyage thus the man of god through the spirit of prophecy predicted the tempest and by the same holy spirit though he was himself absent appeased the same in the month of august when we visited the islands the sea was tumultuous making a violent inset between them and the main land they are    in number the largest and only one we thought worth attending to is the house island nearest to bambrough where st cuthbert made his residence mr pennant visited them all and has the following remarks which as the work of a very able naturalist highly merit a place here there ly certain isles adjoining to farne island bigger then farne itself but in them is no habitation certn big fowls

rokkes  lel itin vol     opposite to bambrough lie the farn islands which form two groups of little isles and rocks to the number of    but at low water the points of others appear above the surface they all are distinguished by particular names the nearest isle to the shore is that called the house island which lies exactly one mile    chains from the coast the most distant is about seven or eight miles they are rented for   l per annum their produce is kelp some few feathers and a few seals which the tenant watches and shoots for the sake of the oil and skins some of them yield a little grass and serve to feed a cow or two which the people are desperate enough to transport over in their little boats  visited these islands in a coble a safe but seemingly hazardous species of boat long narrow and flatbottomed which is capable of going through a high sea dancing like a cork on the summits of the waves  touched at the rock called meg whitened with the dung of corvorants which almost covered it their nests were large made of tang and excessively faetid  rowed next to the pinnacles an island in the farthest group so called from the vast columnar rocks at the south end even at their sides and flat at their tops and entirely covered with guillemots and shags the fowlers pass from one to the other of these columns by means of a narrow board which they place from top to top forming a narrow bridge over such a horrid gap that the very sight of it strikes one with terror  landed at a small island where we found the female eider ducks at that time fitting the lower part of their nests was made of sea plants the upper part was formed of the down which they pull off their own breasts in which the eggs were surrounded and warmly bedded in some were three in others five eggs of a large size and pale olive color as smooth and glossy as if varnished over the nests are built over the beach among the loose pebbles not far from the water the ducks sit very close nor will they rise till you almost tread on them the drakes separate themselves from the females during the breeding season we robbed a few of their nests of the down after carefully separating it from the tang found that the down of one nest weighed only three quarters of an ounce but was so elastic as to fill the crown of the largest hat the people of this country call these st cuthberts ducks from the saint of the islands  besides these kinds i observed the following  puffins called here tom noddies anks  here skouts guillemots black guillemots little anks shiel anks shags corvorants black and white gulls brown and white gulls herring gulls  which i was told sometimes fed on eggs of other birds common gulls  here annets kittiwakes or tarrocks pewit gulls great terns sea pies sea larks  here brockets jackdaws which breed in rabbitholes rock pigeons rock larks the terns were so numerous that in some places it was difficult to tread without crushing some of the eggs  the last isle i visited was the house island the sequestered spot where st cuthbert passed the two last years of his life here was afterward established a priory of benedictines for six or eight monks subordinate to durham a square tower the remains of a church and some other buildings are to be seen there still and a stone coffin which it is apprehended was that of st cuthbert at the north end of the isle is a deep chasm from the top to the bottom of the rock communicating to the sea through which in tempestuous weather the water is forced with vast violence and noise and forms a fine jet deau of sixty feet high it is called by the inhabitants of the opposite coast the churn  the horrible description given of this island by ancient authors before st cuthbert blessed it with his presence is already mentioned i am apt to doubt whether aidan ever made any other retreat to these islands than merely occasional and for no longer stay than to put up his supplications to heaven on singular events where from greater privacy he might possess more fervor of mind than he could command in the cells of a convent here the saint built himself a cell and a small oratory which he surrounded with a wall that cut off his view from every thing but the heavens those who visited him only conversed through a grate not having access to his presence farne dicitur insula medio in mari posita etc sed aliquot milibus passuum

the landing place where the brethren who came to visit him lodged after the death of st cuthbert ethelwold who took on him the religious habit at ripon resorted to this hermitage and possessed it    years ending his life there felgild succeeded ethelwold and in the time of that hermit eadfrid bishop of lindisfarn restored from its foundations the oratory of st cuthbert which had gone to ruin bid relates that felgild was more than  0 years old when he wrote the life of st cuthbert besides the persons mentioned by bid there were other devotees who chose farn for the place of their retreat st bartholomew was one as appears from a manuscript history of his life in the bodlean library who obtained leave of lawrence prior of durham to go to farne where he found one elwyn in possession of the desirable residence and whose religion was not sufficiently tempered with charity to induce him to welcome the stranger bartholomew wrote in this retreat his farne meditations now preserved in the

there was singular danger in having a bishop of durham under any attachment to the king of scotland as in right of his see he would possess places of great strength and importance more particularly he would hold a large tract of sea coast and many havens where the shipping and troops of france and flanders might be received these objections not being esteemed of sufficient importance to the monks for them to renounce their right of election or fearing new innovations from regal power they appealed to the sea of rome but the messengers charged with this matter died in their passage and melsonby

which is sand and rock a scanty herbage takes place indeed in some spots especially on the little lawn but there is neither tree or shrub the shore is rocky and sounding to the hollow sea which rolls upon it sends forth a horrid howling the northeast winds blow fiercely here and every inclemency of weather known to the climate beats on these inhospitable shores which are tremendous from frequent

was born in the town of duns in the county of mers and being yet a child after some taste he had got of the latin tongue by the perswaision of two minorite friars went to oxford studying logic in morton college then applying himself to scholastic divinity grew to such a perfection therein as he was called the subtle doctor and was followed of a number who after his name are called to this day scotistae after he had professed a while at oxford he was called to read divinity in the university of paris and from thence went to colon where he died of the apoplexy they write that after he was laid in grave his spirits did return and that striving to get forth he was there smothered whereupon an italian did write this epigram  quaecunque humani fuerant jurisque sacrati in dubium veniunt

writers contend that this scotus was born in england in dunstane village within the parish of emilden in the county of northumberland and confirm it by the manuscripts reserved in the library of

parade for the garrison in this front there is a gateway built in a very remarkable style being the great entrance to the castle it is formed by a circular arch with a portico and interior gate is defended by two heavy semicircular towers uniting with the superstructure of the gateway these towers after rising about  0 feet and containing two tiers of apartments support turrets of a square form now so very rugged and ruinous as not to allow a conjecture what was their original height this wall extends to the cliffs on the sea banks is guarded by two square bastions and a small sallyport and is terminated by a square tower with a gateway on the brink of the cliff to the sea on this quarter appear the remains of a very strong wall indeed it is probable the whole area was originally so enclosed the heavy seas which break upon the rocks of the northwest point have torn them much and it appears as if the area had been originally of greater extent than at present many separate columns of rock standing near the cliffs which some ages ago may have been joined to the main land at the south point of the area is the well near to the eastern tower are the remains of a chapel immediately below this tower is a gully or passage of perpendicular sides formed in the rocks about  0 yards in length and  0 feet deep where the sea makes a dreadful inset breaking into foam with a tremendous noise the spray occasioned thereby is driven within the castle walls this place is called by the country people the rumble churn the gulf from the walls of the tower which i ascended to obtain the view has a very awful appearance you look immediately down upon the abyss where as the tide rushes up the waters are lifted many feet above the common level rising toward the walls of the tower as if they would surmount the cliffs and deluge the plain the breaking of the waves in foam over the extreme point of the rocks the heavy spray the noise of the disturbed waters and the groan which echo returns through the desolated towers are noble though tremendous  the date of this castle is fixed by authors to the beginning of the   th century thomas earl of lancaster general of the confederate army which opposed king edward ii being said to be the founder he was also owner of pomfret castle where after being taken by the kings troops at burrowbridge he was imprisoned and soon after decollated as a traitor though afterward he was canonized and the place of his martyrdom took the name of st thomass hill he was possessed of immense estates and was the most powerful and opulent subject in europe holding at once the earldoms of lancaster lincoln salisbury leicester and darby the king sat personally on his trial a remarkable circumstance he died   th march      and was buried on the south side of the high altar in the priory church there such veneration was paid to his tomb as the enthusiasts wasted on that of becket the king of his royal clemency remitted the severities of his sentence by which he was condemned to be hanged and quartered an infamy which seldom had fallen on those of royal descent he being grandson of king henry iii but so fluctuating are human affairs that the ignominious exit of this earl gave exalted honors to his name after his death he was enrolled in the list of martyrs was canonized and his portrait placed among those of sacred memory in the cathedral of st pauls  the following account of this matter extracted from the chronique of william de pakington is contained in the  st vol lel col p     etc  about this time henry lacy earl

remains of sir harry gray knt and baronet who died in the   th year of his age were deposited in the family vault of this church a gentleman of an ancient and honorable family and of the greatest personal worth and merit an upright and impartial magistrate and zealously attached to the established government and to the true interest of his king and country an affectionate husband a tender father a kind master and a generous landlord one of the greatest probity and sincerity and no less conscientious in the discharge of divine than social duties of a very charitable and beneficent disposition as appears by the following instances among many others upon the site of an old decayed church here he erected a new one of an elegant taste and not inferior to any of its size in those northern parts upon which he expended at least  00 l he laid out  00 l toward building a convenient schoolhouse for the use of the poor children of this parish and to the former salary of  0l a year

tower noted by leland still remains being alnwick castle depiction of alnwick castle kept in good repair and now forming a part of the mansion house the church was rebuilt by the  st sir harry gray though he was not the patron  we now gained a sight of the town of  alnwick and as we approached from the northeast had a most pleasing prospect of the palace of the duke of northumberland  the castle of alnwick the situation is not naturally elegant the aspect being rather confined and the adjacent lands affording no original beauties the opposite hills rise tamely and are not yet brought into such order as to possess artificial graces enough to conceal the want of that variety and beauty which a traveller wishes to find surrounding so noble a palace the woody banks of the aln with all the wild romantic scenes which hang upon her borders are excluded from the prospect the castle stands upon a fine elevation rising gradually from the river whose open banks are turfed and kept in the most exact neatness under the gardeners scythe but withal possessing that trim countenance given by straight lines and angles level walks and slopes of a mechanical formality a garb in which nature does not look the most lovely the castle is a noble structure rebuilt on the old foundation and in the saxon style the architect has strictly preserved the whole modes and ornaments of the original the battlements are crowded with effigies according to the taste of the normans in whose time it underwent a principal reparation these represent men in the act of defense wielding such arms as were then used some of them are disposed with great propriety the guard of one of the gateways is in the attitude of casting down a mighty stone on the heads of assailants the building is of a beautiful freestone in chiseld work its form is singular being composed of a cluster of semicircular and angular bastions i cannot without the ichnography of the place give the reader a more competent idea of its figure than by comparing it to a section of the clustered saxon pillar in our cathedrals this edifice stands in a spacious area which at the time of its greatest strength i presume totally surrounded it defended by a complete circumvallation and a moat otherwise the principal part of the fortress would have lain unguarded by any outwork except a moat at present the front is opened to the northeast and the wall having towers at proper intervals shuts it in on the other quarters as we viewed the castle on our approach the walls with its towers formed a noble flanking to the principal structure to the southward the garden grounds appeared prettily disposed to the north and west the town of alnwick was seen spreading on the back ground we lamented the want of some of those fine woodlands and lofty gray rocks which impend over the aln above alnwick to give rural and romantic graces to objects so imperial if i may be permitted to use the expression in distinguishing this noble edifice  we passed over an elegant stone bridge on our approach to the town the battlements formed of interwoven crescents we found the inn crowded with people of fortune come from all parts of the county to pay their compliments to the duke and duchess her grace was living when the author made his tour and compiled this work he should think himself happy could he compose an eulogium equal to so eminent and illustrious a character it being their first public day after their arrival at this palace for the summer recess  the approach to the castle retains much of the solemn grandeur of ancient times the inscription on the gateway still legible esperance me comfort appertained to the arms of the percies and was placed there when the repairs were made by that family the moat is drained and the ceremony of letting down the drawbridge is forgot but the walls which enclose the area still wear the ancient countenance of strength and defiance you enter by a machicolated gate defended by an upper tower and after passing a covered way approach the interior gate which admits you to the area this entrance is defended by all the devices used in ancient times iron studded gates portcullis open galleries and apertures in the arching for annoying assailants the ingenious traveller mr pennant had been out of humor when he visited this place we met with all the inconveniences of a noisy and crowded inn with every awkward circumstance which could befall travelers who had undergone no little fatigue in pursuing the paths of pleasure and yet we could not submit to coincide with that gentlemans sentiments you look says he in vain for any marks of the grandeur of the feodal age for trophies won by a family eminent in our annals for military prowess and deeds of chivalry for halls hung with helms and hauberks or with the spoils of the chase for extensive forests and venerable oaks ye look in vain for the helmet on the tower the ancient signal of hospitality to the traveller or for the greyheaded porter to conduct him to the hall of entertainment the numerous train whose countenances give welcome to him on his way are now no more and instead of the disinterested usher of the old times he is attended by a valet eager to receive the fees of admittance i must beg leave to pronounce that though the savage ferocity of the feodal ages is taken away yet not the marks of grandeur we saw no miserable dungeons filled with captives no places of execution groaning under their execrable burden the towers remain but without the cry of captivity and torture hospitality clothed in princely array sits in the hall dispensing with a brow of benignity mixed with features of the highest magnificence gifts worthy her hand the duke and duchess are easy of access and of an affable deportment their visitants are happy under their smiles without being awed by their eminence the attention they pay to the petitions of dependents is marked with the greatest benevolence no vain promises are given to still importunity no hopes are flattered without sincerity  the strictest honor attends the most trivial actions a truly great principle distinguishes these noble personages amidst a happy liberality there is so exact a propriety and such perfect economy that no transaction passes in the household without a certain rule and singular regularity the innumerable charities they pour forth are bestowed with such admirable propriety that each person relieved at the gate brings a ticket as an authority to the officer for the dispensation of his lords bounty so that improper objects cannot deceive or crafty knaves obtain the portion assigned for the relief of the truly necessitous and meritorious object to enumerate acts of benevolence is inconsistent with my plan but some are so singularly worthy the worlds attention that i cannot resist the pleasure of relating a single transaction which on my hearing it brought tears of joy into my eyes  her grace returning from an airing in her chariot passed through the ranks of people in the gateways who attended to receive a daily distribution to the poor a widow oppressed with grievous necessity could not leave her domestic employment or her labor to attend with her ticket she entrusted it to her daughter a girl about seven years of age who took her parents place at the gate her grace observed this girl employed in knitting whilst all the rest of the indigent group sat with idle hands she sent a servant to bring the child to her who received the message with astonishment and apprehension she followed the messenger with trembling steps revolving in her mind the supposed offenses she had committed and looking with eyes swimming in tears on the illfated work she held in her hand as the cause of her graces displeasure pale with apprehension of reproof she approached the duchess confusion and dread were mixed upon her features whilst looks of timid innocence lived in her eyes her grace perceived the childs distress but conceived not the cause when the infant had recollected courage enough to give her the power of expression she began a faultering and fearful excuse for the supposed crime she had committed in knitting at the gate a smile of divine benevolence arose upon the duchesss countenance  simplicity and native innocence have great charms  she was won by the childs sensibility as well as by her industry the girl was taken from her indigent mother clothed and put to school where she is acquiring those accomplishments which one day will advance her above the rank of her humble progenitors  the inside of this palace is finished in a most splendid taste every thing to use mr pennants expression being completed with an incompatible elegance a particular account of suits of apartments finished and furnished in the highest manner would be tedious the rich variety is for the eye only the chief descriptions i will borrow from mr groses work to which gentleman i am bound to pay due acknowledgments for his elegant drawing from which the preceding plate was engraved by the ingenious artist mr bailey who was my fellowtraveller  a description of

repaired  alnwick castle contains about five acres of ground within its outer walls which are flanked with    towers and turrets that now afford a complete set of offices to the castle and maintain many of them their original names as well as their ancient use and destination  these are  i the great or outward gate of entrance anciently called the utter ward  ii the garner or aveners tower behind which are the stables coachhouses etc in all respects suitable to the magnitude and dignity of this great castle  iii the water tower containing the cistern or reservoir that supplies the castle and offices with water adjoining to this is the laundry etc  iv the caterers tower adjoining to which are the kitchens and all conveniences of that sort  behind the adjacent walls are concealed a complete set of offices and apartments for most of the principal officers and attendants in the castle together with a large hall or dining room to entertain the tenants at the audits with an office for the auditors housekeepers room and underneath these a servantshall with all other suitable conveniences  v the middle ward  vi the auditors tower  vii the guard house  viii the east garret  ix the records tower of which the lower story contains the evidence room or great repository of the archives of the barony over it is a circular apartment designed and executed with great taste and beauty for a banqueting room being    feet diameter and    feet   inches high  x the ravine tower or hotspurs chair between this and the round tower was formerly a large breach in the walls which for time immemorial had been called by the towns people the bloody gap  xi the constables tower which remains chiefly in its ancient state as a specimen how the castle itself was once fitted up  xii the postern tower or sally port the upper apartment now contains old armor arms etc the lower story has a small furnace and elaboratory for chemical or other experiments  xiii the armourers tower  xiv the falconers tower  xv the abbots tower so called either from its situation nearest to alnwick abbey or from its containing an apartment for the abbot of that monastery whenever he retired to the castle  xvi the west garret  the castle properly consists of three courts or divisions the entrance into which was defended with three strong massy gates called the utter ward the middle ward and the inner ward each of these gates was in a high embattled tower furnished with a portcullis and the outward gate with a drawbridge also they had each of them a porters lodge and a strong prison besides other necessary apartments for the constable bailiff and subordinate officers under each of the prisons was a deep and dark dungeon into which the more refractory prisoners were let down with cords and from which there was no exit but through the trap door in the floor above that of the inner ward is still remaining in all its original horrors  this castle like many others in the north was anciently ornamented with figures of warriors distributed round the battlements and therefore the present noble proprietors have allowed them to be continued and have supplied some that had been destroyed but to show what they once were and that this is no innovation they have retained the ancient ones though defaced which were placed on the top of the two octagon towers  from length of time and the shocks it has sustained in ancient wars this castle was become quite a ruin when by the death of algernon duke of somerset it devolved together with all the estates of this great barony etc to the present duke and duchess of northumberland who immediately set to repair the same and with the most consummate taste and judgment restored and embellished it as much as possible in the true gothic style so that it may deservedly be considered as one of the noblest and most magnificent models of a great baronial castle  nothing can be more striking than the effect at first entrance within the walls from the town when through a dark gloomy gateway of considerable length and depth the eye suddenly emerges into one of the most splendid scenes that can be imagined and is presented at once with the great body of the inner castle surrounded with fair semicircular towers finely swelling to the eye and gayly adorned with pinnacles figures battlements etc  the impression is still further strengthened by the successive entrance into the second and third courts through great massy towers till the stranger is landed in the inner court in the very center of this great citadel  here he enters to a most beautiful staircase of a very singular yet pleasing form expanding like a fan the cornice of the ceiling is enriched with a series of   0 escutcheons displaying the principal quarterings and intermarriages of the percy family the space occupied by this staircase is    feet long    feet   inches wide and    feet   inches high  the first room that presents to the left is the saloon which is a most beautiful apartment designed in the gayest and most elegant style of gothic architecture being    feet   inches long    feet   inches wide and    feet  0 inches high  to this succeeds the drawing room consisting of one large oval with a semicircular projection or bowwindow it is    feet   inches long    feet   inches wide and    feet high  hence the transition is very properly to the great dining room which was one of the first executed and is of the purest gothic with nitches and other ornaments that render it a very noble model of a great barons hall in this room was an irregularity in the form which has been managed with great skill and judgment and made productive of beauty and convenience this was a large bowwindow not in the center but toward the upper end which now affords a very agreeable recess when the family dine alone or for a second table at the great public dinners this room is    feet   inches long  0 feet  0 inches wide exclusive of the circular recess which is    feet in diameter and    feet   inches high  from the dining room the stranger may either descend into the court by a circular staircase or he is ushered into a very beautiful gothic apartment over the gateway commonly used for a breakfast or supperroom this is furnished with closets in the octagon towers and is connected with other private apartments it is    feet   inches long feet wide and    feet   inch high  hence the stranger is conducted into the library which is a very fine room in the form of a parallelogram properly fitted up for books and ornamented with stuccowork in a very rich gothic style being    feet long wide and    feet   inch high this apartment leads to  the chapel which fills all the upper space of the middle ward here the highest display of gothic ornaments in the greatest beauty has been very properly exhibited and the several parts of the chapel have been designed after the most perfect models of gothic excellence the great east window is taken from one of the finest in york minster the ceiling is borrowed from that of kings college in cambridge and the walls are painted after the great church in milan but the windows of painted glass will be in a style superior to any thing that has yet been attempted and worthy of the present more improved state of the arts exclusive of a beautiful circular recess for the family the chapel is  0 feet long    feet   inches wide and    feet high  returning from the chapel through the library and passing by another great staircase that fills an oval space    feet   inches long and    feet   inches wide we enter a passage or gallery which leads to two great statebed chambers each  0 feet long most nobly furnished with double dressing rooms closets and other conveniences all in the highest elegance and magnificence but as conformable as possible to the general style of the castle from these bedchambers the passage opens to the grand staircase by which we first entered and compleats a tour not easily to be paralleled  i must now turn my attention to the antiquity and history of this place  mr gross says it is believed to have been founded in the time of the romans although no part of the original structure is now remaining but when part of the dungeon or castle keep was taken down to be repaired some years ago under the present walls were discovered the foundations of other buildings which lay in a different direction from the present and some of the stones appeared to have roman mouldings the dungeon or keep of the present castle is believed to have been founded in the saxon times the zigzag fretwork round the arch that leads into the inner court is evidently of saxon architecture and yet this was probably not the most ancient entrance for under the flag tower before that part was taken down and rebuilt by the present duke was the appearance of a gateway that had been walled up directly fronting the present outward gateway into the town  the first

with a becoming dignity refused alleging if there was any dispute to his title it should be settled on the marches by men of both nations agreeable to the laws and customs established there the english monarch not consenting to such proposition malcolm returned in high displeasure and was not long before he showed his resentment by entering the borders with a powerful army accompanied by edward his son they laid waste the county of northumberland to the environs of alnwick and besieged the castle the most authentic account of the tragical events of this siege seems to be that given in the ancient chronicle of alnwick abbey of which a copy is preserved in the british museum mowbray a d  0   rex scottorum malcholmus and primogenitus ejus filius edwardus cum multis aliis in

stratagem he rode forth completely armed with the keys of the castle tied to the end of his spear and presented himself in a suppliant manner before the kings pavilion as being come to surrender the fortress malcolm advancing hastily without his armor received a mortal wound from the spearman who escaped by the fleetness of his horse and by swimming the river which was then flooded with rains the

the forfeitures of their estates under the determinations of the parliament of winchester john de vesey was one of them and having been deprived of his castle and barony of alnwick he entered into a combination with several others laboring under the same proscription for the recovery of their possessions vesey raised a sufficient force to gain his castle but prince edward coming against him with a strong body of forces reduced his garrison to such distress that he was obliged to surrender and submit himself to the princes mercy through whose intercession he received the royal pardon  in      this john de vesey was summoned to parliament in the   th year of king henry the thirds reign this was the glorious era in which our mode of parliaments was first settled and commons regularly admitted to a share in the legislative power he died in the   th year of the reign of king edward i and in the   th year of that reign a d      died william de vesey the last baron of that family who having no ligitimate issue but leaving a son born out of wedlock did by the kings license enfeof anthony beck bishop of durham and titular patriarch of jerusalem in the castle and barony of alnwick in trust for such natural son but this right reverend guardian got the infant deprived of his barony and as he acquired other royal favors also obtained a confirmation from the king of a sale made thereof to henry lord percy baron of topcliff and spofford in yorkshire an ancestor of the present illustrious family  mr gross says but from what authority he is not pleased to point out that the appointment of the infants guardians as also the very words of the deed of enfeofment now extant in which the conveyance is to the bishop absolute and unconditional confute a report too hastily taken up by some historians that this castle and barony were only given to the bishop in trust for william the bastard above mentioned and that he was guilty of a violation of this trust in disposing of them otherwise it would have been well if mr gross could have shown where this deed was to be seen as it would in some measure have exonerated the bishops memory of this infamous charge and would have set historians right for the future rymer iii          authorizes the contrary determination i do not remember an instrument of that antiquity which contains an express trust but where a trust was premised it was merely confidential or expressed in some separate deed trusts were introduced by the lawmen to evade the statute of uses made in the reign of king henry viii and from that period gained their legal acceptance  the castle and barony of alnwick continued in the bishops possession    years gross before he granted them to lord percy the bishops deed bears date the   th of nov   0  and does not indeed wear the countenance of an obscure transaction for the witnesses to it were some of the greatest personages in the kingdom viz henry lacy earl of lincoln robert de umfreville earl of angus robert lord clifford etc the grant was afterward confirmed by the king at sheene   d jan    0 to h percy and his sons who mr gross says to remove every pretense of complaint obtained a release of all right and title to the inheritance from the heir at law sir gilbert de aton knt who was the nearest legitimate relation to the lord william de vesey above mentioned i must confess mr

raised for her service into england breze landed on the northumberland coast with about  00 men at arms he possessed the castle of alnwick which was soon after besieged by lord hastings sir ralph gray and sir john howard the garrison was reduced to great distress when george douglas earl of angus influenced to this service by great promises from margaret advanced unexpectedly to the besiegers with  0000 horsemen and making such maneuvers as induced the english army to apprehend he meant to attack them whilst they were forming themselves in order of battle he brought a strong party up to the postern gate to whom the garrison made a sally and being mounted on horses brought for that purpose or behind the armed horsemen the small garrison evacuated the fortress being only  00 in number and fled without bloodshed it is believed the garrison before they retired endeavored to destroy all the arms and ammunition they could not carry off for a few years ago on opening the principal well in

this battle is particularly mentioned with some singular circumstances not noted in the account given thereof page  0 etc in this vol  the most material are that the scots army was flanked on one hand by woodlands the defiles of which would greatly impede the english horse that the scotch army before engaging kneeled down to prayers which suppliant posture the english apprehended was to denote their submission and that they begged their lives a conceit in the author as improbable as ridiculous no credulity or confidence in the authority could reconcile so simple a tale to common sense that after the english army were put to the rout gloucester attended by his military tennants made a desperate effort to retrieve the lost honors of the day in which he fell that on the day of the general engagement robert bruce being attacked by sir henry boynton slew him with a battle ax which was a signal to the scotch army for the onset these are material variances from the relations of other

family live all the heroic virtues of their ancestors i must give a place to the following oration spoken at guildhall westminster by the reverend mr bennet on tuesday july the  0th      on placing the picture of earl percy in the council chamber of that hall  gentlemen notwithstanding your worthy chairman has so fully expatiated on the cause of this cheerful and respectable meeting i feel myself animated not less from inclination than duty to offer a few words with your permission on the present occasion  public virtues and singular acts of greatness have ever kindled in the mind of man an ardent desire of beholding the persons or representations of those in whom they shone hence examples of great and generous actions have been continually handed down to posterity for their imitation and incitement to glory  hence caesar  hence cato live and their virtues remain unsullied by the grave amidst the rust of time  rome had its heroes  britain boasts of hers and when percy is no more that picture shall record his deeds  at a time when the supreme legislative authority of parliament over the whole british empire was called in question at a time when discord disobedience nay rebellion itself prevailed in america  at a time when dissipation and every species of luxury pervaded this great nation and its direful influence was visibly increasing  earl percy disdaining every consideration that was unconnected with the common weal boldly stood forth a champion for his country a friend to his king and enemy to those who had fallen from their duty  it was not wealth gentlemen that could urge him to so dangerous an undertaking  fortune had placed him above the pursuit of it  it could not be ambition for rank and titles were already his own  but it was public spirit that called him forth  for he had all to lose but nothing to gain  nothing but the true interest of his country to acquire he gave up his own safety he made a sacrifice of every thing  pleasures profit and interest  all were subservient to the common good  without flattery gentlemen i may assert rome would have gloried in such a real patriot rome would have rejoiced to have seen one of their nobility so strenuous in their countrys cause  but this was not all and what i have said would bear but little resemblance to that great man were i not to take notice of his unbounded humanity as well as public spirit  his tenderness in a time of the greatest calamity his readiness in sharing whatever his ample fortune afforded him with the common soldier the widow and the orphan has raised his name almost above the reach of praise  great as his own distress was he overlooked it in commiserating and relieving that of others indeed every humane and generous feature of the noble duke his father are clearly seen in the actions of the son  but it is not to be wondered at gentlemen that humanity generosity and magnificence should shine forth with so much luster in the noble earl when they are the acknowledged characteristics of the house of northumberland   the town of alnwick alnwick alnewick or alnewicke in saxon  implying a town of two fathoms length in the deanery of alnwick and in coquetdale ward  randals manuscripts from the manuscripts of roger gale esquire extract of a letter from mr gale to sir john clerk   th june      i had lately an account from alnwick of some brass weapons found there by a mason as he was clearing the earth from a rock about a mile n w from that place within the old park to get up some stone after having dug about half a yard deep in the ground he came to  0 sword blades and    spear heads lying close to the top of the rock without any case or cover than the soil the swords were exactly of the same shape as those in the   st plate of mr gordons book no     and    or    inches long some of the spears resembled   and   in the same but others were broader and cut through as in the margin digging about a foot lower on the hill side he found    brass wedges or chizzels with a ring near their thicker end of which i doubt not but you have seen many and so need not give you any description of them but that they are not unlike no   in mr gordons  0th plate how and for what they were used i will not take upon me to determine absolutely but by their edges which are much broken and battered they seem to have been employed as chizzels for cutting stone i believe they put a wooden shaft in the hollow end of them and so drove them with a mallet sir laurences system of agriculture and gardening where he mentions some of these found in the small joints and vices of the stone in a quatry near bishop weremouth which is no weak confirmation of my conjecture if the softness of the metal and consequently its unfitness for such work is objected i answer that when they had not a harder necessity would compel them to use such as they had besides most sorts of stone are so soft when they lie bedded in and at their first coming out of the quarry that they might make a very good shift to cut it and cleave it with their tools while it was under those easy circumstances to which i may add that these brass chizzels are of a much harder temper than we know how to give that metal as are also their swords which are made of it and other weapons  the shaft when not employed might be drawn out of the chizzel and by running a string

bushel of them were found at cave upon the banks of the humber in yorkshire under a little tumulus by the highway side and what is very remarkable every one of them was enclosed in a matrix of the same metal or case fitting it so exactly that it seemed to be cast in it and so fresh and whole were the edges of them all as if they had never been used  a little above the place where the swords and spears were buried at alnwick was deeply and rudely cut in the rock      but i cannot think these figures had any relation to what was sound below i have had the good fortune to get a sword and spear and   chizzels the sword spear head and   of the chissels i presented to my lord hrtford for a crown piece the rest were seized by the duke of somersets steward upon pretense of securing them for his grace but were never sent to him so many of these brass chizzels have been found in this island and so few any where else and those only in france that they seem almost to have been the peculiar tools of the britons their near alliance and intercourse with the gauls easily accounting why they have been sometimes discovered in the ancient seat of the latter the swords and spear heads aforementioned being found so near these chizzels and of the very same metal is an argument that they belonged to the same people which i cannot think to have been romans who as i formerly ventured to give you my opinion seem to have left off the use of brass in their weapons before their arrival in this island the word ferrum much earlier than that time denoted in their authors all manner of military weapons and was a general name for them which i think is some additional strength to my former arguments on that subject  i am etc r gale   sir john clerks answer   th aug      i return you thanks for the account you sent me of the antiquities found at alnwick their number surprised me much some of the same kind have been found here in cairns nothing in antiquity is more mysterious than the use of these instruments of brass which resemble small hatchets or chissels i incline to think them warlike instruments as we generally take the stone hatchets to be i have   or   of both kinds when they came first into my hands i set about reading such accounts as had been given of them and found that one mr hearne had taken a good deal of pains to prove they were roman his dissertation is printed in motts collection of the transactions of the royal society v   part   p  0 but i cannot be of that gentlemans opinion the romans understood better the expeditious ways of doing things than to make use of such slight and brittle tools we must then ascribe them to the ancient britons who used instruments of brass before iron came to take place what makes me judge they were not chissels is that the britons made very little use of hewn the stones at stonehenge are hewn stone and for that reason little or nothing of their stone monuments does remain it is indeed probable they made use of them for repairing their highways for all such instruments found here were in cairns cairus are burying places and therefore usually situated near highways so that the finding these tools near highways is merely accidental  r g situated near these ways and those in my possession have induced me to think that our great highways in britain were not roman but british how then were they warlike instruments  i am glad you have got one of the swords i wish i knew how to get one of the same kind from the duke of somerset  i am etc john clerk    is irregular being built on the declivities of a hill in

is his graces benevolence to the public that the eye of the curious is not excluded from those beautiful scenes the way to huln forms one of the sweetest and most romantic rides in the county where nature has left the lands open art has happily disposed her works with the justest taste to supply the vacancy the entrance is by a steep descent to the vale through which the river winds its course the road by traversing the hills obliquely renders the way easy to the passenger it is clothed on each hand with plantations of various kinds of forest trees mingled with great judgment and so disposed that the pines and evergreens give an agreeable variegation of color in the foliage without deadening the scene nothing can be more gloomy than longextended lines of dusky firs which as the poet mason justly observes blot the horizon these plantations are bordered on each side of the road with a variety of flowering shrubs and tufts of flowers after passing this agreeable grove by irregular windings we descended into a plain washed by the solemn stream of sleepy aln which scarce appears to flow so dull it seems in this romantic valley shut in on every hand by lofty eminences covered with wood forming a spacious theater near two miles in circuit on the right hand the river forms a semicircle the opposite shore composed of shaken and perpendicular rocks over whose brink impends a forest of oaks rising shade above shade up to the crown of the mountains as the aln passes away from this sweet vale and glides from under the feet of those romantic rocks she does not even yield a murmur or a sigh except where constrained by some artificial wears she turns over with indolence and falls again to sleep on the succeeding lake  after passing this plain the vale grows narrow the hills and woods are loftier and the river here and there frets over a few pebbles which impede her passage here is every sylvan beauty here we tasted enjoyment of all the pleasures of a woody scene  the richness of the forest hues the deep shadow and the refreshing breeze perfumed by woodbine  together with that solemnity and stillness which sooth the contemplative mind  as we winded through this deep valley the prospect at length opened upon the site of huln abbey on the left hand the landscape was abruptly closed with rugged mountains of naked white rocks opposed to which on the right on a grassy eminence stand the remains of the monastery humbly mourning in the lowly garb of solitude and bending down in ruins over which a tower of the percys bears the melancholy air of unavailing defense and overlooks the mouldering walls with an aspect of despondency in its inability to shield off the strokes of time and devastation we ascended to the summit of the hill and being possessed of the keys by which alone we could have had access to these retreats we flattered ourselves no obstacle could arise that might deprive us of the sight of the ruins of this religious house and every thing curious there but the whole is enclosed with a lofty wall the interior ground being disposed in gardening we found the keeper of this place a little man of a mean and insolent aspect he heard our request with the door in his hand after which with a contemptuous silence he walked in and turned the key against us as if he was afraid we should discover some theft he was committing against his lord thus excluded and looking ridiculous enough we could do nothing more than ride round the walls by which we observed that the ruins chiefly consisted of a small chapel wanting little besides a roof the tower a square building with exploratory turrets at each corner is in good repair fitted up as a pleasure room commanding a beautiful prospect as we could sufficiently judge from our lower situation  the view from this eminence into the vale which we had passed was singularly beautiful the ragged rocky and barren mountain which now lay on our right afforded a bold contrast to the hanging forests and the planted eminences which intersected the winding valley the aln was seen in meanders down the nearer and narrow dell and in the extended distant plain the waters formed a fine lucid crescent the canal being then happily touched by the suns beams the heights clothed with oaks the lower hills girt with plantations of various hues the bold rocks pushing forth their fronts

barons who went to the holy wars in the reign of king henry iii were william de vesey lord of alnwick and richard gray two eminent chieftains in the christian army led by curiosity or devotion they went to visit the monks of mount carmel and there unexpectedly found a countryman of their own one ralph fresborn a northumberlandman who had distinguished himself in a former crusade and in consequence of a vow had afterward taken upon him the monastic profession in that solitude when vesey and gray returned to england they strongly importuned the superior of the carmelites to let their countryman accompany them home which was at length granted upon condition that they would found a monastery for carmelites in their own country soon after their return fresborn mindful of their engagement began to look out for a place for their convent after examining all the circumjacent solitudes he at length fixed upon the present spot induced it is said by the great resemblance which the adjoining hill bore to mount carmel and indeed whoever looks into maundrils travels will find that the draught of that mountain given in his book bears a strong likeness to this before us  the above william de vesey gave a grant of the ground consisting of twelve or thirteen acres in his park of holne but fresborn is said to have erected the building himself the foundation was laid about a d    0 and fresborn gathering a proper number of monks became the first abbot of the order and having presided here with great reputation of sanctity at length died and was buried in the monastery about the year       the original grant of william de vesey was confirmed by his successors veseys and by the percies after their becoming proprietors of alnwick many additional privileges and immunities were added by the succeeding grants particularised in mr groses work but too tedious to take place except only such as are singularly curious following  also all wild bees with their fruits of honey and wax found in walse and in holne as well in the park as in the forest for the perpetual support of the light in their church with a provision against the said friars being defrauded of the said bees

of much more modern date than the foundation of the house this tower is not square but oblong having an exploratory turret on each corner the north side is ornamented with a nich canopyd capable of receiving a statue five feet high most probable it contained the effigies of the dedicatory virgin beneath is a figure of an angel in relief with expanded wings over this entrance are shields of arms a cross supposed to be the arms of the veseys and a cross molin on the south side in a nich is the figure of one of the religious of the order of white friars of premonstratenses in his proper habilament in pretty good preservation this front is ornamented with shields of arms the arms of brabant adopted by the percys with the arms of lucys quarterly the principal and also the arms of vesey  a gate opens to the east on each side of which are the figures of cherubs supporting armorial shields on this front is also a canopy and nich for a statue here are the arms of brabant and the arms of lucys on separate shields at this entrance as also on the north side were machicolations and in the center of the arching of the gateway is a square aperture from whence the possessors could annoy assailants the masonry of this tower is excellent the gates of lattice braced with iron still remain  above the gate going into the court of the house is an escutcheon of white marble much injured by the weather but retaining some marks of the sculptor to distinguish that it once contained the crest of the doubledays an arm in armor suspending a mullet the antiquity of this piece has been much doubted but the materials determine that point clearly  this seat of the doubleday family has nothing very singular to mark it but the beauty of the retirement under the hanging woods of the river aln the ground plot of the religious house is now included in the orchard the ruins of which probably afforded materials for the present mansion but there are not the least remains to denote the exact site of the monastic buildings or the place of interment of the illustrious personages before mentioned  solemn situations like this and the ruins of religious houses always affect my mind with a degree of languishment such a seclusion such a retirement would have filled my wish the life of the ecclesiastic is most desirable and seems calculated to be the happiest no natural tendency to indolence and ease prompts this determination but the serenity of a churchmans life under the entire preclusion of all worldly concerns affords that tranquillity of mind so necessary to contemplation

merchandise from holland near the sea on an eminence are the remains of a church in the form of a cross when this edifice was destroyed or by whom is not known the churchyard is still used for sepulture in the banks as washed away by the violence of the sea have frequently been discovered bones of an enormous size ignorant spectators have retained the circumstance without distinguishing of what animals these were the remains and being found near a place of human interment they are at once conceived to have belonged to men of gigantick stature the constant warfare that distressed these shores for ages might occasion the slaughter of vast numbers of horses and other beasts which after a day of havoc may have been thrown into one common pit the remains of elephants have been

leading to the church which is an elegant structure whose spire is upwards  00 feet high the other to the bridge where is an ancient tower contiguous to the bridge is a large freestone quarry the stones of which are so much esteemed that great quantities thereof are shipped for london the salmon fishery here is carried to a very great extent so that at the mouth of the coquet in the summer season as well as in the river itself are some thousands caught which gives employment to a number of hands the river which almost surrounds the town directs its course in a straight line for about half a mile then leaving the fine and pleasant villas of glosterhill and amble on its southern banks while it loses itself in the ocean in the year      it left its old course and forced its way between two sandy hills overgrown with bent that had obstructed its passage for ages and is now settled in a very deep channel with a fine clay bottom which makes it navigable for small craft it is said there is upwards of    feet of water upon the bar at full sea and continues that depth very near the town so that with a little assistance of art it might be made to admit ships of a considerable burden and as coquet island is situated a little to the southward forms a fine bay at the very mouth of the river the grounds adjoining thereto abound with a fine seam of coal and so plentiful is corn that few counties can equal its fertility from these considerations what pity it is that warkworth was not made a seaport since nature has almost half finished the design  this little borough is

northumberland and as the town consists all of free burgesses is capable of great improvements john fitz robert in   king henry iii obtained license that the market which had been usually kept upon the sunday at his manor of werkworth should be held upon the wednesday every week  dugd baron v   p  0    the castle stands on the crown of a rock of an oblong figure the great tower to the north placed on the brink of the cliff above the town is of fine architecture in chiselwork of a singular figure being octangular and from the center of four opposite sides a turret projects of a semihexagonal form from the middle of the building a very lofty exploratory turret arises this part of the castle owes its origin to the percys as appears by the lion of brabant above the gate and the arms dispersed over the building the western side is formed of various irregular towers and walling of different ages extending along the brink of the cliff whose foot is washed by the river coquet on the south the ground rises gradually to the height of the rocks on which the western buildings are founded this side of the castle fronts to a spacious plain or platform and is defended by a high wall with an outward moat the ancient gateway and chief entrance to the castle is on this side the gate defended by circular towers and a draw bridge the eastern side is placed on the brink of a steep declivity defended by an outward moat and a lofty wall guarded by a square bastion near the center and an angular tower at the south point the walls enclose a spacious area almost square within which the ancient parts of the fortress are very ruinous  the view from hence is so extensive and various that description can carry but a very imperfect idea of its members or its beauties to the east and northeast there is a sea prospect with which you take in all the shore we had traversed with dunstanbrough and bambrough castles at the most distant point of land the farn islands lie scattered like patches on the face of the waters the port of alemouth is a nearer object and at a little distance the mouth of the river coquet and coquet island with its ruined monastery are seen to the north you view a rich cultivated country to alnwick westward the banks of coquet river graced with little woodlands which here and there impend on its winding channel to the south you view an extensive plain inclining toward the sea crowded with villages and interspersed with woods the shore indented by many little ports and creeks the higher grounds are scattered over with innumerable hamlets churches and other buildings mingling with a variety highly pleasing whilst on the extreme distance the different teints of the landscape arising from various objects require colors to convey their picture to the mind  mr gross who has given two views of this castle in his excellent work says nothing can be more magnificent and picturesque from what part soever it is viewed and though when entire it was far from being destitute of strength yet its appearance does not excite the idea of one of those rugged fortresses destined solely for war whose gloomy towers suggest to the imagination only dungeons chains and executions but rather that of such an ancient hospitable mansion as is alluded to by milton where throngs of knights and barons bold in weeds of peace high triumphs hold   the castle and mote according to an ancient survey contained   acres    perches of ground its walls on the south east and west sides are garnished with towers the great gate of the castle is on the south side between two polygonal towers and is also defended with machicolations  the keep or dungeon forms the north front its figure is a square with the angles canted off near the middle of each face of this square there is a turret projecting at right angles its end terminating in a semihexagon these projections are of the same height as the rest of the keep this keep is very large and lofty and contains a variety of magnificent apartments  mr gross gives the copy of a survey taken of this castle in      of which some extracts may be pertinent here the buyldinge of the said castle on the sowth part is three towers viz the gatehouse tower in the middle thereof which is the entrye at a draw bridge over dry moyte and in the same toure is a prison and porter lodge and over the same a fare lodging called the constables lodgings and in the curtayne is a fair and comely building a chapel and diverse houses of office and above the great chamber and the lords lodginge on the west side the posterne tower and the old hall which was very fare at the entrye into the hall for the porche thereof is raised a little square tower wherein is two chambres and on the foresyd in stone portrayed a lion very workmanly wrought and therefore called the lion tower in the east side of the great hall was an i will set out with pyllers which yet stands the doungion is in the north part of the scyte of the said castle set upon a little mount highyer than the rest of the cowrte steps of a greas before ye enter to yt and the same is buyld as a four square and out of every square one tower all which be so quarterly squared together that in the sight every part appears five towers very finely wrought of masonwork and in the same contained as well a fair hall kytchinge and all other houses of offices very fare and apteley placed as also great chamber chapel and lodgings for the lord and his trayn the castle is envyroned on three parts with the said ryver and of the north part in an angle within the said water is situate a town called the borough of warkworth and the parish church etc  warkworth was formerly the barony of roger fitz richard who held it by the service of one knights fee of the grant of king henry ii he married eleanor one of the daughters and coheiresses of henry de essex baron of raleigh and clavering the name of clavering is derived from the barony of clavering in essex  by the testa de nevill it appears that robert the son of roger held of the king in capite by the service of one knights fee the barony of warkworth with its appurtenances and roger the son of richard held the same barony by like service from the time of king henry the father of king john who gave it to him in fee  john de clavering was summoned to parliamant as baron warkworth and clavering   th king edward i  d king edward iii and the  th king edward iii   it continued in this family for several successive generations john in obedience to king edward i by his command took upon him the surname of clavering in consideration of certain grants of lands in the southern counties he made over to king edward ii the reversion in fee of his barony and castle of warkworth and also rothbury corbridge and newburn which by a reversionary grant to henry lord percy now are become part of the possessions of his grace the duke of northumberland provided he should die without issue male this reversion king edward iii granted to henry lord percy from whom these possessions have descended to the present duke of northumberland  the church is a handsome building ornamented with a spire the inside very neat there is a monument with the recumbent effigy of a knight templar with an inscription intimating that the personage there interred was sir hugh de morwick who gave the common to the town of warkworth  in a window of one of the ailes is painted the figures of st hilda and an attendant female  leland says warkworth was much resorted to by merchants at present there is no navigation on the coquet though it is said to be practicable to bring up small craft to the bridge the town is entitled to a weekly market on thursday and three annual fairs on the thursdays preceding st georges st lawrences and st martins days  we passed up the river coquet about three quarters of a mile to the  hermitage at warkworth depiction of warkworth hermitage hermitage the approach is kept in neat order but still retains its original form a narrow walk on the brink of the river which at this place flows without any troubled current leads to the door of the hermitage the poem of the hermit of warkworth to which i shall have frequent occasion to resort in the following description opens thus dark was the night and wild the storm and loud the torrents roar and loud the sea was heard to dash against the distant shore musing on mans weak hapless state the lonely hermit lay when lo he heard a female voice lament in sore dismay with hospitable haste he rose and waked his sleeping fire and snatching up a lighted brand forth hied the reverend fire this short extract will show the poets mode of introductions he then leads on the personages to whom the hermit relates his tale  ah seldom had their host i ween beheld so sweet a pair the youth was tall with manly bloom she slender soft and fair       first tell me father said the youth nor blame mine eager tongue what town is here what lands are these and to what lord belong alas my son the hermit said why do i live to say the rightful lord of these domains is banished far away ten winters now have shed their snows on this my lowly hall since valiant hotspur so the north our youthful lord did call against fourth henry bolingbrook led up his northern powers and stoutly fighting lost his life near proud salopias towers one son he left a lovely boy his countrys hope and heir and oh to save him from his foes it was his grandsires care in scotland safe he placed the child beyond the reach of strife nor long before the brave old earl at bramham lost his life and now the percy name so long our northern pride and boast lies hid alas beneath a cloud their honors rest and lost no chieftain of that noble house now leads our youth to arms the bordering scots despoil our fields and ravage all our farms their halls and castles once so fair now moulder in decay proud strangers now usurp their lands and bear their wealth away not far from hence where yon full stream runs winding down the lea fair warkworth lifts her lofty towers and overlooks the sea the towers alas now stand forlorn with noisome weads oerspread where feasted lords and courtly dames and where the poor were fed meantime far off mid scottish hills the percy lives unknown on strangers bounty he depends and may not claim his own o might i with these aged eyes but live to see him here the should my soul depart in bliss he said and dropped a tear and is the percy still so loved of all his friends and thee then bless me father said the youth for i thy guest am he silent he gazed then turned aside to wipe the tears he shed and lifting up his hands and eyes poured blessings on his head       but who may this young lady be that is so wondrous fair       then up and down in hunters garb i wandered as in chase till in the noble nevills house raby castle  i gained a hunters place some time with him i lived unknown till i would the hap so rare to please this young and gentle dame that barons daughter fair       this evening as the night drew on fearing we were pursued we turned adown the right hand path and gained this lonely wood then lighting from our weary steeds to shun the pelting shower we met thy kind conducting hand and reached this friendly bower  lofty perpendicular rocks on the other hand confining the walk to about the width of four feet from the summit of the cliffs a grove of oaks is suspended giving a solemn shade and at their feet issues a spring of the purest water which formerly supplied the recluse the steps vestibule and chief apartments of the hermitage are hewn out of the bosom of a freestone rock whose outside face is about  0 feet high embowered with stately trees which impend from the top of the precipice and fissures of the cliffs one lower and outward apartment is of masonry we entered into this lower apartment by a passage of three paces the doorway marked with the remains of bolts and iron hinges it is built up against the side of the rock about    feet square and appears to have been the kitchen or principal dwelling having a range or fireplace six feet wide on the south side of this apartment opposite to our entrance is a doorway leading to an outward seat formed in the rock and opening upon the walk on the rivers brink on this side of the room are two windows which bear the marks of irongrating and also a closet by holes cut in the rock it seems as if timbers had been lodged therein for the flooring of an upper chamber this structure is built of ashlerwork and appeared to us of much more modern date than the cells formed in the rock passing from this outward building the way we entered we ascended by    steps to a little vestibule with a seat on each side capable of holding one person only above the inner doorway some letters appear the remains of a phrase which may be thus rendered in english my tears have been my food day and night from thence we entered the principal apartment or chapel about    feet in length and not more than seven feet and an half wide and of the same height two pilasters of semihexagonal form project from the opposite walls in the center and one from each corner from whence spring the intersecting groins of the roof the joinings ornamented with roses the pilasters have plain capitals and bases in the old gothic style all the work is chiselled and done with mechanic exactness and regularity the wall or outside rock as you enter is left so thick as to admit the vestibule before described at the east end is an altar formed cross the whole apartment ascended by two steps the upper plane edged with a moulding in the center of the wall behind is a nich for a crucifix or image with the remains of a glory on the right hand as you approach the altar cut out of the thickness of the wall is a nich or cavity like those often described in the progress of this work left in the walls of the ailes of churches within which there is represented a table monument no chink or cavity appearing to give a supposition that it is hollowed to receive any human remains with a recumbent female figure mr walliss description is in the following words in the fool of a window at the south end of the altar is the effigies of the blessed virgin sculptured in stone recumbent another of the child jesus on her right hand standing his left rested upon her shoulder at her feet in a nich in the wall is the effigies of an hermit in the attitude of prayer mr wallis is in an error here for the female recumbent figure having its head toward the east lays with the right hand to the chapel if any figure has stood on the side of the effigies it must have been against the pillar which divides the windows there is an absurdity in the idea of the boy jesus standing over the tomb of the virgin mary that need not be dwelt upon the hands and arms of which appear to have been elivated light is admitted by two small windows behind on the pillar which divides the windows are the remains of some sculpture supposed by many to be that of an hovering cherub but with the utmost attention and a strong desire to coincide with others i could not see any such figure even with an eye prejudiced by such prepossessions and now attended by their host the hermitage they viewed deep hewn within a craggy cliff and overhung with wood and near a flight of shapely steps all cut with nicest skill and piercing through a stony arch ran winding up the hill there decked with many a flower and herb his little garden stands with fruitful trees in shady rows all planted by his hands then scoopd within the solid rock three sacred vaults he shows the chief a chapel neatly arched on branching columns rose each proper ornament was there that should a chapel grace the latice for confession framed and holy water vase over either door a sacred text invites to godly fear and in a little scutcheon hung the cross and crown and spear up to the altars ample breadth two easy steps ascend and near a glimmering solemn light two wellwrought windows lend beside the altar rose a tomb all in the living stone on which a young and beauteous maid in goodly sculpture shone a kneeling angel fairly carved leaned hovering over her breast a weeping warrior at her feet and near to these her crest this is a bulls head the crest of the widdrington family all the figures etc here described are still visible only somewhat effaced with length of time   if it has ever been the representation of any figure and now wasted by the weather beating through the windows i conceive it was that of a child standing in a weeping attitude over the recumbent effigies at the foot of the recumbent effigies is a basin cut for holy water and the feet of the effigies rest against an animal most likely a dog as an emblem of fidelity as is usual on monuments of the like form i pay great deference to the opinions of other visitants but cannot agree with the author of the poem that this is a bulls head or the usual place for crests on the contrary according to the virtues of the deceased ancient tombs are decorated with an animal at the foot of the effigies as a lion for fortitude a dog for fidelity etc and this same figure appeared to me no other than that of a crouching dog as is to be seen on multitudes of ancient tombs the usual place of the crest on tombs is under the head of the effigies the examples in the northern counties are most likely to point out to us the prevailing fashion the bulls head is in that position on the tombs of the family of nevils in brancepeth and staindrop churches in the county of durham and a dog lays at the feet the same on the fine tomb of ogle in bothal church and also the rams head on the elegant tomb of gray at chillingham with many other instances in northumberland under the head of the effigies no crest appears a double cushion is the support by length of time and the weather beating through the windows the figures are greatly injured in a nich at the foot of the monument and cut in the wall is the figure of an hermit on his knees resting his head on his right hand and his left hand placed on his bosom as in a lamenting or pensive posture the author of the poem has racked invention to conceive a cause for our hermits vow of severity and retirement  the cliff the vault but chief the tomb attract the wandering pair eager they ask what hapless dame lies sculptured here so fair the hermit sighed the hermit wept for sorrow scarce could speak at length he wiped the trickling tears that all bedewed his cheek alas my children human life is but a vale of woe and very mournful is the tale which you so fain would know young lord thy grandsire had a friend in days of youthful fame yon distant hills were his domains sir bertram from the advertisement to the poem  about a mile from the castle in a deep romantic valley are the remains of a hermitage of which the chapel is still entire this is hollowed with great elegance in a cliff near the river as are also two adjoining apartments which probably served for the sacristy and vestry or were appropriated to some other sacred uses for the former of these which runs parallel with the chapel appears to have had an alter in it at which mass was occasionly celebrated as well as in the chapel itself  each of these apartments is extremely small for that which was the principal chapel does not in length exceed    feet nor is more than   feet in breadth and height it is however very beautifully designed and executed in the solid rock and has all the decorations of a complete gothic church or cathedral in miniature  but what principally distinguishes the chapel is a small tomb or monument on the south side of the altar on the top of which lies a female figure extended in the manner that effigies are usually exhibited praying on ancient tombs this figure which is very delicately designed some have ignorantly called an image of the virgin mary though it has not the least resemblance to the manner in which she is represented in the romish churches who is usually erect as the object of adoration and never in a prostrate or recumbent posture indeed the real image of the blessed virgin probably stood in a small nich still visible behind the altar whereas the figure of a bulls head which is rudely carved at this ladys feet the usual place for the crest in old monuments plainly proves her to have been a very different personage  about the tomb are several other figures which as well as the principal one above mentioned are cut in the natural rock in the same manner as the little chapel itself with all its ornaments and the two adjoining apartments what slight traditions are scattered through the country concerning the origin and foundation of this hermitage tomb etc are delivered to the reader in the following rhimes  it is universally agreed that the founder was one of the bertram family which had once considerable possessions in northumberland and were anciently lords of bothal castle situate about ten miles from warkworth he has been thought to be the same bertram that endowed brinkburn priory and built brenkshaw chapel which both stand in the same winding valley higher up the river  but brinkburn priory was founded in the reign of king henry i whereas the form of the gothic windows in this chapel especially of those near the altar is found rather to resemble the style of architecture that prevailed about the reign of king edward iii and indeed that the sculpture in this chapel cannot be much older appears from the crest which is placed at the ladys feet on the tomb for camden informs us that armorial crests did not become hereditary till about the reign of king edward ii   was his name where ever the noble percy fought his friend was at his side and many a skirmish with the scots their early valor tried fair widdrington the maidens name yon towrs her dewlling place her sire an old northumbrian chief devoted to thy race many a lord and many a knight to this fair damsel came but bertram was her only choice for him she felt a flame lord percy pleaded for his friend her father soon consents none but the beauteous maid herself his wishes now prevents         when lo a damsel young and fair stepped forward through the hall she bertram courteously addressed and kneeling on her knee sir knight the lady of thy love has sent this gift to thee then forth she drew a glittering helm well plated many a fold the casque was wrought of tempered steel the crest of burnished gold sir knight thy lady sends thee this and yields to be thy bride when thou have proved this maiden gift where sharpest blows are tried young bertram took the shining helm and thrice he kissed the same trust me i will prove this precious casque with deeds of noblest fame lord percy and his barons bold then fixed upon a day to scour the marches late oppressed and scottish wrongs repay         now closing fast on every side they hem sir bertram round but dauntless he repels their rage and deals forth many a wound the vigor of his single arm had well nigh won the field when ponderous fell a scottish ax and clove his lifted shield another blow his temples took and reft his helm in twain that beauteous helm his ladys gift his blood bedewed the plain lord percy saw his champion fall amid the unequal fight and now my noble friends he said let us save this gallant knight then rushing in with stretched out shield he over the warrior hung as some fierce eagle spreads her wing to guard her callow young         all pale extended on their shields and weltring in his gore lord percys knights their bleeding friend to warks fair castle bore         all day over moss and moor they rode by many a lonely tower and twas the dewfall of the night ere they drew near her bower         six days young knight are past and gone since she set out to thee and sure if no sad harm had happd long since thou would her see for when she heard thy grievous chance she tore her hair and cried alas i have slain the comeliest knight all through my folly and pride         then mounted she her milkwhite steed one morn at break of day and two tall yeomen went with her to guard her on the way sad terror smote sir bertrams heart and grief overwhelmed his mind trust me said he i never will rest till i my lady find         now brother well our ways divide over scottish hills to range do thou go north and i will go west and all our dress well change         one day as he sat under a thorn all sunk in deep despair an aged pilgrim passed him by who marked his face of care         cheer up my son perchance he said some tidings i may bear for often when human hopes have failed then heavenly comforts near behind yon hills so steep and high down in a lowly glen there stands a castle fair and strong far from the abode of men as late i chanced to crave an alms about this evening hour methought i heard a ladys voice lamenting in the tower        these tidings caught sir bertrams ear he thanked him for his tale and soon he hasted over the hills and soon he reached the vale         all day he sits beside the gate and pipes both loud and clear all night he watches round the walls in hopes his love to hear the first night as he silent watched all at the midnight hour he plainly heard his ladys voice lamenting in the tower the second night the moon shone clear and gilt the spangled dew he saw his lady through the grate but twas a transient view the third night wearied out he slept till near the morning tide when starting up he seized his sword and to the castle heyd when lo he saw a ladder of ropes depending from the wall and over the moat was newly laid a poplar strong and tall and soon he saw his love descend wrapped in a tartan played assisted by a sturdy youth in highland garb then clad amazed confounded at the sight he lay unseen and still and soon he saw them cross the stream and mount the neighboring hill unknown unheard of all within the youthful couple fly but what can scape the lovers ken or shun his piercing eye with silent step he follows close behind the flying pair and saw her hang upon his arm with fond familiar air thanks gentle youth she often said my thanks thou well have won for me what wiles have thou contrived for me what dangers run and ever shall my grateful heart thy services repay sir bertram could not further hear but cried vile traitor stay vile traitor yield that lady up and quick his sword he drew the stranger turned in sudden rage and at sir bertram flew with mortal hate their vigorous arms gave many a vengeful blow but bertrams stronger hand prevailed and laid the stranger low die traitor die  a dreadful thrust attends each furious word ah then fair isabel knew his voice and rushed beneath his sword o stop she cried o stop thy arm thou do thy brother slay and here the hermit paused and wept his tongue no more could say at length he cried go lovely pair how shall i tell the rest ere i could stop my piercing sword it fell and stabbed her breast were thou thyself that hapless youth ah cruel fate they said the hermit wept and so did they they sighed  he hung his head        my brother alas spoke never more his precious life was flown she kindly strove to sooth my pain regardless of her own        thus pouring comfort on my soul even with her latest breath she gave one parting fond embrace and closed her eyes in death         for me i loathed my wretched life and long to end it thought till time and books and holy men had better counsels taught they raised my heart to that pure source whence heavenly comfort flows she taught me to despise the world and calmly bear its woes no more the slave of human pride vain hope and sordid care i meekly vowed to spend my life in penitence and prayer the bold sir bertram now no more impetuous haughty wild but poor and humble benedict now lowly patient mild my lands i gave to feed the poor and sacred altars raise and here a lonely anchorite i came to end my days this sweet sequestered vale i chose these rocks and hanging grove for often beside that murmuring stream my love was wont to rove my noble friend approved my choice this blessed retreat he gave and here i carved her beauteous form and scoopd this hollow cave full fifty winters all forlorn my life i have lingered here and daily over this sculptured saint i drop the pensive tear in mr groses account of this hermitage it is alleged that it was universally believed the first hermit enjoined himself this life of penance and severity in contrition for the murder of his own brother i must say i was struck with an idea on my first entrance which grew upon me whilst i remained in these sacred vaults and drew on a train of pensive thoughts there needed nothing barbarous savage or murderous to induce a man to such a life  disappointed love was sufficient of itself to incite it conceive the personage sculptured upon the tomb or monument to be the devoted bride or beloved wife of the recluse cut off in the prime of life by some common casualty perhaps after a short life of harmony and love in the marriage state in the instant of bringing into the world the issue of an happy intercourse and the heir of an opulent race  this was cause sufficient under such circumstances we should entertain more feelings for the tender sorrows and disappointed love of the hermit than we can experience when we see him stained with bloody crimes arising from wrath revenge rashness or indiscretion  mad with jealousy even to such a blindness that he could not know his own brother though gone forth in disguise at his instance on the same errand with himself i own my ideas furnished me with a very different picture of the hermits woes  i stood over the monument with an eye flooded in tears and a mind distressed by the tenderest touches of commiseration after musing for some time i imagined i could hear the distressed inhabitant exclaim in the dust rests for ever the beloved remains of the best of women  united to me by love and wedloc  the hopes of my youth the joy of my desire and the felicity of my possession with her i had flattered my mind life would pass away serenely and the evening of the human day advance in peace but alas when my happiness was at its height she was snatched from me and forlornness beset my steps  but to return to my description the west end of the chapel is lighted by a window formed of four conjoining circles above the inner door of the vestibule is a shield bearing the remains of some arms by some taken to be the figure of a gauntlet but as it is generally believed one of the bertrams formed this hermitage so it is probable this shield the remains of which seem to correspond therewith bore the bertrams arms or an orl azure the bertrams were an ancient family in this country they held great possessions under the savor of william the conqueror with whom sir richard bertram a norman knight came over to england he had in marriage as a royal ward sibel the daughter and heiress of the mitford family sir william his son obtained his possessions of mitford to be created a barony by king henry i he married alice the daughter of sir william merley by whom he had issue two sons this sir william was or osbertus colutarius under his grant the founder of brinkburn priony afterward described   on the left hand of the altar a window is formed in the partition of the apartments divided by two mullions the summit of each light or division ornamented with work formed of sections of circles like those seen in cathedrals of the tenth century from the chapel we entered an inner apartment by a neat doorcase over which is sculptured a shield with the crucifixion and several instruments of torture at the east end of this inner apartment is an altar like that in the chapel lighted by the lastdescribed window and through which the person kneeling at the inner altar could view the cenotaph in the chapel this apartment is about five feet wide and nine paces in length here is also a nich or basin for holy water on the northern side of this inner chamber a recess is cut in the rock of size sufficient to hold the couch of a person of middling stature i have seen several of the like form alcoved above and a sole about two feet above the level of the floor to hold the mattress and bedding of the recluse this recess is so placed that whilst i sat therein to make my notes by a nich cut slantwise in the partition wall which separates the two apartments i had a view of the cenotaph and effigies thereon the nich seemed calculated for this very purpose being cut through the wall assant it could not be conceived intended to convey the light by some it has been imagined to be designed for confession but it is my sentiment that the hermit was priest and penitent in one and that he had devised those apertures that the effigies should be constantly in his sight in this inner apartment is a small closet cut in the side wall to the north from this interior chamber is a doorway leading to an open gallery having a prospect up the river but by the falling of some of the rock above this part is greatly damaged it is said by old people that the roof was supported by a fine pillar and formed a small piazza cloister or open gallery  such galleries are seen in very ancient mansions in the center of the front one is yet perfect in the remains of bradley hall in the county of durham the mansion of the eldest branch of the family of bows built as it is presumed soon after the conquest  from these cells through a neat doorway there are winding stairs cut in the rock leading to its summit supposed to conduct to the hermits olatory or garden a channel is ingeniously formed on the steps to carry off the water  it seems evident that the original hermitage consisted of no more than the apartments hewn in the rock the inner one being the dewlling place and the little cloister the summer seat facing westward and commanding a beautiful view up the river coquet which here forms a fine curve in extent near half a mile on this side bordered by rocks on the other by cultivated lands of an easy inclination on the extremity stands a pretty farmhold to terminate the sequestered rural prospect the style of architecture adopted in this hermitage is of the saxon gothic which proves its antiquity in the postscript to the poem of the hermit of warkworth the author asserts that the memory of the first hermit was held in such regard and veneration by the percy family that they afterward maintained a chantry priest to reside in the hermitage and celebrate mass in the chapel whose allowance uncommonly liberal and munificent was continued down to the dissolution of the monasteries and then the whole salary together with the hermitage and all its dependencies reverted back to the family having never been endowed in mortmain on this account we have no record which fixes the date of the foundation or gives any particular account of the first hermit the patent is extant which was granted to the last hermit in      by the sixth earl of northumberland henry earl of northumberland etc know you that etc have geven and granted and by these presents do gyve and grant unto the said sir george lancastre mine armytage belded in a

xxiiith yer of the reign of our sovereygn lord king henry the eight the author of the poem in this postscript adds after the perusal of the above patent it will perhaps be needless to caution the reader against a mistake some have fallen into of confounding the hermitage near warkworth with a chantry founded within the town itself by nicholas de farnham bishop of durham in the reign of king henry iii who appropriated the church of branxton for the maintenance there of two benedictine monks from durham that small monastic foundation is indeed called a cell by bishop tanner but he must be

of a durable stone the walls are almost entire the great tower is very perfect there are some remains of the dormitory now converted into a cellar mr gross observes that these ruins exhibit one among the many instances wherein circular and pointed arches occur in the same building and that in parts manifestly constructed at the same time which shows that about the period of its erection there was a kind of struggle between the ancient mode or saxon and what is called gothic architecture in which neither style then thoroughly prevailed the upper range of windows in this church are all circular those immediately under them are pointed two doors one on the north the other on the south have circular arches of various members falling back supported on pilasters richly adorned with variety of saxon ornaments particularly that on the north which has among others the heads of animals these are generally deemed the most ancient decorations of that style the great tower has four pointed arches and others of the same shape are supported by massy octagonal pillars in the body of the church there have been burials here as late as the year      at the east end and in the north and south crosses were chapels in one of which are diverse fragments of coffins and human bones on the whole though this building except about the doors is remarkably plain it has a sober and solemn majesty not always found in buildings more highly decorated part of this perhaps it may owe to its romantic situation which is the most proper in the world for retirement and meditation near the southwest angle of the church is a house seemingly built out of the offices of the monastery there are no monuments or inscriptions that we could discover the whole of the little plain on this peninsula is occupied by the

not quit our road to visit it though greatly tempted by the agreeable descriptions given us of the walks of hartburn wood  we arrived at  bolham a small village of some antiquity being the ancient residence of sir walter de bolham to whom it was granted by king john from the bolhams it came to the family of raimes in the time of king edward iii and as appears by the escheats of the several reigns of king richard ii king henry iv king henry vi queen elizabeth and king charles i remained in that family for many generations we inquired after a camp before described to us of an oblong figure   0 yards long and  0 broad fortified with a vallum and double trench having a raised pass leading to it it appears to be roman from the manuscripts of roger gale esquire extract of a letter from mr john warburton to roger gale esquire   january      as i was well assured from the authority of mr camden for i want languages to derive words that clenoventa was on the banks of the went or wentsbeck in northumberland i carefully examined all places from its source till it falls into the sea that had the least appearance of antiquity as likewise those upon the river glen bowent and alne viz anterchester yevrin which is bedes ad gebrin milfield bedes melmin brampton where mr camden in his first edition of the britannia placed bremenium but could never satisfy myself until i discovered the devils causeway and found thorntons standing thereon which though at present but an inconsiderable village shows the vestigia in it of a remarkable town in former times a high ridged military way runs through the middle of it and a square platform joins to it both which are evidently roman  i had once made choice of bolham for the ancient glanoventa which is situated upon an eminence opposite to thornton on the other side of the wentsbeck where there are likewise considerable remains of antiquity but on better consideration found that to have been of the saxons foundation why of saxon foundation bolham might have been the town of glenoventa and thrton a tarris or castelliam to it thorton by mr warbartons map is at least two miles north from bolham see note to mr warburtons letter of   st nov       r g   about two miles south of this thornton close by the military way lately mentioned are two large stones standing on their end like those at burrowbridge but not so big and betwixt them a tumulus which i was at the expense of opening and in it found a stone coffin about three feet in length two in breadth and two in depth which was black on the inside with smoke and had in it several lumps of glutinous matter which my workmen would needs have to be pieces of the dead heros flesh it was covered over with two flat stones and not above a yard in depth from the summit of the tumulus but had neither inscription bones coins urns or other remarkable thing about it i opened another larger than this near chester in the wood and found it much the same  bedal  th jan     j

without any inscription the personage interred totally unknown on the northeast side of the moor is a rock trenched round containing the ruins of interior buildings but its history lost in the oblivion of ages near bolham is a place called gally hill the place of execution belonging to the ancient barons many places of that name are to be seen near the baronial castles in this county  we now took our rout by  mitford to morpeth the ancient castle of mitford is a rude heap of ruins situate on a considerable natural eminence defended toward the north and west by a deep ditch and on the south the river wansbeck washes the foot of the castle hill the works appear to cover about an acre of ground the principal part of this fortress consisted of a circular tower raised upon an artificial mount the chief elevation from the natural level being effected by arches of stone and vaults which in ancient times were used as prisons or places for concealment the tower was defended by an outward wall which ran parallel with it at the distance of about  0 feet there is a very narrow prospect from this eminence the vale is so shut in on every side what other erections were within the walls of this fortress cannot be traced the ruins are so confused and most of them covered with grass  it is presumed this castle was built before the conquest the first owner and its date are not known  at the time of the conquest it was the possession of sir john mitford whose only daughter and heir sibille was given in marriage by the conqueror to sir richard bertram a norman knight by whom he had two sons william and roger  william succeeded to the manor and castle of mitford and by the grant of king henry i it was created a baronage he married alice the daughter of sir william merley

norman knight sir william sir roger sir william ob  th king john sir roger ob    king henry iii roger  a lineal descendant having joined with the northern barons in the   th year of the reign of king john the flemish troops commanded by that inhuman ravager in his northern depredations seized this castle and destroyed the town of mitford with fire and sword a little higher the river wentsbeck falls into the sea it runs by mitford which was burnt down by king john and his rutars when they so miserably wasted this country that age called those foreign auxiliaries and freebooters rutars who were brought out of the low countries and other places to king johns assistance by falques de brent and walter buc which rutarii or ruptarii are not only mentioned by our historians in the reign of king john but before his time also in the reign of henry ii and after it under henry iii by all the accounts which we have of them it appears they were mercenary german troops now in the high dutch rot whence our english rout is a company of soldiers rotten or rottiren to muster that from hence we are to fetch the true original of the word we are sufficiently taught by will newbrigensis who lived and wrote his history in the times of these rutars this was formerly the barony of william bertram whose line soon failed in roger his grandson the three coheirs being married to norman darcy i penbury and william de elmeley  gibsons camden the next year probably whilst the castle remained in the kings custody it was besieged by alexander king of scotland as is mentioned in lelands collectanea from a chronicle called historia aurea whether it was taken or not is not mentioned  the barony of mitford was given by the crown to philip de ulcotes but upon the kings demise bertram found means to make his peace with king henry iii and for a fine of  00l obtained a restitution of his lands and afterward grew into so much esteem with him that he granted on the payment of  0 marks that his annual fair at mitford should last eight days instead of four  his successor roger bertram was one of the insurgents at northampton in the reign of king henry iii where he was taken prisoner and his honor and castle of mitford with all his other lands were seized for the kings use the castle was given by king edward i to eleanor stanour the wife of robert de stoteville  in the year

very steep and washed by the river wansbeck the northern secured by a deep valley the tower has formerly had angular turrets at the northeast and southeast corners with a communication by an open gallery which was supported by projecting corbles there is no portcullis in the center of the arched roof of the gateway is a square aperture calculated to annoy assailants who should gain the outward gate it commands a fine prospect overlooking the town of morpeth and the banks of wansbeck where large tracts of woodlands are beautifully disposed near this tower toward the northeast and on the other side of the deep dell or valley before described is a round mound of earth on a natural mount whose height is greatly increased by art it appears to have been raised rather by assailants than as an outwork or defense to the castle for from thence by engines stones and missile weapons might be thrown into the interior parts of the fortress to annoy the garrison and agreeable to the modes practiced in early times perhaps this was cast up for an opposing fort and malvoisin on some blockade no record come to my knowledge proves who was the first founder of this castle early in the time of the normans the baronial seat of the merleys was here and probably they had a stronghold upon the very eminence where the present remains stand  the tower was the work of william lord greystock who

that merlay and morpeth were places originally distinct from each other the one denoting the hill and the other the valley at length the distinctions subsided in the general appellation of morpeth  we do not find in history any thing singular of morpeth in the times of the saxons it was the ancient barony of the merleys but when it was so created or whether the merleys were in possession before the conquest there is no satisfactory evidence by the testa de nevill it appears that the third roger de merley held the barony of morpeth by the service of four knights fees et omnes antecessores sui

lord william howard third son of the duke of norfolk from whom they descended to the present lord carlisle  we made an excursion from morpeth to visit  bothall the baronial inheritance of the family of ogles distant from morpeth about four miles this ride is extremely beautiful lying within a little distance of the river wansbeck the banks of which to the south are lofty and clothed with fine hanging woods through which here and there you see a bold promontory or rocky precipice all the environs of the river to bothal are romantic and beautiful the castle though placed on a considerable eminence yet stands in a very deep vale hanging woods forming an amphitheatre at the distance of about half a mile its present remains chiefly consist of the great gateway flanked on the north side by two polygonal towers    feet high and on the southwest angle by a square turret whose height measures  0 feet from the towers of this gate the outward wall extends along the brink of the eminence in a circular form enclosing the area and interior buildings of the castle this enclosure contains about half an acre in which are some scattered fragments of the inner buildings now affording no degree of certainty what were their original form and use to the northwest of the gateway was formerly another tower pulled down within the memory of persons living which bore the denomination of ogles tower the site of this castle to the south is very lofty on the brink of a rock whose foot is washed by the river the east and west sides of the eminence have been defended by a moat mr gross to his second plate of this castle which chiefly represents the gateway tower says the wood scene in the back ground slopes to the waters edge here and there skirted by picturesque rocks and in many places the trees overhang the stream which here runs briskly breaking against the huge stones plentifully scattered throughout its channel at once captivating the eye and by its gentle murmurs sweetly soothing the ear indeed the banks of the wansbeck between this place and morpeth afford a variety of sylvan scenes equal in beauty to any in the kingdom  i must descend to more minute descriptions of the gateway with its towers this gateway is of the same model as the gate of alnwick castle and by its architecture and ornaments appears to be nearly of the same date they bear a certain appearance of being the most modern parts of this castle the architecture is excellent and the edifice built of a durable stone well dressed and in good preservation the ascent from the town is easy and gradual the outward gate was defended by a portcullis in the arching of the roof of the gateway are three square apertures from whence the garrison could annoy the assailants when they had gained the first gate a door on each hand leads to the flanking towers on the right hand is a passage and staircase in the southwest tower at the foot of the stairs is a door into the prison which is not so horrible an enclosure as most of those seen in baronial castles it is above ground and closely arched having narrow apertures like loopholes to admit light and air from the gateway passage opposite to these stairs on the other side of the gateway is a large hall passing the winding stairs we entered the stateroom above the gateway this apartment is lighted by four windows none of them of any considerable size the principal one is to the north in the center by means of the thickness of the wall the recess formed for the window is benched with stone at the sides with seats for six persons at least from this window you view the town the church and a narrow vale through which the river flows on each side of this window is a door leading to the chambers of the flanking towers the fireplace of a very spacious range is to the east on the left side of which is another window with a recess benched like that before described a third window like the two former is to the right of the door as you enter looking into the area of the castle a large window to the west commands the wider part of the vale and the fine hanging woods by which it is is bounded three large stones cover the apertures in the floor which open upon the passage of the gateway the upper rooms being more ruinous are not so easy to describe or their form capable of being ascertained i walked these apartments with a veneration proceeding from the tenderest obligations an alliance with a lineal descendant of those illustrious families who for ages possessed this inheritance    in the front of the gateway are several shields of arms arranged in the following order which i apprehend like those at alnwick perfectly point out to us the time when this part of the castle was built in the center in a large shield are the arms of england and france quarterly it is observable that england takes the first quarter a thing i have never observed an instance of before on the dexter side a shield with the arms of england three lions passant gardant on the sinister a shield with the arms of the grays barry of six argent and azure three torteauxes in chief this denotes that the erection was made in the time of edward iv whose consort was a gray mother of thomas gray who in the   th year of that reign was created marquis of dorset beneath in the center the arms of bertram or an orl azure on the dexter and sinister sides of this are three shields which denote the alliances of the bertram family  the first on the dexter side the arms of percy  the second of dacre  the third of vesey or a cross sable  the first on the sinister side of darcy  the second of hastings  the third two lions passant gardant in a tressure but to what family this coat armor appertains i cannot form any probable assertion  on the tower on the right hand of the gateway are four shields the chief of which is of the ogles but as they are greatly defaced by time and on my view did not seem to have any material relation to the date or history of this erection i passed them without particular attention but on considering the matter i am induced to believe that john ogle the grandson of the heiress of bertram and who assumed the name of bertram erected this gateway in the family of ogles afterward mentioned he is particularly noticed  in the center on the battlement is the figure of a man in stone in the attitude of sounding a horn on the right hand tower is another figure holding a ball between his hands these figures are greatly injured by the weather the following curious survey of this castle was published in the antiquarian repertory  the following extract is copied from a survey called the book of bothool baronrye in northumberland most beautifully written and in high preservation the property of his grace the duke of portland to whom that barony now belongs it was taken the  0th day of june      by cuthbert carnable robert maddison and john lawson tenants to that manor by virtue of a commission granted

range of the wall where the notitia places it the rivers name is wantsbeck and glanoventa in the british tongue signifies the shore or banks of venta mr gross has the following remarks on the bertrams the original possessors of this castle richard bertram who lived about the time of king henry ii gave two sheaves or two third parts of the tithes of this barony to the monks of tinmouth in bournes history of newcastle it is said being a devout man he gave two shares i e two third parts of the titles of it to the monks his son robert obtained of king richard i that his manor with its dependencies should be raised to a barony and it is mentioned as such in that ancient record remaining with the kings remembrancer in the exchequer called testa de nevil from its being compiled by jollan de nevil who was a justice itinerant in the   th and   th years of king henry iii it contains the kings fees through the greatest part of england with inquisitions of lands escheated and serjeantries  this barony was held by robert of the king in capite by the service of three knights fees as his ancestors had formerly held it the said lands being de veteri feofmento and paying yearly for the castle guard at newcastle upon tyne for cornage  l   s  d  robert was succeeded by his son roger who procured a charter for free warren for all his demesne lands here and at heburn in this county his heirs enjoyed the barony for some successions without making any additions to its grandeur but robert bertram being in the reign of king edward iii constituted sheriff of northumberland and governor of newcastle upon tyne obtained a license of that king to make a castle of his manor house at bothal  robert having no issue male his daughter and heiress helen marrying sir robert ogle of ogle knight transferred this barony to his family robert their son after the death of his mother settled the same upon his youngest son john his paternal estate he bequeathed to his eldest son robert who suffered his brother to enjoy the barony of bothal for a short time only for soon after his fathers death with  00 armed men he took forcible possession of the castle under pretense of its being his birthright but on complaint to parliament a writ was issued to the sheriff of northumberland directing him to reinstate the complainant and commanding robert to appear at westminster on a certain

grace william the late duke of portland whose eldest son now duke of portland is the present proprietor  the parochial church stands at a little distance from the castle in tablets on the wall in the old black letter are painted the genealogy of the ogles of whom there were seven lords and thirty knights this genealogical table begins with humphrey ogle of ogle castle at the time of the conquest there is a fine marble tomb of one of the ogles and his lady with their effigies recumbent i presume the personages there represented are sir robert ogle and his wife the baroness bertram his effigy is clothed in a coat of mail the hands elevated about his neck a chain with a cross pendant on his bosom his hair cut over his forehead and round by his ears his head supported on his crest a bulls head his feet rested against a curled water dog her effigy is dressed in a long robe which conceals her feet over her head and shoulders a mantle flowing back her hands elevated her head supported by a cushion tasselled at the corners kept by two esquires in their proper habiliments each holding a tassel on the lap of her robe a small italian greyhound a sword sheathed lies between these effigies at the head of the tomb in niches ornamented with tabernaclework are four ecclesiastics their crowns shaven and with hands elevated at a corner an inclining shield supported on the dexter side by a lion collared and chained and on the sinister side by a monkey chained by the waste the shield of arms is so singular that i have caused it to be engraved with the effigies  on the banks of wansbeck near to bothall are the ruins of an ancient chapel or oratory said to be dedicated to the blessed virgin the situation is admirably calculated for meditation being in a shady solitude by the arms on the wall it appears to have been built by the family of ogles the erection is all of wellwrought free stone its dimensions within eight yards in length and four in breadth the roof now gone to decay was arched with stone after a curious form as appears by its remains it is now grown over with trees which have struck their roots into the joints and chasms of the building  in passing to ashington the family seat of the crows we had a view of  shipwash where the rectoryhouse stands appertaining to the parish of bothall lately honored by the residence of the most excellent prelate his grace the hon and right rev dr drummond late lord archbishop of york he was the second son of the right hon george hay earl of kinnoul and brother to the present whose illustrious ancestors are recorded for their virtues and military achievements in the annals of their country he was a man of deep erudition an excellent pastor a steady loyalist and a statesman of unbiassed integrity he mixed affability with dignity and at the same time he commanded reverence he was courteous in his archiepiscopal character he was rigid yet easy of access and as he was benevolent so was he slow of condemnation he constantly avoided the bustle of greatness and in his country retreat putting off the dignity of his office he was distinguished as a generous friend an inimitable parent and a gracious neighbor he was a student in christ church college oxford and had the degree of doctor in divinity   th june      he took the name and arms of drummond as heir intail to his great grandfather william drummond viscount strathallan he married henrietta daughter of peter auriol esquire merchant of the city of london by whom he had issue three sons and two daughters he became chaplain to king george ii in august      was installed prebendary of westminster   th april      and consecrated bishop of st asaph   th april      he was afterward translated to sarum and made archbishop of york in      in the same year he was made lord high almoner to the king and one of his majestys most hon privy council  the mother church it is said formerly stood here at a little distance lies the port of  cambois at the mouth of the river wansbeck a haven with two quays on the north shore for small vessels about  0 tons burden employed in the export of corn and grindstones and in importing timber the principal proprietors are sir thomas clavering bart and matthew ridley esquire many lime boats from the adjacent coasts resort to this place the cliffs by the sea called the hawks hugh are rude and majestic there is a cavern toward the north end well known to smugglers the situation of  ashington and the prospect from thence are delightful the banks of wansbeck are finely wooded and on every hand you look upon a rich cultivated country the objects disposed on these scenes are various and beautiful the nearer are woodlands rocks and cultivated eminences scattered over with hamlets the streams of wansbeck enlivened by people employed in the salmon fishery and graced with the bridge of shipwash and the fishing vessels the more distant are bebside and the port of cambois seaton delaval and the sea ashington was one of the dependent manors of the barony of bothall near this place is a spring called st margarets well but without any medicinal qualities its name derived from days of superstition when for every trifle places and things were beatified by the churchmen   approaching the sea coast we viewed  newbiggin a fine bay for shipping secured from the stormy quarters by high rocky promontories and capable of receiving vessels of  0 tons burden the town is small and chiefly inhabited by fishermen there are several granaries for corn here this whole coast is enlivened by trade and opulence is dispensed on every side by the hand of industry human nature is capable of vast works the capacity of man is infinite the further it is exerted the more is discovered for the advancement of its occupation the more our faculties are employed the nearer we approach to a similarity of the divine being in whose image man was created in the beginning to let our time elapse whilst our rational powers sleep in indolence is highly criminal it is a prodigality of all others the worst denying birth to those good works we owe to ourselves and to mankind at large in the bay ships ride in six or seven fathom of water  the church stands on the north side of the haven on a point of land which projects a considerable way into the sea and it is said there are the remains of a pier there this church was formerly a much more considerable edifice now the middle aile and steeple with a spire only remaining which circumstances give rise to an idea that newbiggin and its haven were in some former age of more considerable importance the spire is a mark to seamen of great use to ships coming from the north and baltic seas as a direction for their southward course the ornament of the altar seems to have been a devoted gift by some seaman who had escaped the perils of the ocean being the kings arms carved in wood for the sternpiece of a ship  we passed the house of  creswell

in possession till the degradation of the family at the abovementioned period  we advanced westward to  cawsey park a member of the barony of bothall and the inheritance of a younger branch of the noble family of ogle now the seat of bernard shaw esquire by his marrying the widow of william ogle esquire this was the mansion of john ogle who appears to have erected it as the old tower still retains the initial letters of his name the date thereon       his wife was interred in bothall church and her tomb has the following inscription here lies catharine the wife of john ogle of cawsey

collateral branches of the noble family of ogle whose pedigrees would not be esteemed sufficiently pertinent to hold a place in this work  henry ogle brother of the late william ogle founded a school here for  0 children and endowed it with a small piece of ground and  00l in money for a stipend for the master  humphrey of this line of the family of ogles was dean of hereford and one of the society of brazen nose college oxford where he founded two scholarships in favor of the heirs of his brother roger  the house has no great beauty of situation it is surrounded with a cultivated country and has pleasant gardens fish ponds and other artificial ornaments which greatly contribute to make it a pleasant retirement  longhorsley this manor was given by gospatrick earl of dunbar to sir ralph merley baron of morpeth as part of the dowery of julian his daughter roger de merley granted part of these possessions to adam de plesis and the heirs of his body in the reign of king henry

only daughter and heir married thomas riddell esquire of swinburn castle wallis the church stands at a distance from the town and belonged to the priory of brinkburn mr wallis says that the lord of this manor compelled all the tenants within the manor to keep the ways and ditches round their grounds in good order on pain of being whipped the day after his court was held as his authority for this strange penalty he quotes the autographo perantiquo et iste est rogerus qui subditos suos in horsley ad vias et fossatas circa campos de horsley been conservandas et diligenter sustentandas tractare statuit et quod quicunque convictus fuerit de aliquo fragmento in fossatis vel viis praedictis in campo suo tenetur ibidem in crastino inventionis sanctae crucis et crastino sancti martini in hieme et reddet domino suo pro quolibet delicto suo duas virgas serveas quoties inde convictus fuerit i conceive mr wallis has mistranscribed the word serveas how he renders the sentence to make it imply such a penalty as he has stated even allowing the word serveas to be right i know not the virga serrea was a royal standard measure kept in the exchequer and it is most probable the penalty inflicted on the tenants of horsley was a forfeiture meeted by the virga ferrea   in our return to morpeth our resting place from these little excursions we viewed  cockle park tower which stands about four miles north from morpeth in the time of king edward i it was the mansion house of a branch of the family of bertrams built according to the fashion of most of the ancient capital dwellings in this county as a stronghold not only for the family but a place of security for the tenants with their flocks and herds at the times of incursions of the scots or ravages by the banditti called the moss troopers  from morpeth our next tour was by whalton to ogle castle  whalton was the barony of walter fitz william who came into england with the conqueror it was afterward the possession of robert de crammaville whom king john divested and afterward gave his estates together with warkworth to roger fitz roger an ancester of the noble family of clavering it afterward came to the family of scroops

lands are capable minister acres was shut in on every side by a desert which within a few years has been converted into beautiful plantations but the great advancement which has taken place here is almost incredible and the noble works which now fill a tract of land that was covered with heath and had all the dreary aspect of barrenness and waste are astonishing no man is more valuable to the commonwealth than he who applies his opulence in the improvements of agriculture the produce of our lands is a staple of which we cannot be robbed by foreign enemies a treasure which no change in the balance of europe can waste an intestine wealth which will give power without the jeopardies attending common merchandise the increase will ever find an efflux to states which cannot support their numbers by the produce of their own land and will ever secure an influx of wealth our lands afford a perpetual supply of trade the goods derived from manual occupations are the objects of fluctuating taste and when birmingham and wolverhampton shall no longer bear the laborious anvil our wool our corn and cattle will remain a lasting source of wealth manual occupations are transferrable and in future ages may and will be moved from their present seats and take place in other kingdoms and distant quarters of the earth but the produce of lands as they are local so are they universally necessary those of our climate in particular others produce the luxuries we seek but ours the necessaries every climate requires to mr brandling every lover of his country must return thanks for the

of the family and various trophies are carved and so relieved that all their parts are perfectly seen free from its entablature this facade is rendered extremely beautiful by the breaks and fine proportions of its parts and by the excellent sculpture with which it is dressed and the whole is crowned with a ballustrade and proper pedestals on which urns are placed at each end hereof are seen

of their proportions than with the splendor of their decorations the floor is of a black and white marble and the chimneypiece finely adapted to the great style of the room the figures which support it are exquisitely executed as are the basso relievos and all the decorations opposite to the door is a grand music gallery faced with elegant iron ballustrades upon a fine entablature and supported

godfrey kneller and other good portrait painters and also to the two grand winding geometrical stone staircases    feet in diameter reaching from the bottom to the top of the house of a structure which has been greatly admired by all who have seen them having iron ballusters of a very light and elegant form the hall leads to a splendid saloon fronting the pleasure grounds    feet long and from

are three feet diameter in this room there are eight majestic fluted corinthian columns of the most beautiful stone and the same number of pilasters which divide it into three spaces the ceiling was executed by the famous italian artist vercelli and is exquisitely modelled and admirably colored here are several finely painted whole length pictures of this family at the east end is a small antichamber which leads into a spacious drawing room and also into a lesser drawing room contiguous to an an elegant eatingroom beautifully ornamented with festoons of fruit and flowers formed of a most durable composition and so admirably painted as perfectly to resemble nature collateral to these stately apartments are others for retirement and waitingrooms connected with a stone winding staircase of fine workmanship being ten feet three inches in diameter and communicating with the great staircase at every landingplace through either of which you may ascend to a grand gallery on the next floor on each side whereof are several large and finely proportioned bedchambers and from whence you may pass into    new rooms lately built by sir john among which are several stately bedchambers and dressingrooms and he has also highly ornamented the greatest part of this fine mansion with new and rich furniture most of the best rooms have marble chimneypieces of admirable workmanship all the offices in the base story which are very numerous are arched with hewed stone from whence you may go on the same level to the east and west wings in the former thereof are the noble stables the chief of which is    feet long and    wide and    feet   inches high the roof being supported by three superb arches    feet   inches high the divisions of all the stalls and the

all kinds on the ground floor and in the second floor several good apartments and a gallery also reaching along the whole length of it this splendid seat stands in part of the pleasure grounds surrounded by a haha having a wall of hewn stone nine feet high and considerably more than a mile in circumference which is not seen from the house here are several walks disposed with great taste some of which are shaded as well by lofty old trees as plantations through which various vistas are cut some of them being terminated by elegant stone buildings and others opening delightful prospects to the sea toward the east greatly heightened by ships which are frequently sailing in sight of the windows to the south there is a fine view over a verdant lawn to another bay of the sea where frequently   0 sail of colliers may be seen and enriched with the fine ruin of tynemouth priory a grand obelisk and several villages and hamlets interspersed forming a very beautiful landscape to the west there is an avenue of a mile and quarter long and to the north a view of a great part of northumberland extending over a space of  0 miles terminated by the august mountains of cheviot this house stands within a few yards of the place where delaval castle the ancient baronial seat of the family formerly stood near the house is the family chapel in this chapel are two tombs with recumbent effigies the one a knight in armor who had made the crusade the other a lady but there is no inscription to denote the personages they represent of saxon antiquity hartley haven depiction of hartley haven mausoleum at seaton delaval depiction of mausoleum where divine service is constantly performed not far from thence there is an elegant mausoleum which has lately been built by sir john and lady hussy delaval to the memory of their late son who was the delight not only of his parents but of all who knew him his endowments were so pleasing and his manners so captivating that the most able panegyrist would want words to give an adequate idea of this most admirable young man no expense has been spared in this pious edifice which has been justly admired by every one who has seen it the perron to the entrance being of the height of the zocle of the building serves as a continual pedestal to it the portico is of the doric order tetrastite the columns of which are each formed of one single stone weighing several tons bearing a handsome pediment with a triangular tympanum the dressing of the whole is elegant and simple a cupola covered with lead rising majestically in the center produces a very solemn appearance the inside is of the form of a chapel having a nave in the middle with an altar or communion table above which a solemn dome is supported by semicircular arches opening to an aile on each side in which are several arches and niches for the reception of tablets inscriptions and monuments underneath are catacombs strongly arched and of most durable workmanship they are all founded as is the whole of this structure upon a rock and as all the stones of which it is composed are large and set so close together as not to admit of any wall falling it is calculated to last as long as the work of man can do it is enclosed by a haha wall of    feet high and   feet thick so wrought and put together as to have a rocky appearance giving the idea of long duration and by forming from its rudeness a strong contrast to the building which is all polished as well as stone can be produces an admirable effect  a delightful shady walk of a mile long leads to sir johns port of hartley in a periodical publication printed for snagg in fleet street i find the following account cullicoats a place otherwise of no great distinction but worthy remembrance in this respect that it is a very commodious little port of artificial construction or as the common people style it an harbor made by hand it is dry at low water and difficult at the entrance but it serves for coals and salt belonging to the works of particular persons at whose expense it was constructed seaton sluice was originally of the same kind sir ralph delaval was continually contriving new improvements in the exercise of which he never hesitated at expense and amongst the rest made this port on his own plan and entirely at his own charge for the benefit of his tenants and himself immediately but without excluding others who chose to use it in the construction of this small harbor he found enough to exercise his skill and patience the stone pier which covered it from the north east wind being carried away by the sea more than once and when he had overcome this difficulty by using timber as well as stone he felt a new inconvenience by his ports filling up with mud and sand though a pretty sharp rill ran through it which had so hollowed the rock as to produce the very basin which sir ralph would convert into a haven in order to remove this mischief he placed a new strong sluice with floodgates upon his brook and these being shut by the coming in of the tide the back water collected itself into a body and forcing a passage at the ebb carried all before it and twice in    hours scoured the bed of the haven clean king charles ii who had a great taste for matters of this kind made him collector and surveyor of his own port whence his coals well known in london by that name are shipped there are also large salt works and copperas works and likewise very considerable glass works which were built by thomas delaval esquire and purchased of him by sir john who has cut through a solid and hard rock a new entrance into his harbor which is    feet deep  0 feet broad and  00 feet long this great work he did at his own private expense which no person has any share or concern in but himself no ships come hither except for his coals salt glass and copperas the three lastmentioned works are carried on here for the sake of consuming the small coals of his colliery which would without them be of no value before this new entrance was effected the opportunity for exportation here was very confined as the ships for want of a sufficient depth of water in the old entrance were obliged to be loaded with keels whereas they can now sail out with their full loadings these works produce to the public a revenue of above  0000 l a year and afford sir john the means of constantly supporting several hundred people who live upon his estate in honest industry in which he and lady hussy delaval take great delight  sir john has also made a little harbor of refuge in st marys island for the safety of the fishermen upon this coast by which many have been saved who could not possibly in certain winds have reached any other harbor  conceiving it might prove most agreeable to the reader to find a particular description of  ford castle which sir john hussy delaval considers as his sporting seat immediately succeeding that of the princely mansion of seaton delaval i reserved it for this place  from yevering bell and the eminences beyond wooler it has a noble appearance arising from a fine cultivated plain this castle was reedified by sir john the antique style being well preserved in the design two towers one on the east flank and one on the west being the only remains of the old castle which are retained in this edifice the work was begun in the year      and completed in two or three years the front is to the south the center of which is formed by a semihexagonal projection and its terminations are square turrets from whence on each hand a regular wing is advanced on the west side of the area in front is an old square tower of singular form it being composed of two turrets one arising above another the upper one being so much less than that which supports it as to afford a spacious battlement the area is enclosed by a wall embrazured and garnished with turrets the entrance to which is by a spacious gateway the wall is defended by corner towers  this castle is seated on the east banks of the river till it appears by madoxs exch p     that sir william heron built it in the   th year of the reign of king henry iii a d      the estate having come to his family by an intermarriage with the heiress of ford who derived her descent from odonel de ford as is mentioned in the preceding page    and who was seized thereof in the time of king henry i  the castle commands a fine prospect up the valley as far as wooler bounded by lofty eminences which rising swiftly are broken in the most agreeable and romantic manner to the westward at about the distance of a mile and a half you view flodden hill marked to the eye by a rising plantation of firs made by sir john hussy delaval which crowns the eminence and gives a beautiful object upon the landscape in great floods the till overflows several hundreds of acres of flat ground the extensive sheet of water makes a grand appearance from the castle when it subsides the plain is left covered with a most fertilizing mud by which the soil is greatly enriched  from the happy taste her ladyship possesses for a rural life sir john has advanced the more rapidly in those works of improvement which mark the adjacent country the fair example becomes illustrious by the contrast which is seen in the lives of persons of equal rank and opulence the works which are spread around ford and seaton delaval whilst they dispense felicity to innumerable laborious families contribute greatly to the general opulence of the state no panegyric can pay due praise to those who thus employ their abundant wealth the effect is not contracted within the circle of sir johns possessions the example influences as it carries with it conviction and many are thereby induced to cultivate and improve the adjacent estates recovering from a prepossession of ages of ignorance that the nature of the soil and climate would frustrate their attempts a vast tract of land on which you look from ford was within  0 years last past one continued sheepwalk now intersected and enclosed with excellent quickwood fences the eminences adorned with fine plantations the large and open farms which heretofore gave the country the aspect of poverty and desolation are now subdivided and let out into smaller allotments from  0l to  00l a year each by which the country has become well peopled and the lands which for pasturage did not yield above one shilling per acre now let for twentyfive shillings the vice of enlarging farms destroying villages and thereby depopulating a country was advanced to such enormity in the reigns of king henry vii and king henry viii that it called for a parliamentary inquiry and restriction no language can more strongly express the error than the preamble of the statute of the   th of king henry viii cha    for as much as diverse and sundry persons of the kings subjects of this realm to whom god of his goodness has disposed great plenty and abundance of moveable substance now of late within few years have daily studied practiced and invented ways and means how they might accumulate and gather together into few hands as well great multitude of farms as great plenty of cattle and in especial sheep putting such lands as they can get to pasture and not to tillage whereby they have not only pulled down churches and towns and enhanced the old rates of the rents of the possessions of this realm or else brought it to such excessive fines that no poor man is able to meddle with it but also have raised and enhanced the prices of corn cattle wool pigs geese hens chickens eggs and such other almost double above the prices which have been accustomed by reason whereof a marvelous multitude and number of the people of this realm be not able to provide meat drink and clothes necessary for themselves their wives and children but be so discouraged with the forge near ford castle depiction of forge misery and poverty that they fall daily to theft robbery and other inconveniences or pitifully die for hunger and cold and as it is thought by the kings most humble and loving subjects that one of the greatest occasions that moves and provokes those greedy and covetous people so to accumulate and keep in their hands such great portions and parts of the grounds and lands of this realm from the occupying of the poor husbandmen and so to use it in pasture and not in tillage is only the great profit that comes of sheep which now be come to a few persons hands of this realm in respect of the whole number of the kings subjects that some have   000 some  0000 some  0000 some  000 some  000 and some more and some less by the which a good sheep for victual that was accustomed to be sold for  s  d or  s at the most now sold for  s or  s or  s at the least and a stone of clothing wool that in some shires of this realm was accustomed to be sold for   d or  0d now sold for  s or  s  d at the least and in some counties where it has been sold for  s  d or  s  d or  s at the most is now sold for  s or  s  d at the least and so are raised in every part of this realm which things thus used be principally to the high displeasure of almighty god to the decay of the hospitality of this realm to the diminishing of the kings people and to the let of the clothmaking whereby many poor people have been accustomed to be set on work and in conclusion if remedy be not found it may turn to the utter destruction and desolation of this realm which god defend  by this law which is still subsisting no farmer under a penalty to be levied by justices of the peace should hold more than two farms and they to be in one parish where he should reside and no farmer to have above  000 sheep  not only the pleasure her ladyship takes in promoting sir johns attention to the improvements of the adjacent lands she also i am informed was a chief cause of the iron manufactory carried on near ford being brought to its present significance about a mile down the river a platingforge was erected in      where a large quantity of shovels spades and other plateiron works are made as well for home consumption as for exportation at the ports of berwick newcastle etc the scheme when carried to its intended extent will be of great consequence to this part of the country the situation of the forge is romantic and the whole scene picturesque the water to supply the wheels is collected by a dam and forms a fine canal from whence it breaks over the wear in a beautiful cascade and being intercepted in its lower course by rocks and hillocks divides itself into several streams the buildings for the forge as you look up the river lay to the left on the opposite side is a watercornmill the vale seen above the canal consists of cultivated and enclosed grounds which are highly contrasted by the lofty eminences which bound the prospect finely broken and irregular through which the light streams and gives a singular beauty to the offscape these at the extreme point of view are overlooked by cheviot awfully supreme and majestic on whose brow heavy vapors are generally seen suspended  the family of delaval had considerable possessions in  echewick hubert delaval and richolda his mother gave a moiety of that manor to the priory of hexham the priory held lands there of the gift of others one parcel the donation of thomas de echewick and another of peter de fawdon the abbey of newminster also had lands in echewick by the gift of john de mitford   king henry vi  roger fenwick esquire of bitchfield second son of sir john fenwick of wallington by margery the daughter and heiress of john harbottle esquire married ursilla daughter of sir john heron of chipchase knt and purchased of the crown echewick hall with diverse lands to be held by fealty only as of the manor of east greenwich subject to a certain feefarm rent in the year      he settled the same on anthony his second son whose issue in the male line becoming extinct the estate about the year    0 came to ralph scourfield esquire of newcastle upon tyne in right of his mother who was the daughter of geo fenwick of newcastle merchant adventurer younger son of anthony fenwick ralph scourfield of echewick esquire his only son was high sheriff for the county of northumberland a d      he died sept      and lies buried within the rails of the communion table in the church of st john newcastle on his decease the estate descended to edward bell esquire whose eldest daughter and coheiress the present proprietor in the year      married george spearman esquire  this family of spearmans derives descent from le sire dasperemont son of the count dasperemont who accompanied king william the conqueror to england the corruption of the name has been attributed by some of the family to an achievement in the holy wars under prince edward afterward king edward i the ancestors of george spearman esquire were settled at preston in the parish of tynemouth for some centuries john of that family in the beginning of this century left by will a chalice for the communion and a yearly stipend for a schoolmaster in the parish of tynemouth  but to return from this digression  from the mausoleum at seaton delaval the walk is extended to  hartley which place was the possession of adam de jesmont as appears by the escheats of the reign of king john but in that age it was inconsiderable when compared to its present state  the river anciently made its course due east until it was within a little way of the sea and then suddenly made a turn and discharged itself in a course due north the sea banks at this point form an angle one side facing to the north and the other almost full east at the point of this angle sir ralph delaval erected his works to secure his little haven at the mouth of the river as mentioned in the foregoing note but sir john in an age much advanced in mechanic knowledge brought his haven into its present state by cutting through the rock from the point where the river anciently turned toward the north to the sea on the east side of the angle so that the current now discharges itself into the sea in a straight direction almost due east and forms a harbor accessible with every wind and a moorage secure against every storm  over the cut a drawbridge is cast for the passage of the inhabitants

stone about two miles northwest of tynemouth the best account which has yet been given of it is by mr gross which i shall take the liberty to transcribe it appears to me to be the ancient boundary mark of the priory district many obelisks of this kind being fixed on the boundaries of church lands in the northern counties  a gentleman in the neighborhood remembers it standing though in a tottering condition and much out of the perpendicular he thinks it was then near ten feet high it has lately been thrown down and broken two pieces of it are now remaining one of which measuring three feet and a half has been set up the other of about three feet is the part represented in mr groses plate lying on the ground on the pedestal is the inscription o horror to kill a man for a pigges head the characters seem more modern than the obelisk this monument is of a whin stone its plan what is called an oblong square it is injured by time and besides which the country people have punched it so full of round holes and otherwise so defaced it as not only to render its ornaments unintelligible but also to make it doubtful whether all its sides or only the two broadest were ornamented the following traditionary story relative to this monument is also given by mr gross a monk of this monastery strolling abroad came to the house of mr delaval an ancestor of the ancient family of that name who was then absent on an hunting party but was expected back to dinner among the many dishes preparing in the kitchen was a pig ordered purposely for mr delavals own eating this alone suiting the liquorish palate of the monk and though admonished and informed for whom it was intended he cut off the head reckoned by epicures the most delicious part of the animal and putting it into a bag made the best of his way toward the monastery delaval at his return being informed of the transaction which he looked upon as a personal insult and tynmouth depiction of tynmouth abbey being young and fiery remounted his horse and set out in search of the offender when overtaking him about a mile east of preston he so belabored him with his staff called a hunting gad that he was hardly able to crawl to his cell the monk dying within a year and a day although as the story goes the beating was not the cause of his death his brethren made it a handle to charge delaval with his murder who before he could get absolved was obliged to make over to the monastery as an expiation of this deed the manor of elsig in the neighborhood of newcastle with several other valuable estates and by way of amend honorable to set up an obelisk on the spot where he properly corrected the monk elsig was afterward made the summer retreat of the priors of tynmouth this story like many others of the like kind is very defective in several parts no date is affixed and the abovementioned monument is shown in support of it it seems difficult to account for this monk being so far from his monastery especially alone which was strictly prohibited by their rules and this not being of the mendicant order he could not be going on the quest the only method of reconciling it is to suppose that this personage was a laybrother and servant to the house it however shows how dangerous it was to injure the meanest retainer to a religious house a peril very ludicriously though justly expressed in the following old english adage which i have somewhere met with  if perchance one offend a freeres dog straight clameth the whole brotherhood an heresy an heresy  the town of  tynemouth is well built being a place of great resort in the bathing season the inns are good and there is every accommodation to render the situation agreeable  the present church stands a mile west from the town and was consecrated by bishop cosins  0 king charles ii a d       the priory lies to the east end of the town on a peninsula formed of stupendous rocks on the north side of the mouth of the river tyne against which heavy seas break with great vehemence and tumult the approach to the priory in its present state is from the west by a gateway tower of a square form having a circular exploratory turret on each corner from this gateway on each hand a strong double wall has extended to the rocks on the sea shore which from their great height have been esteemed in former times inaccessible the gate with its walls was fortified by a deep outward ditch over which there was a drawbridge defended by moles on each side the tower comprehends an outward and interior gateway the outward gateway having two gates at the distance of about six feet from each other the inner of which is defended by a portcullis and an open gallery the interior gateway is in like manner strengthened by a double gate the space between the gateways being a square of about six paces is open above to allow those on the top of the tower and battlements to annoy assailants who had gained the first gate by different accounts it appears that there was a place of considerable strength here in very remote antiquity camden says there are some apprehend that the rampire not the roman wall went as far as to the very mouth of tyne and affirm it was called penbalcrag that is the head of the rampire on the rock i dare avouch this was in the time of the romans tunnocellum expressing the promontory of tunn or tyne where lay the first cohort aela classica enrolled probably from the name by aelius hadrianus the emperor and in pay for sea services for the romans had certain light pinnaces termed luforiae upon the rivers  what it was in the time of the saxons as a fortification we have little or no evidence to be depended upon the situation on the ostium of so important a river and so well calculated for the command of this shore induced william the conqueror to order it should be converted into a fortress the religious inhabitants were ill suited to this plan and the first degradation of this monastery was by waltheof earl and governor of northumberland at the command of his sovereign who it is known had very little veneration for religious institutions at this period it was fortified with the wall and tower before described robert mowbray earl of northumberland made choice of it for his stronghold when he rebelled against king william rufus but as it usually happens with rebels he had ill success being closely besieged he withdrew himself into the monastery and claimed the benefit of sanctuary a protection presumed to be inviolable in those days notwithstanding which he was dragged forth by the conquerors carried to windsor and held in close durance there for a long time before he was put to death camden on its being converted into a fortress it took the north west view of tynmouth depiction of tynmouth abbey the name of tynemouth castle it belonged to the earls of northumberland from the time of waltheof for several generations in pecks desiderata curiosa tynemouth castle is mentioned in the list of castles bulwarks and fortresses garrisoned in the reign of queen elizabeth whereby it appears here was a master gunner and six inferior gunners in camdens time it was in good repair he says it is now called tynemouth castle and glories in a stately and strong castle it was besieged by the scots in      when the garrison were obliged to surrender to the arms of the parliament and submit to their instructions on this occasion there was delivered up    pieces of cannon a great stand of arms with stores of ammunition and provision of very consisiderable amount several of the garrison it is said during a violent storm escaped by the privies a large sum was appropriated by parliament to restore the injury this fortress sustained in the siege and colonel henry lilburn was made governor but he deserting his party the garrison soon after revolted sir arthur hezelrig who lay at newcastle marched immediately to reduce them and took the place by storm the men scaling the walls in the most intrepid manner at the mouths of the cannon entered by the embrazures and portholes and after a short engagement with the garrison within the fortifications soon became masters of it in the conflict lilburn was slain  on passing the gateway the scene is strikingly noble and venerable the whole enclosed area may contain about six acres the walls seem as well calculated for defense as the gateway tower the view is crowded with august ruins many fine arches of the priory are standing the most beautiful part of these remains is the eastern limb of the church of elegant workmanship the ruins are so disunited that it would be very difficult to determine to what particular offices each belonged on the south side adjoining the wall which stands on the brink of the cliff are several spacious vaulted chambers one of which i conceived was the kitchen from the large extended fireplace another the prison with an aperture in the top of the vault by which the miserable captive descended to his horrid dungeon on the north and east sides the cliffs appear to be about  0 perpendicular fathoms in height at the feet of which on a broken rocky shore the sea beats impetuously from the walls on the south side you have a view of the batteries which command the mouth of tyne with the barracks for the garrison on the north side is a house built by colonel henry villiers once governor of this fortress together with a lighthouse for the benefit of shipping passing this dangerous coast these erections being made by license from government villiers was authorized to receive one shilling for every british vessel and sixpence for each foreign vessel anchoring in shields harbor which produced a revenue of about  0l per annum a trifling gratuity for so beneficial a work his monument in the prioryyard has the following epitaph hic fitae sunt mortales reliquiae henrici villiers armigeri stirpe antiqua prognati unici honoratissimi comitis de jersey fratris nec non hujus presidii circiter viginti annos fidelis et perquam dilectus praefectus vixit annos    obiit    aug anno dom mdccvii    the ruins which present themselves in front on entering the gateway appear to be the remains of the cloister to which you have access by a gateway of circular arches comprehending several members inclining inwards and arising from pilasters after passing this gate in the area many modern tombs appear the ground being still used for sepulture the west gate entering into the abbey is still entire of the same architecture as that leading to the cloister the ground from the cloister to the south wall is almost covered with foundations of buildings which i presume are the remains of the priory two walls of the east end of the church are standing the end wall to the east contains three long windows the center window the loftiest is near  0 feet high richly ornamented with mouldings some of rosework and others of the dancette as the figure is termed in heraldry or zigzag a decoration common to old saxon architecture the divisions or pillars between the windows are enriched with pilasters of five members with highly finished foliated capitals and cornices above the center window is an oval one with like mouldings and the openings of a gallery on each side part of the south side wall of the choir is also standing illuminated with four windows of like form as those to the east and equally ornamented though not of the same height for above them are an equal number of small windows the divisions or pillars between the larger windows are decorated with pilasters of the same kind as those at the east end in the divisions or pillars between the smaller windows spring the groins of the arches which formed the roof by their remains showing they were ornamented with rich mouldings the arches of the windows in this part are circular the blank arches which are thrown upon the wall beneath the windows are pointed the architecture through the whole of this part of the building is singularly light and beautiful the erection consists of a red freestone which endures the weather well in this stormy situation  beneath the center window at the east end is a doorway of like excellent workmanship conducting to a small but elegant apartment which i conceive has contained the shrine and tomb of st oswine on each side of the door is a human head cut in a style much superior to that of the general taste of the age in which they are supposed to have been executed the apartment within is    feet in length and nine feet in breadth and height on the south side is an entrance from the open yard with two windows on the north side three windows and a circular window to the east so elevated as to give place for an altar beneath there are two niches for statues at the east end a closet for the vessels for sacred offices and a basin for holy water on each side of the window is the figure of a monk kneeling and two of the emblematical animals commonly depicted with the evangelists the side walls are ornamented with pilasters from whence spring the groins and arches of stone which in various intersections form the roof the joinings of which are enriched with circles of carved work and the interstices of the roof are arched and constructed with thin bricks the circles contain sculptures of the divine personages with the apostles of workmanship far from being despicable and all the figures are in good preservation round each sculpture is a circular belt with a sentence in the old english character well raised viz sanct petrus ora p nobis etc each varied by the name of the personage to whom it is inscribed the center row consists of four circles in one is the effigies of john the baptist with the like sentence in a second toward the west the effigies of our savior with a monk kneeling in a third to the east the effigies of the supreme with the lamb bearing an ensign and in the fourth a representation of the last judgment with this sentence in die judicii liberare nos above the door is the effigies of our savior with a globe in his hand with morit p nobis subscribed on each side of the door an emblematical figure as to the east there are two escutcheons the dexter one charged with bearings of vesey a cross sable the sinister the bearings of brabant and lucy quarterly in p moniers celebrated history of painting etc we have the following remarkable passages touching the original use of paintings and sculptures in the christian churches  one would have thought that the excellence of designing ought to have been kept up at rome by reason that from the beginning of the christian religion the christians made use of painting and sculpture to represent the histories of the old and new testament to adorn their churches and tombs  st gregory in an oration which he made at constantinople mentioned in the second nicene council ac   vidi saepius inscriptionis imaginem and sine larrymis transire non potui cum tam efficaciter eb oculos poneret historiam of nice assures us he could not refrain from tears at the sight of a picture wherein abraham was represented about to sacrifice his son in his oration

etiam pictara tacens in perietibus lqui and utilitatis plurimum afferre he describes the greatness and magnificence of a temple consecrated to that saint he takes notice that his martyrdom was extraordinarily well done and that the characters of the grief and constancy of this martyr of the fierceness and cruelty of the tyrant and the assistance of our blessed lord to crown this happy saint were as legible in this piece as in a book insomuch that the pictures on the walls were like a lively and useful sermon  saint basil confirms the same thing and says that painters do as much by their figures as orators by theirs and that both equally serve to persuade and raise the contemplators to virtue  there were some excellent painters among the greeks in the year  00 for there was nothing more surprising nor of greater usefulness than a piece of the day of judgment done by methodius which so sensibly affected bogoris curtpal ceen zar related by mr h d iconol  this methodius was a monk and painter bogoris employed him to paint a palace he had built he orderd him in general to draw representations of terror taking chiefly delight in pictures that represented the combats of hunters with boars lions bears and tigers methodius finding nothing more terrible than the day of judgment he painted it admirably well with all its most horrible and amazing circumstances and above all the reprobates on the left hand of the judge and delivered over by his sentence to devils to be dragged into hell bogoris was so touched at the representation of this picture that he immediately resolved without further delay to turn christian   king of the bulgarians that it converted that prince and afterward all his subjects to christianity  images in the christian religion began from the time of jesus christ the first that was made was by a lady whereof there is made mention in st luke cha   v    this holy woman as an acknowledgement of her cure erected in the city of caesarea a statue of i c it was of brass and at his feet was the statue of this woman in a supplicant posture she was so acceptable to god that he gave a miraculous virtue to a plant that grew at the foot of this statue and when it was grown high enough to touch the fringe of this image it healed all sorts of diseases nie council  d act   s greg a espist to germ bp of constant several historians record this truth particularly eusebius of caesarea eusebius lib c   chap    this history is also related by antipater bestrensis and also by nicephorus casseterat and metaphs there is also a large narrative of all these ancient images in the book of subterranean rome who was an ocular witness of the truth of it and sozomen reports that julian the apostate by reason of the hatred he bore to i c caused this famous statue to be taken away and ordered his own to be set up in its place but he was immediately punished for this sacrilege for lightning falling thereon consumed it to ashes  there are other authors who write that from the time of the apostles there were images of the painting of i c historiae quoq  says damascene proditum est cum abagarus edesse rex eo nomine pictorem misisset ut domini imaginem exprimeret neq id pictor ob splendorem ex ipsius vultu manantem consequi potuisset dominam ipsum divinae suae ac vivificae faciei pallium admovisse sicq illud ad abagarum ut ipsius cupiditati satisfaceret misisse   jo damasc de orthod fid     chap    baron ann tom   an    and that our blessed savior was the inventor of them at the solicitation of abagarus king of edessa who having heard of the miracles of c i sent a painter to draw his picture but when he could not lay down the design of it by reason of the shining rays that issued from his divine looks our lord to satisfy the request of the king of edessa covered his face with a linen vail whereon he imprinted his divine image and sent it to that prince by virtue whereof he was healed of a disease otherwise incurable in the time of the apostles were also to be seen images of the blessed virgin for st luke made several of them this is witnessed by st gregory the patriarch of constantinople st gregory the   writing to leo isaurus relates the same history and that they came out of all the east to worship this image cum hyerosolymis ageret christus abagarus qui tum temporis dominabatur and rex erat urbis edessenorum cum christi miracula audivisset epistolam scripsit ad christum qui manus suae responsum and sacram glories amq faciem suam ad eum misit itaq ad illam non manufactam imaginem mitte ac vide congregantur illic orientis turbae and orant etc in what he writes to the emperor leo isaurianus  theodorus theodoris in his oration against leo isaurus annal t   annal     and in the  d council of nice the same relation is confirmed by leo lecturer of the church at constantinople who witnesses the honor that was paid in his time to that image these are his words leo religiosissimus lector magnae and egretiae ecclesiae constantinopolitanae dixit and ego indignus vester famulus cum descendissem cum regis apocrisariis in syriam edessem petivi and venerandam imaginem non factam hominum manu adorati and honorari apopula vide etc further shows that the empress eudoxia sent one of these images painted by st luke to pulcheria augusta lucas vero qui sacrum composuit evangelium cum domini pinxisset imaginem pulcherimam and pluris faciendam posteris reliquit st theodor orat in leo arm  teod lect collet l   there is also one to be seen at this day at rome made by the same saint which is carefully kept by the religious of saint sylvester  although the history of the portrait of c i sent to abagarus and that of the portrait of the holy virgin painted by st luke are scrupled and contested about by some notwithstanding i thought fit to relate them here to show the antiquity of images after the example of the second nicene council those of the apostles st greogory ii in his epistle to leo isaurus says of the first christians who painted our savior qui dominum cum viderent prout viderant venientes hierosolymam spectandum ipsum proponentes depinxerunt cum stephanum protomartyrem vidissent prout viderant spectandum ipsum proponentes depinxerunt et uno verbo dicam cum facies martyrum qui sanguinem pro christo fuderunt vidissent depinxerunt confessors and martyrs have been also painted and engraven in the infancy of the church the same st gregory tells us the same thing as pope adrian i relates in what he writ to constantine and irenaeus he assures us that there were kept in the basilicum and in the vatican the portraitures had   epist to constable and irenaeus baron annal to   an     and to   an     of st peter and st paul which are those which st sylvester showed to the emperor constantine constantine to adorn his new city set up on all the gates the image of the holy virgin and upon that of his palace the image of our savior which leo isaurianus caused to be taken

exact era of its foundation cannot be ascertained there are nevertheless sufficient proofs of its great antiquity insomuch that according to the learned author last cited it is evident that st

or other sinister views his life was marked with savage barbarities which drew upon him the wrath of his prince who banished him for his complicated and atrocious crimes thenceforth he attached himself to the king of norway who was ravaging scotland and induced him to attempt deposing his own brother harold ii for which purpose he projected a descent at the haven of tynemouth from whence they pillaged all the country on the banks of tyne putting again to sea they entered the humber where they committed the most horrid cruelties burning and laying waste the whole country and imbruing their hands in a flood of innocent blood in a little time they were opposed by a body of forces under the command of edwin and morchar but in the conflict the danes were victorious harold with an army of  0000 men soon afterward engaged the invaders who were nearly equal in number at stanford bridge near york the battle began at seven in the morning and did not cease till three in the afternoon when after a great slaughter of the danes tostin and the danish king being among the slain victory declared for harold and such were the bloody honors of the day that out of  00 ships with which the invaders entered tynemouth haven twenty and those too by permission of the conqueror carried the young prince with his remaining followers to denmark adam bemensis says that in the spoil of the

first degradation of this monastery was by waltheof earl of northumberland at the command of his king to show some color or pretext for so flagrant an invasion of the rights of the church he pretended it was an unfit situation for devotion horridus and incultus mr walliss ideas are excellent on this subject i will take them literatim as he gives them in his work  it is so far from being an unfit place for devotion that few can exceed it for presenting the mind with a variety of solemn objects capable of raising it to an adoration and awful reverence of the deity the very precipice it stands on lofty and almost perpendicular whose semicircular base withstands the fury of the waves must have inspired the religious with a firm reliance on him who is the rock of ages the calms  the storms

advantage arising from thence the monks knew well how to avail themselves of it the exalted rock on which this monastery stood rendered it visible at a great distance at sea in every direction whence it presented itself as if reminding and exhorting seamen in danger to make their vows and promise masses and gifts to the virgin mary and st oswin for their deliverance vows of this kind were common among the ancients and are to this day it is said made in some catholic states where the walls of churches are covered with the paintings of ships boats and other votive memorials erasmus in his piece entitled the shipwreck has very humourously described and ridiculed this custom of bribing heaven in case of sudden emergency in germany below almost every dangerous fall or passage of the rhine there is a hermitage whose hermit or his agent waits on the passenger in the boat as soon as it has passed over requesting alms as a reward for his prayers to the efficacy of which it is intimated he owes

of the possessions of his grace the duke of northumberland  much of the remains of the priory were pulled down by mr villars for erecting the barracks lighthouse his own house near it and other edifices he likewise stripped off the lead which till then had covered the church gross   the first day of our abode here was employed in drawing views of the august remains the next morning being remarkably serene awaked me early to revisit the same scene and enjoy the sea breeze i walked toward the cliffs  the sun cast a ruddy gleam over a calm ocean  the breeze scarce ruffled the leaping surge  the horizon glowed with clouds tinged with gold and crimson above which the feint blue of the verge gradually deepened into azure as the eye advanced toward the zenith  the sea appeared of a pale green stripped with silver as the rays of light fell upon the tracks which were becalmed  the scene was enlivened by a fleet of vessels    in number of various degrees of burden which then passed in view  over the foreground of this prospect the solemn ruins were disposed in melancholy arrangement wearing a countenance more awful and majestic from the shadows which the eastern sun occasioned to be cast on them  on the right hand and left the landscape presented itself full of life and business and to add to the effects this view had on the mind the morning drum was heard from the garrison the hum of the distant voices of busy men and the sounding of the hollow shore beat by an advancing tide  leaving tynemouth we passed within sight of the barracks and batteries to  north shields which is not improperly compared to wapping the streets lanes and alleys are narrow dirty populace and noisy it is astonishing what business is incessantly going on here we were told there lay in harbor even at that season of the year above  00 sail of ships of considerable burden the crews of such a number of vessels the carpenpenters ropers victuallers and men concerned in the merchandising of such a fleet must necessarily occasion a mighty concourse and bustle to which being added the family of sailors residing here makes the place resemble a hive of bees  shields has advanced to its present state of populousness trade and riches from a very low estate within the space of two centuries the church was begun to be built in the year      in the beginning of the reign of king edward i it consisted only of six fishermens hovels by the arguments in a cause depending between the king and his burgesses of newcastle and the prior of tynemouth in the  0th year of that reign it appears that the prior had built a town upon the bank of the water of tyne on one side and the prior of durham another on the other side where no towns ought to be only lodges for fishermen and that the fishermen had there sold their fishes which ought to have been sold at newcastle and that both the said priors had caused to be made breweries and fisheries having great ships whereas they ought to have had but boats and had caused bread to be baked there which ought to have been baked at newcastle it was decreed that neither at tynemouth or shields there be any sale of things saleable as in meats drinks etc and that ships should not be laden or unladen there this will serve to show what was the state of this place in the   th century  we took a boat to examine this busy scene upon the water the sight of so many vessels and such a concourse of people is very pleasing it consequently brings to ones mind reflections on the powers of human faculties the genius of man is infinite if we could be taught for  000 years we should discover at that period from the learning we had acquired that we had an infinity of subjects yet to learn for the more knowledge man attains the wider circle of objects unattained opens upon him as the scale of numerical calculation is without end as the variations of musical tones are infinite so is mans genius by the use of letters we have accumulated the learning of ages yet after the conclusion of a few centuries all our acquisitions will perhaps appear to posterity as but minute members of the science of mankind before the use of letters with the fall of empires the accumulated knowledge of ages expired with them but henceforth it will not be so  how wonderfully perfect is all maritime science now to what it was in the most flourishing period of the egyptian and phoenician states we are told the timber for building the temple at jerusalem was floated in rafts this shows the force of the shipping then employed the mariners of antiquity seldom trusted themselves from the sight of the coast the grecian and roman fleets were composed of insignificant vessels compared with a british navy the discovery of the magnet has given infinite powers to the mariner our geometrical principles have fitted our vessels for swift sailing and the carriage of great burdens the ark of noah was little better than a huge cask rolling on the face of the deep whose preservation was miraculous and not mechanical amidst the perils of an universal ocean the vessels of the phoenicians were little superior to our limeboats their rigging and devices for sailing greatly inferior and the most excellent of the roman galleys comparable only to the gilded barges of a lord mayors show the most superb vessel we read of in antiquity was constructed by archimedes it was a whole year in building  had twenty benches of oars the enormous pile was fastened together on all sides with huge nails of copper that weighed each ten pounds and upwards the inside had in it three galleries or corridors the lowest of which led to the hold by a descent of stairs the second to apartments and the first to soldiers lodgings  on the right and left side of the middle gallery there were to the number of thirty apartments in each of which were four beds for men the apartment for the officers and seamen had    beds and three great rooms for eating the last of which that was at the poop served for a kitchen all the floors of these apartments were laid with small stories in different colors taken from the iliad of homer the ceilings windows and all the other parts were finished with wonderful art and embellished with all kinds of ornaments  in the uppermost gallery there was a gymnasium or place of exercise and walks proportionate to the magnitude of the ship in them were gardens and plants of all kinds disposed in wonderful order pipes some of hardened clay and others of lead conveyed water all round to refresh them there was also arbours of ivy and vines that had their roots in great vessels filled with earth these vessels were watered in the same manner with the gardens the arbours served to shade the walks  after these came the apartments of venus with three beds this was floored with agates and other precious stones the finest that could be found in the island the walls and roof were of cyprus wood the windows were adorned with ivory paintings and small statues in another apartment there was a library at the top of which on the outside was fixed a sundial  there was also an apartment with three beds for a bath in which were three great coppers and a bathing vessel made of a single stone of various colors this vessel contained   0 quarts at the ships head was a great reservoir of water which held an hundred thousand quarts all round the ship on the outside were atlasses of six cubits or nine feet in height which supported the sides of the ship these atlasses were at equal distance from each other the ship was adorned on all sides with paintings and had eight towers proportioned to its bigness two at the head two at the stern and four in the middle of equal dimensions upon these towers were parapets from which stones might be discharged upon the ships of an enemy that should approach too near each tower was guarded by four young men completely armed and two archers the inside of them was filled with stones and arrows  upon the side of the vessel well strengthened with planks was a a kind of rampart on which was an engine to discharge stones made by archimedes it threw a stone of  00 weight and an arrow of    cubits the distance of a stadium or     paces the ship had three masts at each of which were two machines to discharge stones there also were the hooks and great lumps of lead to throw upon such as approached the whole ship was surrounded with a rampart of iron to keep off those who should attempt to board it all round were iron graplings disposed which being thrown by the machines might catch hold on the enemys vessel and draw them close to the ship from whence it was easy to destroy them on each of the sides were  0 young men completely armed there were as many about the masts and at the engines for throwing stones  though the hold of this ship was exceeding deep a single man could clear it of all water with a machine made in the nature of a screw invented by archimedes  hiero having found there was no port in sicily capable of containing this vessel except where it could not lay without danger resolved to make a present of it to king ptolemy and sent it to alexandria this is supposed to be ptolemaeus philadelphus   this was a more unwieldy and ungovernable mass than noahs ark the comparison made between them and our shipping excites no small degree of wonder how they could ever perform the navigation for which they were respectively designed  what luxury what ease and splendor does britain enjoy from the labor of her mariners things which we have rendered the common necessaries of our lives are furnished from the distant quarters of the earth even the very lower classes mix the produce of the east and west indies for their common meal our dwellings are decorated from all the regions of the world and our tables are furnished with the dainties of every climate  the ancient eastern empires did not enjoy one half of our splendor or our luxury  when i compare this scene of man to the shepherds haunts on the skirts of cheviot mountains i am astonished on each hand at the wasted life and faculties of the shepherd and at the extended powers of the busy race before me  we passed by howden pans where a large ropery and smithery are carried on  walls end lay in our way formerly belonging to the monks of durham given to them by william de carilepho bishop of that see in

esquire wallis at a little distance lies  carr ville once the seat of the cosenss named by mr william carr who rebuilt it not many years ago near it is the extreme roman station on the wall by most antiquaries it is admitted to be the segedunum of the romans a name derived from its situation and being a magazine for corn for the supply of the roman stations from the manuscripts of the late roger gale esquire extract of a letter from chris hunter m d to roger gale esquire sir durham   th may      give me leave to attempt the recovery of one of the roman stations in this country both requisite for the security of navigation in the northern seas and the protection of their frontiers beyond the river tyne thereby saving the great expense and trouble of building the wall as far as the sea at tynemouth no less than three miles at least i mean that near south shields at the entrance of the said river into the ocean and which cannot but have flourished till the danish invasions as mr leland has it in his collectanea vol iv p    e regione tinmuthae fuit urbs vastata a danis urfa nomine ubi natus erat oswinus rex  the communication it had with binchester is visible in several places as is the angle where the paved way goes off from the military way leading to lanchester about three miles to the north of binchester and passes to the northeast through brancepeth park thence a little to the south of brandon and is lost in the cultivated grounds but appearing upon durham moor in the same direction again passing by haghouse and below upon harbrass moor is very visible tending past lumley castle in a direct line toward south shields passing about a mile to the east of chester in the street without any signs of communication therewith two elevated pavements in the river tyne the one at the west end of south shields the other on the north side of the river near the end of the roman wall proper for their safe landing at different times of the flowing and ebbing tide fully shows its necessary correspondence with segedunum the first station upon the wall but another military way called wreken dyke passing from this station to the west has hitherto frustrated the enquiries of our late antiquaries mr horsley himself pointing out its ductus very justly over gateside fell where it passed the public road and a little to the west the roman way going to the south from newcastle to chester in the street and afterward running through lamesley and kibblesworth fields advances to the southwest over blackburn moor and through the township of hedley it comes next to causey a village which owes its name to it and from thence ascends a high hill and terminates at a square fortification upon the top thereof at stanley the seat of the hon sir nicholas tempest bart who i am told possesses several roman coins found therein  this place though not above three miles from chester in the street and four from lanshester seems to have had no immediate communication with either of them no vestigia of any paved way appearing upon the adjoining moors and being situated as chester itself at the termination of a military way gives me convincing reason to believe the use of each has been the same namely to guard herds of cattle at grass for the subsistence of the two garrisons of south shields and pons aelii and for victualling ships resorting to the first place whereas had its elevated situation been intended to form a castrum exploratorium then must the advantage of paved ways to the next stations have been necessary for the speedy conveyance of intelligence though this last military way bears the name of wreken dyke i am apt to believe that name is rather due to the way leading from binchester to south shields especially from the authority of ranulph higden who says the wreken dyke or reken dyke passed from the west of england and ended at tinemouth i dare not fix a roman name to this our station without the authority of inscriptions  i am sir etc chris hunter    it lay conveniently for the small vessels employed by the romans on the coast to scour the seas of piratical rovers from the ruins it seems to have had a quay for the convenience of merchandise or perhaps was decorated with some pleasure buildings on the shore it was the station of the first cohort of the lergi in the walls of mr cousinss seat before it was rebuilt mr horsley observed several roman inscriptions which are preserved in his work severuss wall has very manifestly terminated in a square fort or station above a furlong to the east of the mansion called cousinss house the ruins of a roman station and town at this place are very discernible though it has all been ploughed and is now a very rich meadow the stones and rubbish of the buildings are levelled and covered with earth and grass but yet the ramparts of the fort may be distinctly traced out both they and the ditch being visible almost quite round  in mr warburtons vallum romanum and mr horsleys brit romans are the following particulars which i will transcribe as at the time i visited this station i could not traverse the ground without injuring the crops growing there are very evident remains of two turrets at the western and eastern entries to the station and of another at the southwest corner the west entry has been close to the wall and the eastern one directly opposite to it the fort has been about   0 yards or perhaps six chains square and so the contents of it above three acres and an half about  0 yards of the western and eastern sides lie without or to the north of the line of the wall and eighty within it so that the wall falls upon the sides of the station not far from the middle of them the south rampart of this fort is about three quarters of a furlong from the river side and runs along the brow of the hill or at the head of a considerable descent from thence to the river there have been ruins of buildings on this part and to the southwest of the fort but they are now so levelled and covered that little evidence appears above ground yet the stones and remains of rubbish are easily discovered when the surface is any where removed and some of these inequalities in the surface which usually arise from ruins yet remain and may easily be perceived to be hillocks of stones or rubbish mr horsley gives the following inscriptions as belonging to this place  i cohortis primae centuria fiari posuit  this stone with the five next as also a piece of an altar and part of a pedestal are all placed in niches in the outside of the wall belonging to cousins house where they have stood unobserved and neglected for many years and being exposed to the winds and weather have suffered very much by that means i cannot find that the least notice has been taken of them before the four first are plainly centurial such as were generally placed in the face of the wall and are rarely found in any other station hence we have one argument that this station was built at the same time with the wall in the reign of severus the cohorts mentioned in these inscriptions were certainly legionary the mark for the century is very clear and distinct in all of them and the names of the centurions as in most others of the same kind are in the genitive for which reason i think that the mark is not to be read centurio but centuria as it is frequently read in gruter and that posuit is to be supplied or understood at the end so that cohortis primae centuria fiari is much the same as to say such a captains company of such a regiment indeed centurio cohortis or the centurion of a cohort does often occur in inscriptions but does not necessarily imply that the whole command of the cohort was in a single centurion for we have also centurio legionis and miles legionis which can signify no more than such a person was a centurion or a soldier in such a legion  iii  coh x  erected by the century of justinus secundus in the tenth cohort ivstini  erected by the century of justinus secundus in the tenth cohort secvndi  erected by the century of justinus secundus in the tenth cohort   iv  cohortis decimae centuria siinsi prisci posuit  this has sustained more damage than the former by being exposed to the weather for the number of the cohort is effaced the mark for the century is also faint and one of the centurions names very obscure but the other name priscus is plain and clear the letters being gross though short and cut very deep in the stone the former name siinsus sounds somewhat oddly but there are many as uncouth in gruter  vi jovi optimo maximo  a small altar no other inscription appearing   mr gordon supposes that the wall itself forms almost a right angle and then is continued down to the side of the river but it is the western rampart of the station which makes that angle with the wall nor does this rampart reach the river though it is likely the town or buildings without the fort may have extended so far on the north side of the station there are some crooked risings and setlings of the ground which at first view appeared to me not unlike a round fort or tower projecting from the station with a triple rampart and ditch the two closes in which the roman town and station have stood are called wall laws if the name laws be owing to the rising ground only the termination laws or lowes which signifies hills so far corresponds to the roman name segedunum but as there were two distinct tumuli observed by mr warburton remaining near a place he calls the beehouses and not far from these closes he apprehends that from them they have borrowed this name a law or low being one of those names by which tumuli are frequently expressed there was an altar and some centurial inscriptions at cousinss house in mr horsleys time  the wall having left this station passes on westward and at a little distance the remains of a castellum are visible it is  0 feet square like those mentioned in the most western parts of this county it is built close to the wall and wholly within it on the south side from hence the wall passes by walker or wallkier or byker hill and thence descends to ewesburn where are some ruinous heaps which may probably have been the remains of some of the smaller exploratory turrets that have been placed all the way upon the wall hence the wall seems to have passed through the house at red barns and enters newcastle at pandon gate  mr horsley and other authors seem very doubtful of the vestiges of the military way from the walls end to newcastle near the red barns and upon the descent from byker hill to ewesburn they conceived the track where it had gone might in some places be traced but the appearance was so very faint and obscure they would not insist upon it  as for hadrians vallum mr warburton says he could no where in all this space discern the least track of it nor did he ever hear of any traditionary account of its having been there  mr pennant tour in scotland vol ii p     says it was supposed to have reached no further than pons aelii or newcastle on the east but by an account he had recently received from mr robert harrison of that town he found it extended on this side as far as the wall of severus a broken stone has lately been discovered at walls end with this inscription hadr  mvr cond  hoc marm  pos coss d    the distance from the station at the end of the wall to st nicholass church in newcastle is exactly three measured miles and five furlongs and in this space there are three castella all visible that which should have been next in course is lost in the station at newcastle  little benton and long benton were in our view as we passed little benton one of the manors of the barony of heron of which it was held by eustace de benton in the reign of king henry iii now the residence of the family of big william big esquire high sheriff of northumberland       thomas charles big esquire high sheriff       wallis in the   th year of king edward ii it belonged to jeffrey de scroop of masham in yorkshire afterward it came to ralph lord greystock and in the reign of king henry vi it was the possession of william fitz hugh and by him given to his son henry  long benton a dependant manor of the barony of morpeth the church stands at a little distance from the village which with some lands in the parish were given by sir philip somerville to baliol college oxford for the perpetual maintenance of six scholars  heaton lay to our right anciently held of the barony of gaugy now the possession of sir matthew white ridley bart an elegant mansion ornamented with plantations in a good taste the following account of this place and its possessors i have extracted from the notes of mr bournes history of newcastle page      it has been handed down by tradition to the present day that this was a place of retreat for king john when he came into this country and there are still to be seen the ruins of an ancient building which carries the name of king johns palace on the north side of this old building are the remains of a fortification which it is natural to conjecture was built for the safety and security of this house and consequently this house must have been of some great distinction robert de gaugy was a great man in the reign of king john and had special trust reposed in him by his sovereign and it is not improbable when the king came to these parts he lodged at this house  the present house was built in the year      and is so situated that on the west it overlooks the town moor fenham and part of the lands of the prior of tinmouth on the east it faces the shields road on the north it has a most agreeable prospect to the windings of the ouse burn of its woods and banks and of the villages situated on it on the south it faces the river tyne  hardriding near haltwhistle is the ancient seat of the ridley family above one of the old doors there a date earlier than the conquest appears and the initial letters of the builder n r this was a younger branch of the ridleys of willimoteswicke of which branch was john ridley a major in the service of king charles i in the duke of newcastles army  bishop nicholas ridley was of this branch and was born here mr bourn says i presume he means at hardriding he was educated in grammar at newcastle on tyne he suffered in      near baliol college in

in grand serjeancy by carrying the kings writ between the rivers tyne and coquet and making distresses of goods for the kings debts  we approached newcastle by pampeden gate it is not my purpose to attempt a particular history or description of this place the subject is too complicated and extensive to be treated at large consistent with the plan i have hitherto pursued a general account is all i shall attempt a worthy friend is compiling with great labor and industry and at vast expense a general history and minute description of new castle to his labors i must refer the curious who i doubt not will find therein infinite pleasure and satisfaction  newcastle though greatly increased in size wealth trade and number of inhabitants since camdens time then merited the following description it makes a glorious appearance as the very eye of all the towns in this part of the kingdom ennobled by a fine haven where ships of great burden lay in security it is situate on the uneven risings of a hill north of the river tyne over which is a fair bridge on the left hand thereof stands the castle and on the right the marketplace and principal part of the city in regard to the elegance of its buildings from thence the ascent is very steep to the upper town which is of much greater extent than the lower graced with four churches and fortified with strong walls having eight gates with several towers this description given by camden compared with the present state of the town will clearly point out the great improvements made therein since his time  it is admitted by all antiquaries that this place is of roman origin from the manuscripts of roger gale esquire extract of a letter from chr hunter esquire m d to roger gale esquire  th may      pliny is the only author we can gather any thing from remarkable concerning the varduli and that so very concise i think deserves a place here in conventum cluniensem varduli ducunt populos xiv ex qutbus albanenses tantum nominare libeat not hist lib iii ca   sect   of the last paris edition and in lib iv ca  0 sect    he enumerates the verduloruin oppida morosgi menosca vesperies amanum portus ubi nunc flaviobriga colonia where mr hardauin recites the modern names and as gruters almost infinite collection affords no inscription wherein the varduli are named i presume the roman economy under the emperor trajan by descent a spaniard if not sooner had abolished the old distinctions of separate governments and reduced the whole province under one general name hispania which afterward the notitia imperii occidentalis divides into three consular provinces under the direction of presidents and places no garrison of the varduli in any fortress in the eastern or western empire  i am sir yours etc chris hunter   answer to the preceding letter by mr gale london  th june      as to the two inscriptions you sent me i will venture to give you my thoughts on them not doubting but you will excuse me where i differ from you since what i offer proceeds only from a love of truth and no spirit of altercation  the first of them is very curious as it gives us the name of a legatus augustalis and propraetor hitherto unknown in britain and which ought as i think to be read as follows  numini augusti et genio cohortis secundae vardullorum equitatae miliariae sub antistio advento legato augusti propraetore f tiranus tribunus dat dedicatque rite  to read g r in the  th line gregulium is not a little doubtful it cannot well be supposed that the tribune of the cohort would dedicate an alter to the deity of the emperor and at the same time to the genius of the common soldiers exclusive of the genius of the officers of which he himself was one and how to read it otherwise is as uncertain if the letters are g r as in your copy but if they are c r as on the altar given us by mr horsley durham no    in his brit romans and which you say has c very apparent instead of g they may denote civium romanorum and these varduli a people of spain admitted to the freedom of the city of rome for some extraordinary merit or by some emperors favor perhaps their countryman trajans this was a privilege frequently conferred on foreigners even whole towns and nations and at last communicated by antoninus pius omnibus vide span exercit de civ romans apud graevii these tom xi p    s c in commune subjectis by which it seems as if this altar had been erected before this general grant of that emperor for it is no great honor or advantage for these varduli to value themselves upon if they had enjoyed it only in common with all the rest of the world monsieur spanheim observes exercit  ma ad constitution imp antonini de civ romans quod sub m antonino imp civitate donati essent quicunq in romani orbis provinciis aut oppidis delecti essent milites ut praesidiarii in imperii limitibus constituerentur this seems contradictory to the first mentioned grant since it only confers the freedom of the city upon the soldiers in garrison on the frontiers of the empire and the other gives it to all the subjects of the roman empire without exception perhaps the soldiers had this advantage given them at first and upon finding the encouragement it gave them to defend the countries where they were quartered it was thought advisable to admit all the subjects of the empire to the same privilege to interest them the more in preserving the whole from the attacks of the barbarians but there has been no small uncertainty among the learned to which of the antonini this constitution is owing some attributing it to antoninus pius others to marcus aurelius and mr spanheim with great reason to antoninus caracalla from dion cassius chiefly who tells us this privilege was granted by him omnibus qui in orb romano erant not so much for the honor and advantage of it to the people as for the filling his treasury since it made them liable to the payment of several taxes from which they were before exempted so that the soldiers had this benefit conferred on them for their services and the rest of the people afterward most likely to drain their purses  in gruters thesaur p cccclv   is mentioned t antistius praefectus alae sulpiciae c r i e civium romanorum and in page cccclix   l praesentius praefectus coh i afr c r e which is read praefectus cohortis primae afrorum civium romanorum equitatae vide urfatus c r just the same as that at lanchester only changing afrorum into vardulorum a cohors equitata was composed partly of horse partly of foot as vegetius lib    c   informs us prima cohors habet mill centum et quinque equites loricator centum triginta duos et appellatur milliaria i must own the cohors in this inscription is called secunda vardulorum but that is only in respect to the cohors prima vardulorum of which an inscription was found at riechester in northumberland this second cohors of the varduli might however be the prima auxiliaria of some legion perhaps the vi and in more esteem for some eminent service or fortunate accident than the first not dignified with the honorable title and privileges civium romanorum and perhaps also independent of any legion and after all the sole reason why one of these cohorts was called the first and the other the second might have been from the priority of time when they were first raised  this antistius adventus seems also to have been legatus augusti and propaetor in belgium from an altar found near utrecht upon which he is called caius antistius  jovi opt maximo summano exsuperantissimo soli invicto opollini lunae dianae fortunae marti victoria paci colus antisius adventus legatus augusti propraetore dat and this justifies my reading of his titles here legatas augusti propraetore dat and not legionis augustae propraetore there being no mention of a military body in the belgic inscription besides we never meet with a legion styled augusta singly without some other adjunctive distinction as the legio ii vi or antoniniana augusta nor could there be any such officer as a praetor or propaetore legionis that magistrate being entirely civil  sir yours etc r gale    but of what importance or magnitude the roman station was which occupied a part of this ground no evidence appears camden adopts the name of gabrosentum which he thinks might be derived from its vicinity to the steeps on the opposite shore of tyne as being the haunt of herds of goats these etymologies are sometimes so constrained that they rather bewilder than instruct it is as probable the name of gabrosentum might from the same cause extend to the cliffs and hills on both sides of the river the notitia places gabrosentum within the wall and makes it the station of the second cohort of thracians other antiquaries dr hunter mr horsley mr pennant insist upon its name of pons aelii where the romans had a bridge to the southern shore and that it was garrisoned by the cohors cornoviorum this they attempt to confirm from the traces of a military road discovered in a lineal direction from the bridge to chesterlestreet dr stukeley conjectures that this was the station admurum of richard of cirencester dr stukely p    in his map of britania romana no altars or inscriptions have been discovered to ascertain the name if there was once a roman station here every vestigia thereof must long since have been destroyed by the works of a large populous and ancient town the remains of the roman wall or wall of severus have frequently been discovered by workmen in digging the foundations of buildings in those parts of the town through which it lay it passed from the west through the vicarage gardens the groat market the north part of st nicholass church and from thence to pandon gate this gate bears singular marks of antiquity the superstructure is of different workmanship and model from any others on the town wall the arches are circular and there appears that natural decay on the whole structure which might happen in such a number of years camden says at pandon gate there remains it is presumed one of the turrets of the roman wall differing in form and workmanship from the others on the walls of the town by the dimensions which i took of this gateway i find it nearlycorresponds with the other ports or gates in the roman wall it is said the carpenters tower is also of roman original the reputed antiquity of pandon gate is denoted in a proverb of common acceptance as old as pandon yates  we have no authorities to fix the certain era when or by whom this place was first inhabited from the evacuation of the romans or how long it remained deserted after their departure like other strongholds within the defense of the roman wall it is reasonable to conceive it was very early resorted to by the distressed britons and was kept up by them as a place of security against the northern rovers the first name we find it distinguished by in history was monkchester which shows that it was noted for being the habitation of religious men pennant what society of religious and whether saxons or not took up their residence here at what time they first possessessed the place or when they were expelled are circumstances unknown all the evidence remaining is the name only bid in his ecclesiastical history and life of st cuthbert is totally silent relative to them and as his residence was at jarrow situated within a few miles and he died in     the name of monkchester and the residence of those religious must have succeeded his death mr pennant says their destruction must have been early for the venerable bede takes no notice of the place the ruin therefore of this place cannot be attributed to the danes whose first invasion did not take place till after the death of that historian it appears to me the argument holds the other way for had it been the residence of any religious society who suffered persecution before or in the time of bid he would have noticed it fiftynine years elapsed between the time of bedes death and the first descent of the danes on northumberland in this period of time the increase of religious houses was very rapid and it is reasonable to conceive such examples as landisfarn and jarrow had produced would greatly promote like institutions in their neighborhood from hollinsheads authority we are induced to believe that on the visitation of aldwin alfrin and remfrid in  0   there was not a monastery remaining in this part of northumberland and scarce a church was left standing  this was a desirable situation for the danes when they entered the tyne and to that era i am inclined to fix the destruction of the religious society which had settled here and from whose residence the name of monkchester was derived  in  0 0 when robert courthose the son of william the conqueror returned from his scotch expedition he halted here to refresh his army and finding the situation proper for a fortress to command the turbulent borderers and the river well adapted for the reception of succors by sea as well as trade built a castle here to which he gave the name of newcastle in contradistinction it is said to a small circular tower bourne which the monks held or to the roman turrets on the wall  from this period we may date the growing importance of the place the protection of a fortress on the banks of so fine a river would draw thither a great number of setlers and trade would soon begin to flourish under such propitious circumstances there was so rapid a progress in its improvements that before the death of king david i of scotland who held it as a member of his earldom of northumberland it was become a place of great importance david having founded here two monasteries tanner     keith tanner says a nunnery was founded here as early as the conquest  newcastle was defended by a strong wall and an outward ditch of great depth now much gone to decay from lelands account it appears that this fortification was begun in the reign of king edward i and completed in the reign of king edward iii a rich citizen having been taken prisoner in the middle of the town by the hasty irruption of a hardy band of scots who would not set him at liberty without a considerable sum for his ransom on his return he set about to secure his native place by a wall his fellowcitizens promoting so important a work for the protection of their merchandise and riches in the   th year of the reign of king edward i the royal license for fortification was obtained but it is the opinion of some that the northern wall was built in the reign of king john and that the remaining part of this fortification began from the above event in the reign of edward i greys chorograph the circuit of the wall rather exceeds two miles two miles and     yards it is defended by towers the chief of which are of a cemicircular figure machicolated towers are intermixed but not regularly which project a little over the wall and there are also many guerrets they were decorated with the effigies of men cut in stone placed on the tops of them as though they were watching they had square holes over the walls to throw stones down   there were seven ancient gates a gate at the bridge end  then turning on the right hand to the key a chapel of the town with a macsun dieu  then a certain houses with a watar gate and a sqware haull place for the town

were added in more modern times bridge gate which guarded the pass of the bridge and sand gate which opens upon the rivers banks the wall formerly extended between bridge gate and sand gate which part some few years ago was taken down to open the quay an alteration greatly for the convenience of trade the form of the wall there proved it to be of the most modern date of any part of the fortifications there being therein many small gates to give access to the quays sand gate had no tower above it as the other gates  the gate of walkknowle is said by some to be of roman architecture the wall upon the knoul cannot be understood of any other than the roman wall because it had this name from very ancient times long before the building of the town wall  bourne and part of severuss work its present superstructure is modern being the hall of the carpenters company this was one of the roman towers as was very visible before the taking down the upper part of it for it was of the same size model and stone with the tower of rutchester in northumberland  ibid   pampedon is the next gate formerly opening upon an ancient town of that name which was united with newcastle by the grant of king henry iii a d      whereby it was ordained et quod praedicta villa novi castri et terrae and tenemen predict in pampedon unica villa etcet sunt et unus burgus ad uniend et concludend dictam vallam novi castri in emendationem et augmentationem ejus villae etc it is said that in pampedon was a palace of the saxon kings of northumberland pennant bourne this gateway was defended by folding gates of iron wallis the present ascent to the top of the wall is by stairs two yards wide from the remains of the superstructure it is not at this time possible to gain any certain idea of the form or capaciousness of the roman turrets  the part of the wall which extends from sand gate to pampedon and from thence to the austin friars tower is pointed out by mr wallis as being the work of the burgher who was surprised by the scots king edward iii granted to the corporation the duties and customs of the town for the term of seven years to enable them to complete the fortification but finding them negligent of a work of such importance he revoked the grant and constituted henry de percy ralph de nevil john de fenwick john de creyk and robert de fenwick then sheriff of northumberland commissioners for keeping the town after which the franchises were not restored to the burgesses till they consented to perfect the work at their own costs wallis in the reign of king henry viii this place is said to have exceeded in the strength and magnificence of its works all the cities of england and most places in europe lelands itin   a small tower called corner tower

the next place is a postern called white friar gate a convenient passage for the carmelites or white friars to and from their monastery  not far from thence is the white friar tower built on the summit of a vast eminence above the street called the close its form is circular it is flagged on the top and embrazured from thence you have the most extensive prospect any part of these fortifications commands you view the whole of the upper town and great part of the lower a vast tract of country down the river and a landscape as beautiful and extensive toward the west and north as any in this part of northumberland this building is attributed to the house of carmelites which stood immediately opposite its eminence is such that from the close gate you ascend to it by   0 steps the inner part of the tower contains the masons hall  the close gate is near the present extremity of the wall on the banks of tyne i am inclined to conceive the ancient fortification of this town did not consist of an entire circumvallation but that the walls terminated in two points as they approached the river near to close gate and sand gate the town after the completing of the walls was divided into    wards according to the number of the gates and round towers in the wall which towers and gates were wont to be defended in times of hostility with the scots by the particular wards appropriated to them  bourne   having described the walls i must in the next place consider the interior fortress  the castle all authors agree was built by robert carthouse son of william the conqueror in the year  0 0 on his return from his scotch expedition he perceived the great consequence of such a fortress on the frontiers commanding so fine a river and in a situation excellently calculated for assembling the northern levies on any disturbance on the borders the tower built by robert was of great strength square and surrounded by two walls the height of the tower is    feet the square on the outside    feet by    the walls    feet thick with galleries gained out of them there was a chapel within the tower pennant the outward fortifications are now defaced and their site crowded with buildings the tower still remains entire the corners projecting from the plane of the square a mode much practiced in the norman structures it is situate on a lofty eminence commanding the whole town the principal entrance is on the south what number of gates were in the outward wall we cannot now determine but from bournes account of it which i shall quote in its proper place the area enclosed by this wall contained three acres and one rood the castle belongs to the county of northumberland and makes no part of the liberties of newcastle or its sheriffdom the government of it   st september  st of king henry vii was granted to william close esquire for life as constable and in the  th year of the same reign it was granted to roger fenwick esquire with  0l per annum salary since which time i do not find that any constable has been appointed but the sheriffs of northumberland had custody of the castle it now serves for the county prison and in the great hall the judges of assize hold the gaol delivery  soon after the building of this castle it is said by bourne that robert de mowbray earl of northumberland when in rebellion against king william rufus was besieged therein and this fortress after suffering much damage was taken but i confess i do not find sufficient authorities to support this assertion of my author and think it is much to be doubted the scots by treachery a d      in the  st year of the reign of king stephen gained possession of the castle and town which they held to the year      when malcolm iv ceded the northern counties to king henry ii in the   year of henry the   the king of scotts had the erledom of lancastre in his hands the cite of cairluel bamburgh castle and newcastel  lel col v   p       the castle having suffered much by neglect in that and the succeeding reign king john restored it and added a ditch to the fortifications in doing which he was obliged to destroy several houses as a compensation to the owners of these tenements he ordered   0s  d rents in escheats to be paid yearly as is set forth in his charter to the town the records have of late years been strictly kept and much interest must be used to have access to the archieves to me whose intention was chiefly to make a descriptive view such applications were not of such moment as they are to the learned compiler from whom we may in a little time hope to receive a complete history of newcastle this castle was considered of such consequence that most of the neighboring baronies paid considerable sums toward its support under the articles of castleward and cornage the several sums are mentioned in bournes history the barony of herons  dilston  walton  bolbeck  bolam  gaugye  marley  bothal  delaval  rosse  bywell and  copun  besides the larger payments several small ones issued from sundry houses and lands in the town  bourne says in the  th of king edward iii an inquisition was taken at this town whereby it was found that at the time of the battle of bannockburn which was in the year      when john de kenont knight was high sheriff of northumberland the castle and all its edifices about it were in good repair that after that time nicholas scot adam de swinburn william riddel johannes de fenwick cuthbert de broughdon johannes de fenwick johannes de woodhorn johannes de lilleburn willielmus de tynedale roger mauduit and robertus darreius were high sheriffs of northumberland during which time the great tower and also the lesser ones of the said castle the great hall with the kings chamber adjoining to it together with diverse other chambers below in the queens mantle and the buttery cellar and pantry the kings chapel within the castle a certain house beyond the gate which is called the chequer house with the bridges within and without the gate with three gates and one postern were  00l worse than before they also say that there are in the custody of roger mauduit late high sheriff   0 fother of lead they say also that it was thought highly necessary that the baron heron of huddeston the baron of walton lord robert clifford of the new place chief lord of the barony of gaugie the lords of the barony of  and devilston that the lord of werk upon tweed the lord of the barony of bolbeck alias bywell the baron of bothal and lastly the baron of delaval should build each of them a house within the liberties of the castle for the defense of it  there were two great strong walls which surrounded the castle the interior wall was of no great distance from the castle itself as may be still seen in several places the exterior wall surrounds the verge of the castle borders from this outer wall were four gates the great gate and three posterns the north side of the castle is the main gate called now the black gate it had two port culicesses one without the gate as may be still seen and another within it at a little distance from it the ruins of which were to be seen a few years ago there still remains a piece of the old wall which shows its situation to have been where that house is which was lately purchased by mr jasper harrison the shop belonging to this house was dug as i am informed out of the wall just now mentioned on the east side of the castle there was a postern which led down to the street called the side which is still to be seen it was once called but many years after it was in decay the waist of laurentius acton on the south side of the castle is another gate which leads down the castle stairs to the street called the close this was the south postern there is a building upon it which was the county goalers house on the west side was the postern facing bailiff gate now the dwelling house of james lidster  there is an house in the yard which they say was the chapel of of the garrison which is called the chapel house to this day it stands northeast from the chapel its common name now is the three bullsheads  by an inquisition taken in the reign of king james i it appears this castle was then much out of repair and in the   th of the same reign another having been taken complaint was made that a great dunghill heaped up against the wall on the west side of the castle had done damage to the amount of   0l it was under the same inquisition complained that the great square tower was full of chinks and crannies and that onethird of it was almost taken away that all the lead and coverings which it had of old were embezzled and carried off insomuch that the prisoners of the county of northumberland were most miserably lodged by reason of the showers of rain falling on them the computation made for repairs was  0 l   s in      the dunghill was taken away by sir john morley and it is said was used to make a rampart on the town walls against the scots he also repaired the round tower under the moothall now called the half moon wallis   it has been continues bourne a building of great strength and no little beauty the vast thickness of the walls speaks the one and the ruins of some curious workmanship the other the grand entrance into the castle was at the gate facing the south which leads up a pair of stairs which still shows the magnificence of the builder to a very stately door of curious masonry the room this leads into has its floor broken down close to the castle wall as indeed all the other floors are to the top of the castle so that excepting the floor above the county gaol there is not one left though there have been five divisions or stories of the castle besides this this floored room which i was told was lately flagged by the order of william ellison esquire when he was mayor in      seems to me without any doubt to have been the common hall of the castle because on the north side of the same room there is an entrance by a descent of some steps into a room where is the largest fire place i saw in the castle which plainly speaks it to have been the kitchen at the end of this there are several stairs which lead into a place under the kitchen which i think goes down as low as the bottom of the castle this i take to have been a cellar as i do also that little dark place on the right hand coming up again to have been a sort of pantry the door i mentioned just now on the east of the castle which leads to the first broken down floor is because of its grandeur and beauty an argument that this room has been the most stately one in the whole castle another reason for its being so is because of the windows which gave light into it those of them that face the east are the most beautiful of the whole castle beside on the south of this room there is an entrance into a sort of a parlour or withdrawing room which has a fire place in it and has been a piece of curious workmanship as is visible to this day and this place has no communication with any part of the castle but this room on the north side of this room is a door leading into an apartment where stands a well of considerable depth it was    yards before we touched the surface of the water which seems to have been placed there on purpose for the more immediate service of this room there are some little basins on the top of the well with pipes leading from them which conveyed water to different apartments of the castle this is plain from what may be observed in the county gaol at the bottom of the castle the round stone pillar in it having an hollow in the middle of a foot wide with a lead spout in the side of it  in the inquisition made in the  th of king edward iii above mentioned among other things that were complained of for being neglected one was capella domini regis infra castrum this chapel i have been told stood on that part of the castle yard where the moothall is but upon searching i found it in the castle itself according to the account of it just now mentioned the door of it is at the bottom of the south wall of the castle adjoining to the stairs which lead into the state chamber it has been a work of great beauty and ornament and is still in the midst of dust and darkness by far the most beautiful place in the whole building the inside of it being curiously adorned with arches and pillars it is easy to observe the different parts of it the entrance the body of it and the chancel on the left side of the entrance you go into a dark little room which undoubtedly was the vestry the full length of it was    yards the breadth six yards and a half it had three or four windows toward the east which are now all filled up nor is there any light but what comes in at a little cranny in the wall nicholas de byker tenet terras suas ut faciat districtiones ad ward novi castri super tynam faciend et pro deb domini regis inter tynam et coquet etc and then my authority goes on to say that the manor of byker was sir ralph lawsons knt deceased after of henry lawson esquire his son and now of his eldest son who without all question is bailiff by inheritance of the said castle and is to levy these castle wards cornages etc and other rents issues fines and amerciaments belonging to the said castle  in the   th of king james i      a grant was made of the site and demesnes of the castle to alexander stevenson esquire who was succeeded by one patrick black who died and left it in the possession of his wife after that one james langton claimed patrick blacks right but by virtue of what is not known  the liberties and privileges of the castle extend northwards to the river of tweed and southward to the river of tees  in the year       0 king george ii the site and demesnes of the castle were granted to george liddell esquire for  0 years from   july      rent  00 chaldron of coals for greenwich hospital  the next subjects of antiquity to be attended to are the religious

was given by three sisters whose names have long since been ungratefully buried in oblivion  when was the particular time of its building i have met with no account but it is not difficult to give a probable guess the order itself of the dominicans or black friars came into england in the year      consequently it must have been founded after that time and that it must have been founded some years before the year    0 is plain to a demonstration for in that year which was the  th of king henry i the black friars had license from the king to break a door through this new or town wall into their garden which proves them a regular settled body at that time and therefore that their priory was built some years before that license  we are told that this monastery was in old time called the gray friars which in my opinion is a thing highly improbable for the gray friars or franciscans came not into england till about the year      and if as i have proved above the black friars were a settled body some years before    0 how is it possible to have been called of old time the gray friars this is therefore a mistake and besides the dominicans came into england before the franciscans or gray friars and therefore more probably were sooner in this place  it has been a very stately building as appears by the present remains of it the area or grass plot is about    feet in length and as many in breadth on the east side of it was the chapel which is now the hall of the company of smiths in this town on the west side of it is a curious old well which served the monastery with water called our ladys well on the south may still be seen the ruins of a curious front on which side is the hall of the cordwainers in which i saw a pair of winding stairs which they told me before they were walled up led by a vault as far as the nunnery of st bartholomew on the north of it were their gardens a part of which was the wardens close before the building of that part of the town wall this appears by the charter granted to the monastery in the reign of edward i about the breaking out that narrow gate in the wall between westgate and newgate in which grant it is said that the wall went through the middle of their garden the monastery was dependant on the priory of tynemouth  in the reign of edward ii the brethren of this monastery had license granted them for the building of a draw bridge beyond the new ditch of the castle  who were the priors of this monastery what eminent men belonged to them or what things were transacted by them from their beginning till their dissolution were things undoubtedly preserved among themselves whilst they were a body but after their surrender were either destroyed or have not yet come to light  one of the priors of this monastery was one richard marshall i take this gentleman to have been the last prior of this monastery for in the   th of king henry viii a grant of a tenement near the white cross signed by friar richard marshall doctor and prior and friar david simpson and friar john sourby was given to anthony godsalve upon his paying to the said priory or monastery  s per annum this grant is now in the possession of mr thomas marshall of newcastle joiner who purchased this tenement and has lately rebuilt it he pays the same rent to the town of newcastle which the tenement paid to the monastery about two years after the signing of this deed in january the  0th of this reign this monastery surrendered it consisted of a prior and    friars  what became of the brethren of this friary after their surrender what they had allowed them annually for a maintenance or whether they had any thing allowed at all does not appear some account indeed i met with afterward of the prior himself but none of the friars it is this which follows  richard marshall prior of the black friars in newcastle about the year      went into scotland and preached at st andrews that the paternoster should be addressed to god and not to the saints some doctors of the university being disgusted at this assertion prevailed with one tofts a gray friar to undertake to prove that the paternoster might be said to the saints whose ignorance in doing the same was so manifest that he became the common jest and quitted the town  after the surrender of this monastery the black friars was granted to the town of newcastle in consideration of   l  s  d the annual value of it was  l   s  d  the king says in his grant that he gives to the mayor and burgesses of newcastle the whole house and site lately a priory or house of brethren called vulgarly the black friars in newcastle upon tyne the chapelhouses edifices gardens etc the hall two chambers a chamber called the cross chamber and two gardens with their appurtenances and the whole close within the westgate and another close near the site of the said priory on the north and a close containing three acres and a house in the same close without the walls of the said town and a house called the gatehouse situated near the said street it also appears from the first grant that the king reserved to himself and successors the bells and lead that was upon the church belonging to this friary and the other buildings of it the lead in the gutters together with the stones and iron of the church etc  the nine crafts of this town had their meeting houses or halls in it and still have except two of them the tailors and the cordwainers who have bestowed these upon some poor widows and got themselves others in their places these halls are of great service to this ancient building in preserving it from entire ruin such is the hall of the smiths which was repaired by them in the year   0  the hall of the dyers the hall of the bakers and brewers which was repaired by them in the year      these halls are on the east side of the friary such also are those on the west side of it viz the hall of the sadlers which was repaired by them in the year      and the hall of the skinners and glovers which was repaired by them in the year      such are those also on the south side of it viz the cordwainers hall which was turned into apartments for three widows in the year      the hall of the butchers and the hall of the tanners were repaired in the year       by the means of these halls there is still some visage of the friary remaining which had otherwise been entirely in dust it is a pity that those people who are permitted by the companies to reside in some of those rooms are not threatened into more cleanliness this still remains a matter of complaint for it is abominably filthy and the curious pass through it amidst those unseemly annoyance of which some animals are peculiarly delicate in their concealment and that the companies themselves are not at the expense of repairing the area were these things done it would be a beautiful piece of antiquity and the entertainment of the curious from whence soever they come  brown willis in his history of

assigned thereto the great tithes excepted a state of the lectureships from the manuscripts of dr chapter hunter  it appears that pearson lecturer of st nicholas about   0  was paid quarterly a salary out of the town of newcastle and likewise for several years after during his continuance  it appears that shaw was about      lecturer of st johns and had a salary quarterly paid him out of the town and the like for several years after during his continuance  fran gray about      was lecturer of st andrews and had also a salary quarterly paid him out of the town and the like for several years after during his continuance  there were lecturers of all saints about the same time as dr jennison and others who had also a salary paid them out of the town and continued in the like manner till the late civil wars  the salaries were not one and the same but added and increased as the town thought fit upon this first settlement they had those salaries out of the town for preaching in the forenoon and the parishes contributed for their preaching in the afternoons some time after the town of newcastle made an addition to the former salaries and gave them an allowance for preaching both forenoon and afternoon after which augmentation the parishes gave no further contribution in this state have the lectureships continued ever since with an alteration still of salaries more or less as there was occasion and at the will and pleasure of the patrons and when any vacancy happened in any of the said churches the mayor aldermen and common council of newcastle have from time to time chosen another in such room and stead and the bishop of durham for the time being did always hitherto allow and approve of by his license such person so chosen being duly qualified  note the lecturers of st nicholas and all saints have this further advantage in it which makes it the more valuable that this preferment does no ways disqualify or incapacitate them from holding other livings with the cure of souls

pleasing appearance not unlike a magnificent imperial crown it is justly allowed by all travelers to be the finest piece of masonry of the kind in europe this tower most authors agree was built in the time of king henry vi by one robert rhodes on the bottom of the bellfry is this inscription orate pro anima roberti rhodes great disputes have arose who this robert rhodes was gray says he was prior of tynemouth in the time of king henry vi others suggest he was one of the justices of the bishop of durham and quote a register at durham to prove robert rhodes and agnes his wife lived about the year      but bourne with great propriety fixes on an eminent merchant in newcastle and gives powerful arguments for his determination  bourne tells the following remarkable story that when the scots besieged the town in the civil wars and made ineffectual efforts to reduce it they sent a message threatening to destroy this fine steeple in consequence of which the mayor ordered it to be filled with scotch prisoners then in the town which being made known to the besiegers they forbore to shed the blood of their countrymen and the elegant edifice was saved   from thence it is conjectured by several that this was the name of the founder pennant vol   p  0  the church is well illuminated the east or altar window was anciently adorned with paintings on the glass representing the twelve

proved that from the time of its commencement to april            patients have been discharged cured  to these may be added the hospital for lunatics and the hospital for married women lyingin as also the fund raised for the support of those who liein at their own houses  an elegant hall has lately been erected in high friar chair by the society of free and accepted masons of the lodge of st john it is richly ornamented and has an excellent organ for their solemn rites it was dedicated in the year      to attend which ceremony there was the most respectable and numerous convention of that order that ever appeared in the northern parts of this kingdom the music was performed by an excellent band the vocal parts of which were done by the best voices from the quire of durham cathedral a pathetic exhortation was delivered by mr huntley and an elegant oration displaying the antiquity progress and excellence of the order by the rev dr scott of simonburn the festival was held in the new assembly room when at three tables near  00 of the brethren dined together at which time that regularity order and harmony were maintained for which this society above all others in the world is remarkable where men of all ranks political opinions and religious persuasions meet without envy or contention and preserve a unanimity and brotherly love in despite of the frailties and fickleness of the human heart  the history of this place is very dark antecedent to the time of robert carthouse and the building of the castle from whence it is presumed the name of newcastle was derived the advantages of a fine navigable river with a situation defended by so strong a fortress would soon induce merchants and others to fix there yet we find no record of any royal charter liberty or

were our author is silent king john in the  d year of his reign confirmed the above charter on payment of  00 marks and two palfreys madox firma burgi p    in the   th year of his reign he greatly enlarged those liberties and powers and expressly in consideration of the loyalty and faithful services of his burgesses there he granted them several exclusive privileges among which are an exemption from the power of the sheriff of the county at large and that they should be amenable to the courts only within their own jurisdiction except in matters relative to the rights of the crown the government of the borough was then under four bailiffs only  king henry iii by charter appointed a mayor to preside in the government of this borough together with four bailiffs from this prince the burgesses derived two most excellent bounties viz the castle demesnes containing   0 acres for free pasturage with liberty of winning coal and stone as also a plot of ground called the forth containing about    acres here the infirmary stands a portion of the ground is enclosed and converted into a public walk one thing very singular in this royal charter is the prohibition against jews

king henry iv that newcastle received the most distinguishing marks of royal favor on the accession of this prince the borough received a confirmation of all ancient liberties and immunities besides which he also granted that this borough should for ever thereafter be independent of the county of northumberland that it should have a sheriff as being a county of itself a district not above  0

should be elected out of the burgesses as associates in the civil magistracy with the mayor with power to act as justices of the peace within the precincts of the borough that the burgesses should hold the conservatorship of the river tyne from sparrow hawk to hedwin streams with the royalties thereof a space of    miles within which limits no ship should load or unload any sort of goods but at the quays of newcastle the present quays are esteemed equal to any in england being upwards  00 yards in length king edward ii granted the conservatorship of the river tyne to john earl of hampstead but the same was soon revoked on its being represented an infringement on the rights of newcastle  king edward vi on the dissolution of the bishopric of durham by act of parliament a d      granted to newcastle the town and liberties of gateshead he also proposed to have erected a bishopric at newcastle out of part of the revenues of the dissolved see the preamble of the act sets forth that this bishopric being then void of a prelate the gift thereof was in the kings pleasure and the compass of it being so large as to extend itself into several shires far distant it could not be sufficiently served by one bishop and since the king by his godly disposition was desirous to have gods holy word preached in those parts which were wild and barbarous for lack of good preaching and good searching therefore he intends to have two good bishoprics for that diocese the one at durham which should have  000 marks yearly revenue and another at newcastle with  000 and also found a cathedral church at the latter place with a deanery and chapter out of the revenues of the said bishopric therefore the bishopric of durham is utterly extinguished and dissolved and authority given for letters patents to erect the two new bishoprics together with a deanery and chapter at newcastle with a proviso that the rights of the deanery chapter and cathedral of durham should suffer nothing by this act but these purposes were defeated by the death of the king and on the accession of queen mary      the bishopric of durham was restored the preamble sets forth that certain ambitious persons taking advantage of the late kings minority made an interest by sinister practice to procure the dissolution of the bishopric that it was done out of mercenary views to enrich themselves and their friends by seizing the lands of the sea rather than upon just occasion or godly zeal that tunstall bishop of durham was deprived upon unjust furmises and false accusations and that the process against him was foul and illegal that upon a full examination of the matter by the queens commissioners the sentence of deprivation was declared void as may be seen at large by an authentic instrument that the queen had new founded the bishopric by her letters patents and restored all the lands in her possession but that neither the sentence of deprivation nor the queens letters patents were of sufficient force to recover the honors lands etc to the sea of durham therefore to restore the bishopric to its former interest privileges and revenues the two dissolution statutes of the last reign are hereby repealed   queen elizabeth confirmed to the burgesses all the liberties and immunities granted by her predecessors and added thereto many privileges by her charter dated as mr wallis says on the   d march in the   d year of her reign but as it appears by a note to bournes history in the   st year of that reign it was then declared to be a free town with power to the corporate body to purchase lands to them

great to enter upon an exact detail would exceed the limits of my work the exports chiefly consist of coals wrought iron lead glass salt bacon corn salmon butter tallow and grindstones its situation is such as necessarily renders it the place of supply for an extensive country in articles of imported merchandise in the summary i have given of the trade of the county in the succeeding pages the importance of this place will appear in mr pennants work it is stated that in the year      the shipping mentioned in the following table were entered here with imports    0 ships carrying     0 tons

a manufactory of broad and narrow woollen clothes carried on with great success seldom less than  0000 firkins of butter and  0000 hundreds of tallow are annually exported from hence  the chief article of export is coal great disputes have arose touching the time when coals were first used in this island  our antiquaries have conjectured that the romans knew how to win them and their use yet

mentions carbo marinus  in the  st year of the reign of king edward i mention is made de carbonibus maritimis and their measure  in the   st year of that reign a complaint was made of the public nuisance the burning of coal was in the city and suburbs of london by corrupting the air by the stink and smoke and a proclamation was issued to prohibit its use and afterward a commission of oyer to

means these carriages on an easy descent run without horses and sometimes with that rapidity that a piece of wood called a tiller is obliged to be applied to one wheel and pressed thereon by the

a less grateful kind but it was exported to foreign parts long before it was in use in london for london likewise had its neighboring forests we find that in      king henry iii confirms to the good people of newcastle the charter of his father king john granting them the privilege of digging coals in the castle moor and converting them to their own profit in aid of their feefarm rent of one

considered in the capital as a nuisance for on the repeated complaints of prelates nobles commons of parliament and inhabitants of london against the stench and smoke of coals used by brewers dyers

first offense and for the second by the destruction of their furnaces in      we find that their use was not only tolerated but their consumption made beneficial to the state for in that year a duty of sixpence per ten each quarter of a year was imposed on ships coming from newcastle in      the trade became so important as to engage the regulations of government and orders were given about the

abandoned tyrant randals manuscripts one of the houses remained for some time suspended in an amazing manner over a dreadful chasm sustained by the compactness of its materials and its timber and clinging by a small part of its foundation on one of the piers from which the arch was broken down from thence the miserable inhabitants looked on the raging waters and the horrid ruins with distraction and sent forth cries of despair to multitudes of spectators who could not lend them aid at length the fatal moment arrived that closed the tremendous spectacle the house with its inhabitants sunk and were swallowed up in the destructive torrent  the ancient bridge was of wood and in the   d year of the reign of king henry iii was destroyed by fire the late bridge was constructed of stone and consisted of    arches three of which on the north were closed up and used as cellars it was built about  00 years ago walter kirkham he came to the sea      bishop of durham being a great contributor thereto the original superstructure of this bridge was probably of wood like that over the danube and continued made with the same material for several centuries notice is taken of it in the reign of king richard i when philip poictiers bishop of durham gave license to the burgesses of gateshead to give wood to whomsoever they pleased to be spent about the river tyne which is supposed to mean in the repairs of the bridge and quay on the part belonging to durham for one third belongs to the bishop and two to the town so that after it was destroyed in      by a furious fire the bishop and the town united in the expense of building the stone bridge of which this calamity was the origin the prelate walter kirkham had the advantage in this for armed with spiritual powers he issued out indulgences from all penances to every one that would assist either with money or labor the town also applied to other bishops for their assistance in promoting so good a work and they in consequence granted their indulgences but then the clergy of the north were directed by their archdeacon to prefer the indulgences of their own prelate to any other in the end both parties succeeded and the money raised was given to laurentius master of the bridge pennant vol   p       it was crowded with buildings near the middle was a tower with an iron gate which the corporation used as a town prison this tower was of considerable service some years ago in preventing the further communication of a fire which consumed many houses adjoining it at the south end was formerly another tower and a drawbridge a blue stone near the middle of the bridge denoted the boundary of the towns liberty the southern end of the bridge appertaining to the sea of durham in the year      a claim of the corporation to the whole bridge occasioned a suit in which the right of the bishop of durham to the southern part was established thomas ruthal bishop of durham in the reign of king henry vii repaired the southern part this part of the bridge was repaired by thomas ruthal bishop of durham famous in the reigns of king henry vii and viii not only for being the richest subject then in britain but for the unfortunate mistake he made in delivering the book of his own private affairs to the aspiring cardinal wolsey instead of one he had wrote on the state of the kingdom by the desire of his sovereign whereby the cardinal effected his ruin and stepped into his bishopric wallis     a strong building crossed the bridge which was used as a magazine for the town on the south front was an elegant statue of king cha ii with this motto adventus regis solamen gregis there was an opening in the battlements of the bridge railed with iron for the convenience of passengers to look upon the river and shipping mr bourne relates a story that from thence one anderson an alderman dropped his signet ring into the river that some time afterward his own servant having bought a salmon for his table in opening the fish the ring was found in its intrails and was in his days in the custody of a descendant of mr anderson herodotus gives an account of a similar circumstance happening to polycrates king of samos who was called the favorite of fortune  on the  0th of june    0 the workmen began to pull down the west end of st thomass chapel in order to open

tides from tyne head in aldston moor to shields was a continued scene of horror and devastation  an act of parliament passed  d june      to enable the bishop of durham and his successors to raise a competent sum of money to be applied for the repairing improving or rebuilding such part of tyne bridge as belongs to the sea of durham  on the  0th june      one stephenson contracted to build a temporary bridge over the tyne in four months time under a great penalty which was performed  on tuesday   th april      the first stone of the south pier of the new bridge within the boundaries of this corporation was laid by sir matthew white ridley mayor  from the evidence of the ancient name of pons aelii and the roman road from chester leading thereto it is conjectured that the romans had a bridge here  mr pennant is of opinion that part of the roman bridge remained till the late inundation for from the observation of workmen upon the old piers those as well as the piers of the bridge at bywell seem originally to have been formed without any springs for arches this was a manner of building used by the romans witness the bridge built over the danube by trajan at severin whose piers he believes still exist adrian was probably the founder of the bridge at newcastle which was called after his family name pons aelii in the same manner as jerusalem was styled elia capitolina and the games he instituted at pincum in maesia aeliana pincensia the coins discovered on pulling down some of the piers in      confirm my opinion several were discovered but only three or four rescued from the hands of the workmen all of them are coins posterior to the time of adrian probably deposited there in some later repairs one of them is a beautiful faustina the elder after her deification her forehead is bound with a small tiara her hair full twisted and dressed a la modern round is inscribed diva faustina on the reverse is ceres with a torch in one hand and ears of corn in the other the inscription augusta s c  the next has the laureated head of antoninus pius on the reverse apollo with a patera in one hand and a plectrum in the other the legend so much defaced as to be illegible  the third is lucius verus like that of faustina after consecration on the reverse is a magnificent funeral pile and the word consecratio s c  within a little distance from newcastle lies  jesmond a corruption of jesusmount  an ancient hospital with a chapel appertaining to it dedicated to the virgin mary king edward vi granted this place to the corporation of newcastle who sold it to sir robert brandling the hospital is now used as a dwelling house and the chapel is converted into a stable  there was a well at jesmond greatly resorted to by persons laboring under infirmities for its salutary qualities it had as many steps down to it as there are articles in the creed many pilgrimages were made to jesmond to visit the shrine of the virgin and to partake of the miraculous virtues of the sanctified spring the superstition of paying reverence to salubrious springs seems to be derived from the romans  in the first year of the reign of king henry viii a mob headed by several of the aldermen and principal inhabitants of newcastle assembled here with intent to slay the prior of tinemouth the cause of this outrage my author does not mention bourne notes p      from the same authority it appears that soon after jesmond became the property of mr coulson he enclosed the well and converted it into a bath but in a short time the water forsook the well which alarmed the superstitious much but whilst the cry against this profanation was warmest the waters returned and the miracle was washed away  elswick is about a mile west from newcastle the seat of john hodgson

cup of roman pottery and the neck and handle of a cruise of brown pottery unglazed wallis     benwell was the condercum of the romans in mr horsleys works the following roman antiquities found at this station are mentioned  no vii jovi optimo maximo dolicheno et numinibus augusti prosalute imperatoris caesaris titi aelii hadriani augusti pii patris patriae et legionis secundae augustae marcus liburnius fronto centurio legionis ejusdem votum solvit libens merito  between cousins house and benwell i could not meet with any roman inscriptions or sculptures i never heard of any found at newcastle nor is this much to be wondered at considering how large a town it has long been and how easy it is to suppose that all that was roman has been lost some ages ago amongst such numerous buildings i therefore proceed to the inscriptions at benwell there are three belonging to this fort of which this and the next have been published only i think by mr gordon that part of the two first lines which is lost in the break of the stone is so supplied by mr gordon as if the whole had been jovi optimo maximo et numinibus etc and as if the words optimo maximo had been wrote at large so as to fill up the whole vacancy but these words are seldom found at length upon an altar and will by no means consist with the letters heno which are very plain and distinct the reading i have given seems to answer as to the letters and to fill up the space with the greatest exactness and it will be hard to find another word into which the letters heno will enter nor is there any occasion to search for any other since jupiter dolichenus had not only several altars dedicated to him in other places but one or two likewise in britain caesar in the short natural history he gives of britain tells us the inland countries afford tin and the maritime iron though no great plenty of it this passage of caesar may give us some light into the reason of these altars being dedicated to jupiter dolichenus when compared with another inscription to the same deity published by reinesius and referred to in camden the inscription is this jovi optimo maximo dolycheno ubi ferrum nacitur sempronius rectus cent frumentarius d d reinesius thinks jupiter had this name given him from  a town of epirus or macedonia which country strabo represents as rugged and mountainous and productive of metals among which reinesius supposes there was iron if this was the case though strabo i think does not mention iron the words ubi serrum nascitur may seem to intimate that jupiter dolichenus had some particular concern in iron mines and so might well be applied to for assistance and conduct by those who entertained hopes of making beneficial discoveries in that way now benwell is not many miles from the sea and this country abounds with mines of coal that bring yearly a very large sum of money into it and the romans from caesars account and other circumstances might expect to find iron mines in these parts and upon that occasion pay their devotion to jupiter dolichenus montsaucon has given us one image of this deity found at marseilles clad in armor and standing upon a bull which seems to agree very well with this account but another image represents him in a rustic habit with an ox under him and stephanus who calls him  derives his name from dolochene a city of cammagene in asia which strabo describes as a fruitful country well planted with trees and vines it is not unlikely therefore he might be worshipped at both these places and that the words in reinesiuss inscription ubi ferrum nascitur might be designed as descriptive of the grecian deity it may not be improper to remark that there is a coalry not far from benwell a part of which is judged by those that are best skilled in such affairs to have been wrought by the romans the legio secunda augusta for whose preservation together with that of the emperor this altar was erected must at this time have been upon the wall in northumberland which very probably if pausaniuss account be true might be after they had defeated the brigantes and taken from them a great part of their land  the words which i read centurio legionis ejusdem are by mr gordon read legatus ejusdem which mistake he seems to have been led into by not observing the centurial mark so that here is no foundation to suppose a new propraetor or lieutenant m liburnius front from this inscription this curious altar has on one side the sacrificing knife and ax on the other side both the patera and praeferiulum this and the following were in the collection of robert shaft esquire  no viii centurio legionis vicestmae valentis victricis votum solvil libens merito  this is an imperfect inscription upon the lower part of a broken altar found in the same place with the preceding and as that was erected by a centurion of the second legion called augusta so this by another such officer of the twentieth legion called valens victri the mark for the centurion is very plain and distinct upon the stone though omitted by mr gordon nor do i remember an instance in britain of an altar erected by a whole legion though it was frequently done by a cohort my reason for reading valens victrix and not valeria or valeriana i have given before  no ix victoria augustr nostrorum secit nepot softi senecionis consulis felix alae primae asterum praefectus  i first discovered this inscription on the side wall of a house at east denton which village stands upon the wall about a quarter of a mile west from benwll fort the house was afterward demolished and this stone thrown among the dirt and rubbish but being again recovered by a curious gentleman of my acquaintance is now in my possession though the word secit as synonimous with psant is frequently applied to an altar or monument and therefore does not certainly prove that the legion was at this time employed in building the wall or the valla yet as no person is named in the inscription to whose honor this monement was erected the word fecit may possibly refer to some other work than purely setting up such a stone and to none more likely than building that part of the wall but this i have considered in its proper place it is somewhat rare and curious to have the name of the legion and the number of the cohort set down both together so distinctly as here there are some other parallel instances of legionary cohorts in britain but not very many in a memorandum left by the late dr wdward f creane this stone is sd to have been found on the roman wall near newcastle upon tire and to have been sent to him by dr ca of that town the monument correspondents so exact to the description i had from an eyewitness of one found at benwell fot and preferred for some re at benwell se that there can remain no doubt but it must be the very me i am told it was first presented by the present mr shastos grandmother during the miory of the late mr shafto at benwell to the late dr ca a learned and curious physician of newcastle by whom it was transmitted to london since the death of dr woodwa and the posal of hs coesin in which i saw it it is now in the possession of mr west the distinct mention mae  ths monument of the ala prima astorum renders it highly curious and valuable as it cnfr the roman town and fort upon the wall at benwell to be the ancient condrcu the third station per neam vali where according to the notitia this ala was in garrison i was agreeably surprised at the sight of it because it is a further confirmation of the scheme i had advanced concerning these stations i was also pleased to discover the small o at the end of the last line which is sufficiently distinct and certain and proves the word to be astorum not asturum in which it agrees with the notitia that part of the stone which is near the m in the bordering is imperfect and broken i make no doubt but the letters rv have been before the m and that it is to be read astorum the pra on the other side can be nothing else but praefectus there is no appearance left of any cross strokes of the e after ala in the last line but as these may have been worn out i am of opinion that it was at first alae and that the monument was set up by felix the commander of this ala it seems plainly to have been erected victoriae augustorum for the word victoriae is complete and distinct the upper parts of the two g g are yet visible and dr woodward had put a v before them in his copy though i could not discern any vestige of it on the stone i suppose a stroke or two in the next letters are now effaced and that they were originally a double n conjoined for nostrorum and whosoever considers the frequent variation of letters we often meet with in the same monument will not think it strange that the first stroke is more oblique here than in one or two instances of the same letter afterward the letters f e at the end of this line must in all probability stand for the word fecit if my reading be allowed the monument must have been erected by felix who was the grandson of socius senecio the consul and the commander of the first wing of the asti mr ward chooses to read the third and fourth lines thus numerius sosius senecio nepos consulis felix the letter n put for a praenomen signifies numerius according to diomedes sosius was one of the consuls names who is called g sosius senecio in the fasti consulares and n for nepos is very common upon inscriptions as to the situation of the words nepos consulis it is usual in inscriptions to insert such words as express any relation or other circumstance of those who erect them before the last name but n s in goltzins is made to stand for numerius as well as n alone this being admitted we may read numerius senecio nepos consulis felix but i much incline to the reading that i have given which occurred to me at the first it is evident that no regard is had in this inscription to the usual order of the words in others there seems rather to be an affected singularity as to this matter senecio who is mentioned in an inscription or two found at brugh in richmondshire the originals of which are now lost was probably of the same family though rather too late to be the same person with him who is described in this monument for he as appears from these inscriptions i have referred to lived under the reign of commodus and continued at least till the joint reign of severus and caracalla is later than a grandson of sosius senecio the consul can well be supposed to have lived for sosius senecio was the fourth and last time consul in conjunction with licinius sura in the year  0  under the reign of trojan from whence to the beginning of the joint reign of severus and caracalla is little less than a century for the same reason it is not so probable that the two emperors here intended are severus and caracalla but rather marcus aurelius and lucius verus who as well as the others carried on a war with success against the britons and calpurnius agricola was their legate whose name we meet with in some inscriptions found near the roman wall and as he began to reign jointly above thirty years before the other two that time suits better than the other so that upon the whole i take this monument to have been erected to the honor of the emperors marcus aurelius and lucius verus upon occasion of some victory they had gained over the northern britons by calpurnius agricola their legate in which this felix senecio had the command of the first wing of the asti the asti according to pancirollus were the inhabitants of the asta a colony in liguia asta is mentioned by pliny and others no doubt they were distinct from the astures a people of spain the four inscriptions which follow are on stones built up in the walls of houses in the village of benwell  no ix dis manibus aurelii clae primae astorum  this is a funeral monument but imperfect and has been much abused i have given the best reading of it i could it is now built up in the front of mrs lions house near the door there appears something like a stop after the a in the last line but yet i incline to read it alae primae and most probably astorum for this was the only ala primae stationed on the principal line of the wall this seems to be of the lower empire and more strongly proves this fort to be the ancient condercum  no ix centuria peregtini this of peregrinus is now built up in the fore wall of the house of william gill  no ix legionus secundae augustae cohors decima  this is very useful and curious though it contains only the name of the legio secunda augusta and the number of the cohort namely the tenth for this farther confirms what i had from other reasons and inscriptions conjectured before that this legion was employed on the east end of the wall and this cohort of that legion in particular the sea goat and pegasus at the top are not uncommon and seem to denote the maritime situation of the country on the one hand and the swiftness of the roman victory on the other there is a branch in the upper part of the stone which was mistaken by a very learned antiquary for a roman vexillum and we have a roman vexillum supported by a pegasus and a sea goat at little chesters on the wall this stone is now in the fore wall of the house of joseph wallis near the door  no ix centuria arrii  this of arrius is in the back wall of the house of matthew garret both the stone and letters are very coarse arrius is a roman name horace has it once and again  no ix centuria herenniani  this stone was found near the highway side by denton and is now in my own possession herennius herennianus occurs in a remarkable inscription found in spain and published in the transactions the name on this stone is plainly herrennianus  this station on benwell hill has furnished a good many inscriptions but i remember not to have seen or heard of any roman coins found here nor can i say in the general that roman coins are so frequent in the stations on the wall as in some other places but the fine urn which they now preserve in the library at durham was found at this place the cut of the letters in the inscriptions belonging to benwell is tolerably good and the inscriptions themselves are not so much perplexed with ligatures of letters as those of later dates often are though these are not wholly free from them but the most curious inscriptions have been removed out of this county many were carried off by sir robert cotton several of which are yet remaining at connington near stilton in hantingdonshire but they also are going to ruin for the summer house where they were carefully placed by sir robert being now uncovered and in a ruinous state the stones and inscriptions have already suffered very much  mr warburton had made the largest collection who was at a great deal of pains and expense to collect the most curious roman stones he could find in this county but he unhappily broke many of them in order to make them more portable and so carried off only that part of the stone which had the inscription by this means it has happened that many of the stones collected by him are only faces of altars and in several instances the inscriptions themselves have suffered damage by this unhappy frugality what this gentleman had collected together at hexham have since been removed to the library at durham  mr warburton in his vallum romanum justifies himself against this charge in the following manner the editor in vindication of himself from this unjust accusation of a parsimonious incuriosity denies the charge in every part and as a proof of the truth thereof refers himself to the draughts of the altars he discovered as the same are represented in the plates that the romans frequently broke and defaced altars on particular occasions is evident and is usually observed to have been practiced on revolutions in the empire or upon a persons falling into disgrace who is mentioned in the inscription  observations on the inscriptions near walbottle  the three following are at a place upon the wall called walbottle  no x centuria mucieni posuit  this is centurial and is now in the sore wall of a cowhouse in this village it contains nothing distinct but the character and name of the centurion  no xi cohors octava posuit this contains only the number of the cohort i believe there never has been any thing more inscribed on it and am apt to think it was the eighth cohort of the legio secunda augusta the same as that before in the inscription at east denton  no xii the inscriptions contained under this number are only some obscure and doubtful remains of numeral letters the two first viz v and ix have most probably been   and   denoting the numbers of the cohorts they are in the corner of the stone wall through which a small brook passes a little west from the town and of the same sort with these are the rest but placed in several parts of the inside of the wall which incloses the field there were two or three more of the same sort and size with no i upon them and another also with no v besides those which i have described   the distinct remains of the station appear on benwell hill the observations made thereon and the course of the wall from newcastle to rutchester by mr horsley and mr warburton are to the following effect no appearance of either of the roman walls can be expected as far as the buildings of newcastle extend but as soon as they are well ended some feint vestiges of both or of what has belonged to them begin to show themselves for just at the end of westgate on the south side of the highway hadrians ditch seems pretty visible and near the quarry house some feint marks of the ditch and north agger begin to appear but chiefly of the latter and this state of the vallum extends to benwell fort as to severuss wall little or nothing relating to it can be discovered between the town and the quarry house some visible remains of a castellum are discoverable just behind the quarry house and the line of the wall appeared to go through the midst of the house the castellum is conveniently placed for prospect and is the only one that is visible between newcastle and the next station by the distance there should have been another but it is quite demolished from the quarry house to elswick windmill severuss wall is difficult to trace but from thence to the fort on benwell hill the appearance of the ditch is frequently very distinct and the track of wall which keeps much upon the high road pretty certain  from the station at newcastle which is placed by these antiquaries near the castle to benwell hill is near two miles and a furlong and no inscriptions have been discovered in this space at least none now remain nor even the remembrance of any  the situation of the station on benwell hill is high and the prospect considerable the ramparts are large and distinct but the ditch scarce to be discerned hadrians vallum seems to have fallen in with the south side of it and severuss wall strikes upon the east and west sides so as to leave three chains to the north and six to the south but there is no appearance of the wall and its ditch being continued through the fort though mr gordon has so represented it there are stones in the road that now crosses this fort but these seem only to have been taken out of the ruins to repair the highway this station falls in course to be condercum the name given in the notitia to be the third in the series where the ala prima astorum was quartered  from the station at benwell hill severuss wall and ditch in going down to denton continue much in the same state as before but hadrians work on this side begins to appear more conspicuous both the walls pass to the north of the hill and village of benwell from denton to the chapel houses both the walls and their ditches are almost all the way visible and distinct over against west denton hall there seemed to be the visible remains of a castellum and somewhat like the ruins of a turret not very far from it  near the chapel houses about a furlong south from severuss wall and less from hadrians are somewhat like the ruins of a rampart it is called the castle steads the name usually given to those castella that are regularly placed along severuss wall but this besides its being at some distance from the wall which the others never are appears to have been of a quite different form and dimensions for it is about four chains long with an interval in the middle that looks like a gate and so makes it appear very like the south rampart of a small fort but if there have been ramparts on the other sides no traces of them appear at present the prospect here especially to the south is very considerable perhaps it has been an exploratory tower belonging to hadrians work and prior to severuss and so neglected in his time the usual castellum belonging to severuss wall is about a furlong west from the chapel houses and visible there so that the other can neither be one of these nor intended to supply the place of one from the name chapel houses one would expect to find some ruinous chapel there and i should have suspected somewhat of these ruins to have been of that nature if the name castle steads had not determined against it  from chapel houses to wallbottle both walls and ditches are pretty visible and continue so to newburn dean but on the descent from the chapel houses to wallbottle hadrians north agger becomes very conspicuous and holds so for the most part to newburn dean between wallbottle and this dean is a castellum still very visible and from the dean to throcklow hadrians vallum and ditch are discernible but not very large and severuss wall not quite so plain  over against throcklow in a convenient high place there seems to be the ruins of another castellum but near the village the vallum is very obscure from throcklow to heddon on the wall severuss wall and ditch are very conspicuous and hadrians vallum and ditch near as visible the north agger is also discernible for part of the way and near heddon it is very considerable before we come to heddon there is on the north side of the wall another place of the same nature with that at chapel houses and called likewise castle steads the remains are very confused and as it is altogether on the north of the wall and detached a little from it it seems to be a castellum erected prior to the wall and neglected after the building of it the prospect from this place is very good which makes it the more likely to have been of the exploratory kind however there seems to have been an usual castellum in severuss wall very near to these ruins which is a further proof that the other has not been used after the wall was erected it seems to have been twice as large as one of severuss castella and yet not large enough for a station three sides the north east and west may be traced out but the other is entirely levelled  heddon commonly called heddon on the wall was part of the barony of hugh de bolbeck who gave the appropriation and advowson of the church here to the abbey of blanchland  in nov      the workmen employed in making the military road which leads from carlisle found a great number of curious roman coins and medals in the ruins of the roman wall here they had been deposited in wood boxes which were almost decayed several of the medals were fresh and fair as if but newly struck some of them are of silver but most part of copper and mixed metal they are thought to be as valuable a collection as has been discovered for some centuries past  near heddon on the wall somewhat appears like severuss military way pretty near to his wall but it is rather probable this appearance is nothing but the stones and ruins of the wall and that the military ways have here coincided because the north agger is so large though in a ploughed field not far from this place there have been some remarkable tumuli the village heddon laws which stands upon a hill has no doubt had its name from such tumuli there is yet remaining one very great heap of stones besides other tumuli and a remarkable one farther to the east called dewly law with a smaller one near it the whole hill is like the ruins of a quarry but curious and worth the seeing if regard be had to the distance of    miles from the sea heddon on the wall would seem to be bedes villa ad murum and not either walls end or wall town  from heddon to rutchester both the walls and their ditches are distinct and a little before we come to rutchester hadrians north agger is distinct here is another castellum the remains of which are very visible and an oval fort though it seems not to be roman near it the whole distance between the station at benwell hill and this at rutchester is six measured miles and three quarters in this space there are six visible castella in a series without interruption and the constant exact measure between them is six furlongs and three quarters and the whole distance between the two stations six measured miles and three quarters the two castella that have been next the fort at benwell hill have no visible remains  we passed in view of denton hall a seat of the ancient family of montagues to  newburn a borough given by king john to robert son of

newburn was a place of consequence and note preceding the conquest copsi who was created earl of northumberland by king william was put to death here osulf the preceding governor expelled by the conqueror to give place to copsi being forced into the woods and deserts lay concealed till he had collected a few hardy troops with these he besieged copsi and at length obliged him to take refuge in the church osulf disregarding all veneration for things sacred when put in competition with his desperate fortune and revenge set fire to the holy pile and as copsi endeavored to shun the flames he was seized and his head severed on the spot  at this village on the   th of august    king charles i a d    0 lord conway with an army of  000 foot and   00 horse opposed the passage of the scots over the river tyne led by lesley in rushworths historical collections there is a very particular relation of this affair p       on the twenty seventh of aug    0 in the forenoon his majesty received intelligence from the lord conway that the scots would that night be near newcastle with their army craving his majestys pleasure and directions about the disposing of his army to the interruption of the march of the scots  the king immediately called the gentry of yorkshire then at york together to wait upon his majesty to whom the earl of strafford made a speech presently after he prepared a packet to be sent post to the lord conway then understanding the scots were come near newcastle and the author of these collections being newly come post from london to york and hearing a packet was about to be sent to newcastle took the opportunity to bear the messenger company therewith but when the author and the messenger with the packet came to newcastle upon the   th of august in the morning they were informed that the lord conway was gone to the army near newburn whither we went immediately and found the lord conway and the field officers at a council of war at stella half a mile distant from the army and delivered the lord conway the packet which being opened it contained special orders to prepare the army for an engagement with the scots whilst they were in debate in this matter an herald came in all haste from the army to acquaint the lord conway and council of war that the army was already engaged with the scots which seemed strange to them because orders were given not to fight but upon the defense  on the   th of august the scots pitched their tents on heddon law above newborn from whence there went a continued descent to the river of tyne in the night time they made great fires in and round about their camp on an open moorish ground having coals plenty thereabouts so that the camp seemed to be of large compass and extent  that night and the next morning they suffered any englishman to come into their camp and made them welcome with expressions of great love and protestations of doing harm to none but those who should oppose them in demanding justice of the king against incendiaries  the same night part of the kings army consisting of  000 foot and   00 horse were drawn forth into a plain meadow ground which was near a mile in length close on the south side of tyne called newborn haugh or stella haugh to hinder the scots from passing the river in the night time where were two several sconces or breastworks raised by the english against the two fords which the scots might pass over at low water for till then they could not pass the tyne and into each sconce were put four hundred musketeers and four pieces of ordinance  the horse were drawn into squadrons in the said haugh at some distance from the foot in this posture horse and foot guarded the river all that night and the next day till the engagement  the scots all the forenoon watered their horses at one side of the river and the english on the other side without affronting one another or giving any reproachful language  the scots having the advantage of the rising ground above newborn easily discerned the posture and motion of the english army below in the valley on the south side the river but the posture of the scots army the english could not discern by reason of the houses hedges and enclosures in and about newborn the scots brought down cannon into newborn town and planted some in the church steeple a small distance from the river tyne their musketeers were placed in the church houses lanes and hedges in and about newborn  the skirmish began thus as the author of these collections was informed being then upon the place a scottish officer well mounted having a black feather in his hat came out of one of the thatcht houses in newborn and watered his horse in the river tyne as they had done all that day an english soldier perceived he fixed his eye toward the english trenches on the south side of the river fired at him whether in earnest or to fright him is not known but wounded the scotchman with the shot who fell off his horse whereupon the scottish musketeers immediately fired upon the english and so the fight begun with small shot but was continued with great shot as well as small  the scots played with their cannon upon the english breastworks and sconce the kings army played with their cannon to beat the scots out of the church steeple thus they continued firing on both sides till it grew to be near low water and by that time the scots with their cannon had made a breach in the greater sconce which colonel lunsford commanded wherein many of his men were killed and began to retire yet the colonel prevailed with them to stand to their arms but presently after a captain a lieutenant and some other officers were slain in that work then the soldiers took occasion to complain that they were put upon double duty and had stood there all night and that day to that time and that no soldiers were sent from the army at newcastle to relieve them but col lunsford again prevailed with them not to desert their works but another cannon shot hitting in the works amongst the soldiers and killing some more of them they threw down their arms and would abide in the fort no longer  the enemy on the rising ground above newbourne plainly discerned the posture of the kings army and how the soldiers had quit the great work and being low water the scots commanded a forlorn party of    horse being gentlemen of the college of justice troop to pass the river which they did with some swiftness their orders were only to make discovery in what posture the soldiers were about the uppermost work but not to come to close engagement but fire at a distance and retreat  the scots playing at this time very hard upon the furthermost trench forced the english foot to retreat from that work also which the scots discerning on the rising ground at newborn commanded by sir thomas hope and two regiments of foot commanded by the lord craford lindsey and lord lowdon waded through the river and general lesley at this instant of time played hard with nine pieces of cannon from a new sconce which they had raised on a hill to the east and so galled the kings horse drawn up in plain meadow ground that it much disordered them and sending more forces over the river a retreat was sounded and colonel lunsford drew off the cannon immediately commissary wilmot son to the lord wilmot sir john digby a romish recusant and daniel oneal an irishman jointly engaged the enemy and had a sharp encounter with their horse they being commanded to bring up the rear whilst the foot retreated up ryton and stella banks but the scots with their fresh supply newly come over the river environed these three commanders and took them and some others of their troops prisoners general lesley treated these commanders nobly in the scots camp and afterward gave them their liberty freely to return to the kings army  in this engagement cornet potter son of endymion potter of the bedchamber was slain and during the whole fight about  0 men more as the scots told us after the cessation of arms was agreed unto for the scots buried the dead and afterward they further told us that most of them that were killed lay about the works how many of the scots were slain we know not  after this retreat the lord conway called a council of war and it was there resolved at twelve at night that the whole army should retreat to durham horse and foot and train of artillery and to quit newcastle   the scots with great intrepidity passed the river breast deep in the face of the english army who were drawn up on the opposite banks three hundred scotch horse were obliged to repass the river being opposed by a body of foot covered by a breastwork but lesley getting nine pieces of cannon said to have been concealed in some brushwood previous to the army fording the river to play upon the english lines a panic seized the whole line of infantry they threw down their arms and fled with the utmost precipitation leaving the horse under commissary general wilmot accompanied by many gentlemen of rank exposed to the enemys artillery and the united force of the whole body of scots till overpowered by numbers and having

cattle are bred of which some have come to the weight of   0 stone   lb to the stone the ordinary cattle in the interior parts of the country are of a middle size and mixed breed between dutch and scotch which are very beautiful and yield abundance of milk smaller cattle of the highland kind are bred in the mountainous parts the hills afford fine sheep walks and the flocks are numerous in some parts of the county of late years they have been much improved by the introduction of leicestershire and lincolnshire sheep by which cross the fleeces are become much better and the sheep feed to an improved weight few of the large sheep are kept in this county  improved husbandry makes a rapid progress and enclosures take place of the wide extended tracts where many herdsmen were heretofore necessarily employed to keep the cattle and flocks within their bounds  for so large a tract of land there are few considerable woods of timber trees and planting seems to proceed but languidly except in the vale of whittingham and some other tracts where a laudable example has been given  the rivers abound with salmon and trout and the coasts with cod ling turbot soles place whitings haddocks

thereon ancient customs etc many ancient customs prevail in this county the familiarity or outward insignificance of which occasion them to pass without much attention but as they are the strongest traditional memorials of antiquity i thought them worth collecting and present them to the reader with some short conjectures on their origin and the historical facts to which they have relation  mr bryants words are we talk indeed of ancient times and times of antiquity but that time is most aged which has endured longest and these are the most ancient days in which we are ourselves conversant we enjoy now an age of accumulated experience and we are to make use of the helps which have been transmitted to dispel the mist which has preceded letters have afforded the accumulation before their use the dissolution of every state was the dissipation of its science and wisdom arts and collective knowledge were destroyed with the empire in which they flourished and only a few scattered fragments and distracted ruins remained to save them from total oblivion by letters we possess the wisdom of all quarters of the earth times which have preceded their use left us chiefly traditional fragments scattered abroad in national customs and provincial names and phrases  in the course of this collection i shall remark whatever mr bourne in his popular antiquities has noticed with some of the illucidations and judicious constructions given by his late editor the rev mr john brand  babba the common and most tender appellation of an infant is babba this name mr bryant in his analysis of ancient mythology says is derived from the exclamation made by the congregation during the ceremony of purification by passing infants through the fire of molock fire worship was used in this country and in the druidical rites such ceremony might be retained for they held many customs so similar to those of the hebrews that it strengthens the idea greatly they were communicated by the phoenecians or introduced from germany where the amonians most certainly were well known the saxons also introduced their customs they were worshippers of fire and might hold such office of purification  gifts to infants children when st sent abroad in the arms of the nurse to visit a neighbor are presented with an egg salt and fine bread the egg was a sacred emblem and seems a gift well adapted to infancy mr bryant says an egg containing in it the elements of life was thought no improper emblem of the ark in which were preserved the rudiments of the future world hence in the dionusiaca and in other mysteries one part of the nocturnal ceremony consisted in the consecration of an egg by this as we are informed by porphyry was signified the world it seems to have been a favorite symbol and very ancient and we find it adopted among many nations it was said by the persians of oromasdes that he formed mankind and enclosed them in an egg cakes and salt were used in religious rites by the ancients the jews probably adopted their appropriation from the egyptians and if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour etc lev ii   with all thine offerings thou shall offer salt ibid    there was a custom in the romish church of making a cake in honor of the holy virgins time of childbirth which was condemned by a canon in the council of trullus bou pp antiq p 0  quoted can  0 trul bal   doubling the thumb children to avoid approaching danger are taught to double the thumb within the hand this was much practiced whilst the terrors of witchcraft remained and even in the beginning of the present century much of those unhappy prejudices possessed the minds of the vulgar it was a custom to fold the thumbs of dead persons within the hand to prevent the power of evil spirits over the deceased the thumb in that position forming the similitude of the character in the hebrew alphabet which is commonly used to denote the name of god  new years day the celebration of new years day is preserved in this country as a rural festival gifts are made to children servants and dependants called new years gifts mr bourne quotes what stillingfleet says that among the saxons of the northern nations the feast of the new year was observed with more than ordinary jollity and from hospinian says it was an ancient custom of the heathens and afterward practiced by the christians servants were exempt from their labor and partook of the feast and rural sports with their masters they were presented with tokens of approbation and favor on certain festivals the romans gave pieces of money to travelers and strangers who were present at the sacrifice on our day of festivity mirth is excited by a rustic masquerading and playing tricks in disguise the hide of the ox slain for the winter cheer is often put on and the person thus attired attempts to show the character of the devil by every horrible device in his power all the winter sports seem to express a strong opinion of the ancients that genii of very contrary natures prevailed on earth that the one was constantly concomitant to light as the other was to darkness and this image of the devil which is frequently permitted to expel the inhabitants and take possession of the house is typical of the power of the evil genius in the season when the sun is longest absent from our hemisphere this corresponds with the lamentation used by those who held the elusinian mysteries and mourned for adonis it is very difficult to make any probable determination to what people we owe these customs in the roman saturnalia and sigillaria this kind of frolicking was practiced among the observations made by mr brand on bournes xiv chap he remarks that there was an ancient custom for young women to go about with a waffail bowl that is a bowl of spiced ale on new years eve with some sort of verses that were sung by them in going from door to door waffail is derived from the anglo sax  that is be in health  twelfth day the twelfth day after the day of our saviors birth is attended with great festivity there are diversions used in the southern parts of england which have not reached this northern county the mirth of the day here consists of feasting and a social intercourse between neighboring families mr brand makes a happy quotation from colliers eccl hist vol i p     in his observations on bournes chap xvii in the days of king aelfrid a law was made with relation to the holydays by virtue of which the    days after the nativity of our savior were made festivals so much as these feasts have been decried i cannot see them in the despicable light many modern authors have been pleased to place them they were the occasion of gathering neighbors together in good humor with each other and the means of keeping them on terms of intimacy friendship and benevolence were thereby increased and good offices multiplied public matters at such times were discussed and amicably determined and those happy effects resulted which tended not only to the advantage of the individual but to the good of society at large this age is refined into insipidity few of the old hospitable days return sociability is sickened into unmeaning ceremony in ancient times the bard was brought to the festive hall to rehearse the excellencies of our ancestors to fire the breast with emulation to inspire noble and bounteous sentiments and lift us through example into an adoption of the character of those heroes and men of honor from whom we were descended then it was the genial spirit was roused and benevolence prevailed the name of friendship is retained in our language and the real character is somewhere still found to exist but it is chiefly in middle life the great and opulent in general have little experience of it each apparently separates himself from community and is involved in his own circle the distinguishing characteristicks which in former days purchased a man fortune and fame are become intrinsic trifles with which he may amuse himself but purchase little patronage the vice is contaminating it is creeping into the vitals of lower life and where the insipidity will end is beyond modern magic to divine what would be the consequence should adverse ages ever bring on exigences of state the old popular influence of the great no longer existing the distances between ranks of men still extending their separation the celebrated fable points out the politics which would prevail with the lowest classes of men if we are only to be regarded for servility it is indifferent to us to whom we are servants there is nothing keeps this part of the state within rule but the fear of still worsning the condition  black maile payment this customary collection of money corn and cattle was taken away in consequence of the accession of king james i there was a law indeed made in the   d year of the reign of queen elizabeth to restrain the black maile payment and correct the enormities from whence it arose but whilst the contentions between the nations continued it had little effect this was a levy made within this county by the chieftains on the borders for protections against the depredations made by the robbers and spoiltakers afterward called moss troopers the receivers were in league with the banditti  head pence payment this was an exaction made by the sheriff of northumberland amounting to  0l or more twice in seven years it was received for an exemption from attendance at the sheriffs torn and thereupon the lords of manors held their leet where the suitors for their greater convenience were permitted to attend and make what in the law books is called their suit royal this exaction was totally surpressed by the statute made in the   d year of king hen vi c    i have noticed these two obsolete customs because not only their names but also some memorials of them remain on the borders and in the mountainous parts of the county  candlemas day it is little noted in this county but by name several religious rites were made peculiar to it in the romish church in the quotation of st gregorys letter in the notes to p    in the second volume of the work a reason is given for not abolishing the pagan ceremonies in countries where conversion was taking place but it was commanded to adapt them to christian ceremonies and this seems to carry with it a strong reason for the similarity there was in many of the ceremonies of the christian church in the first ages and the pagan rites mr brand in his observations on bournes xix chap from bacons relics of rome fo     makes a quotation which informs us that the romans in the service of their god mars and his mother februa made processions in the city of rome with lighted torches the remains of which custom still existing with the vulgar in the time of pope sergius he commanded that it should be converted into an holy office of the christian church and that the congregation on the same day made their approach to the high altar with lighted tapers in honor of the holy virgin those who sigh for the sanctity of the church in such reviews of her ceremonies must consider this was done to conciliate the minds of those long used in such spectacles and solemn shows and that an austerity which should at once have abolished such acts to which almost every mind was prejudiced would have greatly retarded if not totally prevented the progress of conversion  st agnes fast it is not yet pointed out when or where this had its rise it is a fast kept by women desirous of dreaming of their lovers and thence to derive propitious indications touching wedlock it is the remains of the old superstition of divination but why fixed to the day of st agnes is not to be accounted for  valentine day is an anniversary day of divination by lots it is a common saying that birds on this day choose their mates it may have relation to some domestic birds and also rooks and pigeons the custom now is that the names of young people are wrote on scrols of paper and each draws one confident that marriages are made in heaven and in full hope the lot of life will be pointed out what particular attention the allotted swain in former days was obliged to pay the fair one to whose hands his name had fallen i have not discovered mr brand in his observations on bournes xxth chap quotes a passage in moresin to this purpose that at this festival the men used to make the women presents as upon another occasion the women used to do to the men but that in scotland on this day presents were reciprocal mr pennant speaks of this custom in scotland by which young people try prognostications of their future fortunes in the nuptial state the first inventor of this custom must have been some benevolent female who studied to encourage the intercourse of the sexes for by such means intimacies might arise productive of love and marriage engagements or otherwise the first design of those lots was that those who shared in the dances and diversions might have their proper partners assigned without hazarding the confusion and displeasure which must necessarily arise in the liberty of choice  there was a religious sect of valentinians but i find no ceremony used by them or tenet they embraced which could have any relation to these customs  shrove tide it is particularly observed shrove is derived from shrive confession a preparation enjoined in the romish church previous to the duties of lent it was particularly prescribed that all offenses should be mutually forgiven and reconciliation take place before they entered upon the solemnities of lent and this was consequently a day of mutual intercourse and amity in several ancient roman catholic families the kitchen is opened and every neighbor and passenger is permitted to enter and fry a pancake for which the necessary provision is made ready this seems to be derived from a custom in the refectory of religious houses where the table was spread on this day for all pilgrims travelers and visitants in newcastle durham and other places the great bell of the church is tolled the servants have holyday and whoever partakes of the pancakes of the day must fry them a circumstance which occasions high kitchen mirth in the keeping of the vigils of all solemn days the ceremony began at noon the ringing of the great bell at noon was a signal to clear the larder of flesh meat from which time its use was prohibited in mr brands appendix to bournes pop antiq he says a kind of pancake feast preceding lent was used in the greek church from whence probably we have borrowed it one of the chief diversions of the day is fighting of cocks moresin says this was derived from the athenians who exhibited cock fightings on one day in each year an institution of themistockley and that those of the romish church derived the custom on this day from thence the inference is ridiculous it was a general holyday and this was one of the vulgar dissipations no otherwise peculiar to the season than that the animal was in good feather at this time of the year and in condition for the greatest exertion of powers  ash wednesday the name only remains the peculiar customs are forgotten penitents expressed their humiliation by sackcloth and ashes fuller in his church hist p     mentions a custom of giving ashes on ash wednesday to put in remembrance every christian man in the beginning of lent and penance that he is but ashes and earth and thereto shall return in the protestant church the commination or service contains a public rehearsal of those curses which we find denounced in the scriptures and which with an impious arrogance we interlard with an amen not with a petition for eversion assuming a right of denunciation and judgment when humiliation contrition and tears would better befit the congregation in the rehearsal of the very curses by which the most of them probably stand condemned  carling day the second sunday preceding easter is called carling sunday the peculiar custom is the serving up parched peace to the table this seems to be derived from the severities of the romish church in the early ages at this period in lent in their abstinence and mortification using such food this was called passion sunday and mr brand quotes marshall on the saxon gospels vol i p     where it is said care or carr sunday was not unknown to the english in his time mr brand adds it was usual to give away beans in the dole at funerals both with the heathen and the people of the romish church they are used as a kind of mourning dole on this day erasmus mentions an observation of plinys concerning pythagorass interdiction of the use of beans that they contain the souls of the dead thence they were used in the parentalia plutarch held that pulse was of the highest efficacy for invoking the manes the adoption by christians can only be reconciled by the preceding arguments touching heathen rites the modern greeks carry in funeral processions parboiled wheat  palm sunday on this day is still retained the ancient usage of dressing windows with evergreens etc in commemoration of our saviors entry into jerusalem it was the custom of the ancient christian church to represent by solemn shows even the most tremendous occurrences in the history of our savior  a procession with palms was used in this country the buds of the saugh which is one of the earliest marks of vegetation the trees of the climate show are gathered and adopted for branches of palm mr bourne says the branch of palm was used in the country near jerusalem as an emblem of victory our adoption of the saugh buds may arise from their being the first bloom the woods wear after winter is subdued and might be used also typically from their bearing testimony of renovation as a sacred emblem of victory over death  easter day is attended with several singular customs the people rise before the sun in hopes to see the great luminary ascend the horizon dancing for joy this has been an innocent artifice to draw forth the vulgar to early devotion and what could be more powerfully typical and figurative to ignorant minds that conceive few images of the resurrection of our lord than that of a glorious and resplendent sun rising from a gilded horizon dispelling every gloom and shade and dispensing light beauty and joy over the face of the earth it was a season and a spectacle under the immediate impressions of which well adapted and pathetic exhortations would take a deep root the druids and saxons both had made it a chief object of worship and the time of sun rising the chief season for their religious rites and adorations of these strong prejudices would remain with the vulgar bourne says the salutation of the eastern church on this day was the lord is risen and the usual answer was the lord is risen indeed and no doubt they were peculiar to the morning  the children have dyed and gilded eggs given them which are called paste eggs a supposed corruption of pasche eggs eggs were held by the egyptians as a sacred emblem of the renovation of mankind after the deluge the jews adopted it to suit the circumstances of their history as a type of their departure from the land of egypt and it was used in the feast of the passover as part of the furniture of the table with the paschal lamb the christians have certainly used it on this day as retaining the elements of future life for an emblem of the resurrection mr brand has many well chosen quotations on this subject among which is a prayer extracted from the ritual of pope paul the vth made for the use of england ireland and scotland  bless o lord we beseech thee this thy creature of eggs that it may become a wholesome sustenance to thy faithful servants eating it in thankfulness to thee on account of the resurrection of our lord jesus christ who with thee etc etc  he quotes from dr chandlers travels in asia minor a passage in which it appears those of the greek church on this day presented colored eggs in russia there is the like custom which he shows in two quotations one from the abbe d auteroche in his journey to siberia and the other from hakluyts voyage      but from all the quotations no determination is drawn why the painted eggs were used on this day peculiarly and especially being no part of the days repast the field of conjecture is open and at large to every one it seems as if the egg was thus decorated for a religious trophy after the days of mortification and abstinence were over and festivity had taken place and as an emblem of the renovation of life certified to us by the resurrection from the regions of death and the grave  mr brand p     gives us the following note erasmus speaking of the proverb mea est pila that is i have got the ball tells us that it signifies i have obtained the victory i am master of my wishes the romanists certainly erected a standard on easter day in token of our lords victory but it would perhaps be indulging fancy too far to suppose that the bishops and governors of churches who used to condescend to play at hand ball at this time did it in a mystical way and with reference to the triumphal joy of the season certain it is however that many of their customs and superstitions are founded on still more trivial circumstances than even this imaginary analogy  it was an ancient custom for the mayor aldermen and sheriff of newcastle accompanied with great numbers of the burgesses to go every year at the feasts of easter and whitsuntide to the forth the little mall of the town with the maces sword and cap of maintenance carried before them the young people of the town still assemble there at this season particularly play at hand ball dance etc but are no longer countenanced in their innocent festivity by the presence of their governors who no doubt in ancient times used to unbend the brow of authority and partake with their happy and contented people the puerile pleasures of the festive season  it was also usual among the sports of the day to have foot courses etc the prize being a tansey cake it has been alleged that the use of tansey was adopted from the jewish mess of bitter herbs at this season a discussion of this practice of the jews would be too tedious in this place and articles of mortification seem not to correspond with the universal festivity of the time i rather conceive that the prizes were the ancient sweet bread concerning the use of which i shall have occasion to make some remarks in the sequel and that tansey was used for its flavor and salubrity only  mr brand quotes durand lib   c      for a very singular and unreasonable custom that on easter day wives used to beat their husbands and on the day following husbands their wives and he adds there is a custom still retained at the city of durham on these holydays on one day the men take off the womens shoes which are only to be redeemed by a present and on another day the women take off the mens in like manner this custom is not a peculiarity of the city of durham only but extends into other parts of that county as well as northumberland as it seems to be the remains of some religious ceremony if peculiar to the cathedral it would probably travel with the sea from lindisfarn by chester to durham and its remains would be found scattered through this passage in lancashire the custom of the day is to lift the passenger from the ground this shows of itself of what it is emblematical but our custom leaves us wide and indeterminate conjectures in the cathedral of durham there was a custom on good friday for the monks to approach the high altar then decorated with all the solemn emblems of that tremendous day on their knees being bare footed on easter day they made a solemn procession when all the spectators pulled off their shoes as treading on holy ground king canute approached the shrine of st cuthbert from garmondsway the distance of five miles with all his retinue and attendants barefooted when he gave great territories and donations to that church lel col vol i p     these are the most memorable circumstances i have been able to collect preparatory to the passover our savior washed the feet of the disciples after which he gave them this ordonance for i have given you an example that you should do as i have done to you the monks of durham are said to have washed the feet of the poor within the cloister in commemoration of our saviors act in the ages immediately succeeding the conversion of the britons an inveterate hatred and contempt was shown to all jews who by shipwreck or other casualty came among them even to a greater bitterness the aversion was carried than against the unconverted heathen the order of the passover ceremonies as set forth in the   th chapter of exodus enjoins the jews to have their shoes upon their feet perhaps in contradistinction or in reproach of the jews the shoes of passengers are pulled off  sweet bread i intimated in the preceding pages an intention of remarking the sweet bread used in religious rites small loaves of bread peculiar in their form being long and sharp at both ends are called buns this name takes place where old religious ceremonies have been solemnized derived from the consecrated sweet bread which was offered on high festivals it is of the highest antiquity according to mr bryant the offerings which people in ancient times used to present to the gods were generally purchased at the entrance of the temple especially every species of consecrated bread which was denominated accordingly one species of sacred bread which used to be offered to the gods was of great antiquity and called boun the greeks who changed the nu final into a sigma expressed it in the nominative  but in the accusative more truly boun  hesychius speaks of the boun and describes it a kind of cake with a representation of two horns julius pollux mentions it after the same manner a sort of cake with horns diogenes laertius speaking of the same offering being made by empedocles describes the chief ingredients of which it was composed  he offered up one of the sacred liba called a boun which was made of fine flour and honey it is said of cecrops he first offered up this sort of sweet bread hence we may judge of the antiquity of the custom from the times to which cecrops is referred the prophet jeremiah takes notice of this kind of offering when he is speaking of the jewish women at pathros in egypt and of their base idolatry in all which their husbands had encouraged them the women in their expostulation upon his rebuke tell him did we make her cakes to worship her etc jer xliv       lb vii    bryants analysis vol i p     the sacred cakes which were offered at the arkite temples were styled boun and were presented upon every seventh day bryant vol ii the custom of hot cross buns in london on the morning of good friday seems to have relation to these ancient practices we only retain the name and form of the boun the sacred uses are no more  hagmana the rev mr lamb vicar of norham editor of the poem of flodden fight in his ingenious notes thereto says we may find in the north the traces of some words left us by the romans for example the month of of december is called hagmana derived from the greek hagia mean the holy moon  isca when the shepherds call their dogs it is usual with them to cry isca isca which is evidently an abbreviation of lycisca the name of the roman shepherd dog  multum latrante lycisca virg ecl    hocktide hockdays thucxdaeg dies irrisorius a time of scorning or triumphing a festival of the common people held soon after easter the servants had liberty of diverse sports and diversions and in compensation for the loss of time in their service the masters were entitled to a gratuity it was held in commemoration of the day on which the danes were massacred a d  00  and such were the licentious enormities committed therein the servants deeming themselves during this festival under no law of subordination that it was prohibited by the church in the fifteenth century under pain of excommunication the remains of this festival seem to be retained in our fools day the  st of april when all sorts of ridiculous tricks are practiced to render the person you meet with a scoff and jest it may be presumed the persons who from their connections and intercourse with the danes lamented the horrid slaughter were thus scoffed and ridiculed and those who were ignorant of the event sent on fruitless errands to their dying friends weltering in gore such was the savage barbarity of the times and the ferocity of our progenitors these errands are called sleveless errands which skinner construes lifeless errands  may day it still retains some of its ancient sports the young people of both sexes go out early in the morning of the  st day of may to gather the flowering thorns and the dew of the grass which they bring home with music and acclamations and having dressed a poll on the towngreen with garlands dance around it the dew was considered as a grand cosmetick and preserved the face from wrinkles blotches and the traces of old age the happiest gift flora could bestow on her votaries it seems from these remains that this festival was introduced by the romans who observed it in honor of flora what particular rites originally attended it with that people we shall not enquire at present it is celebrated only with mirth innocence and love the druids who were the priests of the god of nature and celebrated every remarkable period in the change of seasons left a memorial of their religious rites on this day very different from those instituted in honor of the notorious divinity flora that is a beltein rural sacrifice it is to be traced in the mountainous and uncultivated parts of cumberland among the cheviots and in many parts of scotland mr pennant gives a particular description in his tour in scotland on the first of may in the highlands of scotland the herdsmen of every village hold their beltein they cut a square trench in the ground leaving the turf in the middle on that they make a fire of wood on which they dress a large caudle of eggs butter oatmeal and milk and bring besides the ingredients of the caudle plenty of beer and whisky for each of the company must contribute something the rites begin with spilling some of the caudle on the ground by way of libation on that every one takes a cake of oatmeal upon which are raised nine square knobs each dedicated to some particular being the supposed preserver of their flocks and herds or to some particular animal the al destroyer of them each person then turns his face to the fire breaks off a knob and flinging it over his shoulder says this i give to thee preserve thou my horses this to thee preserve thou my sheep and so on after that they use the same ceremony to the noxious animals this i give to thee o fox spare thou my lambs this to thee o hooded crow this to thee eagle when the ceremony is over they dine on the caudle etc  we retain something of this kind in the syllabub prepared for the may feast which is made of warm milk from the cow sweet cake and wine and a kind of divination is practiced by fishing with a ladle for a wedding ring which is dropped into it for the purpose of prognosticating who shall be first married  mr brand in his observations on bournes xxv chap makes several quotations from a pamphlet entitled the way to things by words and to words by things he says we gather from him that our ancestors hold an anniversary assembly on may day the column of may whence our may pole was the great standard of justice in the eycommons or fields of may here it was that people if they saw cause deposed or punished their governors their barons their kings the garland or crown when hung on the top of the may or pole was the great signal for convening the people this was one of the ancientest customs which from the remotest ages has been by repetition from year to year perpetuated it was considered as the boundary day that divided the confines of winter and summer allusively to which there was instituted a sportful war between two parties the one in defense of the continuance of winter the other for bringing in the summer the youth were divided into troops the one in winter livery the other in the gay habit of the spring the mock battle was always fought booty the spring was sure to obtain the victory which they celebrated by carrying triumphally green branches with may flowers proclaiming and singing the song of joy of which the burden was in these or equivalent terms  we have brought the summer home  parochial perambulation was a practice introduced by and adopted from the romans who held an annual feast of terminalia they were singularly observant of the bounds of their property and there as the most solemn mode of distinction made their places of sepulcher and erected altars in later ages the companies who went on the perambulation were attended by the parish priest and at every boundary mark which was distinguished by a stone cross a prayer was put up for a fruitful season and protection against the evils of pestilence and dearth this custom and prayer have lately been disused since we grew afraid of appearing religious least we should be accused of having superstition  midsummer the ceremonies of the eve and day of midsummer were various and worthy attention in all these festivals it was the custom to keep the wake as it was called or watch till after midnight and to begin the sports and ceremonies of the day in the first hour of the morning  the summer otice was the grand festival and jubilee of the druids and all those who retained any of the amonian rites of which we trace several in the religious ceremonies of the saxons this day was celebrated with peculiar magnificence and solemnity when the adored luminary was at his greatest altitude it has been alleged by some that the elusinian rites in celebrating the return of proserpine gave part of the ceremony of this day and that the use of garlands is derived from the custom of the initiated in the elusinian mysteries being crowned with flowers  it is usual to raise fires on the tops of high hills and in the villages and sport and dance around them this is of very remote antiquity and the first cause lost in the distance of time many reasons have been assigned in different periods bourne quotes a passage of durand to the following purport in ancient times the dragons being incited to lust through the heat of the season did frequently as they flew through the air spertmatize in the wells and fountains by this means the water became infected and the air polluted so that whoever drank the waters was either tormented with a grievous distemper or lost his life as soon as the physicians perceived this they ordered fires to be made every where about the wells and fountains and those things which occasioned the noisomest smell to be burnt knowing that thereby the dragons would be driven away and forasmuch as this custom was observed about the time we now celebrate st john baptists feast it is therefore still observed among some people in this enigmatical and misterious account we plainly trace the fires were originally kindled for sacred rites and sacrifice in order to avert the horrors of pestilence which in early ages frequently attended the advancing heat of summer in a country covered with forests and swamps whose respiration and exhalations brought on various distempers of which epilepsies was one of the most general to prevent which the darkness of those times had received few discoveries of medicine in scotland they used to run about the mountains and higher grounds with lighted torches like the sicilian women of old in scarch of proserpine  the prophetesses in mona at the approach of the romans ran about with dishevelled hair in a frantic mode with lighted torches performing various rites to execrate the enemy it was a custom not many years ago in this county for the villagers to run with burning firebrands round their fields and then in a forcible manner taking the ashes from some neighboring fire they used to exclaim we have won the flower alias flour of the wake moresin conceives we trace the ancient cerealia in this ceremony it is not to be wondered that the druid rites should in course of time be mixed with the roman mr borlace speaking of this custom in wales says he takes it to be the remains of the druid superstition moresin is of opinion the custom of leaping over the fires is a vestige of the ordeal and those performing these feats were showing tokens of innocence and virtue by being neither burnt or sullied the act of leaping through the flames was certainly a religious one and was meant as a kind of purification and not merely a sport and display of agility mr pennant mentions another remarkable custom in scotland of which he was an eye witness they take the new baptized infant and wave it three or four times gently over a flame saying thrice let the fire consume thee now or never this seems to be the direct act of purification in passing the fire of molock like other heathenish customs appropriated to festivals of the christian church these are adopted on the day of st john or rather used on the same anniversary and the name of that saint assumed to give them new sanctity mr brand quotes several passages from gebelins allegories orientales can one says he overlook here the st john fires kindled about midnight on the very moment of the solstice by the greatest part both of ancient and modern nations a religious ceremony which goes backward thus to the most remote antiquity and which was observed for the prosperity of states and to dispel every kind of evil divinations were also used on the vigil of this day men and women were accustomed to gather together in the evening by the sea side or in some certain houses and there adorn a girl who was her parents first begotten child after the manner of a bride then they feasted and leaped after the manner of bacchanals and danced and shouted as they were wont to do on their holidays after this they poured into a narrow necked vessel some of the sea water and put also into it certain things belonging to each of them then as if the devil gifted the girl with the faculty of telling future things they would enquire with a loud voice about the good or evil fortune that should attend them upon this the girl would take out of the vessel the first thing that came to hand and show it and give it to the owner who upon receiving it was so foolish as to imagine himself wiser as to the good or evil fortune that should attend him bourne p      another custom used on this day is to dress out stools with a cushion of flowers a lair of clay is placed on the stool and therein is stuck with great regularity an arrangement of all kinds of flowers so close as to form a beautiful cushion these are exhibited at the doors of houses in the villages and at the ends of streets and cross lanes of larger towns where the attendants beg money from passengers to enable them to have an evening feast and dancing this custom is evidently derived from the ludi compitalii of the romans this appellation was taken from the compita or cross lanes where they were instituted and celebrated by the multitude assembled before the building of rome servius tullius revived this festival after it had been neglected for many years it was the feast of the lares or household gods who presided as well over houses as streets this mode of adorning the seat or couch of the lares was beautiful and the idea of reposing them on aromatic flowers and beds of roses was excellent the chief port of the ceremonies and solemnities of this feast used by the romans as we are told by the poets and historians was exhibiting the household gods crowning and adorning them with chaplets and garlands of flowers and offering sacrifices up and down the streets the british remains of the ceremony are more refined  that of reposing them on those delicious beds suetonius tells us that augustus ordered the lares to be crowned twice a year we are not told there was any custom among the romans of strangers or passengers offering gifts our modern usage of all these old customs terminates in seeking to gain money for a merry night  sheepshearing the sheepshearing festival retains nothing singular and is too well known to require any animadversions  the wake the country wake or feast day called in some places the hopping is the ancient feast of dedication vide notes vol ii p     mell supper after harvest the heathens are said to have sacrificed to the deity vacina or vacuna who was supposed to preside over rest and ease it is now a custom on the last day of reaping to dress up an image of the corn and bear it home in triumph which is called the kern properly corn baby in some places i have seen an image apparelled in great finery crowned with flowers a sheaf of corn placed under her arm and a scycle in her hand carried out of the village on the morning of the conclusive reaping day with music and much clamor of the reapers into the field where it stands fixed on a poll all day and when the reaping is done is brought home in like manner this they call the harvest queen and represents the roman ceres the servants having performed the most valuable part of their labor are entertained by their masters when all distinction is laid aside this feast is called the mellsupper at which there are dancing masquing and disguising and all other kinds of rural mirth the name of this supper is derived from the rites of ceres when an offering of the first fruits was made the word melle being a provincial word and signifies in this country mingled implying that the cakes used at this festival are mingled or made of new corn and that it is the feast of the first mingling of flour of the new reaped wheat the romans held a solemn day after harvest dedicated to ceres and ops the accustomed victim a boar but we cannot from any part of the above rural feast gather the least roman remains save only the season and the image of the goddess the rejoicing after harvest may have an origin as high in antiquity as reaping itself the first instance we read of is in the  th chapter of genesis ver      semeslins we have a kind of cake mixed with fruit called semeslins the romans prepared sweet bread for their feasts held at seed time when they invoked the gods for a prosperous year in lancashire they are called semens we have the old french word still in use in heraldry semee descriptive of being sown or scattered  many customs are retained in winter  allhallow mass the  st day of november seems to retain the celebration of a festival to pomona when it is supposed the summer stores are opened on the approach of winter divinations and consulting of omens attended all those ceremonies in the practice of the heathen hence in the rural sacrifice of nuts propitious omens are sought touching matrimony if the nuts lie still and burn together it prognosticates a happy marriage or a hopeful love if on the contrary they bounce and fly asunder the sign is impropitious i do not doubt but the scotch fires kindled on this day anciently burnt for this rural sacrifice  martinmas has no peculiar celebration now remaining we are told by moresin that the heathen held the festival of bacchus at this season and without remembering the jolly god the jovial service long remained in the northern counties within half a century it was held as a season of great mirth and jollity  christmas has still many peculiar customs the saltatio armata the pyrrhick or military dance of the romans is still preserved men dressed out with ribbands perform a sword dance and gather gifts for a merry night  others in the same kind of gay attire draw about a plough called the stot plough and when they receive a gift make the exclamation largess but if not requited at any house for their appearance they draw the plough through the pavement and raise the ground of the front in furrows i have seen  0 men in the yoke of one plough  these are perfect remains of roman customs mr brand quotes the following passage aratrum inducere moris fuit romany cum urbem aliquam evertissent ut eam funditus delerent vocab utriusque juris a scot j c in verb aratrum it may have been practiced by the romans in commemoration of the founding of rome or some cities in britain  interea aeneas urbem designat aratro  virgil

tritorium tritum bubus et aratro  the stot plough has been conceived by some to have no other derivation than a mere rural triumph the plough having ceased from its labor  yule clog on the eve of the nativity the peasants place upon the fire a large piece of wood called a yule clog some have looked upon this as a rural sacrifice the beast being stalled there is no further use for the tether clog by which he was prevented straying in the summer from his pasture it has had a more distant implication and intended to keep up the wake and drive away malevolent spirits and spirits of darkness the druids held a solemn festival at this time and fires were lighted to fill up the space between the last night and first morning of the year that the evil genius might not prevail the elusinian mysteries were typical of the renewing year and the howlings and lamentations made in the hours of darkness for the loss of adonis were like our solemn wake over the yule clog which was to banish the spirits of darkness whilst the sun was in his deepest recess in those rites the return of adonis or the sun was represented by the approach of a priest with a lighted torch thereby dispelling the horrid darkness in which the prevalency of the evil genius was described by horrid noises and all the dreadful spectacles ingenuity could devise to secure the superstition of the assembly among all nations there has appeared a prevalent superstition touching good and evil spirits one superintending the hours of light the others darkness one the guides of mans rectitude and virtues the other his malevolence and vice  on the word yule or gule there have been innumerable controversies with the learned from whose arguments i am induced to believe it is a word derived from the old british language and implies a festival and thence that yule clog expresses the festive fuel  the yule baby was a sweetmeat image given to children in commemoration of our saviors nativity  the windows are dressed with evergreens as typical of our savior who was called the branch of righteousness that lives for ever also as memorials of his promises and our victory over death  christmas box gifts to servants and mechanics for their good services in the laboring part of the year the paganalia of the romans instituted by servius tullius were celebrated in the beginning of the year an altar was erected in each village where all persons gave money this was a mode originally devised for gaining the number of inhabitants  the dead customs attending death and funerals are well known and their origin of no very distant antiquity so that i will avoid a subject so peculiarly melancholy and affecting save only the arvel dinner  on the decease of any person possessed of valuable effects the friends and neighbors of the family are invited to a dinner on the day of interment which is called an arthel or arvel dinner arthel is a british word and is frequently more correctly written arddelw in wales it is written arddel and signifies according to dr davises dictionary asserere to avouch this custom seems of very distant antiquity and was a solemn festival made at the time of publicly exposing the corpse to exculpate the heir and those entitled to the possessions of the deceased from fines and mulcts to the lord of the manor and from all accusation of having used violence so that the persons then convoked might avouch that the person died fairly and without suffering any personal injury the dead were thus exhibited by ancient nations and perhaps the custom was introduced here by the romans  finis
