the opinion of a known dissenter on the bill for preventing occasional conformity what is the public possession of places or offices of trust in a government to the case of religion they who separate from the communion of a church cannot in reason expect to be entertained in the service of that very church and they that separate from the church ought to consider places and offices beforehand and to examine whether they can forego them for their consciences or not and if they did so they would not be so frequently foregoing their consciences to possess them a gain  and i cannot but wonder at and condemn the injustice of such dissenters who would have those people to whose communion they cannot or will not join receive them into equal advantages of honor and profit of trust and management in the politic concern  i cannot approve the equity of it nor i would not have the dissenters covet it nor had they the government in their hands would they admit it themselves  this coveting offices of trust honor and profit in the government has been the cause of that occasional compliance which to the dishonor and shame of the dissenters has branded them with too much levity in religion  for whoever dissents from an established church on any account but from a real principle of conscience is a politic not a religious dissenter  nothing can be lawful and unlawful at the same time if it be not lawful for me to dissent i ought to conform but if it be unlawful for me to conform i must dissent and he that cannot die or at least desire to do so rather than conform ought to conform  if i shall dissent and yet at the same time conform by conforming i deny my dissent being lawful or by my dissenting i damn my conforming as sinful  an act of parliament is of every mans own doing and therefore it is just every man should comply with the terms or suffer the penalty but here is no penalty if no crime and if no preferments are sought no honors accepted there is no crime if selfdenial was as practicable as selfadvancement here is no need of occasional conformity for all such do seek the crime that is the first sin then mortgage their consciences to avoid the penalty and so add one sin to another  no man can be said to separate from and join to a thing at the same time if your conscience is satisfied in joining it cannot be satisfied in separating unless you can suppose your conscience to be satisfied and dissatisfied both together  a man passively religious that can communicate any where may from the same principle and with far less guilt communicate no where for he has prostituted the little religion he had if ever he had any to his interest  no occasional conformist can be received into communion in any dissenting assembly upon any other terms than as a penitent for this practice is prepostrous excentrick and destructive of the very foundation of the dissenters principles  methinks men should seem what they are if a man dissent from the church let him do so and his principle being wellgrounded for such dissent let him hold it if not wellgrounded let him leave it if he cannot suffer one way let him suffer another and why should we not be as honest to god as our country  it is an intolerable affront to the church of england reflecting upon its doctrine as well as practice to make use of the church for a cover to fence them against the laws at the same time continuing to disown its communion as a thing not fit to be continued in  conformity and nonconformity at the same time in one and the same person for a secular end to save a penalty and privately and then as being ashamed of it to go back and sit down as not having done it at all are contradictions i must insist upon and rather wish than expect to see rectified  he who dissents from the established church except from true principles of conscience is guilty of a great sin  he who conforms to the established church against his conscience is guilty of a great sin  he who both dissents and conforms at the same time and in the same point of religion must be guilty of one of these great sins  and he who has committed either of these sins ought not to be received again on either side on any other terms than a penitent  as to partial conformity dissent in some things and conforming in others does not seem to concern this case no man among the dissenters pretended to dissent in every thing but we are speaking of conforming in those very points in which we dissent and that no less than the article of communion  if gentlemen who have such a latitude in their opinions would not have it thought they are moved to it by their interests let them practice it openly and not time it so to the every eve of an election as to have it speak of it self and as it were force men to believe it done on purpose nay let them not put such a reproach in the mouths of their enemies as to have it spoken in contempt with circumstances that stop the mouths of argument and are as convincing as demonstration  it is not a light thing to shift and change communion with an established and with a separate church as often as convenience or reason of state or interest invite  as to the excuse that is made that this is no conformity in point of religion but done as a civil action in obedience to the laws of the land as a qualification for admittance into public employments which they think it their duty to accept in order to serve their country are not sacraments religious acts are they not the same thing though differently administered in the established and in the dissenting church and how can you take it as a civil action in one place and a religious act in another this is playing bo peep with god almighty and no man can tell when they are about a civil action and when about a religious and if the service of their country be so dear to them pray why should they not undergo the penalties and choose to expose their bodies and estates for that service rather than their souls these are patriots indeed that will damn their souls to save their country for as has been observed conformity is a sinful act in a dissenter or else his dissenting before and after must be a sinful act and he has no excuse unless it be that he was convinced and reconvincd and then convinced again  after description of true protestant dissenters who cannot conform he proceeds in this manner if there are crept into their company statedissenters or politickdissenters they are not of them and we wish they would go out from them i see no act of parliament a making to the prejudice of this dissenter  this is the dissenter to which her majesty has promised her protection the act against occasional conformity does not concern us i dare undertake not one dissenter offered to present a petition to the honorable house against its passing they who can conform for one reason may conform without two and ought to conform and we are therefore content to be distinguished who cannot conform at all if we have any knaves amongst us take them if we have any hypocrites any who can conform and do not we are free to part with them that the remainder may be all such as agree with the true character of a conscientious dissenter  it is plain that occasional communion is contrary to the very nature and being of a dissenter who if he can conform ought to conform and if he can for a place of preferment ought to do it without the preferment  it is an act destructive of all possible pretense for dissenting and never was nor never can be defended by any dissenter without overthrowing all the reasons they could ever give for dissenting how then can this bill be aimed at the dissenters we hold it to be a novelty an abuse crept in amongst us and we are glad to have it condemned by authority we are so content with the suppressing the grievance of this scandalous ambidexter conformity that we think the hardships put upon us with it not worth the naming  all the parliaments that ever were or will be can never suppress any thing amongst us so scandalous to our reputation and to that candor with which we desire to guide our actions nor so contrary to and destructive of the very nature of our separating from the church of england and the constitution of all our collected congregations and therefore if these occasional conformists would accept of the friendly advice of their brethren it should be that they would for the future conform to the church of england  as for his authority to write thus in the name of the dissenters he alleges that he has the general concurrence of all the dissenters he ever conversed with that publication is an appeal to the world and if he has affirmed any thing in the name of the dissenters which is not their opinion he is liable to an easy confutation truth says he is a general commission and any man may write it  he modestly conceals his name that his reasons might not come clogged with the dead weight of the meanness and imperfections of the author the occasional conformity of dissenters says he is not condemned or defended by the names of authors on either side but by truth scripture and reason and so far as that is on his side he thinks it ought not to be despised for being ushered in by an unworthy instrument  london printed and are to be sold by j nutt near stationers hall   0
