temple bar mdccxvii price   d  an epistle to the king of sweden from a lady of great britain to thee rude warrior whom we once admired and thought thy actions spoke thee half inspired while justice held the balance of thy cause and every language sounded thy applause but since ambition and revenge prevails thy glories languish and our wonder fails to thee a woman sends with generous care and warns thy rashness timely to beware fame now a tale of fresher date has told beyond thy mad romantic feats of old our malcontents thy numerous squadrons boast describe thy penants waving on our coast and to the fearful cry britannias lost but we who know the genius of our isle at their report and thy invasion smile are not our dames in every climate famed les belles angloises by every nation named are not our youth in foreign fields admired alike by valor and by love inspired and shall those fair ones who the morning pass consulting that dear friend to love the glass to set the favorite and the patch to place to bow and glance it with becoming grace to melt the heros heart and charm his eyes fall to thy gothic rage a sacrifice no to thy terror learn our british youth are famed for honor constancy and truth each would as soon consent thy cause to aid as yield the fair to whom his vows are paid unlike the passive females of thy land the arbitrators of the war we stand at flurt of fan our armed legions fly and they who dare offend must dare to die we know thy daring heart is nursed in blood wild as the fiercest savage of the wood with fame like this in northern slaughter shine ough as the frozen bear thy neighboring sign but here thy brutal force no growns shall gain by love as well as arms our monarchs reign can we our george and his loved race disown to find thy barren chastity a throne no in thy shaggy rugg rude slumbers take and dream of conquests thou shall never make at distance be thy leathern doublet worn nor risque thy life to purchase certain scorn for now the wormwood damsels apprehend the dismal consequence of such a friend begin to tremble at the truths they hear and vow their champions shall for george declare they fear thy taste should lead young james astray and quite unman their monarch every way in his excuse they still would have to tell though wars his foe he loves exceeding well the proof from whence he sprung isnot to fight his surgeon proves hereditary right but if by thy example he should grow cold as thy rocks of ice and hills of snow should he clean linen hold in dire disgrace and sable crape his ivory neck enchase should he like thee on shives of coarsest bread rudely with dirty thumbs his butter spread banish the generous juice of grapes away and with small acid tiff his thirst allay swallow lean hasty meals of tastless roots and eat and drink and live and reign in boots should he like thee regardless of the fair lie down to sleep and only wake to war could he in arms like gallant brunswick shine yet would his female friends his cause decline nor justify a right so slovenly divine consult thy safety send no armies forth beyond the confines of thy frozen north since of our british fair this truth is told we love the chaste but we abhor the cold but if thy daring folly will proceed fate drives thee forward and thy falls decreed each lovely toast her heros soul inspires urges the war and wakes his martial fires think but what terrors will thy spirits seize when thou shall face such enemies as these see a battalion laced with point despan and warm in glowing velvets leads the van with warlike air the embroidered chiefs appear and gracefully the looms rich labors wear in modish order over their sholders fly devilles wiggs or lockmans smarter tie the goldclockd stocking draws the gazers sight and verdins redtopd shoe stitched round with white fine meclin laces round their fingers play from snowy shirts at least changed twice a day these welldressd youths to thy destruction move and victory waits upon the wings of love our sexes softness is to thee unknown what by a look or one kind kiss is done thou who a stranger art to loves delight can never imagine how these lovers fight these are the men who on the flandrian plains oerthrew the grand monarch in ten campaigns will these give way before thy vandal host and yield their former labors all for lost no these for liberty and beauty draw and all around the neighboring tyrants awe these cock take snuff invoke the darling fair and then dispatch the foe endebonair aim then no more fond prince at georges throne wake from the flattering dream and guard thy own in every element alike we reign and launch our ready squadrons on the main our champions jocund over the flowing bowl reigns in their wooden worlds from pole to pole fearless of danger cut their conquering way and from invading tyrants scour the sea safer thou might in lakes of sulphur sleep than brave these dreadful masters of the deep beneath their cannons roar thy flaggs must fall orford presides and these are brittons all these bold as lions will the fight maintain or drive thee back or sink thee in the main though boisterous as the winds at sea they roar they are gentle all as southern gales on shore the engagement past the tender thoughts return and for the fair in loves foft fires they burn in beautys dear embraces lulled they lie but when their country calls her strongest foes defy these hoist their sails and wait thy coming over and if thou dare to touch britannias shore never hope to see thy native sweden more how will thou dare these hearts of oak to meet should young augustus deign to lead the fleet augustus he who striding over the slain hunted thy new ally over flandrias plain the boy whose cause forsaken now by all calls for a madman to prevent his fall no dastard blood our princes veins disgrace unlike the princes of a former race who wisely slept or blubbered in distress he will face the battle and will force success from great plantagenet augustus springs by his example taught to conquer kings methinks i see the royal warrior stand dealing amongst his chiefs thy forfeit land while thou shall fall unpitied and forlorn all europes terror once but now all europes scorn finis
