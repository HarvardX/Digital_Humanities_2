mechanic exercises or the doctrine of handyworks  applied to the arts of smithing ioinery carpentry turning bricklayery   to which is added mechanic dyalling showing how to draw a true sundyal on any given plane however situated only with the help of a straight ruler and a pair of compasses and without any arithmetical calculation  the third edition  by joseph moxon fellow of the royal society and hydrographer to the late king charles  london printed for dan midwinter and tho leigh at the rose and crown in st pauls churchyard   0   preface i see no more reason why the sordidness of some workmen should be the cause of contempt upon manual operations than that the excellent invention of a mill should be dispisd because a blind horse draws in it and though the mechanics be by some accounted ignoble and scandalous yet it is very well known that many gentlemen in this nation of good rank and high quality are conversant in handyworks and other nations exceed us in numbers of such how pleasant and healthey this their diversion is their minds and bodies find and how harmless and honest all sober men may judge  that geometry astronomy perspective music navigation architecture etc are excellent sciences all that know but their very names will confess yet to what purpose would geometry serve were it not to contrive rules for handyworks or how could astronomy be known to any perfection but by instruments made by hand what perspective should we have to delight our sight what music to ravish our ears what navigation to guard and enrich our country or what architecture to defend us from the inconveniences of different weather without manual operations or how waste and useless would many of the productions of this and other counties be were it not for manufactures  to dive into the original of the mechanics is impossible therefore i shall not offer at it only i shall say it is rational to think that the mechanics began with man he being the only creature that nature has imposed most necessity upon to use it endowed with greatest reason to contrive it and adapted with properest members as instruments to perform it  nor is it easy to find by any authority what part of the mechanics was first practiced by man therefore i shall wave that too and only consider that if we our selves were the first men what branch of the mechanics we should first need and have recourse to  i have considered and answer that without the invention of smithing primarily most other mechanic invention would be at a stand the instruments or tools that are used in them being either made of iron or some other matter formed by the help of iron but pray take notice that by iron i also mean steel it being originally iron  nor would i have you understand that when i name the mechanics i mean that rough and barbarous sort of working which is used by the natives of america and some other such places for though they did indeed make houses canoes earthen pots bows arrows etc without the help of iron because they had then none amongst them yet since iron is now known to them they leave of their old way of working without it and betake themselves to the use of it nor are at this day though now they have in part the use of iron their machines made by good and ready rules of art for they know neither of rule square or compass and what they do is done by tedious working and he that has the best eye at guessing works best upon the straight square or circle etc  the lord bacon in his natural history reckons that philosophy would be improved by having the secrets of all trades lie open not only because much experimental philosophy is coucht amongst them but also that the trades themselves might by a philosopher be improved besides i find that one trade may borrow many eminent helps in work of another trade  hitherto i cannot learn that any has undertaken this task though i could have wished it had been performed by an abler hand then mine yet since it is not i have vetured upon it  i thought to have given these exercises the title of the doctrine of handycrafts but when i better considered the true meaning of the word handycrafts i found the doctrine would not bear it because handcraft signifies cunning or slight or craft of the hand which cannot be taught by words but is only gained by practice and exercise therefore i shall not undertake that with the bare reading of these exercises any shall be able to perform these handyworks but i may safely tell you that these are the rules that every one that will endeavor to perform them must follow and that by the true observing them he may according to his stock of ingenuity and diligence sooner or later inure his hand to the cunning or craft of working like a handycraft and consequently be able to perform them in time  for the reason aforesaid i intend to begin with smithing which comprehends not only the blacksmiths trade but takes in all trades which use either forge or file from the anchorsmith to the watchmaker they all working by the same rules though not with equal exactness and all using the same tools though of several sizes from those the common blacksmith uses and that according to the various purposes they are applied to and in order to it i shall first show you how to set up a forge and what tools you must use in the blacksmiths work then the rules and several circumstances of forging till your work come to the file then of the several sorts of iron that are commonly used and what sort is fittest for each purpose afterward of filing in general and the rules to be observed in it in the making of jacks hinges screws clocks watches etc in which examples you will find all other sorts of forging or filing work whatsoever comprehended and lastly as a close to smithing i shall exercise upon steel and its several sorts and how to order and temper it for its several uses and what sort is fittest for each particular purpose as which is fittest for edgetools which for springs which for punches etc  some perhaps would have thought it more proper to have introduced these exercises with a more curious and less vulgar art than that of smithing but i am not of their opinion for smithing is in all parts as curious a handycraft as any is besides it is a great introduction to most other handyworks as joynery turning etc they with the smith working upon the straight square or circle though with different tools upon different matter and they all having dependence upon the smiths trade and not the smith upon them  joseph moxon  errata page line        read

in general definition smithing is an artmanual by which an irregular lump or several lumps of iron is wrought into an intended shape  this definition needs no explanation therefore i shall proceed to give you an account of the tools a smith uses not but that they being so common i suppose you do already know them but partly because they may require some precaution in setting them up fittest to your use and partly because it behooves you to know the names smiths call the several parts of them by that when i name them in smiths language as i shall often have occasion to do in these exercises you may the easier understand them as you read them  of setting up a smiths forge the hearth or fireplace of the forge marked a in plate   is to be built up from your floor with brick about two foot and an half or sometimes two foot nine inches high according to the purpose you design your forge for for if your forge be intended for heavy work your hearth must lie lower than it need be for light work for easiness of management and so broad as you think convenient it may be built with hollow arches underneath to set several things out of the way the back of the forge is built upright to the top of the ceiling and enclosed over the fireplace with a hovel which ends in a chimney to carry away the smoke as b in the back of the forge against the fireplace is fixed a thick iron plate and a taper pipe in it about five inches long called a tewel or as some call it a teweliron marked  which pipe comes through the back of the forge as at c into this taper pipe or tewel is placed the nose or pipe of the bellows the office of this tewel is only to preserve the pipe of the bellows and the back of the forge about the fireplace from burning right against the back is placed at about twenty inches or two foot distance the trough and reaches commonly through the whole breadth of the forge and is as broad and deep as you think good as at d the bellows is placed behind the back of the forge and has as aforesaid its pipe fitted into the pipe of the tewel and has one of its boards fixed so that it move not upwards or downwards at the ear of the upper bellows board is fastened a rope or sometimes a thong of leather or an iron chain or rod as e which reaches up to the rocker and is fastened there to the farther end of the handle as at f this handle is fastened a cross a rockstaff which moves between two cheeks upon the centerpins in two sockets as at g so that by drawing down this handle the moving board of the bellows rises and by a considerable weight set on the top of its upper board sinks down again and by this agitation performs the office of a pair of bellows  of the anvil the shape of a black smiths anvil i have inserted in this figure though it is sometimes made with a pike or bickern or beakiron at one end of it whose use i shall show you when i come to round hollow work its face must be very flat and smooth without flaws and so hard that a file will not touch it as smiths say when a file will not cut or race it the upper plain a is called the face it is commonly set upon a wooden block that it may stand very steady and solid and about two foot high from the floor or sometimes higher according to the stature of the person that is to work at it  of the tongs there are two sorts of tongs used by smiths the one the straightnosed tongs used when the work is short and somewhat flat and generally for all plate iron the other crookednosd tongs to be used for the forging small bars or such thicker work as will be held within the returns of their chaps the chaps are placed near the joint because that considering the length of the handles they hold the iron faster than they would do were they placed farther from the joint as in the fig    a the chaps b the joint cc the handles  of the hammer and the sledge there are several sorts of hammers used by blacksmiths as first the handhammer which is sometimes bigger or less according to the strength of the workman but it is a hammer of such weight that it may be weilded or governed with one hand at the anvil secondly the uphand sledge used by underworkmen when the work is not of the largest yet requires help to batter or draw it out they use it with both their hands before them and seldom lift their hammer higher than their head thirdly the about sledge is the biggest hammer of all and is also used by underworkmen for the battering or drawing out of the largest work and then they hold the farther end of the handle in both their hands and swinging the sledge above their heads they at arms end let fall as heavy a blow as they can upon the work there is also another hammer used by them which they call a rivettinghammer this is the smallest hammer of all and very rarely used at the forge unless your work prove very small but upon cold iron it is used for rivetting or setting straight or crooking small work in fig   a the face b the pen c the eye d the handle  of the vice the vice must be set up very firmly that it shake not and stand upright with its chaps parallel or range with your workbench because square filing is a great piece of good workmanship in a smith and should the vice not stand upright and range with the workbench the chaps pinching upon two square sides would make the top side of your work either lean toward you or from you and consequently you filing as a good workman ought to do upon the flat or horizontal plain of your work would take off more of that angle or edge which rises higher than the plain and less off that edge that lies lower than the plain so that one angle being higher or lower than the other your work instead of being filed square would be filed squarewise when you shall have filed all its flat sides and that more or less according to the leaning of the chaps of your vice aa the face has its two ends in a straight line with the middle of its face or plain b the chaps must be cut with a bastard cut and very well tempered c the screw pin cut with a square strong worm d the nut or screw box has also a square worm and is brazed into the round box e the spring must be made of good steel and very well tempered where note that the wider the two ends of the spring stand asunder the wider it throws the chaps of the vice open f the foot must be straight and therefore will be the stronger to bear good heavy blows upon the work screwed in the chaps of the vice that it neither bow or tremble  of the handvice of the handvice are two sorts one is called the broad chapt handvice the other the square nosed handvice the office of the handvice is to hold small work in that may require often turning about it is held in the left hand and each part of your work turned upwards successively that you have occasion to file with your right the squarenosd handvice is seldom used but for filing small globulous work as the heads of pins that round off toward the edges etc and that because the chaps do not stand shouldering in the way but that the flat of the file may the better come at the edges their chaps must be cut as the vice aforesaid and well tempered  of the plyers plyers are of two sorts flat nosed and round nosed their office is to hold and fasten upon all small work and to fit it in its place the round nosed plyers are used for turning or bowing wire or small plate into a circular form the chaps of the fla nsd plyes must also be cut and tempered as the chaps of the vice a the nose b the chaps c the joint dd the handles  of the drill and drillbow drills are used for the making such holes as punches will not conveniently serve for as a piece of work that has already its shape and must have an hole or more made in it here the force of a punch will set your work out of order and shape because it will both batter the surface of the iron and stretch its sides out the shank of a key also or some such long hole the punch cannot strike because the shank is not forged with substance sufficient but the drill though your work be filed and polished never batters or stretches it but cuts a true round hole just in the point you first place it you must have several sizes of drills according as your work may require the shape in fig   is enough to show the fashion of it but it must be made of good steel and well tempered a the point ab the shank c the drillbarrel where note that the bigger the drillbarrel is the easier it runs about but less swift  and as you must be provided with several drills so you may sometimes require more than one drillbow or at least several drillstrings the strongest strings for the largest drills and the smallest strings for the smallest drills but you must remember that whether you use a small or strong string you keep your drillbow straining your string pretty stiff or else your string will not carry your barrel briskly about but your string and bow must both be accommodated to the size of your drill and if both or either be too strong they will break or bend your drill or if too weak they will not carry about the barrel as aforesaid  the drillplate or breast plate is only a piece of flat iron fixed upon a flat board which iron has an hole punched a little way into it to set the blunt end of the shank of the drill in when you drill a hole workmen instead of it many times use the hammer into which they prick a hole a little way on the side of it and so set the hammer against their breast  of the screwplate and its taps the screwplate is a plate of steel well tempered with several holes in it each less than other and in those holes are threads grooved inwards into which grooves fit the respective taps that belong to them the taps that belong to them are commonly made tapering toward the point as fig   shows but these tapering taps will not serve for some sorts of works as i shall show in its proper place  these are the most essential tools used in the blacksmiths trade but some accidental work may require some accidental tools which as they may fall in i shall give you an account of in convenient place  of forging in general i think it needless to tell you how to make your fire or blow it because they are both but laborers work nor how little or big it need to be for your own reason will by the size of your work teach you that only let me tell you the phrase smiths use for make the fire is blow up the fire or sometimes blow up the coals  when it is burning with the iron in it you must with the slice clap the coals upon the outside close together to keep the heat in the body of the fire and as often as you find the fire begin to break out clap them close again and with the washer dipped in water wet the outside of the fire to damp the outside as well to save coals as to strike the force of the fire into the inside that your work may heat the sooner but you ought often to draw your work a little way out of the fire to see how it takes its heat and quickly thrust it in again if it be not hot enough for each purpose your work is designed to ought to have a proper heat suitable to that purpose as i shall show you in the several heats of iron for if it be too cold it will not feel the weight of the hammer as smiths say when it will not batter under the hammer and if it be too hot it will redsear that is break or crack under the hammer while it is working between hot and cold  of the several heats smiths take of their iron there are several degrees of heats smiths take of their iron each according to the purpose of their work as first a bloodred heat secondly a white flame heat thirdly a sparkling or welding heat  the bloodred heat is used when iron has already its form and size as sometimes square bars and iron plates etc have but may want a little hammering to smooth it use then the face of your handhammer and with light flat blows hammer down the irregular risings into the body of your iron till it be smooth enough for the file and note that it behooves a good workman to hammer his work as true as he can for one quarter of an hour spent at the forge may save him an hours work at the vice  the flame or white heat is used when your iron has not its form or size but must be forged into both and then you must take a piece of iron thick enough and with the pen of your hammer or sometimes according to the size of your work use two or three pair of hands with sledges to batter it out or as workmen call it to draw it out till it comes to its breadth and pretty near its shape and so by several heats if your work require them frame it into form and size then with the face of your handhammer smooth your work from the dents the pen made as you did with a bloodred heat  a sparkling or weldingheat is only used when you double up your iron as smiths call it to make it thick enough for your purpose and so weld or work in the doubling into one another and make it become one entire lump or it is used when you join several bars of iron together to make them thick enough for your purpose and work them into one bar or else it is used when you are to join or weld two pieces of iron together end to end to make them long enough but in this case you must be very quick at the forge for when your two ends are throughout of a good heat and that the inside of the iron be almost ready to run as well as the outside you must very hastily snatch them both out of the fire together and after you have with the edge of your hammer scraped off such scales or dirt as may hinder their incorporating with your utmost diligence clap your left handpiece upon your right handpiece and with all speed lest you lose some part of your good heat fall to hammering them together and work them soundly into one another and this if your bars be large will require another or sometimes two or three pair of hands besides your own to do but if it be not thoroughly welded at the first heat you must reiterate your heats so often till they be thoroughly welded then with a flameheat as before shape it and afterward smooth it with a bloodred heat to make your iron come the sooner to a weldingheat you must now and then with your hearthstaff stir up the fire and throw up those cinders the iron may have run upon for they will never burn well but spoil the rest of the coals and take a little white sand between your finger and your thumb and throw upon the heating iron then with your slice quickly clap the outside of your fire down again and with your washer dipped in water damp the outside of the fire to keep the heat in  but you must take special care that your iron burn not in the fire that is that it do not run or melt for then your iron will be so brittle that it will not endure forging without breaking and so hard that a file will not touch it  some smiths use to strew a little white sand upon the face of the anvil also when they are to hammer upon a weldingheat for they say it makes the iron weld or incorporate the better  if through mistake or ill management your iron be too thin or too narrow toward one of the ends then if you have substance enough and yet not too long you may upset it that is take a flameheat and set the heated end upright upon the anvil and hammer upon the cold end till the heated end be beat or upset into the body of your work but if it be a long piece of work and you fear its length may wrong the middle you must hold it in your left hand and lay it flat on the anvil but so as the heated end intended to be upset may lie a little over the further side of the anvil and then with your handhammer in your right hand beat upon the heated end of your work minding that every stroke you take you hold your work stiff against the face of the hammer afterward smooth it again with a bloodred heat  if you are to forge a shoulder on one or each side of your work lay the shank of your iron at the place where your shoulder must be on the edge of your anvil that edge which is most convenient to your hand that if more shoulders be to be made turn them all successively and hammer your iron so as that the shank of the iron that lies on the flat of the anvil feel as well the weight of your blows as the shoulder at the edge of the anvil for should you lay your blows on the edge of the anvil only it would instead of flatting the shank to make the shoulder cut your work through  your work will sometimes require to have holes punched in it at the forge you must then make a steel punch to the size and shape of the hole you are to strike and harden the point of it without tempering because the heat of the iron will soften it fast enough and sometimes too fast but then you must reharden it then taking a bloodheat of your iron or if it be very large almost a flameheat lay it upon your anvil and with your left hand place the point of the punch where the hole must be and with the handhammer in your right hand punch the hole or if your work be heavy you may hold it in your left hand and with your punch fixed at the end of a hoopstick or some such wood hold the stick in your right hand and place the point of your punch on the work where the hole must be and let another man strike till your punch come pretty near the bottom of your work which when it does the sides of your work round about the hole will rise from the face of the anvil and your punch will print a bunching mark upon the hole of a bolster that is a thick iron with a hole in it and placing your punch as before strike it through but you must note that as often as you see your punch heat or change color you take it out of the hole and pop it into water to reharden it or else it will batter in the hole you intend to strike and not only spoil it self but the work too by running aside in the work having punched it through on the one side turn the other side of your work and with your hammer set it flat and straight and with a bloodheat punch it through on the other side also so shall that hole be fit for the file or square bore if the curiosity of your purposed work cannot allow it to pass without filing when your work is forged do not quench it in water to cool it but throw it down upon the floor or hearth to cool of it self for the quenching it in water will harden it as i shall shortly show you when i come to the tempering of steel  of brazing and soldering you may have occasion sometimes to braze or solder a piece of work but it is used by smiths only when their work is so thin or small that it will not endure welding to do this take small pieces of brass and lay them on the place that must be brazed and strew a little glass beaten to powder on it to make it run the sooner and give it a heat in the forge till by sometimes drawing it a little way out of the fire you see the brass run but if your work be so small or thin that you may fear the iron will run as soon as the brass and so you lose your work in the fire then you must make a loam of three parts clay and one part horsedung and after they are wrought and mingled very well together in your hands wrap your work with the brass and a little beaten glass upon the place to be brazed close in the loam and laying it a while upon the hearth of the forge to dry put the lump into the fire and blow the bellows to it till you perceive it have a full heat that is till the lump look like a well burnt coal of fire then take it out of the fire and let it cool afterward break it up and take out your work  thus much of forging in general it remains now that you know what sorts of iron are fittest for the several uses you may have occasion to apply them  of several sorts of iron and their proper uses it is not my purpose in this place to tell you how iron is made i shall defer that till i come to treat of metals and their refinings let it at present satisfy those that know it not that iron is by a violent fire melted out of hard stones called ironstones of these ironstones many countries have great plenty but because it wastes such great quantities of wood to draw the iron from them it will not in many places quit cost to use them in most parts of england we have abundance of these ironstones but our english iron is generally a course sort of iron hard and brittle fit for firebars and other such course uses unless it be about the forest of dean and some few places more where the iron proves very good  swedish iron is of all sorts the best we use in england it is a fine tough sort of iron will best endure the hammer and is softest to file and therefore most coveted by workmen to work upon  spanish iron would be as good as swedish iron were it not subject to redsear as workmen phrase it that is to crack betwixt hot and cold therefore when it falls under your hands you must tend it more earnestly at the forge but though it be good tough soft iron yet for many uses workmen will refuse it because it is so ill and unevenly wrought in the bars that it costs them a great deal of labor to smooth it but it is good for all great works that require welding as the bodies of anvils sledges large bellclappers large pestles for mortars and all thick strong bars etc but it is particularly chosen by anchorsmiths because it abides the heat better than other iron and when it is well wrought is toughest  there is some iron comes from holland though in no great quantity but is made in germany this iron is called dort squares only because it comes to us from thence and is wrought into square bars three quarters of an inch square it is a bad course iron and only fit for slight uses as windowbars brewersbars firebars etc  there is another sort of iron used for making of wire which of all sorts is the softest and toughest but this sort is not peculiar to any country but is indifferently made where any iron is made though of the worst sort for it is the first iron that runs from the stone when it is melting and is only preserved or the making of wire  by what has been said you may see that the softest and toughest iron is the best therefore when you choose iron choose such as bows oftenest before it break which is an argument of toughness and see it break sound within be gray of color like broken lead and free from such glistering specks you see in broken antimony no flaws or divisions in it for these are arguments that it is ound and well wrought at the mill  of filing in general the several sorts of files that are in common use are the square the flat the three square the half round the round the thin file etc all these shapes you must have of several sizes and of several cuts you must have them of several sizes as well because you may have several sizes of work as for that it sometimes falls out that one piece of work may have many parts in it joined and fitted to one another some of them great and others small and you must have them of several cuts because the roughtoothd file cuts faster than the bastardtoothd file the finetoothd file faster than the smoothtoothd file  the rough or coursetoothd file which if it be large is called a rubber is to take off the unevenness of your work which the hammer made in the forging the bastardtoothd file is to take out of your work the deep cuts or filestrokes the roughfile made the finetoothd file is to take out the cuts or filestrokes the bastardfile made and the smoothfile is to take out those cuts or filestrokes that the fine file made  thus you see how the files of several cuts succeed one another till your work is so smooth as it can be filed you may make it yet smoother with emerick tripoli etc but of that in its proper place because it suits not with this section of filing  you must take care when you use the rough file that you go very lightly over those dents the hammer made in your work unless your work be forged somewhat of the strongest for the dents being irregularities in your work if you should file away as much in them as you do off the eminencies or risings your work whether it be straight or circular would be as irregular as it was before you filed it and when you file upon the prominent or rising parts of your work with your course cut file you must also take care that you file them not more away than you need for you may easily be deceived because the course file cuts deep and makes deep scratches in the work and before you can take out those deep scratches with your finer cut files those places where the risings were when your work was forged may become dents to your hammer dents therefore file not those risings quite so low as the dents the hammer made but only so low as that the scratches the roughfile makes may lie as low or deep in your work as your hammer dents do for then when you come with your smoother cut files after your roughfile the scratches of your roughfile and your hammerstrokes or dents may both come out together but to do this with greater certainty hold your file so that you may keep so much of the length of your file as you can to rub range or as near range as you can upon the length of your work for so shall the file enter upon the second rising on your work before it goes off the first and will slip over and not touch the dent or hollow between the two risings till your risings are brought into a straight line with your hollow dent but of this more shall be said when i come to the practice of filing upon several particular sorts of work  if it be a square bar or such like you are to file upon all its angles or edges must be left very sharp and straight therefore your vice being well set up according to foregoing directions you must in your filing athwart over the chaps of the vice be sure to carry both your hands you hold the file in truly horizontal or flat over the work for should you let either of your hands mount the other would dip and the edge of that square it dips upon would be taken off and should you let your hand move never so little circularly both the edges you file upon would be taken off and the middle of your intended flat would be left with a rising on it but this handcraft you must attain to by practice for it is the great curiosity in filing  if it be a round piece or rod of iron you are to file upon what you were forbid upon square work you must perform on the round for you must dip your handlehand and mount your endhand a little and laying pritting near the end of your file to the work file circularly upon the work by mounting your handlehand by degrees and dipping your endhand in such manner as when the middle of your file comes about the top of your work your file may be flat upon it and as you continue your strokes forwards still keep your hands moving circularly till you have finished your full stroke that is a stroke the whole length of the file by this manner of circular filing you keep your piece or rod round but should you file flat upon the top of your work so many times as you shall remove or turn your work in the vice so many flats or squares you would have in your work which is contrary to your purpose  when you thrust your file forwards lean heavy upon it because the teeth of the file are made to cut forwards but when you draw your file back to recover another thrust lift or bear the file lightly just above the work for it cuts not coming back  thus much of filing in general  of the making of hinges locks keys screws and nuts small and great of hinges in fig   a the tail b the cross cdddde the joint dddd the pinhole when the joint at c on the tail is pind in the joint at e in the cross the whole hinge is called a crossgarnet  hinges if they be small as for cupboard doors boxes etc are cut out of cold plate iron with the smiths call all chissels they use upon cold iron coldchissels coldchissel but you mark the outlines of your intended hinge as fig   the crossgarnet either with chalk or else raze upon the plate with the corner of the coldchissel or any other hardened steel that will scratch a bright stroke upon the plate and then laying the plate flat upon the anvil if the plate be large or upon the the stake is a small anvil which either stands upon a broad iron foot or basis on the workbench to remove as occasion offers or else it has a strong iron spike at the bottom which iron spike is let into some certain place of the workbench not to be removed its office is to set small cold work straight upon or to cut or punch upon with the coldchissel or coldpunch stake if the plate be small take the coldchissel in your left hand and set the edge of it upon that mark or raze and with the handhammer in your right hand strike upon the head of the coldchissel till you cut or rather punch the edge of the coldchissel almost through the plate in that place i say almost through because should you strike it quite through the edge of the coldchissel would be in danger of battering or else breaking for the face of the anvil is hardened steel and a light blow upon its face would wrong the edge of the coldchissel besides it sometimes happens that the anvil or stake is not all over so hard as it should be and then the coldchissel would cut the face of the anvil or stake and consequently spoil it therefore when the edge of the coldchissel comes pretty near the bottom of the plate you must lay but light blows upon the coldchissel and yet you must strike the edge of the coldchissel so near through the bottom of the plate that you may break the remaining substance asunder with your fingers or with a pair of plyers or sometimes by pinching the plate in the vice with the cut place close to the superficies of the chaps of the vice and then with your fingers and thumb or your whole hand wriggle it quite asunder but having cut one breadth of the coldchissel remove the edge of it forward in the raze and cut another breadth and so move it successively till your whole intended shape be cut out of the plate  when you cut out an hinge you must leave on the length of the plate ab in this figure plate enough to lap over for the joints i mean to turn or double about a round pin so big as you intend the pin of your hinge shall be and also plate enough to weld upon the inside of the hinge below the pinhole of the joint that the joint may be strong  the size or diameter of the pinhole ought to be about twice the thickness of the plate you make the hinge of therefore lay a wyre of such a diameter toward the end b in this figure on the tail piece athwart the plate as cd and double the end of the plate b over the wyre to lap over it and reach as far as it can upon the end a then hammer the plate that is lapd over the wyre close to the wyre to make the pinhole round but if your plate be thick it will require the taking of an heat to make the hammer the closer to the wyre and consequently make the pinhole the rounder your work may also sometimes require to be screwed into the vice with the doubled end upwards and the bottom side of the wyre close against the chaps of the vice and then to hammer upon the very top of the pinhole to round it at the end also when you have made the pinhole round in the inside take the pin cd out of the pinhole and put the jointend of the hinge into the fire to make a weldingheat which when it has snatch it quickly out of the fire and hammer or weld the end b upon the tailpiece a till they be incorporate together but you must have a care that you hammer not upon the plate of the pinhole lest you stop it up or batter it when it is well welded you must again put in the pin cd and if it will not well go into the pinhole because you may perhaps have hammered either upon it or too near it and so have somewhat closed it you must force it in with your hammer and if it require take a bloodheat or a flameheat of the joint end and then force the pin into the pinhole till you find the pinhole is again round within and that the pin or wyre turn evenly about within it  afterward with a punch of hardened steel as you were taught page      punch the nailholes in the plate or if your plate be very thin you may punch them with a smiths call all punches they use upon cold iron coldpunches cold punch after all smooth it as well as you can with your handhammer take a bloodredheat if your work require it if not smooth it cold so will the tailpiece be fit for the file double and weld the crosspiece as you did the tailpiece  having forged your hinge fit for the file you must proceed to make the joint by cutting a notch in the middle of the pinhole between dd in plate   on the cross as at e and you must cut down the ends of the pinhole on the tailpiece as at dd till the joint at c fit exactly into the notch in the cross and that when the pin is put into the pinhole dd on the cross the pinhole in the tailpiece may also receive the pin then by holding the tailpiece in one hand and the cross in the other double the tail and cross toward one another to try if they move evenly and smoothly without shaking on the pin which if they do the joint is made if they do not you must examine where the fault is and taking the pin out mend the fault in the joint  then file down all the irregularities the coldchissel made on the edges of your work and if the curiosity of work require it file also the outer flat of your work but though smiths that make quantities of hinges do brighten them as they call it yet they seldom file them but grind them on a grindstone till they become bright etc  having finished the joint put the pin in again but take care it be a little longer than the depth of the joint because you must batter the ends of the pin over the outer edges of the pinhole that the pin may not drop out when either edge of the cross is turned upwards  the chiefest curiosity in the making these and indeed all other hinges is   that the pinhole be exactly round and not too wide for the pin   that the joints are let exactly into one another that they have no play between them lest they shake upwards or downwards nor yet are forced too hard into one another lest when they are nailed on the door the joint be in danger of breaking   that the cross and the tail lie on the underside exactly flat for should they warp out of flat when they are nailed on the nails would draw the joint awry and not only make it move hard and unevenly but by often opening and shutting break the joint   if your work be intended to be curious the true squarefiling the upperside as you were taught page          is a great ornament  a smiths call all chissels they use upon cold iron coldchissels  b the stake is a small anvil which either stands upon a broad iron foot or basis on the workbench to remove as occasion offers or else it has a strong iron spike at the bottom which iron spike is let into some certain place of the workbench not to be removed its office is to set small cold work straight upon or to cut or punch upon with the coldchissel or coldpunch  c smiths call all punches they use upon cold iron coldpunches  if the hinge you are to make be large and plateiron is not strong enough for it you must forge it out of flat bariron as you were taught from page   to page     the manner of working duftails fig   and sidehinges fig   etc is the shape considered in all respects the same i have here showed you in crossgarnets but in these or others you may if your work require curiosity instead of doubling for the joint forge the round for the joint of full iron and afterward drill a hole through it for the pinhole and by curious filing work them so true into one another that both sides of the hinge shall seem but one piece as i shall show more at large when i come to the making of compasses and other joints for mathematical instruments  of locks and keys as there are locks for several purposes as streetdoor locks called stocklocks chamber door locks called springlocks cupboardlocks chestlocks trunklocks padlocks etc so are there several inventions in locks i mean in the making and contriving their wards or guards but the contrivances being almost innumerable according to the various fancies of men shall be referred to another time to discourse and i shall now show you the working of a springlock which when you know how to do your fancy may play with inventions as you best like  in fig   aaaa the mainplate bc the keyhole ede the tophook ee crosswards f the bolt g the bolttoe or boltnab h the drawback spring

coldchissel the size and shape of the mainplate as you were taught to cut the cross and tailpiece of the crossgarnet then consider what depth you intend the bit of the key shall have and set that depth off on the mainplate by leaving about half an inch of plate between the bottom of the keyhole and the lower edge of the mainplate as at c or more or less according to the size of the lock then measure with a pair of composses between the bottom of the bit and the center of your key or your intended key and set that distance off from c to b near the middle between the two ends of the mainplate and with the a prickpunch is a piece of tempered steel with a round point at one end to prick a round mark in cold iron prickpunch make there a mark to set one foot of your compasses in then opening your compasses to the middle of the bit of your intended key as to d describe the arch ede for the true place the tophoop must stand on  then cut one other piece of plate as aaaa in fig   for a coverplate with two pieces one on each side long enough to make studs of to turn downwards and then outward again as ff gg that the coverplate may stand off the mainplate the breadth of the bit of the key and at the two end of these studs punch holes as gg to rivet the coverplate into the mainplate in the middle of this plate make the center as at b then open your compasses to three quarters the length of the bit and half the diameter of the shank of the key and placing one foot in the point b describe with the other foot the arch dcd for the true place of the mainward then set your compasses to a little more than half the diameter of the shank and place one foot as before in the center b and with the other foot describe the small arch e for the true place the stepward or as some call it the dapward must stand so have you the true places of the wards for an ordinary springlock you may if the depth of your bit will bear it put more wards in your plates but you must note that the more wards you put in the weaker you make your key because that to every ward on the plates you must make a slit or ward in the bit of the key and the more wards you make the weaker the iron of the bit will be and then if the bolt shoot not easily backwards or forwards the bit may be in danger of breaking  having marked on your plates the places of all your wards you must take thin plate and with hammering and filing make them both hammerhard is when you harden iron or steel with much hammering on it hammerhard and of equal thickness all the way then file one edge very straight by laying a straight ruler just within the edge of it and drawing or racing with a point of hardened steel a bright line by the side of the ruler file away the edge of the plate to that line then draw as before another straight line parallel to the first straight line or which is all one parallel to the filed edge just of the breadth you intend the wards shall be and file as before only you must leave two or sometimes three studs upon this plate one near each end and the other in the middle to rivet into the mainplate to keep the ward fixed in its place therefore you must take care when you elect this thin piece of plate that it be broad enough for the ward and these studs too then laying the plate athwart the pike of the bickern hold your hand even with the face of the bickern and hammer this plate down somewhat by the side of the pike and by degrees you may with care taken bring it unto a circular form just of the size of that circle you described on the mainplate which when you have done you must apply this ward to the circle you described on the mainplate setting it in the position you intend it shall be fixed and marking with a steel point where the studs stand upon that circle in those marks punch holes to rivet the studs to work so by all the other wards  if you have a pin to the lock punch a hole through the center on the coverplate somewhat smaller than the wyre you are to make your pin of because you may then file one end of the pin away to a shank which must fit the smaller hole on the plate and the whole thickness of the pin will be a sholder which will keep the pin steady in the centrehole of the plate when the pin is rivetted into the plate but because there is some skill to be used in rivetting i shall before i proceed any farther teach you  the manner of rivetting rivetting is to batter the edges of a shank over a plate or other iron the shank is let into so as the plate or other iron may be clinched close and fixed between the battering at the end of the shank and the sholder so that  when you rivet a pin into a hole your pin must have a sholder to it thicker than the hole is wide that the sholder slip not through the hole as well as the shank but the shank of the pin must be exactly of the size of the hole the shank must be rivetted into and somewhat longer than the plate is thick file the end of the shank flat so shall the edges of the end the easilier batter over the plate then put your shank into the hole wherein it is to be rivetted but be sure you force the shank close up to the sholder then turn the top of this sholder downwards plate and all upon your stake but lay it so as that the sholder lie solid and the shank at the same time stand directly upright and with your left hand keep your work bearing hard upon the flat or face of the stake then holding your hammer in your right hand hold the edge of the face of it dripping aslope from the right hand outward and lay pretty light blows upon the edge of the end of the shank turning with your left hand your work round to the face of the hammer till you have battered the edges of the shank quite round about but this is seldom done with once turning your work about therefore you may thus work it round again and again till you find it is pretty well rivetted then lay heavier blows upon it sometimes with the face sometimes with the pen of the hammer till the end of the shank is battered effectually over the plate  one main consideration in rivetting is that the pin you rivet in stand upright to the plate or other iron you rivet it upon for if it do not stand upright you will be forced to set it upright after it is rivetted either in the vice or with your plyers or with your hammer and that may if your plate be thin bow it or if it be thick break the shank or else the sholder of your rivet and so you lose your labor and sometimes spoil your work  another consideration is that when you rivet a pin to any plate and you fear it may afterward twist about by some force that may be offered it you must to provide against this danger file the shank you intend to rivet either square or triangular and make the hole in the plate you rivet it into of the same size and form and then rivet in the shank as before there are two ways to make your hole square or triangular one is by filing it into these forms when it is first punched round the other by making a punch of steel of the size and shape of the shank you are to rivet and punching that punch into the plate make the same form  now to return where i left off the pins and shanks of these wards must be made of a long square form because the plates of the wards being thin should you make them no broader than the plate is thick the studs or shanks would be too weak to hold the wards therefore you must make the rivettingshank three or four times or sometimes more as broad as the plate is thick and then rivet them in as you were taught just now  then place the coverplate upon the mainplate so as the center of the coverplate may stand directly over and against the center of the mainplate and make marks through the hole gg of the studs of the coverplate upon the mainplate and on those marks punch holes and fit two pins into them to fasten the coverplate on to the mainplate but you must not yet rivet them down till the keyhole be made because this coverplate would then stop the progress of the file through the mainplate when you file the keyhole when you have placed the coverplate upon the mainplate and fitted it on with pins so as you may take it off and put it on again as your work may require you must punch the keyhole or rather drill two holes close by one another if the keyhole falls near the wards because punching may be apt to set the wards out of form and with small files file the two holes into one another to make the hole big enough to come at it with bigger files and then file your keyhole to your intended size and shape  the keyhole being finished forge your key as you were taught page   and if your key is to have a pinhole drill the hole in the middle of the end of the shank then file the wards or slits in the bit with thin files yet sometimes smiths punch or cut them with a coldchissel at the same distances from the middle of the pinhole in the end of the shank which is the same center which was made before in the mainplate on the coverplate which you placed the wards at from the center of the main and coverplate but before you file these wards too deep into the bit of the key make trials by putting the bit into the keyhole whether the wards in the bit will agree with the wards on the plates which if they do you may boldly cut them to the depth of the wards on the plate if not you must alter your course till they do but you must take great care in cutting the wards down straight and square to the sides of the bit for if they be not cut down straight the wards on the plates will not fall in with the wards in the bit of the key and if they be not square to the sides of the bit the bit will not only be weaker than it need be but it will show unhandsomely and like a botch to the eye  the cross and hockwards is made or at least entered at the forge when the iron has a blood or almost a flame heat yet sometimes smiths do it on cold iron with a thin chissel as you was taught page      but you must take care that your chissel be neither too thick or too broad for this punching of wards is only to give the thin files entrance to the work which entrance when you have you may easily file your cross or hookwards wider or deeper as your work may require but if your chissel be too broad or too thick it will make the wards in the bit too long or too wide and then as i said before the bit of your key will prove weaker than it needs to be  having made the wards on the plate and in the bit of the key you must forge the bolt of a considerable substance thick and square at the end that shoots into the staple in the frame of the door that it may be strong enough to guard the whole door but the rest of the bolt that lies between the two staples on the mainplate may be made very thin inwards that is the side that lies toward the mainplate which because it cannot be seen when the bolt is fixed upon the plate i have made a figure of it and turned the inside to view as in fig   where you may see that the end a has a considerable substance of iron to guard the whole door as aforesaid and b is a square stud which does as well keep the outside flat of the bolt on the range as serve for a stud for the spring h in fig   to press hard against and shoot the bolt forwards this bolt must be wrought straight on all its sides except the topside which must be wrought straight only as far as the sholder g called the toe or nab of the bolt which rises as you see in the figure considerably high above the straight on the top of the bolt the office of this nab is to receive the bottom of the bit of the key when in turning it about it shoots the bolt backwards or forwards  having forged and filed the bolt you must fit the hollowside of it toward the mainplate at that distance from the keyhole that when the key is put into the keyhole and turned toward the bolt the bottom of the bit may fall almost to the bottom of the nab and shoot the bolt back so much as it needs to enter the staple in the doorframe and having found this true place for the bolt you must with square staples just fit to contain the bolt with an easy play fasten these staples by rivetting them with the bolt within them one near the bolt end the other near the nab end as at ll to the mainplate  then punch a pretty wide hole in the mainplate as at k to receive a strong pin and file a sholder to the shank of the pin that goes into the plate this pin is called the pin of the tumbler the tumbler is marked i which is a long piece of iron with a round hole at the top to fit the pin of the tumbler into that it may move upon it as on a joint and it has an hook returning at the lower end of it to fall into the breech of the bolt and by the spring h forces the bolt forwards when it is shot back with the key this spring is made of steel and afterward tempered as i shall show you in proper place it is fixed at the bottom of the mainplate by two small shanks proceeding from that edge of the spring that lies against the mainplate as at oo these shanks are to be rivetted as you were taught even now on the other side of the mainplate  all things being thus fitted punch an hole on each corner of the mainplate for nails to enter that must nail the lock to the door or if you intend to screw your lock on the door you must make wide holes big enough to receive the shank of the screw last of all rivet down your coverplate to the mainplate and file your key and polish it too if you will so shall the lock and key be finished  a a prickpunch is a piece of tempered steel with a round point at one end to prick a round mark in cold iron  b hammerhard is when you harden iron or steel with much hammering on it  the making of screws and nuts the shank of the screw for doors and many other purposes must be forged square near the head because it must be let into a squarehole that it may not twist about when the nut is turned about hard upon the screwpin therefore take a squarebar or rod of iron as near the size of the head of the screwpin as you can and taking a flameheat of it lay so much of this bar as you intend for the length of the shank with one squareside flat upon the hitherside of the anvil and hammer it down to your intended thickness but have a care you do not strike your iron on this side the edge of the anvil lest you cut the iron as i told you page    thus at once you will have two sides of your shank forged the underside made by the anvil and the upperside beaten flat with the hammer the head will be in the main rod of iron then if your iron grows cold give it another heat and lay one of the unwrought sides upon the hitherside of the anvil just to the head and hammer that down as before so shall the two other squaresides be made then hammer down the corners of so much of this shank as you intend for the screwpin and round it as near as you can with the hammer set then the chissel to the thickness you intend the head shall have and strike it about half through then turn the sides successively and cut each side also half through till it be quite cut off if the sholder be not square enough hold it in your squarenosd tongs and take another heat and with speed lest your work cool screw the shank into the vice so as the sholder may fall flat upon the chaps of the vice then hammer upon the head and square the sholder on two sides do the like for squaring the other two sides this was in part taught you before in page    but because the cutting this iron rod or bar just above the sholder makes the head and for that i did not mention it there i thought fit since the purpose required it to do it here the forging of the nuts are taught before page       having forged and filed your shank square and the head either square or round as you intend it shall be file also the screwpin from the risings and dents left at the forge and file it a little tapering toward the end that it may enter the screwplate the rule how much it must be tapering is this consider how deep the inner grooves of the screwplate lie in the outer threads and file the end of the screwpin so much smaller than the rest of the screwpin for the outer threads of the screwplate must make the grooves on the screwpin and the grooves in the screwplate will make the threads on the screwpin having fitted your self with a hole in your screwplate that is such a hole whose diameter of the hollow grooves shall be equal to the diameter of the screwpin but not such a hole whose diameter of the outer threads shall be equal to the diameter of the screwpin for then the screwplate will indeed turn about the screwpin but not cut any grooves or threads in it screw the shank with the head downwards in the vice so as that the screwpin may stand directly upright and take the handle of the screwplate in your right hand and lay that hole flat upon the screwpin and press it very hard down over it and turn the screwplate evenly about with its handle toward you from the right toward the left hand so shall the outer threads of the screwplate cut grooves into the screwpin and the substance of the iron on the screwpin will fill up the grooves of the screwplate and be a thread upon the screwpin but take this for caution that as i told you you must not make your screwpin too small because the screwplate will not cut it so if you make it too big if it do enter the screwplate where it is taper it will endanger the breaking it or if it do not break it yet the screwplate will after it gets a little below the tapering go no farther but work and wear off the thread it made about the tapering  to fit the pin therefore to a true size i in my practice use to try into what hole of the screwplate the tap or place of the tap if it be a tapering tap i make the nut with will just slide through  threads and all which generally in most screwplates is the hole next above that to be used for then turning my pin about in that hole if the pin be irregularly filed or but a little too big on any part of it the threads of that hole will cut small marks upon the pin on the irregular places or where it is too big so that afterward filing those marks just off i do at once file my pin truly round and small enough to fit the hle i make my screwpin with  as the hole of the screwplate must be fitted to the screwpin so must the screwtap that makes the screw in the nut be fitted to to the round hole of the nut but that tap must be of the same size of your screwpin too which you may try by the same hole of the screwplate you made the scrwpin with screw the nut in the vice directly flat that the hole may stand upright and put the screwtap upright in the hole then if your screwtap have an handle turn it by the handle hard round in the hole so will the screwtap work it self into the hole and make grooves in it to fit the threads of the screwpin but if the screwtap have no handle then it has its upper end filed to a long square to fit into an hollow square made near the handle of the screwplate but that long square hole over the long square on the top of the tap and then by turning about the screwplate you will also turn about the tap in the hole and make grooves and threads in the nut  but though small screws are made with screwplates yet great screws such as are for vices hotprsses printingpresse etc are not made with screwplates  must  out of the main iron with heavy blow  a coldchissel the manner of making them is as follows  the rules and manner of cutting worms upon great screws the threads of screws when they are bigger than can be made in screwplates are called worms they consist in length breadth and depth the length of a worm begins at the one end of the spindle and ends at the other the breadth of the worm is contained between any two grooves on the spindle viz the upper and under groove of the worm in every part of the spindle the depth of the worm is cut into the diameter of the spindle viz the depth between the outside of the worm and the bottom of the groove  the depth ought to be about the one seventh part of the diameter on each side the spindle  you ought to make the groove wider than the worm is broad because the worm being cut out of the same entire piece with the spindle will be as strong as the worm in the nut though the worm  be smaller for you cannot come  the nut to cut it with fles as you  and therefore you must either turn up a rod of iron to twist round about the grooves on the spindle and then take it off and braze it into the nut or else you must cast a nut of brass upon the spindle which will neither way be so strong as the worm cut out of the whole iron by so much as brass is a weaker metal than iron and therefore it is that you ought to allow the worm in the nut a greater breadth than the worm on the spindle that the strength of both may as near as you can be equalizd for both being put to equal force ought to have equal strength the worm may very well be the one seventh part smaller than the groove is wide as aforesaid  having considered what breadth the worm on the spindle shall have take a small thin plate of brass or iron and file a square notch at the end of it just so wide and so deep as your worm is to be broad and deep and file the sides of the plate that this notch stands between just to the width of the groove this plate must be a gage to file your worm and groove to equal breadth by then draw a straight and upright line the whole length of the spindle divide from this line the circumference of the whole spindle into eight equal parts and through those divisions draw seven lines more parallel to the first line then open your compasses just to the breadth of one worm and one groove and set off that distance s often as you can from the one end of the spindle to the other but i should first have told you that the end of your spindle must be square to the outside and with a prickpunch make a mark to every setting off on that line do the like to all the other straight upright lines note that you may choose one of these eight upright lines for the first and make the next toward your left hand the second but then the first must stand toward you and the next that the third and so on and the top mark of every one of these upright straight lines shall be called the first mark the next under that the second mark the third the third mark and so downwards in order and number  having marked one of these eight lines at the top of the spindle to begin the winding of the worm at with a blacklead pencil draw a line from that mark to the second mark on the next upright line toward the left hand from thence continue drawing on with your pencil to the third mark on the third upright line draw on still to the fourth mark on the fourth upright line and so onwards till you have drawn over the eight straight lines which when you have done you must still continue on drawing downwards to each lower mark on each successive upright line till you have drawn your worm from end to end then examine as well as you can by your eye whether the worm you have carried on from mark to mark with the blackled pencil do not break into angles which if it do any where you must mend it in that place then with the edge of an halfround file file a small line in the blacklead line and be sure that the line you are filing run exactly through all the marks that the blacklead pencil should have run through if it did not for want of good guidance of the hand this small line is only for a guide to cut the groove down by for the making of a screw is indeed nothing else but the cutting the groove down for then the worm remains but you must not file in this small line but leave it as a guide to lie on the middle of the worm as i said before therefore to cut down the groove take a coldchissel somewhat thinner than you intend the groove shall be wide viz about the thickness of the breadth of the worm and with heavy blows cut out the groove pretty near the reason why you should not offer to cut the grooves to their full wedth at the first is because your hand may carry the coldchissel somewhat awry and should your coldchissel be as thick as the groove is wide you could not smooth the irregularities out without making the worm narrower than you intended it then with a flatfile open and smooth the groove filing in the middle between the two next fine lines cut by the halfround file till you have wrought the spindle from end to end so shall the worm remain but you must not expect that though the groove be cut it is therefore finished for now you must begin to use the thin plategage and try first whether the worm have equal breadth all the way secondly whether the grove have equal breadth all the way and thirdly whether the groove have equal depth all the way and where ever you find the worm too broad you must file it thinner and where the groove is not deep enough file it deeper therefore in cutting down the groove you may observe that if at first you file the worm never so little too narrow or the groove never so little too deep you shall have all the rest of the worm or groove to file over again because the whole worm must be brought to the breadth of the smallest part of it and the whole groove to the depth of the deepest place all the way especially if the nut be to be cast in brass upon the spindle because the metal running close to the spindle will bind on that place and not come off it but if the nut be not to be cast in brass but only has a worm brazed into it this niceness is not so absolutely necessary because that worm is first turned up and bowed into the grooves of the spindle and you may try that before it is brazd in the nut and if it go not well about you may mend or botch it either by hammering or filing or both  the manner of casting the nut upon the spindle i shall show when i come to the casting of metals and the manner of brazing has been taught already number i fol        if your spindle is to have three or four worms winding about it as coiningpresses and printingpresses have that they may not wear out too fast you must divide the circumference into three or four equal parts and having straight upright lines drawn as before begin a worm at each of those three or four divisions on the circumference and considering the breadth of your worm and width of your groove measure that width as often as you can on all the upright lines and making marks on those at each setting off draw as before a line from the end of the spindle on the first upright line to the mark below it which is the second mark on the second upright line from thence to the third mark on the third upright line and so on to the other end of the spindle having drawn the first worm work the other worm as this  thus much may at present suffice for great screws    mechanic exercises or the doctrine of handyworks viz the making of jacks and bulletmolds the twisting of iron and casehardning it with the use of some tools not

pieces with two small squares toward the ends of them and two round ends for screwpins beyond those squares the small squares are to be fitted into square holes into the fore and backsides and the round screwpins are to make screws of to which a square nut is to be fitted to draw the top and bottom pieces close and right up to the insides of the fore and backsides the manner of filing of these ends you were in part taught numb ii fol       and numb i fol    but another way is by trying your work with an instrument called by workmen a square as you see described in this figure  of the square and its use the sides abc are called the outersquare the sides def the innersquare its use is thus if your work as in this case be an outersquare you must use the innersquare def to try it by applying either the side ed or df but suppose the side ed to one of the sides of your work choose the flattest and truest wrought if neither of the sides be flat make of them flat as you were taught numb i fol       if then you find the side df of your square lie all the way even upon the adjoining side of your work you may conclude those sides are square but if the adjoining side of your work comply not all the way with the adjoining side of the square you must file away your work where the square rides upon it till the whole side be wrought to comply with the adjoining side of the square that is till both the sides of your work agree with both the sides of the squares when they are applied to one another having tried two sides square make a third side of your work square by applying one of the sides of the square to one of those sides of your work that are already made square and as before try the third untried side and make that square and by the same rule make the fourth side square  if the work you are to file be an hollow square you must apply the outer square abc to it and try how when one side of the square is applied to one side of your work the other side of your work agrees with the other side of the square which if it do all is well but if the square and the work comply not with one another you must file the work where it bears the square off but to return where i left  having made these two ends square you must fit the length of them to the thickness of the fore and backsides into which they are to enter but so as the squares be not full so long as to come quite through the fore and backsides lest when the nuts are screwed on the screwpins that are at the ends of these squares they screw full up to the squares and bear against the corners of them which if they do the nuts will not draw the fore and backsides close against the shoulder of the squares on the top and bottom pieces and then the whole jack frame will not stand fast and firm together  but before you fit this frame thus together you must consider the diameter of the mainwheel that you may punch round holes in the fore and backsides to enter the mainspindle therefore open your compass to half the intended diameter of the mainwheel and half a quarter or an whole quarter of an inch more for play between the semidiameter of the main wheel and the upper flat of the bottom piece and set that distance off from the upper flat of the bottom piece on the fore and backsides and with a round punch somewhat smaller than the intended size of the main spindle punch holes at that setting off your punch must be smaller than the main spindle because the holes may perhaps not be so exactly round or punchd so truly upright or perfectly smooth as they ought to be and should you make the holes so wide at first as they need to be you could not mend them without making them wider these holes must be punchd at the fire or forge as smiths say when they take an heat of their work to punch it because the fore and the backsides are too strong as smiths say that is too thick to punch with the cold punch the way of punching them you were taught numb i fol       besides a cold punch is commonly made flat at the bottom and therefore does not prick an hole but cut an hole if the iron be not too strong for that flat bottom and the upright side about it met in an angle or edge at the bottom which edge by the force of the hammer cuts the iron if it be not too strong when it is laid upon a bolster as it is described numb i fol    and should you cut out so much iron in the fore and backsides as would entertain the main spindle it being thick you will make the fore and backsides too wide therefore as i said the holes must be pricked in the fore and backsides at the fire or forge which with a sharp pointed punch is sooner done nor does pricking diminish the substance or strength of the iron but makes it swell out at the sides and retain both substance and strength the irregularity or swelling out that this punching makes on the flats of the fore and backsides you must hammer down again with almost a bloodredheat i say almost a bloodredheat because should you take too great an heat you may make the fore and backsides stretch and so put the whole jackframe out of order  having punchd the holes for the main spindle you must punch the holes in the fore and backsides for the wormwheel spindle as you punch the holes for the main spindle but these must be small holes to entertain the small ends or pins of the wormwheel spindle  these holes thus punchd may perhaps not be exactly round or fit your size nor will they be smooth enough within therefore with a the square bore is a square steel point or shank well tempered fitted into a square socket in an iron wimble it is described fig   its use is to open a hole and make it truly round and smooth within when you use it you must set the head against your breast and put the point of the square bore into the hole you punchd or would open and turning the handle about you with it turn about the shank of the square bore whose edges cut away the irregularities of the iron made in the punching but you must thrust or lean hard with your breast against the head of the square bore that it may cut the faster and you must be sure to guide the square bore truly straight forwards in the hole lest the hole be wrought aslope in the iron squarebore you must to open an hole is in smiths language to make the hole wider open them wider to your size and that opening them in the inside will both round and smooth them  you must also punch a square hole toward the top of the foreside for the shank of the wormloop  then forge and sit in your mainwheel spindle and your wormwheel spindle which spindles must both be exactly straight between the corners of their two ends unless you like to have moldings for ornaments on them and forge a square toward the ends of both the spindles to fit into a square hole in the middle of the cross of their wheels and leave substance enough for a shoulder beyond the square to stop the square hole in the cross of the wheels from sliding farther on the spindle and you must leave substance of iron enough to forge the nut of the wormwheel near the other end but in this and indeed in all other forging remember as i told you numb i fol   that it behooves you to hammer or forge your work as true as you can least it cost you great pains at the vice  then forge the wormspindle which is all the way round and straight unless you will have moldings for ornaments as aforesaid upon the shank of it but you must be sure to forge substance enough for the worm to be cut out of it  the main and wormwheels are forged round and flat  the manner of forging these wheels which in smiths language is turning up the wheels is first to draw out a square rod as you were taught numb i fol   among the several heats of iron somewhat thicker than you intend your wheel shall be but it must be almost as thin on one side as you intend the inner edge of the wheel shall be and the opposite to it above twice that thickness for the outer edge of the wheel the reason you will find by and by having drawn from your square rod a convenient length viz almost three times the diameter of your intended wheel you must take almost a flameheat and hammer all along the whole length upon the thick edge so will you find the long rod by this hammering turn by degrees rounder and rounder in upon the thin edge which you hammered not upon till it become a circle or pretty near a circle but you must make it somewhat more than a circle for the ends must lap over one another that they may be welded upon one another  thus you may see the reason for making the outer edge of the rod thick and the opposite edge thin for your hammering upon the outer edge only and not on the inner makes the outer edge a great deal thinner and at the same time makes the wheel broader  the reason why i told you you should draw fourth the rod to almost three times the diameter of the wheel and not to the geometrical proportion is because that in hammering upon it to make it round the rod will stretch so considerably that it will be long enough to make a wheel of your intended diameter and most commonly somewhat to spare but to return  before you take a welding heat as by numb i fol    0 you must flatten the two ends that are to be welded together to a little more than half their thickness that when they are lapt over one another and welded together they may be no thicker than the other part of the wheel  if the wheel be not turned up so round that with a little labor you may mend them at the vice you must with blood red heats hammer them round upon the pike or bickern of the anvel holding with your tongs the inner edge of the wheel upon it and hammering upon the outer edge of the wheel till the wheel be fit for the vice their insides must be divided into four equal parts or four a dufftail is a figure made in the form of a dovestail and is used by many other handycrafts as well as smiths but most especially by joyners as i shall show when i come to joynery dufftail notches to be filled into them the dufftail notches are cut in the inner edge of the wheel somewhat more than a quarter of an inch deep and spreading somewhat wider toward the outer edge the notches are to receive the four ends of a cross forgd somewhat thicker toward the ends than the thickness of the wheel and must be filed outer dufftails to let exactly into the inner dufftail notches made in the inside of the wheel they must be forged thicker than the wheel because they must batter over both the flat sides of the wheel to keep the wheel strong and steady upon the cross and sometimes for more security they are brazed into the wheel yet that is but seldom the middle of this cross is made broad that when the square of the spindle it may have strength enough to bear the violence offered at as well in winding up the great weight that keeps the wheels in motion as in the checking and turning the jackwinder back to set the jack a going when by the winding up it may be subject to stand still or sometimes for want of weight or else for want of oiling or some other accident  these wheels thus forged and filed flat must be divided the main wheel commonly into    equal parts and the worm wheel into    equal parts but these numbers are not exactly observed by smiths for sometimes they make them more and sometimes less either according to the size of their wheels or according as they intend their wheels shall go swifter or slower about for the fewer the teeth on a wheel are the sooner a wheel goes about and the more teeth on a wheel the slower the wheel goes about or sometimes as they have opened their compasses to divide them for if by luck they at first open their compasses to such a width as will just measure out on a circle which they describe on the center of the wheel for that purpose their intended number than the wheel shall have the intended number of teeth if not let it somewhat fall short or exceed that number they matter not but make that number of teeth on the wheel and having thus divided the wheel they by the side of a straight ruler laid to the center and every division marked on the wheel draw or scratch a straight line from the outer limb of the wheels to the circle which circle i should have told you before is described at that distance from the outer verge they intend the teeth shall be cut down to this is indeed a rough way of working but the office of a jack is well enough performed by this rough work and the usual prizes such as will scarce pay workmen for better as they say  these wheels thus divided must be cut down into these divisions with a a jackfile is a broad file somewhat thin on both edges and stronger in the middle jackfile the mainwheel straight thwart the outer verge which to speak mathematically makes an angle of  0 degrees with the flat sides of the wheel and the wormwheel aslope making an angle of about     degrees with its sides that is an angle of    degrees with a line drawn straight athwart the outer edge of the wheel and that teeth of the wormwheel may gather themselves into the grooves of the worm in the wormspindle the worm on the wormspindle running about    degrees aslope from this axis or perpendicular of the wormspindle the notches you make with the file must be so wide as to contain about twice the thickness of of each tooth therefore you may observe that the number of teeth cannot be assigned because the sizes of all jack wheels are not of equal diameters and the sizes of the teeth must be filed very square and smooth as the corners taken off and rounded on both sides toward the middle of the top or end of the tooth which much helps the teeth to gather in upon the teeth of the nut and the worm on the wormspindle  the teeth of the wheels being cut down and the whole wheel finished they must be forced stiff and hard upon the square of the spindle close up to the shoulder which square being made somewhat longer than the cross of the wheel is thick must with a coldchissel be cut on the top of that square to make the iron that comes through the square hole of the wheel spread over the cross of the wheel and then that spreading must be battered with the pen of the hammer that it may stand up stiff against the shoulder of the square on the other side of the wheel but in doing this you must be very careful that the spindle stand exactly perpendicular to the flat sides of your wheels for should the spindle lean never so little to one or the other side of the wheel the the wheel when it is moving in the jackframe would not move perpendicular but wabble toward the fore or backsides of the jackframe and perhaps by this irregular motion before a revolution of the wheel be performed it would go off from the length of the teeth of the nut  then file the spindlepins which are the ends of the spindle that go into the centerholes of the fore and backsides of the jackframe exactly round and fit to their centerholes and place them into their proper centerholes then try if the wheels are exactly round on their outer edges and that in turning about their flat sides wabble not but in a revolution keep parallel to the fore and backsides the way smiths use to try them by is to turn them about by the spindle and holding a piece of chalk steady to the outer limb of the wheel not letting the point of the chalk slip forwards or backwards or toward the right or left hand for then if the chalk make a white stroke round the whole wheel and that white stroke lie exactly parallel to the two outer edges of the wheel the wheel is not only round but stands also true upon its spindle that is perpendicular to the spindle and the spindle perpendicular to the flat of it but if the chalk does not touch round the wheel you must file down so much of the outer verge of the wheel where the chalk does touch as will bring down or equalize the diameter of the wheel in that place to the diameter of the wheel in the place where it does not touch so you may conclude the wheel is round if the mark of the chalk lie not exactly in the middle between the two edges of the wheel then it is not perpendicular to the spindle and you must with the hammer set it right that is perpendicular by forcing the wheel over from the side it leans too much to or else by forcing the spindle which is all one yet this is an help you ought not to rely upon but in case of necessity rather be sure your wheel and spindle stand perpendicular to one another before you fasten the wheel upon the square of the spindle for by this help the square on the spindle will be apt to loosen in the square of the wheel and you will have your wheel to now fasten upon the square of the spindle again  as you tried the wheels with chalk so you must try the nut the worm and the spindle  the upper part of the wormspindle must be filled truly round to fit into the wormloop that it shake not in it and yet go very easily about without the least stopping at the upper end of this round on the worm spindle you must file a square to sit the square hole of the fly upon  the shank of the wormloop and the stud of the wormspindle must stand so far off the left side of the fore side that the teeth of the wormwheel may fall full into the grooves of the worm for so both being cut with the same slope the slope teeth of the wormwheel will gather into the slope grooves of the spindle and pressing upon the worm drive about the wormspindle and the fly  the fly is made sometimes with two sometimes with four arms from the center and sometimes the arms are made longer sometimes shorter the more arms and also the longer arms are to make the jack go slower  there is yet a small matter more of ironwork about the jack which is the tumbler but it lies in the farther end of the barrel and cannot well be described without a particular figure which therefore i have inserted as in fig   a the barrel b the main spindle coming through the barrel a the center of the tumbler moving upon the centerpin which is fastened into an ironplate behind the barrel b the collar upon the mainspindle from which proceeds a tongue which passes through a pretty wide hole at c in the tumbler as far as cc the catch of the tumbler the tumbler moves as aforesaid upon the center hole a but receives the tongue through it at c and passes as far as e this tongue serves as a cheek to the tumbler that it cannot tumble above an angle of  0 degrees from the ironplate it is fastened to and that the width of its centerhole and the width of the tongue passes through and the motion of the collar about the mainspindle allows it but were the centerhole a and its centerpin fit and the hole c and the tongue that also passes through it also fit and the collar fixed it could not move at all but this play is enough for it to do the purpose it is designed for the tumbler is so placd behind the barrel that while the jack line is winding up upon the barrel its round britch passes forwards by all the crosses of the mainwheel and the point or catch d as then claps it self snug or close to the ironplate of the barrel but when the barrel is turned to the contrary way the weight of the catch in half a revolution of the barrel let the tumbler be posited where it will makes it open and fall from the ironplate and butt against one or other of the crosses on the mainwheel and so thrusts the main wheel about with the barrel  the eye of the wnch or winder is forged as you were taught to forge the pinhole in the crossgarnet numb ii fol    but that was to be a small round hole and therefore you were directly to lay a small round piece of iron or wyre where you intended the pin hole should be and lap the other end of your work over it but this is to be a wide square hole therefore you must lay a square piece of iron of your size where the eye of the jackwinch shall be and lap or double the other end over it and weld and work as you were directed the rest of the winch is but common forging and filing work which has been sufficiently taught already  the woodwork belonging to the jack is a barrel a spiwheel and a handing of the winch which being turners work i shall say nothing to till i come to the art of turning only those wheels that have more than one groove in them are called two three etc struckwheels in workmens corrupting anguage but i suppose originally two stroke three stroakwheels etc from the number of grooves that are in them  the excellencies of a good jack are   that the jackframe be forged and ild square and conveniently strong well set together and will screw close and tight up   that the wheels be perpendicularly and strongly fixed on the squares of the spindles   that the teeth be evenly cut and well smoothed and that the teeth of the wormwheel fall evenly into the groove of the worm   that the spindle pins shake not between the fore and backsides nor are too big or too little for their center holes  a the square bore is a square steel point or shank well tempered fitted into a square socket in an iron wimble it is described fig   its use is to open a hole and make it truly round and smooth within when you use it you must set the head against your breast and put the point of the square bore into the hole you punchd or would open and turning the handle about you with it turn about the shank of the square bore whose edges cut away the irregularities of the iron made in the punching but you must thrust or lean hard with your breast against the head of the square bore that it may cut the faster and you must be sure to guide the square bore truly straight forwards in the hole lest the hole be wrought aslope in the iron  b to open an hole is in smiths language to make the hole wider  c a dufftail is a figure made in the form of a dovestail and is used by many other handycrafts as well as smiths but most especially by joyners as i shall show when i come to joynery  d a jackfile is a broad file somewhat thin on both edges and stronger in the middle  the manner of making molds to cast leadenbullets in i insert the making of bullet molds because there is some sort of work in them different from what has yet been taught the handles and the heads are forgd as other work but the two concave hemisphers are first punchd with a round ended punch of the shape and almost of the size you intend the bullet shall be they must be punchd deep enough at the forge with a blood red heat then are the edges of the chaps filed flat first with a common file the common way but afterward with an using file as workmen call it the using file is a long and broad file exactly flat on both its cut sides having a square iron handle down out at one end with an hole in it but the handle is not to hold it by when you use it but the hole in it to go over a pin you hang it upon when you do not use it when you use it you must lay it flat upon the work bench with its handle from you and you must take care that it lies solid and steady lest when you work upon it it slip from you therefore you may strike a nail in at the hole in the handle a little way into the work bench that you may draw it again when you have done with the using file you may drive in a small tack on each side the using file to keep it steady or you may tack down two small thin boards on either side and rip them off again when you have done your using file lying thus straight and steady before you lay the chaps of one half of the mold flat upon the hither end of the using file and holding your two thumbs and your two forefingers upon the head of the mold thrust your work hard down from you the whole length of the usingfile then draw your work lightly back and thrust it again hard from you retire these thrusts thus till upon the chaps of the mold you can see no irregularities or the filestroaks of the common file lest so may you be sure that the chaps of the mold is truly flat do the like by the other half of the mold  now you must try whether each of these concaves be an exact halfround thus you may describe an arch a little more than a semicircle just of the diameter of the bullet upon the end of a thin piece of brasslatin draw a straight line through the center and the arch on both sides it for the limits of the semicircle file very curiously all the brass away on the end just to this semicircle and just to the diametralline on either side of the semicircle so have you a unequal semicircle put this unequal semicircle into the concave molds if it fits them so as the unequal reaches just the bottom of the molds when its shoulder touches just the chaps of the mold they are each a true concave hemisphere but if the shoulder of the unequal that is a diametralline prolonged rides upon the chaps of the concave and the bottom of the unequal touch not the bottom of the concave the concave is punchd too deep and must have its chaps rubbed upon the usingfile again till it comply with the unequal then put into the two concaves a round bullet that will just fill them both and pinching the heads of the mold close together in a vice with the bullet in it drill an hole through both the handles of the joint the reason why the bullet is put into the mold is because the chaps of the two halves should lie exactly upon one another whilst the hole for the joint is drilling then fit a rivetpin for this hole and rivet them together but not so hard but that the mold may open and shut pretty easy and yet go true then take the bullet out and file in each half of the head half a round hole directly against one another for the a great is the hole through which the metal runs into the mold the word is used by most founders ga which two half holes when the mold is shut will make one round hole  you may now try with clay or by casting a leaden bullet in it whether it be exactly round or no for making a true round hole in a thin piece of brass just of the circumference of the chaps you may try if the castbullet will just pass through and also fill that hole when the bullet is turnd every way which if it do you may conclude the mold is true this thin piece of brass with a round hold in it is called a sizer  but the inside wants cleansing for hitherto it is only punchd therefore you must provide a the bulletbore is a shank of steel having a steel globe or bullet at one end just of your intended bullet size this globular end must be hatched with a fine cut by a filecutter and hardened and tempered the end of the shank this globular bore is fastened to must be round and so small that when the bulletbore is in the mold the geat will easily receive it the other end of the shank must be fitted into the square socket of the wimble and have a shoulder to it to stop the socket from sliding too far upon the shank from this shoulder the rest of the shank must run tapering down to the small end the bulletbore is fastened to you must work with it as you were taught to work with the squarebore bulletbore with which you may bore the inside of each half to clear it or if they be not quite deep enough punchd you may bore them deeper you may bore them severally or together by putting the bulletbore into the mold so as the shank may come through the geat  in this section you see first the use of a usingfile an instrument of great use for a flat filing for by it you may make two pieces of iron of somewhat considerable breadth so true that by laying the two flat sides upon each other they shall draw up one another it is much used by clockmakers watchmakers lettermoldmakers and indeed all others that frame squarework on iron steel or brass secondly the use of a bulletbore which though it be seldom used yet it may serve not only for bulletmolds but for other purposes and by altering its shape into an oblong a cone or cilinder you may bore these hollow figures either for molds or some other accidental uses  a a great is the hole through which the metal runs into the mold the word is used by most founders  b the bulletbore is a shank of steel having a steel globe or bullet at one end just of your intended bullet size this globular end must be hatched with a fine cut by a filecutter and hardened and tempered the end of the shank this globular bore is fastened to must be round and so small that when the bulletbore is in the mold the geat will easily receive it the other end of the shank must be fitted into the square socket of the wimble and have a shoulder to it to stop the socket from sliding too far upon the shank from this shoulder the rest of the shank must run tapering down to the small end the bulletbore is fastened to you must work with it as you were taught to work with the squarebore  of twisting of the iron square and flat bars sometimes are by smiths twisted for ornament it is very easily done for after the bar is square or flat forged and if the curiosity of your work require it truly filled you must take a flameheat or if your work be small but bloodred heat and you may twist it about as much or as little as you please either with the tongs vice or handvice etc  of casehardning casehardning is sometimes used by filecutters when they make course files for cheapness and generally most rasps have formerly been made of iron and casehardned because it makes the outside of them hard it is used also by gunsmiths for hardening their barrels and it is used for tobaccoboxes codpiecebuttons heads for walkingsaves etc and in these cases workmen to set a greater value on them in the buyers esteem call them steelbarrels steeltobaccoboxes steelbuttons steelheads etc but iron thus hardened takes a better polish and keeps the polish much longer and better than if the iron were not case hardened the manner of casehardning is thus take cowhorn or hoof dry it thoroughly in an oven and then beat it to powder put about the same quantity of bay salt to it and mingle them together with stale chamberly or else whitewinevinegar lay some of this mixture upon the loam made as you were taught numb i fol    and cover your iron all over with it then wrap the loam about all and lay it upon the hearth of the forge to dry and harden when it is dry and hard put it into the fire and blow up the coals to it till the whole lump have just a bloodredheat but no higher lest the quality of your mixture burn away and leave the iron as soft as at first then take it out and quench it or instead of loam you may wrap it up in plate iron so as the mixture may touch every part of your work and blow the coals to it as aforesaid  of several sorts of steel in common use among smiths the difficulty of getting good steel makes many workmen when by good hap they light on it commend that countrysteel for best from whence that steel came thus i have found some cry up flemishsteel others swedish english spanish venice etc but according to my observation and common consent of the most ingenious workmen each country produces almost indifferently good and bad yet each country does not equally produce such steel as is fit for every particular purpose as i shall show you by and by but the several sorts of steel that are in general use here in england are the english the flemish the swedish the spanish and the venicesteel  the englishsteel is made in several places in england as in yorkshire gloucestershire sussex the wild of kent etc but the best is made about the forest of dean it breaks fiery with somewhat a course grain but if it be well wrought and proves sound it makes good edgetools files and punches it will work well at the forge and take a good heat  the flemishsteel is made in germany in the country of stiermark and in the land of luyck from thence brought to colen and is brought down the river rhine to dort and other parts of holland and flanders some in bars and some in gads and is therefore by us called flemishsteel and sometimes gadsteel it is a tough sort of steel and the only steel used for watchsprings it is also good for punches filecutters also use it to make their chissels of with which they cut their files it breaks with a fine grain works well at the forge and will take a welding heat  i cannot learn that any steel comes from sweden but from dantzick comes some which is called swedishsteel it is much of the same quality and finess with flemishsteel  the spanishsteel is made about biscay it is a fine sort of steel but some of it is very difficult to work at the forge because it will not take a good heat and it sometimes proves very unsound as not being well curried that is well wrought it is too quick as workmen call it that is too brittle for springs or punches but makes good fine edgdtools  venicesteel is much like spanish steel but much finer and works somewhat better at the forge it is used for razors chirurgions instruments gravers etc because it will come to a fine and thin edge razor makers generally clap a small bar of venicesteel between two small bars of flemishsteel and so work or weld them together to strengthen the back of the razor and keep it from cracking  there is another sort of steel of higher commendations than any of the forgoing sorts it is called damascussteel it is very rare that any comes into england unwrought but the turkishcymeters are generally made of it it is most difficult of any steel to work at the forge for you shall scarce be able to strike upon a bloodheat but it will redsear insomuch that these cymeters are by many workmen thought to be cast steel but when it is wrought it takes the finest and keeps the strongest edge of any other steel workmen set almost an inestimable value upon it to make punches coldpunches etc of we cannot learn where it is made and yet as i am informed the honorable mr boil has been very careful and industrious in that enquiry giving it in particular charge to some travelers to damascus to bring home an account of it but when they came thither they heard of none made there but were sent about  0 miles into the country and then they were told about  0 miles farther than that so that no certain account could be gained where it is made kirman toward the ocean affords very fine steel of which they make weapons highly prized for a cymeter of that steel will cut through an helmet with an easy blow geog rect fol      the rule to know good steel by break a little piece of the end of the rod and observe how it breaks for good steel breaks short of all gray like frost work silver but in the breaking of the bad you will find some veins of iron shining and doubling in the steel  of nealing of steel having chose your steel and forged it to your intended shape if you are either to file engrave or to punch upon it you ought to neal it first because it will make it softer and consequently work easier the common way is to give it a bloodredheat in the fire then take it out and let it cool of it self  there are some pretenders to know how to make steel as soft as lead but so often as my curiosity has prompted me to try their pretended processes so often have they failed me and not only me but some others careful observers but the way they most boast of is the often heating the iron or steel in redhot lead and letting it cool of it self with the lead i have many times tried this without any other success than that it does make iron or steel as soft as if it were well neald the common way but no softer and could it be otherwise the small iron ladles that letterfounders use to the casting of printingletters would be very soft indeed for their iron ladles are kept constantly month after month in melting metal whereof the main body is lead and when they cast small letters they keep their metal redhot and i have known them many times left in the metal and cool with it as the fire has gone out of it self but yet the iron ladles have been no softer than if they had been well neald the common way but perhaps these pretenders mean the iron or steel shall be as soft as lead when the iron or steel is redhot if so we may thank them for nothing  but that which makes steel a very small matter softer than the common way of nealing is by covering steel with a course powder of cowhorns or hoofs or ramshorns and so enclosing it in a loam then put the whole lump into a wooden fire to heat redhot and let it lie in the fire till the fire go out of it self and the steel cool with the fire  of hardening and tempering steel english flemish and swedishsteel must have a pretty high heat given them and then suddenly quench in water to make them very hard but spanish and venicesteel will need but a bloodredheat and then when they are quenchd in water will be very hard if your steel be too hard that is to brittle and it be an edged or pointed instrument you make the edge or point will be very subject to break or if it be a spring it will not bow but with the least bending it will snap assunder therefore you must let it down as smiths say that is make it softer by tempering it the manner is thus take a piece of grinstone or whetstone and rub hard upon your work to take the black scurf off it and brighten it then let it heat in the fire and as it grows hotter you will see the color change by degrees coming to a light goldish color then to a dark goldish color and at last to a blew color choose which of these colors your work requires and then quench it suddenly in water the light goldish color is for files coldchissels and punches that punch into iron and steel the dark goldish color for punches to use on brass and generally for most edgetools the blew color gives the temper to springs in general and is also used to beautify both iron and steel but then workmen sometimes grind indico and salladoyl together and rub that mixture upon it with a woollen rag while it is heating and let it cool of it self  there is another sort of hardening called hammerhardning it is most used on iron or steel plates for dripping pans saws straightrulers etc it is performed only with well hammering of the plates which both smooths them and beats the metal firmer into its own body and somewhat hardens it  the manner of forging steel either for edgetools punches springs etc is the several shapes considered the same with forging iron only this general rule observe from an old english verse used among smiths when they forge edgetools he that will a good edge win must forge thick and grind thin   the end of smithing   mechanic exercises or the doctrine of handyworks the art of joinery definition joinery is an art manual whereby several pieces of wood are so fitted and joined together by straightline squares miters or any bevel that they shall seem one entire piece  explanation by straightlines i mean that which in joyners language is called a joint that is two pieces of wood are shot that is plained or else they are pared that is the irregularities that hinder the closing of the two pieces are cut off with a pairingchissel they are shot or pared as i said so exactly straight that when they are set upon one another light shall not be discerned betwixt them this they call shooting of a joint or paring to a joint because these two pieces are with glue commonly joined together either to make a board broad enough for their purpose or to a clamp one piece of wood to the end of another piece of wood to keep it from casting or warping  by squares i mean the making of frames either for doorcases or such like which is the framing of two pieces of wood athwart two other pieces of wood so as the four angles of the frame may comply with the square marked d  by miters are meant the joining of two pieces of wood so as the joint makes half a square and does comply with the mitersquare marked e  by a bevel is meant any other angle as frames that may be made of pentagon hexagon octagon etc figures    the names of joyners tools described in plate iv aa workbench b the hook in it to lay boards or other b stuff flat against whilst they are c trying or plaining c the benchscrew on its hither side to screw boards in whilst the edges of them are plaining or d shooting and then the other edge of the board is set upon a pin or pins if the board be so long as to reach the other leg put into the holes marked aaaaa down the legs of the bench which pin or pins may be removed into the higher or lower holes as the breadth of the board shall require so then the benchscrew keeps the board close to the edge of the bench and the pins in the legs keep it to its height that it may stand steady whilst the other edge is working upon for in the shooting of a joint if the board keeps not its exact position but shakes or trembles under the plain your joint will very hardly be truly straight d the holdfast let pretty loose into round holes marked bbbbbb in the bench its office is to keep the work fast upon the bench whilst you either saw tennant mortess or sometimes plain upon it etc it performs this office with the knock of an hammer or mallet upon the head of it for the beak of it being made crooked downwards the end of the beak falling upon the flat of the bench keeps the head of the holdfast above the flat of the bench and the hole in the bench the shank is let into being bored straight down and wide enough to let the holdfast play a little the head of the holdfast being knocked the point of the beak throws the shank aslope in the hole in the bench and presses its backside hard against the edge of the hole on the upper superficies of the bench and its foreside hard against the oppersite side of the under superfcies of the bnch and so by the point of the beak the shank of the holdfast is wedged between the upper edge and its oppersite edge of the round hole in the bench sometimes a double screw is fixed to the side of the bench as at g or sometimes its farther cheek is laid an edge upon the flat of the bench and fastened with an holdfast or sometimes two on the bench e a mallet     bbbbbbb plains of several sorts as b   a fore plain a the te b the mouth c the wedge d the rn e the sole f the foreend g the britch fgh the stock all together a plane it is called the fore plane because it is used before you come to work either with the smooth plane or with the joynter the edge of its iron is not ground upon the straight as the smooth plane and the joynter are but rises with a convexarch in the middle of it for its office being to prepare the stuff for either the smothing plane or the joynter workmen set the edge of it c ranker than the edge either of the smoothing plane or the joynter and should the iron of the plane be ground to a straight edge and it be set never so little ranker on one end of the edge than on the other the ranker end would bearing as then upon a point in working dig gutters on the surface of the stuff but this iron being ground to a convexarch though it should be set a little ranker on one end of its edge than on the other would not make gutters on the surface of the stuff but at the most little hollow dawks on the stuff and that more or less according as the plane is ground more or less arching nor is it the office of this plane to smooth the stuff but only as i said to prepare it that is to take off the irregular risings whether on the sides or in the middle and therefore it is set somewhat ranker that it may take the irregularities the sooner off the stuff that the smoothing plane or the joynter may afterward the easier work it try the manner of trying shall be taught when i come to treat of the use of the rule  you must note that as i told you in smithing number i fol          it was the office of the course toothed file to take off the prominent irregularities the hammer made in the forging etc and that you were not to file them more away than you need so the same caution is to be given you in the using of this fore plane in joynery for the reason there alleged in smithing whether to avoid repetition i refer you only with this consideration that there iron or steel was the matter wrought upon and there a course file the tool but now wood is the matter and a course or foreplane the tool     of setting the iron when you set the iron of the foreplane consider the stuff you are to work upon viz whether it be hard or soft or curling as joyners call cross grained stuff if it be hard or curling you must not set the iron veay rank because a mans strength will not cut deep into hard wood and if it be not hard wood but curling or knotty and the iron rankset you may indeed work with it till you come to some knot or curl but then you may either tear your stuff or break the edge of your iron therefore you may perceive a reason to set the iron fine for curling and knotty stuff  but if you ask me how rank your iron ought to be set i answer if your wood be soft and your stuff free and frowy that is evenly tempered all the way you may set the iron to take a shaving off the thickness of an old coined shilling but scarce thicker whereas if your stuff be hard or curling or knotty you shall scarce be able to take a shaving off the thickness of an old groat therefore you must examine the temper of your stuff by easy trials how the plane will work upon it and set your iron accordingly and observe this as a general rule that the iron of the foreplane is for the first working with it to be set as rank as you can make good work with and that for speed sake  if your iron be set too rank knock with an hammer upon the britch of the stock and afterward upon the wedge for this knocking upon the britch if you knock hard enough twill raise the iron a little and set it fine if you knock not hard enough you must knock again till the iron do rise but if you knock too hard it will raise the iron so much that its edge will rise above the sole into the mouth of the stock and consequently not touch the stuff therefore you must knock softly at first till by trials you find the iron rises to a convenient fineness but as this knocking on the britch raises the iron so it also raises and loosens the wedge therefore as aforesaid whenever you knock upon the britch you must also knock upon the wedge to soften the iron again  if you have raised the edge of the iron too fine you must knock softly upon the head of the iron and then again upon the wdge and this you may sometimes do several times till you fit your iron to a convenient fineness  when you have occasion to take your iron out of the stock to rub it that is to whet it you may knock pretty smart blows upon the stock between the mouth and the foreend to loosen the wedge and consequently the iron  these ways of setting are used to all other planes as well as foreplanes  in the using of this and indeed all other planes you must begin at the hinder end of the stuff the grain of the wood lying along the length of the bch and plane forward till you come to the foreend unless the stuff proves crosgraind in any part of its length for then you must turn your stuff to plane it the contrary way so far as it runs crosgraind and in planeing you must at once lean pretty hard upon the plane and also thrust it very hard forwards not letting the plane totter to or from youward till you have made a stroke the whole length of the stuff and this sometimes if your stuff belong will require your making two or three steps forwards ever you come to the foreend of the stuff but if it do you must come back and begin again at the farther end by the side of the last pland stroke and so continue your several lays of planeing till the whole upside of the stuff be planed  and if the stuff be broad you are to plane upon and it warp a little with the gran or be any ways crooked in the breadth you must then turn the gran athwart the workbench and plane upon the crossgrain for if your work be hollow in the middle you must plane both the bearing sides thinner till they come to a try with the middle then turn the other side of your work and working still crossgrained work away the middle till it come try with the two sides  this way of crossgrained working is by workmen called traversing  thus have you in general the use of all the other planes but the use of those planes that are designed for other particular purposes i shall show as they come in order     of the joynter b   the joynter is made somewhat longer than the foreplane and has its sole perfectly straight from end to end its office is to follow the foreplane and to  an edge perfectly straight and not only an edge but also a board of any thickness especially when  is to be shot therefore the hand must be carried along the whole lenth with an  weight and so exactly  to the edges of the board  of the plane incline either inward or  that the whole breadth be  both isides supposing  sdes  will two edges of two boards when  actly flat and square upon one another that light will not be discerned betwixt them  is counted a piece of good workmanship  joyner to have the craft of bearing his  curiously even the whole length of a long  and yet it i but a slight to those practic  urd the hand to the joynter is also used to try tables with large or small or other such broad work and then joyners work as well upon the traverse with it as with the grain of the wood and also angularly or cornerwise that they may be the more assured of the flatness of their work  its iron must be set very fine so fine that when you wink with one eye and set that end the straight side of the iron is next to the other eye there appears a little above an hairs breadth of the edge above the superficies of the sole of the plane and the length of the edge must lie perfectly straight with the flat breadth of the sole of the plane for the iron being then well wedged up and you working with the plane thus set have the greater assurance that the iron cannot run too deep into the stuff and consequently you have the less danger that the joint is wrought out of straight     the use of the strikeblock the strikeblock marked b   is a plane shorter than the joynter having its sole made exactly flat and straight and is used for the shooting of a short joint because it is more handy than the long joynter it is also used for the framing and fitting the joints of miters and bevels but then it is used in a different manner from other planes for if the miter and bevel you are to fit be small you must hold it very steady in your left hand with the sole of it upwards and its foreend toward your right hand and you must hold your work in your right hand very steady then apply the sawn miter or sawn bevel at the end of your stuff to the foreend of the strikeblock and so thrust it hard and upright forwards till it pass over the edge of the iron so shall the edge of the iron with several of these thrusts continued cut or plane off your stuff the roughness that the teeth of your saw made but if your work be so big that you cannot well weild it in your right hand you must set the end of your work in the benchscrew and plane upon it with a smoothing plane     the use of the smoothingplane the smoothingplane marked b   must have its iron set very fine because its office is to smoothen the work from those irregularities the foreplane made     the use of the rabbetplane the rabbetplane marked b   is to cut part of the upper edge of a board or other stuff straight that is square down into the board that the edge of another board also cut down in the same manner may fit and join into the square of the first board thus cut away and when two boards are thus lapped on the edges over one another this lapping over is called rabbetting  the rabbetplane is also sometimes used to strike a facia in a piece of molding as shall be showed in its proper place  the sides of the iron are not enclosed in the stock of this plane as the foregoing planes are but the iron is full as broad as the stock is thick that the very angles of the edge of the iron may not be born off the stuff to hinder the straight and square cutting it down nor does it deliver its shaving at a mouth on the top of the stock as the other planes do but it has its mouth on the sides of the plane and delivers its shavings there its iron is commonly about an inch broad     the use of the plow the plow marked b   is a narrow rabbetplane with some additions to it viz two square staves marked aa yet some of them have the upper edges of them rounded off for the better compliance with the hand these staves are let stiff through two square mortesses in the stock marked bb they are about seven or eight inches long and stand straight and square on the farther side of the stock and these two staves have shoulders on the hither side of the stock reaching down to the wooden sole of the plane for there is also an iron sole belonging to the plow to the bottom of these two shoulders is rivitted with iron rivets a fence as workmen call it which comes close under the wooden sole and its depth reaches below the iron sole about half an inch because the iron of the plow is very narrow and the sides of it toward the bottom are not to be enclosed in the stock for the same reason that was given in the rabbetplane therefore upon the stock is let in and strongly nailed an iron plate of the thickness of the plowiron for wood of that breadth will not be strong enough to endure the force the lower end of the plowiron is put to this ironplate is almost of the same thickness that the breadth of a plowiron is joyners have several plows for several widths of grooves  the office of the plow is to plow a narrow square groove on the edge of a board which is thus performed the board is set an edge with one end in the benchscrew and its other edge upon a pin or pins put into a hole or holes in the leg or legs of the bench such an hole or holes as will most conveniently for height sit the breadth of the board then the fence of the plow is set to that distance off the ironplate of the plow that you intend the groove shall lie off the edge of the board as if you would have the groove lie half an inch off the board then the two staves must with the mallet be knocked through the mortesses in the stock till the fence stands half an inch off the ironplate and if the staves are fitted stiff enough in the mortess of the stock it will keep at that distance whilst you plow the groove for the fence lying lower than the iron of the plane when you set the iron of the plow upon the edge of the board will lie flat against the farther edge of the board and so keep the iron of the plow all the length of the board at the same distance from the edge of the board that the iron of the plow has from the fence therefore your plow being thus fitted plow the groove as you work with other planes only as you laid hold on the stock of other planes when you use them now you must lay hold of the two staves and their shoulders and so thrust your plow forwards till your groove be made to your depth  if the staves go not stiff enough in the mortess of the stock you must stiffen them by knocking a little wooden wedge between the staves and their mortesses     of moldingplanes there are several other planes in use amongst joyners called moldingplanes as the round the hollow the ogee the snipesbill the rabbetplane the groovingplane etc and of these they have several sorts viz from half a quarter of an inch to an inch and a half they are used as other planes are in the planeing of stuff you must use planes whose irons have different mountings and that according to the hardness or softness of the wood you are to work upon for if the wood be hard the iron must stand more upright than it need do if the wood be soft for soft wood as deal pear tree maple etc the iron is set to make an angle of    degrees with the sole of the plane but if it be very hard wood you are to plane upon as box ebony lignum vitae etc it is set to  0 degrees and sometimes quite upright so that these hard woods are indeed more properly said to be scraped than planed  but before you come to use your planes you must know how to grind and whet them for they are not so fitted when they are bought but every workman accomodates them to this purpose as if it be an hard wood he is to work on he grinds his basil to a more obtuse angle than he would do for soft wood  the basil or angle an iron is ground to to work on soft wood is about    degrees and for hard wood about    or  0 degrees where note that the more acute or thinner the basil is the better and smoother the iron cuts and the more obtuse and thicker the stronger the edge is to work upon hard work    0 of grinding and whetting the iron and other edgetools when you grind your iron place your two thumbs under the iron and your fingers of both hands upon the iron and so clap down your iron to the stone holding it to that angle with the stone you intend the basil shall have keep the iron in this posture without either mounting or sinking its ends all the while the stone is turning about and when you lift the iron off the stone to see if it be ground to your mind if it be not you must be sure you place the iron again in the same position on the stone it had before for else you will make a double basil on your iron but if it be true set on the stone and steddily kept to that position your basil will be hollow and the smaller your grindstone is the hollower it will be you may know when it is well ground by the evenness and entireness of the edge all the way  having ground your iron you must smoothen the edge finer with a good whetstone thus hold the edge of your iron upward in your left hand and your hetstone in your ight and having first spit upon your stone to wet it apply it to the basil of your iron in such a position that it may bear upon the whole breadth of the basil and so working the stone over the basil you will quickly wear the courser grating of the grindstone off the edge on that side then turn the flat side of the iron and apply the stone flat to it till you have worn off the course gratings of the grindstone on that side too  joiners often grind their irons upon a flat grindstone also and then they hold the iron also in their hands in the same posture as if it were to be ground on the round grindstone yet then instead of keeping the iron on one place of the stone they thrust it hard straight forwards almost the length of the stone and draw it lightlier straight back again keeping it all the while at the same angle with the superficies of the stone and then smoothen its edge with the whetstone as if it had been ground upon the round grindstone and this they do so often till they have rubbed the hollowness of the basil to a flat and then they grind it again upon the round grindstone  this order and manner of setting grinding and smoothing a basil and edge is also used in all other edgetools joiners use    0 of chissels of several sorts and first of formers formers marked c   c   are of several sizes they are called formers because they are used before the paring chissel even as the fore plane is used before the smoothing plane the stuff you are to work upon being first scribed as i shall show in its proper place you must set the edge of the former a little without the scribed stroke with its basil outward that it may break and shoulder off the chips from your work as the edge cuts it and you must bea the helve of the former a little inwards over the stuff that the former do not at first cut straight down but a little outward for should you venture to cut straight down at the first you might with a negligent or unluckly knock with the mallet drive the edge of the former under the work and so cut before you are aware more off the under side than the upper side of your work and so perchance spoil it therefore you may make several cutting to cut it straight down by little and little  your work is made ready for the paring chisel when it is used the helve of it is kno upon with a mallet to drive the edge into  stuff      of the paringchissel the paringchissel marked c   must have  very fine and smooth edge its offic to follow the former and to pare off and smoothe the irregularities the former made  it is not knocked upon with the mallet but the blade is clasped upon the outside of the hidermost joints of the fore and little finger by the clutched inside of the middle and  fingers of the right hand and so its edge being set upon the scribed line and the top of the helve placed against the hollow of the inside of the right shoulder with pressing the shoulder hard upon the helve the edge cuts and pares away the irregularities  this way of handling may seem a preposterous posture to manage an iron tool in and yet the reason of the original contriver of this posture is to be approved for should workmen hold the blade of the paringchissel in their whole hand they must either hold their hand pretty near the helve where they cannot well manage the tool or they must hold it pretty near the edge where the outside of the fingers will hide the scribed line they are to pare in but this posture all workmen are at first taught and practice does so inure them to it that if they would they could not well leave it      of the skewformer the skewformer marked c   is seldom used by joiners but for cleansing acute angles with its acute angle on its edge where the angles of other chissels will not so well come      of the mortesschissel the mortess chissel marked c   is a narrow chissel but has its blade much thicker and consequently stronger that it may endure the heavier blows with the mallet than other chisels have so that in grinding it to an edge it is around to a very broad basil as you may see in the figure its office is to cut deep square holes called mortesses in a piece of wood joiners use them of several breadths according as the breadths of their mortesses may require      of the gouge the gouge marked c   is a chissel having a round edge for the cutting such wood as is to be rounded or hollowed  these several sorts of chissels joiners have of several sizes that they may be accommodated to do several sizes of work    mechanic exercises or the doctrine of handyworks continued in the art of joinery     of the square and its use the square marked d is two adjunct sides of a geometrical square a the handle b the tongue c the outer square d the inner square for joiners use it is made of two pieces of wood the one about an inch thick and the other about a quarter of an inch thick these two pieces are severally shot exactly straight and have each of their sides parallel to each of their own sides the thick piece called the handle has a mortess in it as long within a quarter of an inch as the thin piece called the tongue is broad and stiffly so wide as to contain the thickness of the tongue the tongue is fastened into the mortess of the handle with glue and wooden pins so as the two outer sides and then consequently the two inner sides may stand at right angles with one another  the reason why the handle is so much thicker than the tongue is because the handle should on either side become a fence to the tongue and the reason why the tongue has not its whole breadth let into the end of the handle is because they may with less care strike a line by the side of a thin than a thick piece for if instead of holding the hand upright when they strike a line they should hold it never so little inwards the shank of a pricker falling against the top edge of the handle would throw the point of a pricker farther out than a thin piece would to avoid which inconvenience the tongue is left about half an inch out of the end of the handle  another reason is that if with often striking the pricker against the tongue it becomes ragged or uneven they can with less trouble plane it again when the stuff is all the way of an equal strength than they can if cross grained shoulders be added to any part of it  its use is for the striking of lines square either to other lines or to straight sides and to try the squareness of their work by as if they would strike a line square to a side they have already shot they apply the inside of the handle close to the side shot and lay the tongue flat upon the work than by the outerside of the tongue they draw with a pricker a straight line this is called striking or drawing of a square or if they would try the squareness of a piece of stuff shot on two adjoining sides they apply the insides of the handle and tongue to the outsides of the stuff and if the outsides of the stuff do all the way agree in line with the insides of the square it is true square or if they would try the inward squareness of work they apply the two outsides of the square to the insides of the work      the manner of plaining and trying a piece of stuffsquare we will take for example a piece of stuff called a quarter which is commonly two inches thick four inches broad and seven foot long to plane this square lay one of its broad sides upon the bench with one of its ends should pretty hard into the teeth of the benchhook that it may lie the steddier then with the foreplane as you were taught   numb   plane off the roughness the saw made at the pit and work that side of the quarter as straight in its length and breadth as you can with the foreplane which you may give a pretty good guess at if the edge of the iron have born all the way upon the work yet you may try by taking up your work and applying one end of it to one eye whilst you wink with the other and observe if any hollow or dawks be in the length if not you may conclude it pretty true for the work thus held the eye will discern pretty nearly or for more certainty you may apply the edge of the twofoot rule or rather a rule shot the full length of the quarter to your work and if it agree all the way with the rule you may conclude it is straight in length but if you find it not straight you must still with the foreplane work off those risings that bear the edge of the rule off any part of the stuff then try if the breadth be pretty straight if it be the dawks the roughness the foreplane made excepted the  office of the foreplane is performed if it be not you must straighten the breadth as you  length   though this quarter be thus plained straight i length and breadth yet because the on of the foreplane for it fast working the stff is set rank and therefore makes great dawks in the stuff you must set the iron of your foreplane finer as you were taught   numb   and with it then work down even almost to the bottom of those dawks then try it again as before and if you find it try all the way you may with the jointer or smoothingplane but rather with the jointer go over it again to work out the irregularities of the fine fore plane for the iron of the foreplane being ground to a rising in the middle as has been showed   numb   though it be very fine set will yet leave some dawks in the stuff for the jointer or smoothingplane to work out thus the first side of the quarter will be finished  having thus tried one side of the quarter straight and flat apply the inside of the handle to it and if one of the adjoining sides of the quarter comply also with the inside of the tongue all the way you need only smooth that adjoining side but if it do not so comply that is if it be not square to the first side which you will know by the riding of the inside of the tongue upon one of the edges or some other part between the edges you must with the foreplane rankset plain away that stuff which bears off the inside of the tongue from complying all the way with it but if the risings be great you may for quickness hew away the risings with the hatchet but then you must have a care you let not the edge of your hatchet cut too deep into the stuff lest you either spoil your stuff by making it unsizeable if it be already small enough or if it have substance enough make your self more labor to get out those hatchetstroaks with the plane than you need then take off the roughness the hatchet made with the foreplane rankset then fine set and last of all with the jointer or smoothingplane so is the second side also finished  to work the third side set the oval of the gage exactly to that width from the gage that you intend the breadth of the quarter when wrought shall have which in this our example is four inches but will be somewhat less because working it true will diminish the stuff therefore sliding the oval on the staff measure on your inchrule so much less than four inches as you think your stuff diminishes in working measure i say between the oval and the tooth your size if at the first proffer your oval stand too far from the tooth hold the oval in your hand and knock the toothend of your staff upon the workbench till it stand near enough if the oval stand too near knock the other end of the staff upon the workbench till it be fit then apply the flat of the oval to the second wrought side of your stuff so as the tooth may reach athwart the breadth of the stuff upon the first side and keeping the oval close against the second side press the tooth so hard down that by drawing the gage in this posture all along the length of the quarter the tooth may strike a line in like manner upon the side opposite to the first viz the fourth side gage another line opposite to the first gaged line and work your stuff down to those two gaged lines on the third side either with plaining along or with hewing and afterward plaining as you were taught to work the second side  to work the fourth side set the tooth of the gage to its exact distance from the oval viz two inches wanting so much as you think the stuff diminished in working and apply the flat of the oval to each side of the first side and gage as before two lines one on the second the other on the third wrought side work your stuff then down on the fourth side to those two gage lines either with plaining alone or with hewing and afterward plaining as you were taught to work the second side      to frame two quarters square into one another you must take care in mortessing and tennanting that as near as you can equallize the strength of the sides of the mortess to the strength of the tenant i do not mean that the stuff should be of an equal substance for that is not equalling strength but the equalling strength must be considered with respect to the quality position and substance of the stuff as if you were to make a tennant upon a piece of fur and a mortess to recieve it in a piece of oak and the fur and oak have both the same size the tennant therefore made upon this piece of fur must be considerably bigger than a tennant need be made of oak because fur is much a weaker wood than oak and therefore ought to have greater substance to equallize the strength of oak and for position the shorter the stuff that the tennant is made on the less violence the tennant is subject to besides it is easier to split wood with the grain than to break wood cros the grain and therefore the same wood when posited as a tennant is stronger than the same wood of the same size when posited as a mortess for the injury a mortess is subject to is spliting with the grain of the wood which without good care it will often do in working but the force that must injure a tennant must offend it cross the grain of the wood in which position it will best endure violence  when two pieces of wood of the same quality and substance as in this our example are elected to make on the one a tennant and in the other a mortess if you make the mortess too wide the sides of the mortess will be weaker than the sides that contain the mortess and if one be weaker than the other the weakest will give way to the strongest when an equal violence is offered to both therefore you may see a necessity of equallizing the strength of one to the other as near as you can but because no rule is extant to do it by nor can for many considerations i think be made therefore this equallizing of strength must be referred to the judgment of the operator now to the work  the mortess to be made is in a quarter four inches broad in this case workmen make the mortess an inch wide so that an inch and an half stuff remains on either side it therefore your stuff being squared as was taught in the last section set the oval of the gage an inch and an half off the tooth and gage with it on either side your stuff a straight line at that distance from the end you intend the mortess shall be then open your compasses to two inches and prick off that distance in one of the lines for the length of the mortess then lay the inside of the handle of the square to one side of the stuff and upon both the pricks successively and with your pricker draw straight lines through them by the side of the tongue so shall the bounds of your mortess be struck out on the quarter if your mortess go through the quarter draw the same lines on the opposite side of the quarter thus turn the quarter or it edge and apply the inside of the handle of the square to the ends of the former drawn lines and by the side of the tongue draw two lines on the edge of the quarter then turn the quarter again with its other broad side upwards and apply the inside of the handle of the square to the ends of the last lines drawn on the edge and by the side of the tongue draw two lines on this broad side also these two lines if your quarter was truly squared shall be exactly opposite to the two lines drawn on the first broad side of the quarter for the length of the mortess and for the width of the mortess gage this side also as you did the first then for the tennant gage on that end of the quarter you intend the tennant shall be made the same lines you did for the mortess and because the quarter is two inches thick prick from the end two inches and applying the inside of the handle of the square to the side of the quarter and the tongue to that prick draw by the side of the tongue a line through that side the quarter then turn the other sides of the quarter successively and draw lines athwart each side the quarter as you were taught to draw the opposite lines for the mortress  then place the edge of the inchmortesschissel with its basil from you and the helve bearing a little toward you within one half quarter of an inch of one end of the struck mortess and with your mallet knock hard upon it till you find the basil of the chissel will no longer force the chips out of the mortess then remove the chissel to the other end of the mortess and work as with the first end till the chips will void no longer then work away the stuff between the two ends and begin again at one of the ends and then at the other and work deeper into the mortess then again between both and so work deeper by degrees till you have wrought the mortess through or if not through to the intended depth then with the mortesschissel work nearer the drawn lines at the ends of the mortess for before you were directed to work but within half a quarter of an inch of the drawn lines by laying light blows on it till you have made it fit to pare smooth with a narrow paringchissel and then pare the ends as you were taught to work with the paringchissel then with the broad paringchissel pare the sides of the mortess just to the struck lines so is the mortess finished  to work the tennant lay the other quarter on edge upon your workbench and fasten it with the holdfast as you were taught sect i then with the tennant saw a little without the struckline toward the end you must not saw just upon the struckline because the saw cuts rough besides you must leave some stuff to pare away smooth to the struckline that the style that is the upright quarter may make a close joint with the rail that is the lower quarter saw therefore right down with the tennantsaw just almost to the gaged lines for the thickness of the tennant and have a care to keep the blade of the saw exactly upright then turn the opposite side of the quarter upwards and work as you were taught to work the first side  then with the paringchissel pare the work close to the gaged lines for the tennant then try how it fits the mortess if it be not pared enough away you must pare it where it bears that is sticks but if you should chance to have made it too little you have spoiled your work therefore you may see how necessary it is not to make the mortess too wide at first or the tennant too narrow  then with the piercer pierce two holes through the sides or cheeks of the mortess about half an inch off either end one then knock the tennant stiff into the mortess and set it upright by applying the angle of the outer square to the angle the two quarters make and with your pricker prick round about the insides of the pierced holes upon the tennant then take the tennant out again and pierce two holes with the same bit about the thickness of a shilling above the pricked holes on the tennant that is nearer the sholder of the tennant that the pins you are to drive in may draw the sholder of the tennant the closer to the flat side of the quarter the mortess is made in then with the paringchissel make two pins somewhat tapering full big enough and setting the two quarters again square as before drive the pins stiff into the pierced holes  if you make another square as you did this and make also a tennant on each untennanted end of the styles and another mortess on the top and bottom rails you may put them together and make square frames of them      of the miter square and its use the miter square marked e has as the square an handle marked a one inch thick and three inches broad and a tongue marked b of about the same breadth the handle and the tongue as the square have both their sides parallel to their own sides the handle as the square has in the middle of its narrowest side a mortess in it of an equal depth the whole length of the handle into this mortess is fitted one end of the tongue but the end of the handle is first bereld off to make an angle of    degrees with its inside this tongue is as the square pined and glewed into the mortese of the handle  it is used for striking a miterline as the square is to strike a squareline by applying the inside of the handle to the outside of the quarter or batten you are to work upon and then by striking a line by the side of the tongue for that line shall be a miterline and if upon two battens you strike two such lines and saw and pare them just off in the lines when the flats of those two sawn ends are applied to one another the out and inside of the battens will form themselves into the figure of a square  thus picture frames and looking glassframes are commonly made as by a more full example you may see in the next section      of the bevil as the square is made to strike an angle of  0 degrees and the miter an angle of    degrees so the bevil marked f having its tongue movable upon a center may be set to strike angles of any greater or lesser numbers of degrees acording as you open the tongue wider from or shut it closer to the handle it is used as the square and the miter and will perform the offices of them both though it be not purposely made for either but for the striking such bevillines as one part of your work must be cut away to to make it join with another part of your work for example  we will propose to make a frame for a picture lookingglass etc containing eight straight sides you may quickly perceive that all the ends of these eight sides must be cut to bevils and what bevils they must be you will find if you describe upon a smooth flat board a circle of any bigness but the larger the better divide this circle into eight equal parts and from every point draw a line to the center draw also straight lines from every point to its next point then lay the inside of the handle of your bevil exactly upon any one of these straight lines so as the angle made by the inside of the handle and the inside of the tongue lie exactly at the very angle made by this straight line and the semidiametral line proceeding from the center and move the tongue nearer or farther off the handle till the inside of the tongue and the inside of the handle lie exactly upon those two lines so shall your bevil be set  then having sitted your pieces to your scantling stick your pricker as near the outward corner of your pieces as your stuff will bear and apply the inside of your handle also to the outer sides of your pieces and so as the inside of the tongue may be drawn home to the pricker for then lines drawn on those pieces by the inside of the tongue shall be the lines the pieces must be cut in to make these eight pieces join evenly together by the sides of each others bevil then with the strikeblock smooth the ends of the bevils as you were taught in the section of the strikeblock  if you have a board on the backside of this frame you may glue the backsides of these pieces piece by piece to the board but first you must fit them to an exact compliance of every bevil with its match and when they are so fitted drive two nails close to the outside of every piece but drive not the nails deep into the board because when the frame is set and glewed or otherwise fastened you must draw the nails out again for these nails are only intended to serve for fences to set and fit each piece into its proper place before the whole frame is fastened together and should you not thus fence them though by your eye you might judge you fitted the bevils exactly yet one piece being never so little out of its due position would drive the next piece more out and that the next till at the last the last piece would not join but either be too short or too long or stand too much out or in or else too open or too close on the out or inside  but if you have no board on the backside you must when you saw the bevilling angles upon the square ends of pieces not sawn quite through the depth of one end of every piece but about half way through the depth or thickness and then with your chissel either split or else pare the upper side of the square end flat away to the bevil and so leave part of the square end of your piece to lap under the piece it is joined to for example  in fig   plate   ab is the square end of the piece and bc is the bevil you work the piece to therefore you must work away so much of the thickness of the square end as is comprehended between a and c so that you will see the triangle abc is to be wrought away half way down the thickness of the stuff and so will the triangle abc be left for the other half thickness of the stuff but that end of the piece marked   which joins to the piece marked   must upon its bevilstroak be sawn quite off and its underside must have the same triangle wrought into it just so fit as to receive the triangle in piece   and just so deep as that when the triangle on piece   is fitted into the triangle in piece   the superficies of both the pieces may be even with one another and thus you may lap the ends of every piece into one another  these triangles at the ends of the pieces you may glue into one another but if you think glewing alone not strong enough you may pierce an hole near the inner edge of the frame because the triangle has there most substance of stuff and afterward pin it as you are taught to pin the rail and style together in sect     this way of lapping over is sometimes used also for square miters or other angular frames    0 of the miterbox there is another way used by joiners that make many frames to save themselves the labor of drawing or striking out of squares miters and several bevils upon their stuff and this is with a tool called a miterbox described in plate   fig   it is composed of two pieces of wood of an inch thick each as a the upright piece b the bottom piece the upright piece is nailed upright fast upon the bottom piece and this upright piece has on its upper side the miter lines struck with the miter square as de on the left hand and gh on the right hand on these two miter lines the edge of the saw is set and a kerf made straight down the upright piece as from de on the left hand to f and from gh on the right hand to i in like manner any other bevil is struck upon the upper side of the upright piece with the bevil as kl on the left hand and no on the right on these two bevil lines the edge of the saw is set and a kerf made straight down the upright piece as from k to lm and from gh to i you may make as many bevils as you please on the upright piece of the miter box bevils to join frames of either five six seven eight sides etc and the manner to make them to any number of sides was in part taught in the last section for as there you were directed to divide the circle into eight equal parts because eight was the number of sides we proposed to make that frame consist of so if for any number of sides you divide the circle into the same equal parts and work as you were there directed you may find what bevil the pieces must have that make a frame that consists of any number of sides  so also for sawing of any batten or other small pieces square strike at the point a on the upper side of the upright piece a line straight athwart it to b and saw straight down the upper piece to c  the manner how these kerfs are sawn straight down with greatest certainty is thus apply the inside of the handle of the square to the upper side of the upright piece so as the tongue lie close to that end of the miter bevil or square line struck through the upper side of the miterbox and with the pricker strike a line close by the side of the tongue through that side of the upright piece turn the tongue to the other side of the upright piece and apply the inside of the handle of the square to the other end of the miter bevil or square line and with the pricker strike also a line close by the side of the tongue through that side the upright piece these two lines struck on either side of the upright piece shall be a line on each side in which the edge of the saw must run to saw it straight down      of the gage the gage marked g in plate   the oval b is fitted stiff upon the staff c that it may be set nearer or farther from the tooth a its office is to gage a line parallel to any straight side it is used for gaging tennants and for gaging stuff to an equal thickness  when you use it you must set the oval to the intended distance from the tooth if the oval stand too near the tooth hold the oval in your right hand and knock the hinder end of the staff upon the workbench till it remove to its just distance from the tooth if it stand too far off the tooth knock the fore end of the staff  viz the tooth end till it remove to its just distance from the tooth if the oval slide not stiff enough upon the staff you may stiffen it by striking a wooden wedge between the mortess and the staff so may you apply the side of the oval next the tooth to the side of any table or any other straight side with the tooth gage a line parallel or of equal distance all the way from that side      of the piercer the piercer h in plate   has a the head b the pad c the stock d the bitt its office is so well known that i need say little to it only you must take care to keep the bitt straight to the hole you pierce lest you deform the hole or break the bitt  you ought to be provided with bitts of several sizes fitted into so many padds      of the gimblet the gimblet is marked i in plate   it has a worm at the end of its bitt its office is to make a round hole in those places of your work where the stock of the piercer by reason of its own sholder or a sholder or butting out upon the work will not turn about its handle is held in a clutched hand and its bitt twisted stiff into your work you must have them of several sizes      of the augre the augre marked k in plate   has aa the handle b the bitt its office is to make great round holes when you use it the stuff you work upon is commonly laid low under you that you may the easier use your strength upon it for in twisting the bitt about by the force of both your hands on each end of the handle one it cuts great chips out of the stuff you must bear your strength perpendicularly straight to the end of the bitt as with the piercer      of the hatchet the hatchet marked l in plate   its use is so well known even to the most unintelligent that i need not use many words on it yet thus much i will say its use is to hew the irregularities off such pieces of stuff which may be sooner hewn than sawn  when the edge is downwards and the handle toward you the right side of its edge must be ground to a bevil so as to make an angle of about    degrees with the left side of it and afterward set with the whetstone as the irons of planes etc      the use of the saw in general in my former exercises i did not teach you how to choose the tools a smith was to use because it is a smiths office to make them and because in those exercises i treated of making ironwork and steelwork in general and the making and excellency of some tools in particular which might serve as a general notion for the knowledge of all smiths workmanship especially to those that should concern themselves with smithing but to those that shall concern themselves with joinery and not with smithing it will be necessary that i teach them how to choose their tools that are made by smiths that they may use them with more ease and delight and make both quicker and nearer work with them  all sorts of saws for joiners use are to be sold in most ironmongers shops but especially in fosterlane london choose those that are made of steel for some are made of iron for steel of it self is harder and stronger than iron you may know the steel saws from iron saws thus the steel saws are generally ground bright and smooth and are the thickness of the blade considered stronger than iron saws but the iron saws are only hammerhardned and therefore if they could be so hard yet they cannot be so smooth as if the irregularities of the hammer were well taken off with the grindstone see it be free from flaws and very well hammered and smoothly ground that is evenly ground you may know if it be well hammered by the stiff bending of it and if it be well ground that is evenly ground it will not bend in one part of it more than in another for if it do it is a sign that part were it bends most is either too much ground away or too thin forged in that place but if it bend into a regular bow all the way and be stiff the blade is good it cannot be too stiff because they are but hammerhardned and therefore often bow when they fall under unskilful hands but never break unless they have been often bowed in that place the edge whereon the teeth are is always made thicker than the back because the back follows the edge and if the edge should not make a pretty wide kerf if the back do not strike in the kerf yet by never so little irregular bearing or twisting of the hand awry it might so stop as to bow the saw and as i said before with often bowing it will break at last when workmen light of a good blade thus qualified they matter not much whether the teeth be sharp or deep or set to their mind for to make them so is a task they take to themselves and thus they perform it they wedge the blade of the saw hard into the whettingblock marked p in plate   with the handle toward their left hand and the end of the saw to the right then with a threesquare file they begin at the left hand end leaning harder upon the side of the file on the right hand than on that side to the left hand so that they file the upperside of the tooth of the saw aslope toward the right hand and the underside of the tooth a little aslope toward the left or almost downright having filed one tooth thus all the rest must be so filed then with the sawwrest marked o in plate   they set the teeth of the saw that is they put one of the notches marked aaa of the wrest between the first two teeth on the blade of the saw and then turn the handle horizontally a little about upon the notch toward the end of the saw and that at once turns the first tooth somewhat toward you and the second tooth from you then skipping two teeth they again put one of the notches of the wrest between the third and fourth teeth on the blade of the saw and then as before turn the handle a little about upon the notch toward the end of the saw and that turns the third tooth somewhat toward you and the fourth somewhat from you thus you must skip two teeth at a time and turn the wrest till all the teeth of the saw are set this setting of the teeth of the saw as workmen call it is to make the kerf wide enough for the back to follow the edge and is set ranker for soft course cheap stuff than for hard fine and costly stuff for the ranker the tooth is set the more stuff is wasted in the kerf and besides if the stuff be hard it will require greater labor to tear away a great deal of hard stuff than it will do to tear away but a little of the same stuff  the pit saw is set so rank for course stuff as to make a kerf of almost a quarter of an inch but for fine and costly stuff they set it finer to save stuff the whipsaw is set somewhat finer than the pitsaw the handsaw and the compasssaw finer than the whipsaw but the tennantsaw framesaw and the bowsaw etc are set fine and have their teeth but very little turned over the sides of their blades so that a kerf made by them is seldom above half a half quarter of an inch  the reason why the teeth are filed to an angle pointing toward the end of the saw and not toward the handle of the saw or directly straight between the handle and end of the saw is because the saw is designed to cut only in its progress forwards man having in that activity more strength to rid and command of his hands to guide his work than he can have in drawing back his saw and therefore when he draws back his saw the workman bears it lightly off the unsawn stuff which is an ease to his labor and enables him the longer to continue his several progressions of the saw  masterworkmen when they direct any of their underlins to saw such a piece of stuff have several phrases for the sawing of it they seldom say saw that piece of stuff but draw the saw through it give that piece of stuff a kerf lay a kerf in that piece of stuff and sometimes but most unproperly cut or slit that piece of stuff for the saw cannot properly be said to cut or slit the stuff but it rather breaks or tears away such parts of the stuff from the whole as the points of the teeth prick into and these parts it so tears away are proportionable to the fineness or rankness of the setting of the teeth  the excellency of sawing is to keep the kerf exactly in the line marked out to be sawn without wriggling on either or both sides and straight through the stuff as workmen call it that is in a geometrical term perpendicular through the upper and under side if your work require it as most work does but if your work be to be sawn upon a bevil as some work sometimes is then you are to observe that bevil all the length of the stuff etc      the use of the pitsaw marked m in plate   the pitsaw is not only used by those workmen that make sawing timber and boards their whole business but is also for small matters used by joiners when what they have to do may perhaps be as soon done at home as they can carry or send it to the sawyers the manner of their working is both alike for if it be a board they would slit off a piece of timber or if they would take any square quarter or batten etc off they first set off their scantlin for example if it be an inch or more or less they would take off a piece of stuff they open the points of their compasses to an inch measure on their rule and so much more as they reckon the kerf of the saw will make and from on side of their stuff they set off at either end of the stuff the distance of the points of their compasses at this distance therefore they make with the points of their compasses a prick at either end of the stuff then with chalk they whiten a line by rubbing the chalk pretty hard upon it then one holds the line at one end upon the prick made there and the other strains the line pretty stiff upon the prick at the other end then whilst the line is thus strained one of them between his finger and thumb draws the middle of the line directly upright to a convenient height that it may spring hard enough down and then lets it go again so that it swiftly applies to its first position and strikes so strongly against the stuff that the dust or attoms of the chalk that were rubbed into the line shake out of it and remain upon the stuff and thus also they mark the under side of their stuff this is called lining of the stuff and the stuff cut into those lines shall be called inchstuff because the compasses that pricked the stuff were opened wider by the width of the kerf than an inch measure upon the rule but had the compasses been opened but an inch exactly that piece sawn off should in workmens language have been called inhprickt thereby giving to understand that it half the breadth of the kerf thinner than an inch and thus they call all other scantlins   inches   inches   inches etc sawn or pricked  when two workmen are not at hand to hold the line at both ends he that lines it strikes one point of his compass or sometimes a pricker or a nail aslope toward that end into the prick set off and putting the noose at the end of his line over his compasses etc goes to the other end and strains his line on that prick and strikes it as before  the stuff being thus lined is fastened with wedges over the pit if the joiner be accommodated with a pit if he have none he makes shift with two high frames a little more than man high in its stead called great trussels with four legs these legs stand spreading outward that they may stand the firmer over these two trussels the stuff is laid and firmly fastened that it shake not its outer side from whence the pricks were set off must be perpendiculer which you must try by a plumbline for should the top edge of that side hang never so little over the bottom edge or the bottom edge not lie so far out as the top edge the scantlin you saw off would not be of an equal thickness on the top or bottom because the saw is to work exactly perpendicular then with the pitsaw they enter the one end of the stuff the topman at the top and the pitman under him the topman observing to guide the saw exactly in the line and withal drawing the saw somewhat toward him when the saw goes down and the pitman drawing it with all his strength perpendicularly down but not so low that the upper and lower handles of the saw sink below both their managements then bearing the teeth of the saw a little off the stuff the topman draws the saw up again and the pitman assists or eases him in it and thus they continue sawing on till the saw has run through the whole length upon the stuff but when the kerf is made so long that by the working of the saw the pieces of stuff on either side will shake against one another and so more or less hinder the easy progress of the saw they drive a wedge so far in the kerf as they dare do for fear of splitting the stuff and so provide the saw freer and easier passage through the stuff this wedging they continue so often as they find occasion  mechanic exercises or the doctrine of handyworks continued in the art of joinery     the use of the whipsaw marked n in plate   the whipsaw is used by joiners to saw such greater pieces of stuff that the handsaw will not easily reach through when they use it the stuff is laid upon the trussel marked o in plate   in the angles of it then two men takes each an handle of the saw he to whom the teeth of the saw points drawing to him and the other thrusting from him and as before the saw having run its length is lifted gently over the stuff to recover another stroke of the saw      the use of the handsaw marked d the frame or bowsaw the tennantsaw marked o in plate   these saws are accommodated for a single mans use and cut forward as the other saws do the office of the checks made to the framesaw is by the twisted cord and tongue in the middle to draw the upper ends of the cheeks closer together that the lower end of the cheeks may be drawn the wider asunder and strain the blade of the saw the straighter the tennantsaw being thin has a back to keep it from bending    0 the use of the compasssaw marked q in plate   the compasssaw should not have its teeth set as other saws have but the edge of it should be made so broad and the back so thin that it may easily follow the broad edge without having its teeth set for if the teeth be set the blade must be thin or else the teeth will not bow over the blade and if it be thin considering the blade is so narrow it will not be strong enough to abide ough work but at never so little an irregular thrust will bow and at last break yet for cheapness they are many times made so thin that the teeth require a setting its office is to cut a round or any other compass kerf and therefore the edge must be made broad and the back thin that the back may have a wide kerf to turn in      of the rule marked d in plate   the use of the rule is to measure feet inches and parts of inches which for that purpose are marked upon the flat and smooth sides of the rule and numbered with inches and has every inch divided into two halfs and every half into two quarters and every quarter into two halfquarters so that every inch is divided into eight equal parts and these inches are numbered from one end of the rule to the other which commonly is in all    inches which is a twofoot rule  they have commonly both board and timbermeasure etc marked upon them for the finding both the superficial and solid content of board or timber the use of which lines and tables havin been often taught by others and being more mathematical than mechanical is unproper for me to meddle with in this place but rather to refer to those books  but the manual use of it is either to measure length with it or to draw a straight line by the side of it or to try the straightness or flatness of their work with they try their work by applying one of its edges to the flat of the wrought side of their work and bring their eye as close as they can to see if they can see light between the edge of the rule and their work if they cannot they conclude their work is try and well wrought      of the compasses marked e in plate   aa the joint bb the cheeks of the joint cc the shanks dd the points their office is to describe circles and set off distances from their rule or any other measure to their work      of the glewpot marked f in plate   the glewpot is commonly made of good thick lead that by its substance it may retain a heat the longer that the glue chill not as workmen say when it cools when it is to be used      of choosing and boiling glue the clearest driest and most transparent glue is the best when you boil it break it with your hammer into small pieces and put it into a clean skillet or pipkin by no means greasy for that will spoil the clamminess of the glue put to it so much water as is convenient to dissolve the glue and to make it when it is hot about the thickness of the white of an egg the quantity of water cannot be assigned because of the different quality there is in glue keep it stirring whilst it is melting and let it not stick to the sides or bottom of the vessel when it is well boiled pour it into your glewpot to use but let your glewpot be very clean when it is cold and you would heat it again in your glewpot you must take great care that it burn not to the sides or bottom of the glewpot for that burning either turns to a thick hard skin or else to a burnt cinderlike substance which if it mingle with the glue will spoil it all because by its substance it will bear the two joints you are to glue together off each other  when with often heating the glue grows too thick you may put more water to it but then you must make it very hot lest the glue and water do not wholly incorporate  some joiners will when their glue is too thick put smallbeer into it thinking it strengthens it i have tried it and could never find it so but think it makes the glue weaker especially if the smallbear chance to be new and its yest not well settled from it or so stale that it be either draggy or any whit mingled with the settlings of the cask      of using the glue your glue must be very warm for then it is thinnest and as it chills it thickens with a small brush you must smear the glue well upon the joint of each piece you are to glue together and before you set them as they are to stand you must jostle them one upon the other that the glue may very well touch and take hold of the wood and that the glue on each joints may well incorporate then fit the two joints as they must stand and when you set them by to dry let the one stand upright upon the other for if they stand aslope the weight of the stuff when it leans upon two extreme edges may make one end of the joint open      of the waving engine the waving engine discribed in plate   fig   has a b a long square plank of about seven inches broad five foot long and an inch and half thick all along the length of this plank on the middle between the two sides runs a rabbet as part of it is seen at c upon this rabbet rides a block with a groove in its under side this block is about three inches square and ten inches long having near the hinder end of it a wooden handle going through it of about one inch diameter as de at the foreend of this block is fastened a vice somewhat larger than a great handvice as at f the groove in the block is made fit to receive the rabbet on the plank  at the farther end of the plank is erected a square strong piece of wood about six inches high and five inches square as g this square piece has a square wide mortess in it on the top as at h upon the top of this square piece is a strong square flat iron collar somewhat loosly fitted on having two male screws fitted into two female screws to screw against that part of the wooden piece unmortessed at the top marked l that it may draw the iron collar hard against the iron marked q and keep it stiff against the foreside of the unmortessed piece marked l when the piece q is set to its convenient height and on the other side the square wooden piece is fitted another iron screw having to the end of its shank fastened a round iron plate which lies within the hollow of this wooden piece and therefore cannot in draft be seen in its proper place but i have described it a part as at m fig   its nut is placed at m on the wooden piece on the farther side of the wooden piece is fitted a wooden screw called a knob as at n through the farther and hither side of the square wooden piece is fitted a flat piece of iron about three quarters of an inch broad and one quarter of an inch thick standing on edge upon the plank but its upper edge is filed round the reason you will find by and by its hither end comes through the wooden piece as at o and its farther end on the opposite side of the wooden piece  upright in the hollow square of the wooden piece stands an iron as at q whose lower end is cut into the form of the molding you intend your work shall have  in the fore side of this wooden piece is a square hole as at r called the mouth  to this engine belongs a thin flat piece of hard wood about an inch and a quarter broad and as long as the rabbet it is disjunct from the engine and in fig   is marked ss called the rack it has its under flat cut into those fashioned waves you intend your work shall have the hollow of these waves are made to comply with the round edge of flat plate of iron marked o described before for when one end of the riglet you wave is with the vice screwed to the plain side of the rack and the other end put through the mouth of the wooden piece as at tt so as the hollow of the wave on the under side of the rack may lie upon the round edge of the flat iron plate set on edge as at o and the iron q is strong sitted down upon the reglet then if you lay hold of the handles of the block de and strongly draw by them the rack and the riglet will both together slide through the mouth of the wooden piece and as the rounds of the rack rid over the round edge of the flat iron the rack and reglet will mount up to the iron q and as the rounds of the waves on the under side of the rack slides off the iron on edge the rack and reglet will sink and so in a progression or more the riglet will on its upper side receive the form of the several waves on the under side of the rack and also the form or molding that is on the edge of the bottom of the iron and so at once the riglet will be both molded and waved  but before you draw the rack through the engine you must consider the office of the knob n and the office of the iron screw m for by them the rack is screwed evenly under the iron q and you must be careful that the groove of the block slip not off the rabbet on the plank for by these screws and the rabbet and groove your work will be evenly gaged all the way as i said before under the

of the margent of the style viz one breadth above the surbase and the other below the surbase and the upper and lower rails have also each the same breadth with the margent of the style  those moldings above the pricked line on the top as h are called the cornice  sometimes and especially in low rooms there is no base or surbase used and then the middle and lower rail need not be so broad for the middle rail need not be above a third part more than the margent of the rail and the lower rail you may make of what breadth you see convenient they are commonly about three inches and an half or four inches broad yet this is no rule for sometimes workmen make only a flat plinth serve  you may if you will adorn the outer edges of the styles and rails with a small molding and you may if you will bevil away the outer edges of the pannels and leave a table in the middle of the panel  an explanation of terms used among joiners when i first began to print these exercises i marked some terms in joinery with superior letters as printers call them thus abc etc intending at the latter end of these exercises to have explained the terms those letters referred to but upon consideration that those terms might often be used in this discourse when the superior letter was out of sight and perhaps its position where forgotten i have changed my mind and left out the superior letters beyond fol

come to exercise upon the carpenters trade it may be expected by some that i should insist upon architecture it being so absolutely necessary for builders to be acquainted with but my answer to them is that there are so many books of architecture extant and in them the rules so well so copiously and so completely handled that it is needless for me to say any thing of that science nor do i think any man that should can do more than collect out of their books and perhaps deliver their meanings in his own words besides architecture is a mathematical science and therefore different from my present undertakings which are as by my title mechanic exercises yet because books of architecture are as necessary for a builder to understand as the use of tools and lest some builders should not know how to enquire for them i shall at the latter end of carpentry give you the names of some authors especially such as are printed in the english tongue  some may perhaps also think it had been more proper for me in these exercises to have introduced carpentry before joinery because necessity the mother of invention did doubtless compel our forefathers in the beginning to use the convenience of the first rather than the extravagancy of the last i confess i considered it my self and had in my own reason been persuaded to it but that i also considered that the rules they both work by are upon the matter in the same in sawing mortessing tenanting scribing paring plaining moulding etc and likewise the tools they work with the same though some of them somewhat stronger for carpenters use than they need be for joiners because joiners work more curiously and observe the rules more exactly than carpenters need do and therefore i say it was that i began with joinery before carpentry for he that knows how to work curiously may when he lists work slightly when as they that are taught to work more roughly do with greater difficulty perform the curious and nice work thus we see joiners work their tables exactly flat and smooth and shoot their joint so true that the whole table shows all one piece but the floors carpenters lay are also by rule of carpentry to be laid flat and true and shall yet be well enough laid though not so exactly flat and smooth as a table  yet though the rules joiners and carpenters work by are so near the same and the tools they work with and stuff they work upon the same yet there are many requisites proper to a carpenter especially a master carpenter that a joiner need take little notice of which after i have described the carpenters tools that are not expressed among the joiners i shall speak to    of several tools used in carpentry that are not used in joinery and first of the ax the ax marked a in plate   is as you see different from what the joiners hatchet is both in size and form theirs being a light hatchet with a basil edge on its left side because it is to be used with one hand and therefore has a short handle but the carpenters ax being to hew great stuff is made much deeper and heavier and its edge tapering into the middle of its blade it has a long handle because it is used with both their hands to square or bevil their timbers  when they use the ax the timber has commonly some bauk or log laid under it near each end that the edge of the ax may be in less danger of striking into the ground when they hew near the bottom of the timber and they commonly stand on that side the timber they hew upon    of the adz and its use the adz marked b in plate   has its blade made thin and somewhat arching as the ax has its edge parallel to its handle so the adz has its edge athwart the handle and is ground to a basil on its inside to its outer edge wherefore when it is blunt they cannot well grind it unless they take its helve out of its eye  its general use is to take thin chips off timber or boards and to take off those irregularities that the ax by reason of its form cannot well come at and that a plane though rank set will not make riddance enough with  it is most used for the taking off the irregularities on the framed work of a floor when it is framed and pined together and laid on its place for that lying flat under them the edge of the ax being parallel to its handle as aforesaid cannot come at the irregularities to take them off but the adz having its edge athwart the handle will again upon some posts framed upright and range with other framed work close to it the edge of the ax cannot come at the irregularities for the reason aforesaid but the adz will and the like for the irregularities of framed work on a ceiling etc  when they work upon the framed work of a floor they take the end of the handle in both their hands placing themselves directly before the irregularity at a small distance stradling a little with both their legs to prevent danger from the edge of the adz and so by degrees hew off the irregularity but if they hew upon an upright they stand directly before it  they sometimes use the adz upon small thin stuff to make it thinner but this is many times when the ax or some other properer tool lies not at hand and then they lay their stuff upon the floor and hold one end of it down with the ball of the foot if the stuff be long enough if not with the ends of their toes and so hew it lightly away to their size form or both    of carpenters chissels in general though carpenters for their finer work use all the sorts of chissels described in the art of joinery yet are not those sorts of chissels strong enough for their rougher and more common work and therefore they also use a stronger sort of chissels and distinguish them by the name of socketchissels for whereas those chissels joiners use have their wooden heads made hollow to receive the iron sprig above the shoulder of the shank carpenters have their shank made with an hollow socket at its top to receive a strong wooden sprig made to fit into the socket with a square shoulder above it the thickness of the iron of the socket or somewhat more which makes it much more strong and able to endure the heavy blows of the mallet they lay upon the head of the chissel and the shanks and blades are made stronger for carpenters use than they are for joiners  of these socketchissels they have of the several sorts described in joinery though not all severally distinguished by their names for they call them halfinch threequarterinch chissels inch and half twoinch to threeinch chissels according to the breadth of the blade but their uses are the same mentioned in joinery though the manner of using them be somewhat different too for as i told you in joinery the joiners press the edge of the blade into the stuff with the strength of their shoulders but the carpenters with the force of the blows of the mallet and the joiners guide their chissels differently from what the carpenters do their socketchissels for the joiners hold the shank and blade of their chissels as i described in joinery sect    but the carpenters hold the shank of their chissels in their clutched left hand and beat upon the head with the mallet in the right see the figure of socketchissel in plate   c with its head a out of the socket    of the rippingchissel and its use the rippingchissel described in plate   d is a socketchissel and is about an inch broad and has a blunt edge its edge has not a basil as almost all other chissels have and therefore would more properly be called a wedge than a chissel but most commonly carpenters use an old cast off chissel for a rippingchissel  its office is not to cut wood as others do but to rip or tear two pieces of wood fastened together from one another by entering the blunt edge of it between the two pieces and then knocking hard with the mallet upon the head of the handle till you drive the thicker part of it between the two pieces and so force the power that holds them together be it nails or otherwise to let go their hold for its blunt edge should be made of steel and well tempered so that if you knock with strong blows of the mallet the chissels edge upon a nail though of some considerable substance it may cut or brake it short asunder if you cannot at once placing the rippingchissel part the two pieces you must use two rippingchissels placing the second at the remotest entrance in the breach and driving that home will both open the breach wider and loosen the first rippingchissel so that you may take it again and place it farther in the breach and so you must continue edging farther and farther till you have separated your intended pieces  it is sometimes used when carpenters have committed error in their work and must undo what they did to mend it but it is generally used in all alterations and old work    of the drawknife and its use the drawknife described plate   e is seldom used about housebuilding but for the making of some sorts of household stuff as the legs of crickets the rounds of ladders the rails to lay cheese or bacon on etc  when they use it they set one end of their work against their breast and the other end against their workbench or some hollow angle that may keep it from slipping and so pressing the work a little hard with their breast against the bench to keep it steady in its position they with the handles of the draw knife in both their hands enter the edge of the drawknife into the work and draw chips almost the length of their work and so smoothen it quickly    of hookpins and their use the hookpin is described plate   f a the pin b the hook c the head its office is to pin the frame of a floor or frame of a roof together whilst it is framing or whilst it is fitting into its position they have many of these hookpins to drive into the several angles of the frame these drive into the pinholes through the mortesses and tennants and being made taper do with a hammer striking on the bottom of it knock it out again or they most commonly strike under the hook and so knock it out then if the frame lie in its place they pin it up with wooden pins    of the level and its use the level described in plate   g aa the level b the plumbet c the plumbline dd the perpendicular marked from the top to the bottom of the board the level is from two to ten foot long that it may reach over a considerable length of the work if the plumbline hang just upon the perpendicular dd when the level is set flat down upon the work the work is level but if it hang on either side the perpendicular the floor or work must be raised on that side till the plumbline hang exactly upon the perpendicular    of the plumbline and its use the plumbline is described in plate   h a the linerowl b the line it is used to try the upright standing of posts or other work that is to stand perpendicular to the ground plot and then they draw off so much line as is necessary and fasten the rest of the line there upon the linerowl with a slipknot that no more line turn off they hold the end of the line between their finger and thumb half the diameter of the linerowl off one corner of the post or work and if the line and corner of the post be parallel to each other the post is upright but if the post be not parallel to the line but its bottom stands more than half the diameter of the linerowl from the line the post hangs so much over the bottom of the post on that side the line bears off and must be forced backwards till the side of the post and the line become parallel to each other but if the bottom of the corner of the post stands out from the top of the line the post must be forced forwards to comply with the line    of the hammer and its use the hammer is described in plate   i a the face b the claw cc the pen at the return sides of the claw this tool was forgot to be described in joinery though they use hammers too and therefore i bring it in here its chief use is for driving nails into work and drawing nails out of work  there is required a pretty skill in driving a nail for if when you set the point of a nail you be not curious in observing to strike the flat face of the hammer perpendicularly down upon the perpendicular of the shank the nail unless it have good entrance will start aside or bow or break and then you will be forced to draw it out again with the claw of the hammer therefore you may see a reason when you buy a hammer to choose one with a true flat face  a little trick is sometimes used among some that would be thought cunning carpenters privately to touch the head of the nail with a little earwax and then lay a wager with a stranger to the trick that he shall not drive that nail up to the head with so many blows the stranger thinks he shall assuredly win but does assuredly lose for the hammer no sooner touches the head of the nail but instead of entering the wood it flies away notwithstanding his utmost care in striking it downright   0 of the commander and its use the commander is described in plate   k it is indeed but a very great wooden mallet with an handle about three foot long to use in both the hands  it is used to knock on the corners of framed work to set them into their position it is also used to drive small wooden piles into the ground etc or where greater engines may be spared     of the crow and its use the crow is described in plate   l a the shank bb the claws c the pikeend it is used as a lever to lift up the ends of great heavy timber when either a bauk or a rowler is to be laid under it and then they thrust the claws between the ground and the timber and laying a bauk or some such stuff behind the crow they draw the other end of the shank backwards and so raise the timber     of the drug and its use the drug described in plate   a is made somewhat like a low narrow carr it is used for the carriage of timber and then is drawn by the handle aa by two or more men according as the weight of the timber may require  there are also some engines used in carpentry for the management of their heavy timber and hard labor viz the jack the crab to which belongs pullies and tackle etc wedges rowlers great screws etc but i shall give you an account of them when i come to the explanation of terms at the latter end of carpentry     of the tenfoot rod and thereby to measure and describe the groundplot we shall begin therefore to measure the groundplot to which carpenters use a tenfoot rod for expedition which is a rod about an inch square and ten foot long being divided into ten equal parts each part containing one foot and is divided into    equal parts and their subdivisions  with this rod they measure the length and breadth of the groundplot into feet and if there be odd inches they measure them with the twofoot rule their measure they note down upon a piece of paper and having considered the situation of the sides east west north and south they draw on paper their several sides accordingly by a small scale either elected or else made for that purpose they may elect their twofoot rule for some plots for an inch and an half may commodiously serve to set off one foot on some small groundplots and then you have the inches to that foot actually divided by the marks for the half quarters on the twofoot rule but this large scale will scare serve to describe a groundplot above ten foot in length because a small sheet of paper is not above    or    inches long and therefore one sheet of paper will not contain it if the groundplot be longer therefore if you make every half quarter of an inch to be a scale for two inches a sheet of paper will contain  0 foot in length and if you make every half quarter of an inch to be a scale for four inches a sheet of paper will contain  0 foot and thus by diminishing the scale the sheet of paper will contain a greater number of feet  but having either elected or else made your scale you are to open your compasses to the number of feet on your scale your groundplot has in length and then transfer that distance to your paper and to draw a straight line between the two points and mark that straight line with east west north or south according to the situation of that side of the groundplot it represents then again open your compasses to the number of feet on your scale one of the adjoining sides contains and transfer that distance also to your paper and draw a line between the two points and note its situation of east west north or south as before do the like by the other sides and if either a quirk or any addition be added to the building on any side of your groundplot you must describe it also proportionably  then you are to consider what apartments or partitions to make on your groundplot or second or third story and to set them off from your scale beginning at your intended front as for example suppose your groundplot be a longsquare  0 foot in length and  0 foot wide this groundplot will contain in its length two good rooms and a yard behind it  0 foot long if you will you may divide the  0 foot into two equal parts so will each room be  0 foot square or you may make the rooms next the front deeper or shallower and leave the remainder for the backroom as here the frontroom is    foot and the backroom    foot deep and a setting off of   foot broad and  0 foot long taking out of the yard for a buttery below stairs if you will and closets above stairs over it but what width and depth soever you intend your rooms shall have you must open your compasses to that number of feet on your scale and set off that distance on the east west north or south line according to the situation of that side it represents on your groundplot if you set it off the east line you must also set it off on the west if on the north line you must also set it off on the south line because between the two settings off on the east and west lines or north or south lines you must draw a straight line of the length of your intended partition and in this manner you must from every partition draw a line in its proper place on the paper by measuring the distances each partition must have from the outside of the groundplot  and thus you are also to describe by your scale your front and several sides of the carcass allowing the principal posts enterduces quarterings braces gables doors windows and ornaments their several sizes and true positions by the scale each side upon a paper by it self unless we shall suppose our masterworkman to understand perspective for then he may on a singgle piece of paper describe the whole building as it shall appear to the eye at any assigned station     of foundations having drawn the draft the masterworkman is first to cause the cellars to be dug if the house shall have cellars and then to try the ground that it be all over of an equal firmness that when the weight of the building is set upon it it may not sink in any part but if the ground be hollow or weaker in any place he strengthens it sometimes by well ramming it down and levelling it again with good dry earth limecore rubbish etc or sometimes with ramming in stones or sometimes with well planking it or most securely by driving in piles but driving in of piles is seldom used for timber houses but for stone or brick houses and that but in few places of england neither but where the ground proves fenny or moorish therefore a farther account shall be given of foundations when i come to exercise upon masonry etc  then are the cellerwalls to be brought up by a bricklayer with brick for small houses two bricks thick for bigger two and an half bricks thick or three or four bricks thick according to the bigness of the house and quality of the ground as i shall show when i come to exercise on bricklaying  but if the house be designed to have no cellars as many countryhouses have not yet for the better securing the foundation and preserving the timber from rotting masterworkmen will cause three or four or five course of bricks to be laid to lay their groundplates upon that foundation  the foundation being made good the masterworkman appoints his underworkmen their several scantlins for groundplates principal post posts bressummers girders trimmers joysts etc which they cut square and frame their timbers to as has been taught in the several exercises upon joinery whither i refer you and there set them up each in its proper place according to the draft  the draft of a foundation i have described in plate  0 according to a scale of eight foot in an inch where you have the front ab  0 foot long the sides ac and bd  0 foot long

backroom ff    foot deep a buttry or closet taken out of the yard marked g  0 foot deep and   foot wide h a setting off in the yard   foot square for the house of office i leaving way in the shop for a staircase   foot and    foot k the yard l the sinkhole   foot square m leaving way in the kitching   foot deep and   foot wide for the chimneys  i do not deliver this draft of partitions for the most commodious for this groundplot nor is the house set out designed for any particular inhabitant which is one main purpose to be considered of the masterworkman before he make his draft for a gentlemans house must not be divided as a shopkeepers nor all shopkeepers house alike for some trades require a deeper others may dispense with a shallower shop and so an inconvenience may arise in both for if the shop be shallow the front rooms upwards ought to be shallow also because by the strict rules of architecture all partitions of rooms ought to stand directly over one another for if your shop stands in an eminent street the front rooms are commonly more airy than the back rooms and always more commodious for observing public pssages in the street and i that respect it will be inconvenient to make the front rooms shallow but if you have a fair prospect backwards of gardens feilds etc which seldom happens in cities then it may be convenient to make your backrooms the larger for entertainment etc bu i shall run no farther into this argument for i shall leave the masterworkman to consult books of architecture and more particularly the builder which in this case they ought all to do      mechanic exercises or the doctrine of handyworks continued in the art of housecarpentry ac bd cd no groundplates wallplates bresummers lintels the thickness of the wall ab also a

they are to be framed into one another with tennants and mortesses the longer groundplates an and bo are commonly tennanted into the front and rear groundplates ab and no and into these two sidegroundplates are mortesses made for the tennants at the ends of the joysts to be fitted somewhat loosly in at about ten inches distance from one another as in the draft these groundplates are to be bord with an inch and half augre and well pinned into one another with round oaken pins made tapering toward the point and so strong that with the hard blows of a mallet they may drive stiff into the augrehole and keep the tennant firmly in the mortess the manner of making a tennant and mortess is taught in joinery p    but because the stuff carpenters work upon is generally heavy timber and consequently not so easily managed as the light stuff joiners work upon therefore they do not atfirst pin the tennants into their mortesses with wooden pins lest they should lie out of square or any other intended position but laying a block or some other piece of timber under the corner of the framework to bear it hollow off the foundation or what ever else it lies upon they drive hookpins described in plate     into the four augreholes in the corners of the groundplates and one by one sit the plates either to a square or any other intended position and when it is so fitted they draw out their hookpins and drive in the wooden pins as aforesaid and taking away the wooden blocks one by one from under the corners of the frame they let it fall into its place  but before they pin up

marked cc for else you cannot get their tennants into their respective mortessholes but they do i say fit all these in while the frame of groundplates lies loose and may corner by corner be opened to let the respective tennants into their respective mortesses which when all is done they frame the raisingplates just as the groundplates are framed and then frame the roof into the raisingplates with beams joysts etc  the summer is in this groundplate placed at    foot distance from the front and is to be of the same scantlin the principal plates are of for reasons as shall be shown hereafter and the girders are also to be of the same scantlins the summers and groundplates are of though according to the nice rules of architecture the backgirder need not be so strong as the frontgirder because it bears but at    foot length and the frontgirder bears at    foot length yet carpenters for uniformity generally make them so unless they build an house by the great and are agreed for the sum of money etc  the joysts bearing at   foot as here they do are to be   inches deep and   inches broad  the trimmers and trimming joysts are   inches broad and   inches deep and these joysts trimmers and trimming joysts are all to be pinned into their respective mortesses and then its flatness tried with the level as was taught       of setting up the carcass though the groundplates girders etc be part of the carcass yet i thought sit in the last section they should be lid before i treated of the superstructure which i shall now handle the four corner posts called the principal posts marked aa should be each of one piece so long as to reach up to the beam of the roof or raisingplate and of the same scantlin the groundplates are of viz   inches rod and   inches thick and set with one of its narrowest sides toward the front its lower end is to be tennanted and let into a mortes made near the corner of the groundplate frame and its upper end has also a tennant on it to sit into a mortess made in the beam of the roof or rasingpiece  at the height of the first story in this principal post must be made two mortesses one to receive the tennant at the end of the bressummer that lies in the front and the other to entertain the tennant at the end of the bressmmer that lies in the returnside  two such mrtesses must also be made in this principal ost at the height of the second story to receive the tennant at the ends of the bressummers for that story  though i have spoken singularly of one principal post yet as you work this you must work all four principal posts and then set them plumb upright which you must try with a plumbline described in plate      having erected the principal posts upright you must enter the tennants of the bressummers into their proper mortesses and with a nail or two about a single ten or a double ten tack one end of a deal board or some other like piece of stuff to the bressummer and the other end to the framed work of the floor to keep the principal posts upright and in their places then set up the several posts between the principal posts but these posts must be tennanted at each end because they are to be no longer than to reach from story to story or from entertise to entertise and are to be framed into the upper and under bressummer if the entertises be not long enough they set up a principal post between two or three lengths to reach from the groundplate up to the raisingplates  it is to be remembered that the bressummers and girders are laid flat upon one o their broadest sides with their two narrowes sides perpendicular to the groundplot but the joysts are to be laid contrary for they are framed so as to lie with one of their narrowest sides upwards with their two broadest sides perpendicular to the groundplot the reason is because the stuff of the bressummers and girders are less weakened by cutting the mortesses in them in this position than in the other position for as the tennants for those mortesses are cut between the top and bottom sides and the flat of the tennants are no broader than the flat of the narrowest side of the joysts so the mortesses they are to fit into need be no broader than the breadth of the tennant and the tennants are not to be above an inch thick and consequently the mortesses are to be made with an inch mortesschissel as was shown in joinery p    for great care must be taken that the bressummers and girders be not weakened more than needs lest the whole floor dance  these tennants are cut through the two narrowest sides rather than between the two broadest sides because the stuff of the girders retains more strength when least of the grain of the stuff is cut and the tennants being made between the narrowest sides of the joyces requires their mortessholes no longer than the breadth of that tennant and that tennant being but an inch thick requires its mortess but an inch wide to receive it so that you mortess into the girder no more than three inches wide with the grain of the stuff and one inch broad contrary to the grain of the stuff but should the tennant be cut between the two broad sides of the joysts the mortess would be three inches long and but one inch broad and consequently you must cut into the girder three inches cross the grain of the stuff which would weaken it more than  inches with the grain and one inch   but it may be objected that the tennants of the joysts being so small and bearing at an inch thickness must needs be too weak  answer first though the tennants be indeed but an inch thick and three inches broad yet the whole bearing of the joyces do not solely depend upon their tennants because the girders they are framed into prove commonly somewhat wainny upon their upper sides and the joysts are always scribed to project over that waynniness and so strengthen their bearing by so much as they project over the roundness or waynniness of the upper side of the girder  secondly the floor is boarded with the length of the boards athwart the joysts and these boards firmly railed down to the joysts which also adds a great strength to them  thirdly the joysts are seldom made to bear at above ten foot in length and should by the rule of good workmanship not lie above ten inches asunder at the most so that this short bearing and close discharging of one another renders the whole floor firm enough for all common occupation but if the joyces do bear at above ten foot in length it ought to be the care of the masterworkman to provide stronger stuff for them viz thicker and broader if not they cut a tusk on the upper side of the tennant and let that tusk into the upper side of the girders  having erected the principal post and other posts and fitted in the bressummers girders joysts etc upon the first floor they pin up all the frame of carcasswork but though the girders and joysts described for this first floor lie proper enough for it yet for the second story and in this particular case the joysts lie not proper for the second story because in the second story we have described a balcony  therefore in this case you must frame the frontbressummer about seven inches lower into the principal posts because the joysts for the second floor are not to be mortessed into the bressummer to lie even at the top with it but must lie upon the bressummer and project over it so far as you design the balcony to project beyond the upright of the front and thus laying the joysts upon the bressummer renders them much stronger to bear the balcony than if joysts were tennanted into the front of the bressummer and so project out into the street from it  but the truth is though i have given you a draft of the joysts lying athwart the front and rear for the first floor you may as well lay them range with the two sides on the first floor but then the bressummer that reaches from front to rear in the middle of the floor must be stronger and girders must then be tennanted into the bressummer and the groundplates at such a distance that the joysts may not bear at above ten foot in length and the tennants of the joysts must be tennanted into the girders so that they will then lie range with the two sides  but a word more of the bressummer i say as before the bressummer to bear at so great length must be stronger though it should be discharged at the length of the shop  viz at    foot with a brick wall or a foundation brought up of brick but if it should have no discharge of brickwork but bear at the whole  0 foot in length your bressummer must be yet considerably stronger than it need be were it to bear but    foot in length because the shorter all the bearings of timbers are the firmer they bear but then the fraiming work will take up mre labor and in many cases it is cheaper to put in stronger stuff for long bearings than to put a girder between to discharge the length of the joysts to be framed into the girders  but to make short of this argument i shall give you the scheme of scantlins of timber at several bearings for summers girders joysts rafters etc as they are set down in the act of parlia for the rebuilding the city of london after the late dreadful fire which

trimmer at six inches distance from the back  that no timber be laid within the tunnel of any chimney upon penalty to the workman for every default ten shillings and ten shillings every week it continues un reformed  that no joysts or rafters be laid at greater distances from one to the other than twelve inches and no quarters at greater distance than fourteen inches  that no joysts bear at

of these exercises on carpentry referred unto by letters and arithmetical figures in the plate aforesaid  but now we will suppose the carcass is thus finished the bricklayer is then to bring up the chimnies and afterward to tile the house and then the next work the carpenter has to do is to bring up the stairs and staircases and afterward to floor the rooms and hang the doors etc for should he either bring up the stairs and staircases or floor the rooms before the house is tiled or otherwise covered if wet weather should happen it might injure the stairs flooring etc  a the groundplate or

the headsell groundsell and transum run though the outer jaums about four inches beyond them and so they are set in a lay of mortar upon the brickwall before the peers on either side is brought up at about three inches within the front so that the brickwork over the head and about the jaums defend it from the weather then the bricklayer brings up the peers on both sides so that the four ends or tennants that project through the outer jaums being buried and trimmed into the brickwork become a fastening to the windowframe  but if the windowframe stands on a timberhouse the head and groundsell are sometimes tennanted into posts of the carcass and then the posts do the office of the outer jaums of the windowframe and the head and groundsell are then called entertises and therefore both head and groundsell and posts or jaums are rabbetted about half an inch on the outside of the front to receive the pane of glass that is fitted to it and thus as i said the posts become part of the windowframe  but the better way is to frame a window as the brickwork window and to project it an inch and a half beyond the side of the building and to plaster against its sides for the better securing the rest of the carcass from the weather  the windowframe has every one of its lights rabbetted on its outside about half an inch into the frame and all these rabbets but that on the groundsell are grooved square but the rabbets on the groundsell is bevelld downwards that rain or snow etc may the freelier fall off it into these rabbets the several panes of glasswork is set and fastened by the glasier  the square corners of the frame next the glass is bevelld away both on the out and inside of the building that the light may the freelier play upon the glass and upon that bevel is commonly stuck a molding for ornament sake according to the fancy of the workman but more generally according to the various mode of the times     of stairs and staircases several writers of architecture have delivered different rules for the height and breadth of steps and that according to the several capacities of the staircases they forbid more than six and less than four inches for the height of each step and more than sixteen and less than twelve for the breadth of each step but here we must understand they mean these measures should be observed in large and sumptuous buildings but we have here proposed an ordinary private house which will admit of no such measures for want of room therefore to our present purpose  the first and second pair of stairs the steps shall be about   inches high and  0 inches broad the third pair of stairs each step may be about   inches high and   inches broad and for the fourth pair of stairs each step may be about   inches high and   inches broad but this rule they do or should follow viz to make all the steps belonging to the same pair of stairs of an equal height which to do they first consider the height of the room in feet and odd inches if any odd be and multiply the feet by    whose product with the number of odd inches gives the sum of the whole height in inches which sum they divide by the number of steps they intend to have in that height and the quotient shall be the number of inches and parts that each step shall be high or if they first design the height of each step in inches they try by arithmetic how many times the height of a step they can have out of the whole height of the story and so know the number of steps    mechanic exercises or the doctrine of handyworks continued in the art of housecarpentry stairs are either made about a solid newel or an open newel and sometimes mixed viz with a solid newel for some few steps then a straight or foreright ascent with flyers upon the side of the square open newel and afterward a solid newel again than reiterate etc  the last viz the mixed neweld stairs are commonly made in our partywalled houses in london where no light can be placed in the staircase because of the partywalls so that there is a necessity to let in a skylight through the hollow newel but this sort of staircases take up more room than those with a single solid newel because the stairs of a solid newel spread only upon one small newel as the several foulds of the fans woman use spread about their center but these because they sometimes wind and sometimes fly off from that winding take therefore the more room up in the staircase  the manner of projecting them is copiously taught in many books of architecture whether i referr you yet not to leave you wholly in the dark i shall give you a small light into it and first of the solid nowel  winding stairs are projected on a round profile whose diameter is equal to the base the staircase is to stand on suppose six foot square this profile has its circumference divided into    equal parts the semidiameter of the profile is divided into four equal parts and one of them used for the newel and the rest for the length of the steps if you draw lines from the center through every one of the equal parts into the circumference the space between every two lines will be the true figure of a windingstep and if they were all cut out and placed one above another over the true place on the profile round about the newel whose diameter is one quarter the length of a step you would by supporting each step with a raiser have the modle of a true pair of windingstairs see plate  0 fig    hollow neweld stairs are made about a square hollow newel we will suppose the wellhole to be eleven foot long and six foot wide and we would bring up a pair of stairs from the first floor eleven foot high it being intended that a skielight shall fall through the hollow newel upon the stairs we must therefore consider the width and breadth of the hollow newel and in this example admit it to be two foot and a half wide and two foot broad by the width i mean the sides that range with the front and rear of the building and by the breadth i mean the sides that range with the partywalls  i find by the rule aforesaid that if i assign    steps up each step will be seven inches and one third of an inch high  you must note that the flying off or else winding of these steps will vary their places according as you design the first ascent for if you make the first ascent as you come straight out of the street as in plate  0 on the south side you will first ascend upon a pitch of flyers which pitch making an angle of    degrees with the floor with ten steps raise you six foot high above the floor and bring you eight foot toward the northend of the wellhole by making each step ten inches broad  but now you must leave flyers and make four winding steps these winding steps are made about a solid newel as has been taught and this newel serves also for a post to trim the staircase too this post stands upon the floor and is prolonged upwards so high that mortesses made in it may receive the tennants of the top and bottom rails of the whole staircase for that floor these four winding steps aforesaid rounding one quarter about the newel turns your face in your ascent now toward the east these four steps are raised   foot   inches above the flyers so that in all your stairs are now raised   foot   inches here remains now only   foot   inches to the landing place and these take up just four flyers which must be made as was taught before  but now in your second pair of stairs it will be proper to begin your ascent with your face toward the west for landing by the first pair of stairs with your face toward the east you turn by the side of the rail on the second floor from the east toward the north and at the further end of that rail you turn your face again from the north toward the west and begin your ascent on the second pair of stairs  between the skielight and the ascent is a post set upright to fasten rails into to bound the staircase from the bottom of which viz on the second floor you trim up three flyers and then turn off a quarter of a circle with winding steps then again flyers to your designed pitch and then again another quarter of a circle with winding steps etc  the rail these steps are built upon being at the beginning or bottom of the ascent framed or otherwise fastened to the first upright post must at its higher end be framed into the next post also with a bevel tennant as you were taught to frame quarters into one another numb      only with this difference that there you were taught to frame square but here you must frame upon the bevel as you were taught numb      this post aforesaid bears upon the floor to make its bearing the stronger and this post must be continued to such an height as it may also serve to receive the tennanted end of an upper and lower rail framed into it and between these bevelling rails bannisters make good the outside of the staircase  though i have here described this contrivance of a pair of stairs yet do i not deliver it as the best pattern for this building or for these sorts of stairs nor matters it to our purpose whether it be or no for as i told you before my undertaking is the doctrine of handyworks not architecture but it is architecture considers the best forming of all members in a building for the capacity of the groundplot and the convenience of the intended inhabitant but carpenters as carpenters only work by directions prescribed by the architect  these therefore are the common rules that these sorts of stairs and indeed all others with carving according to the profile or groundplot of the stairs are made by but those that will see many inventions may consult books of architecture etc     of flooring of rooms though carpenters never floor the rooms till the carcass is set up and also enclosed by the plaisterer lest weather should wrong the flooring yet they generally roughplane their boards for flooring before they begin any thing else about the building that they may set them by to season which thus they do they lean them one by one on end aslant with the edge of the board against a bauk somewhat above the height of half the length of the board and set another board in the same posture on the other side the bauk so that above the bauk they cross one another then on the first side they set another board in that posture and on the second side another till the whole number of boards are set an end being set in this posture there remains the thickness of a board between every board all the length but just where they cross one another for the air to pass through to dry and shrink them against they have occasion to use them but they set them under some covered shed that the rain or sun comes not at them for if the rain wet them instead of shrinking them it will smell them or if the sun shine fiercely upon them it will dry them so fast that the boards will tear or sh which is in vulgar english split or crack  they have another way to dry and season them by laying them flat upon three or four bauks each board about the breadth of a board asunder the whole length of the bauks then they lay another lay of boards athwart upon them each board also the breadth of a board asunder then another lay athwart the last till all are thus laid so that in this position they also lie hollow for the air to play between them  thus then the boards being roughplaind and seasoned they try one side flat as by numb      and both the edges straight as if they were to shoot a joint as by numb     and cut the boards to an exact length because if the boards are not long enough to reach athwart the whole room the ends may all lie in a straight line that the straight ends of other boards laid against them may make the truer joint and this they call a beaking joint but before they lay them upon the floor they try with the level described   the flatness of the whole frame of flooring again lest any part of it should be cast since it was first framed together and if any part of the floor lie too high they with the adz if the eminency be large take it off as was showed    or if it be small with the jackplain in numb     till it lie level with the rest of the floor but if any part of the floor prove hollow they lay a chip or some such thing upon that hollow place to bare up the board before they nail it down  all this being done they choose a board of the commonest thickness of the whole pile for the first board and lay it close again one side of the room athwart the joysts and so nail it firmly down with two brads into every joyst it crosses each brad about an inch or an inch and a half within the edge of the board  if they should lay more than an ordinary thick or thin board at the first they would have a greater number of boards to work to a level than they need because all the rest of the boards must be equalized in thickness to the first  then they lay a second board close to the first but before they nail it down they again try how its sides agrees with the side of the first and also how its thickness agrees with the first board if any part of its edge lie hollow off the edge of the first board they shoot off so much of the length of the board from that hollowness toward either end till it comply and make a close joint with the first but if the edge swell in any place they plain of that swelling till it comply as aforesaid  if the second board prove thicker than the first then with the adz as aforesaid they hew away the under side of that board most commonly cross the grain lest with the grain the edge of the adz should slip too deep into the board in every part of it that shall bare upon a joyst and so sink it to a flat superficies to comply with the first board if the board be too thin they underlay that board upon every joyst with a cap etc  and as this second board is laid so are the other boards laid if they be well assured the boards are dry and will not shrink but if they doubt the dryness of the boards they sometimes do or should take a little more pains for after they have nailed down the first board they will measure the breadth of two other boards laying them by the side of the first but yet they will not allow them their full room to lie in but after there edges are true shot in a straight line they will pinch them off about half a quarter of an inch room more or less according as they guess at the wellseasonedness of the boards by nailing down the fourth board nearer to the first board by half a quarter of an inch more or less then the breadth of both boards are and though it be afterward somewhat hard to get these two boards into that narrow room viz between the first and fourth board yet they help themselves thus the underedge of these boards that are to join to each other they bevel somewhat away and then the first and fourth board being fast nailed down as aforesaid they set the outer edges of these two boards again the two nailed boards letting the inner edges of the two loose boards meet and make an angle perpendicular to the foor then with two or three men jumping  upon that angle these two boards  and reiterated jumps by degrees  the superficies of the floor  with forcing pins and wedges force them together and then with brads they nail them down as they did the first board thus afterward they nail down a seventh board as they did the fourth and then fit in the fifth and sixth boards as they did the second and third boards and so on nailing down every third board and forcing two others between it and the last nailed board till the whole floor be boarded  but if these boards are not long enough as i hinted before to reach through the whole room they examine how true the ends lie in a straight line with one another by applying the edge of the twofoot rule to the ends and where the ends of any boards keep of the edge of the twofoot rule from complying with the whole range of ends they with the chissel and mallet cut off that irregularity holding and guiding the chissel so that it may rather cut away more of the bottom then top of the board that so the boards joined to the ends of the first laid boards may make on the superficies of the floor the finer and truer joint  having thus boarded the whole room notwithstanding they used their best diligence to do it exactly yet may the edges of some boards lie somewhat higher than the board it lies next to therefore they peruse the whole floor and where they find any irregularities they plane them off with the plane etc     the hanging of doors windows etc the floors being boarded the next work is to hang the doors in which though there be little difficulty yet is there much care to be taking that the door open and shut well  if the door have a doorcase as chamberdoors and closetdoors commonly have the jaums of the doorcase must stand exactly perpendicular which you must try by the plumbline as by   and the head of the doorcase or entertise must be fitted exactly square to the jaums as you where taught numb            and the angles of the door must be made exactly square and the rabbets of the door to fit axactly into the rabbets of the doorcase but yet they commonly make the door about one quarter of an inch shorter than the insides of the jaums of the doorcase least if the boards of the floor chance to swell within the sweep of the door the bottom of the door should drag upon the floor  they consider what sort of hindges are properest for the door they are to hang when they have a streetdoor which commonly is to take off and lift on they use hooks and hindges in a battenddoor backdoor or other battenddoor or shopwindows they use crossgarnets if a framed door side hindges and for cupboards doors and such like duftails see the description of these hindges in numb   fig       but what sort of hindges soever they use they have care to provide them of a strength proportionable to the size and weight of the door they hang with them wellmade hindges i have described numb   fol  0 whither to avoid repetition i refer you  if they hang a streetdoor which is commonly about six foot high they first drive the hooks into the doorpost by entering the post first with an augure but the bit of the augure must be less than the shank of the hook and the hole boared not so long because the shank of the hook must be strongly forced into the augurehole and should the augurehole be too wide the shank would be loose in it and not stick strong enough in it therefore if the shank be an inch square an half inchaugure is big enough to bore that hole with because it will then endure the heavier blows of an hammer to drive it so far as it must go and the stronger it is forced in the faster the hook sticks but yet they are careful not to split the doorpost  these hooks are commonly drove in about fifteen inches and an half above the groundsell and as much below the top of the door it is or should be their care to choose the pin of the lower hook about a quarter of an inch longer than that they use for the upper hook or else to make it so because these doors are commonly unweildy to lift off and on especially to lift both the hindges on both the hooks at once therefore when the lower hindge is lifted on the lower hook if the door be then lifted perpendicularly upright so high as the under side of the upper hindge may just reach the top of the upper hook you may the easier slip the eye of the upper hindge upon the hook whereas if the lower hook be either shorter or just no longer than the other instead of lifting it readily upon the upper hook you may lift it off the lower hook and so begin the labor again  having drove in the hooks they set the rabbets of the door within the rabbets of the doorpost and underlay the bottom of the door with a chip or two about half a quarter of an inch thick to raise the door that it drag not then they put the eyes of the hindges over the pins of the hooks and placing the tail piece of the hindges parallel to the bottom and top of the door they so nail them upon  this is the rule they generally observe for hanging doors shopwindows etc only sometimes instead of nailing the hindges upon the door they rivet them on for more strength and then after they have fitted the door or window into its rabbets and laid the hindges in there proper place and position as aforesaid they make marks in the nailholes of the hindge with the point of their compasses upon the door and at those marks they pierce holes with a piercerbit that fits the shank of the rivet then they put the shank of the rivet through the holes made in the door yet so that the head of the rivet be on the outside of the door and they also put the end of the shank into the nailhole

to the axis this is a brief collection and indeed the whole sum of turning  now as there is different matter or substance to be turned so there is also different ways and different tools to be used in turning each different matter  the different matters are soft wood hard wood ivory brass iron etc each of which when i have described the turners tools for soft wood i shall discourse upon but  i of the lathe the lathe is described in plate    a this machine is so vulgarly known that though it cannot be described in draft so as all its parts shall appear at one single view yet enough of it to give you the names of its several members and their uses are represented viz aaaa the legs or styles bb the cheeks or sides cc the puppets d the screw d the pike e the rest f the handle of the screw g the tennants of the puppets h the wedge i the treddle k the crosstreddle l the pole m the string n the horn     of the legs or styles the legs or styles are commonly about two foot and ten inches high and are set perpendicularly upright having each of them a tennant on its upperend of the thickness the two cheeks are to stand assunder and on either side the shoulder of these two tennants is laid one of the cheeks close to the sides of the tennants and so pinned close to the tennant as was taught numb      but a steddier and more secure way is to have a strong iron screw made with a square shank near the head that when it enters into a square hole made fit to it in the hithermost cheek it may not twist about but by the turning about of an iron nut upon the foreend of the screw the nut shall draw the two cheeks close to the two sides of the tennants or the upper ends of the legs    of the cheeks as i told you the legs are to be set up directly perpendicular so the cheeks are to be fastened directly horizontally upon them and the legs and cheeks are to be fastened with braces to the floor and other parts of the room the lathe stands in according to the convenience of the room for fastening that the whole lathe may stand as steedy and solid as may be for if with turning large work the strength of the tread should make the lathe tremble you will not be able to make true and neat work but the tool will job into softer parts of the stuff and fly off where a knot or other harder parts of the stuff comes to the tool    of the puppets the puppets are square pieces of wood of a substance convenient to the light or heavy work they intend to turn and turnners will rather have their puppets too strong than too weak because though the puppets be very strong yet they can turn light work with them whereas if they be weak they cannot turn heavy work with them for the weight of heavy unequal tempered stuff running about will be apt both to shake the puppets and loosen the small hole of the wedge in the tennant by either of which inconveniences the work in the lathe may tremble as aforesaid  and though no size for the height of the puppets can be well asserted because of the several diameters of work to be turned yet workmen generally covet to have their puppets as short as they well can to bear their work off the cheeks of the lathe because these puppets stand in the firmer and are less subject to loosen but then if the diameters of the work be large the puppets may be too short to turn that work in for the pikes of the puppets must stand somewhat more than half the diameter of the work above the superficies of the cheeks therefore turners have commonly two or three pair of puppets to fit one lathe and always strive to use the shortest they can to serve their work unless the shortness of the legs of the lathe makes the work fall too low for the pitch of the workman that is to work at the lathe therefore in the making of the lathe the height of the legs with relation to the intended work and height of the workman are to be well considered  at the lower end of these puppets are made two tennants of such a thickness that they may easily slide in the grove between the two cheeks and so long that a mortess through it of the length of the cheeks depth and a sufficient strength of wood below it may be contained into this mortess is fitted a tapering wedge somewhat less at the fore end and bigger at the hinder end than the mortess that as it is forced into the mortess with a mallet or a maul it may draw the bottom shoulder of the puppet close and firmly down upon the cheeks that they may neither joggle or tremble in working    of the horn upon the right hand puppet on the out side near the top of it is hung the tipend of an horn with its tip downwards to hold oil in and ought to have a wooden round cover to fit into it that neither chips or dirt get in to spoil the oil and in the handle of the cover should be fitted a wooden butten which may serve for an handle to the cover and through this butten should be fastened an iron wire to reach almost to the bottom of the horn this wire stands always in the oil that so often as the workman has occasion to oil the centers of the work to make his work slip about the easier he takes the wooden cover by the button wire and all and with the end of the wire oils his centerholes and pops his wire and cover again into the horn against he has occasion to use it the next time    of the pikes and screw near the upper end of one of these puppets is fastened a strong iron pike but its point is made of tempered steel and near the upper end of the other puppet is fitted an iron screw quite through a nut in the puppet whose point is also made of tempered steel this iron pike in one puppet and the screw in the other puppet are so fitted into the puppets that their shanks lie in a straight line with one another and both their points lie also in that straight line pointing to one another and in the head of the iron screw is a hole where into is fitted an iron handle about seven or eight inches long with a round knob at each end of it that it slip not through the hole in the head this iron handle is to turn about the screw forward or backward as your purpose shall require  upon the points of this screw and pike the centers of the work are pitched and afterward screwed with the screw hard and so far into the stuff that it may not slip off the points in working especially if it be soft wood and the work large and heavy  also near the upper end of these puppets upon that side the workman stands when he works the wood of the puppets is wrought away to square flat shoulders somewhat below the pikes that the rest may if occasion be lie near the pikes and bear steady upon the shoulders    of the rest the rest is a square piece of stuff about an inch or an inch and half thick and two inches or two and an half broad and somewhat longer than the distance between the puppets its office is to rest the tool upon that it may lie in a steady position while the workman us it    of the siderest but besides this rest turnners have another rest called the siderest this they use when they turn the flat sides of boards because the flat sides of boards standing athwart the pikes and this rest standing also athwart the pikes they can the more conveniently rest their tool upon it it is marked e in plate   and is in the plate disjunct from the lathe as well because it and the common rest cannot both together be expressed in picture as also because it is made to take off and put on as occasion requires  the rest is marked a and is a piece of an oaken plank or elm plank about two inches think and stands so high above the cheeks of the lathe as the points of the pikes do or sometimes a little higher its breadth is about a foot or more or less as the work requires or the workman fancies the bottom of it is firmly nailed to one side of a quarter of oak or elm of about three inches square and two foot or two foot and an half long close to one end as you see in the figure at b so as the rest stand upright to the piece of quarter this piece of quarter is as a tennant to slide into a square iron collar marked e this square iron collar is made so long as to reach through the depth of the cheeks of the lathe and to receive the quarter or tennant thrust through it above the cheeks and a wedge under the cheeks marked d which wedge when stiff knocked up draws the tennant strong and firmly down to the cheeks and consequently keeps the siderest steady on any part of the cheeks according as you slide the collar forwards or backwards toward either pike or as you thrust the rest nearer or farther to and from the pikes  some turnners for some work instead of a plank for this rest fasten to one end of the quarter or tennant a long iron with a round cilindrick socket in it as at the figure marked f in plate    a is the socket of about an inch or an inch and an half diameter to reach within two or three inches as high as the pikes and into this socket they put a long round iron shank as in figure g of the same plate a is the shank and at the top of this shank is made the rest marked b this shank i say slips easily into the socket that it may be raised or let down as occasion requires and by the help of a screw through the socket at e may be fastened at that length  the rest by reason of its round shank may be also turned with its upper edge more or less oblique or athwart the work or else parallel to the work according as the purpose may require  near one end of the rest is fitted and fastened a piece of wood about an inch square and ten or twelve inches long this piece of wood is fitted stiff into a square hole or mortess made in the puppet a little above the shoulder for the rest to set the rest to any distance from the pikes which with the ends of wooden screws entered into wooden nuts on the further side of the puppet and coming through against the rest keeps the rest from being thrust nearer to the work when the workman is working    of the treddle and crosstreddle about the middle between the ends is placed a wooden treddle about two inche and an half broad an inch thick and three foot long and sometimes three and an half  four foot long the hinder end of it is fastened to the floor with a piece of leather sometimes a piece of the upperleather of an old shoe which piece of leather is nailed to the underside of the hinder end of the treddle  as to leave leather enough beyond the end  the treddle to nail down upon the floor which treddle being thus nailed down will move upwards as the spring of the pole draws up the string the string being also fastened to the fore end of the treddle  the hinder end of the treddle is nailed down about a foot or a foot and an half behind the lathe and about the middle between both the legs so that the foreend of the treddle reaches beyond the foreside of the lathe about a foot and an half or two foot and note that the farther the foreend of the treddle reaches out beyond the foreside of the lathe the greater will the sweep of the foreend of the treddle be and consequently it will draw the more string down and the more string comes down at one tread the more revolutions of the work is made at one tread and therefore it makes the greater riddance of the work  but then again if the foreend of the treddle reach too far before the foreside of the lathe it may draw the end of the pole so low as to brake it and it will also be the harder to tread down because the power commanding which is the weight of the tread lies so far from the weight to be commanded which is the strength of the pole augmented by the distance that the end of the treddle has from the work in the lathe so that you may see that the nearer the foreend of the treddle lies to the perpendicular of the work in the lathe the easier the tread will be and some turners that turn altogether small work have the foreend of the treddle placed just under their work so that their string works between the cheeks of the lathe but then the sweep of the treddle being so small the pole draws up but a small length of string and consequently makes the fewer revolutions of the work in one tread which hinders the riddance of the work unless with every spring of the pole they should lift their treading leg so high as to tire it quickly with bringing it down again after it is raised to so uncommodious a position  this treddle has a square notch in the middle of the further end about an inch and an half wide and two inches long that the end of the string may be wound either off or on the wood on either side the notch to lengthen or shorten the string as the different diameters of the work shall require  about the midde of the treddle is fixed a round iron pin about half an inch in diameter so as to stand upright about an inch and an half or two inches long above the treddle and under the cheeks is also fixed down the crosstreddle which is such another piece of wood as the treddle is but longer or shorter according to the length of the lathe and in the middle of the breadth of the crosstreddle is made several holes all arow to receive the iron pin set upright in the treddle these holes are commonly boared about two or three inches assunder that the pin or the treddle may be put into any one of them according as the string is to be placed nearer to or further off either end of the lathe    of the pole the pole is commonly made of a firpole and is longer or shorter or bigger or smaller according to the weight of the work the workman designs to turn for the thicker the pole is the harder must the tread be to bring it down and for this reason if the pole prove too strong for their common or continued work they will weaken it by cutting away with a drawknife described numb   plate   e and   part of the substance off the upper and under sides of the pole  the thick end of this pole is nailed or indeed rather pinned up to some girder or other timber in the ceiling of the room with one single nail or a pin that the pole may move upon that nail or pin as on a center and its thin end pass from one puppet to the other as the work may require and at about a distance or more is also nailed up to some joysts or other timbers of the ceiling two cheeks of a convenient strength and at the lower end of these two cheeks is nailed a quarter or batten to bear the pole though the weight of a tread be added to it as you may see at nn in plate      0 of the siderest but it sometimes happens that the ceiling of the workroom is not high enough for the pole to play upwards and downwards therefore in such case they place the thin end of the pole at some considerable distance off the lathe either before or behind it and so make the spring of the pole horizantal toward the lathe conveying and guiding the string from the pole to the work by throwing it over a rowler moving on two iron centerpins fastened at both ends and placed parallel to the cheeks of the lathe above the work as high as they can and thus every tread draws the rowler about but should the rowler not move about upon these irons pins the string every tread would both cut a groove in the ruler and fret it self more or less upon the rowler     of the bow some turnners that work light work such as caneheads inkhorns etc for which they need scarce remove the puppets often their lathe use a common bow such as archers use the middle of this bow they fasten over head with its string horizontally downwards and in the middle of that string they fasten another string perpendicularly downwards whose other end they fasten to the treddle and the string wound round their work brings it about     of the great wheel but when turnners work heavy work such as the pole and tread will not command they use the great wheel this wheel is so commonly known that i shall need give you no other description of it than the figure it self which you may see in plate    a it is turned about with one and sometimes with two iron handles according as the weight of the work may require  its string has both its ends strong and neatly fastened together not with a knot but lapt over one another about three inches in length and so is firmly whipped about with small gut that it may the easier pass over the narrow groove in the edge of the rowler this string is laid in the groove made on the edge of the wheel and also in the groove of the work but before it is laid upon both one part of the string is lapt over and crosses the other and the string receives the form of a figure of eight only one of its bows or circles becomes no bigger than the groove in the work and the other as big as the groove in the wheel  then the whole frame wherein the wheel is fixed is removed farther off the lathe that the string may draw tight upon the work  the reason why the string thus crosses it self is because it will touch and gird more upon the groove of the work and consequently as was said before    will the better command the work about  the manner of turning this wheel is as the manner of turning other wheels with handles  besides the commanding heavy work about the wheel rids work faster off than the pole can do because the springing up of the pole makes an intermission in the running about of the work but with the wheel the work runs always the same way so that the tool need never be off it unless it be to examine the work as it is doing  when the wheel is used its edge stands athwart the cheeks of the lathe     of the treddlewheel this is a wheel made of a round board of about two foot and an half diameter conveniently to stand under the cheeks of the lathe it also has a groove on its edge for the string to run in it has an iron axis with a crook or crank at one end and on this crook is slipped the noose of a leather thong which having its other end fastened to a treddle does by keeping exact time in treads carry it swiftly about without intermission  but the length of the thong must be so fitted that when the wheel stands still and the crook at the end of the axis hangs downwards the end of the treddle to which the thong is fastened may hang about two or three inches off the ground for then giving the wheel a small turn with the hand till the crook rises to the highest and passes a little beyond it if just then i say the workman gives a quick tread upon the treddle to bring the crook down again with a jerk that tread will set it in a motion for several revolutions and then if he observes to make his next tread just when the crook comes about again to the same position it will continue the motion and cause of the motion and keep the wheel always running the same way if he punctually times his treads  the treddel wheel is used for small work only as not having strength enough to carry heavy work about such as caneheads small boxes etc and it is fitted below the cheeks between the puppets as the bow is above  besides these inventions to carry about the work in the lathe there are many more as with a great iron wheel having teeth on its edge which teeth are to fall into an iron nut upon an iron axis pitched upon the pikes of the puppets of the lathe or fitted into collars etc  also for very heavy work as guns great mortars etc wheels turned with wind water or horses to carry the work about of which more in their proper places     of the string upon the thin end of the pole is wound a considerable bundle of string that as a mandrel requires to be bigger than ordinary or the work heavier they may unwind so much of the string as will compass the mandrel twice or if the work be heavy thrice the easier to carry it about  this string is made of the guts of beasts most commonly of sheep and spun round of several thicknesses of which the workman chooses such sizes as are aptest for his work for large and heavy work very thick but for small and light work thin and there are several reasons for his choice for a thin string will be too weak for heavy work but if it were not too weak for heavy work it would be apt to mark soft wood more than a thick string would when they are forced to shift the string and let it run upon the work besides a thin string though it were strong enough would not so well bring heavy work about because being small but little of the string touches the wood to command it unless they wind it the oftener about the work which both takes up time and hazards the breaking of the string by the fretting of the several twists against one another  now a thick string is uncommodious for small work because having a strength and stubbornness proportionable to its size it will not comply closely to a piece of work of small diameter but will be apt to slip about it unless both pole and tread be very strong and then if the centerholes be not very deep and the pikes fill them not very tight and the puppets also not very well fixed the strength of the string will alter the centerholes especially when the work is upon soft wood or else it will endanger the breaking the work in its weakest place     of the seat parallel to the cheeks on the inside the lathe is fitted a seat about two and an half inches square and the whole length of the lathe having an iron pin fastened on either end the underside of it it lies upon two bearers of wood that are fastened athwart the outer sides the legs or else to set it higher the outer ends of the cheeks according to the height of the person that works at the lathe these bearers reach in length so far inwards as that they may be capable to bear the seat so far off from the lathe as in the diameter of the work they intend to turn in the lathe and also the bulk of the workman that stands between the lathe and it may be contained  it is not called a seat because it is so but because the workman places the upper part of his buttocks against it that he may stand the steddier to his work and consequently guide his foot the firmer and exacter  the two bearers have several holes made in them from within sixteen inches off the lathe to the ends of them that the iron pins fastened in the ends of the seat may be removed nearer or farther off the lathe according to the greatness or smallness of the diameter of their work  having thus described the parts of a common lathe i shall now follow with their other tools also  ii of gouges gouges are marked bb in plate    they do the office of foreplains in joynery and the jackplains in carpentry and serve only to take off the irregularities the hatchet or sometimes the drawknife leaves after the work is hewed or drawn pretty near a round with either of them and therefore as the foreplain is made with a corneredge only to take off the irregularities of a board so the gouge that it may also take off the irregularities or extuberancies that lie farthest from the axis of the work and also frame pretty near the hollow moldings required in the work precede the smoothingchissels and that the gouge may the more commodiously and effectually do it the blade of this tool is formed about half round to an edge and the two extreme ends of this half round a little sloped off toward the middle of it that a small part about the middle may the easier cut off the prominencies that are not concentrick to the axis and so bring the work into a method of formation  the hollow edge is ground upon the corner of a grindstone which in short time wears the outside of that corner to comply and form with the hollow of the gouge it is afterward set upon a round whetstone that fits the hollow of the edge or is somewhat less but they do not set their gouges or chissels as i told you in numb    0 the joyners do for turnners tools being somewhat unweldy by reason of their size and long handles they lay the blade of the gouge with its unequal side upon the rest of the lathe and so with the whetstone in their right hand they rub upon the basil the grindstone made and as they rub they often turn another part of the hollow of the edge to bear upon the round of the whetstone till they have with the whetstone taken off the roughness of the grindstone  of these gouges there are several sizes viz from a quarter of an inch to an whole inch and sometimes for very large work two inches over  the handles to these gouges and indeed to all other turning tools are not made as the handles of joyners or carpenters tools are but tapering toward the end and so long that the handle may reach when they use it under the armpit of the workman that he may have more stay and steady management of the tool    mechanic exercises or the doctrine of handyworks applied to the art of turning iii of flat chissels the flat chissels are marked cc in plate    these do the office of smoothing plains in joining and carpentry for coming after the gouges they cut off the prominent risings that the gouges leaves above the hollow  the edges of these flat chissels are not ground to such a basil as the joyners chissels are which are made on one of the flat sides of the chissels but are basild away on both the flat sides so that the edge lies between both the sides in the middle of the tool and therefore either sides of the tool may indifferently be applied to the work which could not well be should the edge lie on one of the sides of the tool because if they should apply the basil side of the tool to the work the thickness of the basil would bear the edge of the tool off and should they apply that side of the tool the edge lies on to the work the swift coming about of the work would where a small irregularity of stuff should happen draw or jobb the sudden edge into the stuff and so dawk it which if the stuff be already small enough would now be too small because in turnings all irregularities must be wrought smooth down  of those flat chissels there are several sizes viz from a quarter of an inch one inch two inches to three inches broad according to the largness of the work  these are set with the whetstone as the gouges are only they often turn the gouges upon the round side because they would smoothen all the hollow edge but these are laid flat upon the rest and with a flat whetstone rubbed on the basil as the gouge was with the round  iv of hooks the hook is marked d in plate    as the gouge is used when the work lies before the workman viz parallel to its axis and cuts right forwards so the hook is used when the work stands on the right or left side the workman as the flat sides of boards to be turned do and therefore this work may be said to lie athwart its axis and the hook is made so as to cut on the right or left side a board and to take off the extuberances from the plain of the board but though this tool does the office of a gouge yet it is more difficult for a workman to use than a gouge because it is made thinner and slenderer than a gouge that its edge cutting at a greater bearing from the rest may the easier come at the stuff it works upon and the farther the edge that cuts lies from the rest the more difficult it is for a workman to guide it because it is then more subject to tremble especially since as aforesaid the edge of the hook is and must be thinner than the edge of the gouge  these tools as also the gouges and flatchissels are all about ten or twelve inches long without the handles  the hooks when they want sharpening cannot be ground as the gouges and chissels are but they must be first softened in the fire and turned straight and then brought to an edge and by heating again red hot turned into its form then must it be hardened and tempered as you were taught numb   fol       yet do not workmen proceed thus with their hook every time it grows bluntish but only when the edge is either by long use or bad temper grown so thick that this following way will not help them for they whet the outer edge with a whetstone as they do other tools but because they cannot come at the inner edge of the hook with a whetstone unless the hook be very wide and the whetstone very thin they make use of a piece of tempered steel as sometimes the  side of a chissel or the back of a knife and so with the edge of the square scrape along the hollow edge of the hook and force the edge as much to the outside of the hook as they can thus butchers wear at their girdles small round rods of steel well tempered and polisht that they may with quick dispatch whet their knives upon it by forcing the edge forwards upon the blade or pressing down the shoulder that hinders the edge entrance for their steels being so well polisht cannot properly be said to wear away any part of the shoulder that should hinder the edge from doing its office  v of grooving hooks and grooving tools the grooving hook is marked e in plate    and has its tooth of different forms according to the fashion of the groove to be made on the plain of the board for sometime its tooth has a flat edge sometimes a round edge sometimes a point only and sometimes two points or other forms as aforesaid  its whole blade is made much stronger than the gouge and chissels and has the sides of as edge more obtuse to make it the stronger  the flat tools work the boards flat either to the plain of the board or to a flat groove in the board  the round edge cuts an halfround hollow in the board  the point cuts a fine hollow circle or swage in the flat of the board and being made trangular has three edges each of which cuts the ridges smooth down that the hook left upon the board  the twopoint groovinghook cuts two fie hollow circles or swages on the plain of the board  the groovinghooks do not work as the hooks do for the hooks cut the wood but these do but indeed scrape off the extuberancies or fre into the wood and therefore they are very seldom used to soft wood because its being loose will not endure scraping without leaving a roughness upon the work but hard wood or ivory for the reason converted will  vi of mandrels and   of flat mandrels mandrels are marked f   f   f   f   in plate    there are different sorts of mandrels and the sizes of them also different according to the sizes of the work    broad flat mandrels marked f   in plate    with three or more little iron pegs or points near the verge of its flat and these are used for the turning flat boards upon for the backside of a board placed flat upon it will when screwed up tight between the pikes by help of the irong pegs remain in its place and position whilst the flat side of the work is working upon  behind the backside of this mandrel and indeed all other mandrels is fitted a long shank or rowler for the string to be wound about while the work is turning this rowler must be so large in diameter that the string wound about it may command the work about if the work be large and heavy the rowler must be bigger than if the work be light for else the string will not command it about but if the diameter of the rowler be smaller the work comes so much swifter about the rowler must also be so long between its shoulders that it may conveniently contain so many diameters of the string as shall be necessary to wind about it  this whole mandrel is marked f   in plate    a the round flat or face of the mandrel b the rowler cc the shoulders of the rowler ddd the pegs    of pinmandrels   mandrels are made with a long wooden shank to fit stiff into a round hole that is made in the work that is to be turned this mandrel is called a shank or pinmandrel and is marked f   in plate    and if the hole the shank is to fit into be very small and the work to be fastened on it pretty heavy then turners fasten a round iron shank or pin of the size of the hole it is to be fitted into and fasten their work upon it these mandrels with iron shanks are used by turnners that turn bobbins or such like work because a wooden shank to fit the small hole though the work would not be strong enough to carry the work about    of hollowmandrels   there is another sort of mandrels called hollow mandrels described f   plate    it is both a hollowmandrel and also used to turn hollow work in it this mandrel has but one centerhole belonging to it viz at the rowle end or neck but it has a shank which supplies the office of another centerhole a the hollow b the shank or neck the hollow is made so wide that the work intended to be turned hollow in it may fit very stiff into it and so deep that it may contain the intended work  when it is used it is pitched upon the center at the farther end of the rowler and has its shank put into one of the holes of the jointcoller described in plate    fig g that will best fit it which hole standing directly against the pike in the hinder puppet and receiving the shank into it guides the mandrel about as if it were pitched upon two centers and the work being forced stiff into the hollow of this mandrel will be carried about with it exposing the foreside of the work bare and free from the joyntcoller and not impeded by spikes from coming at the work so that with the hook groovinghook gouge or flatchissel according as your work requires you may come at it to turn your intended form  hollow mandrels are also used in collers that open not with a joint but then the spindle is made of iron and has a screw just at its end upon which is screwed a block with an hollow in it made fit to receive the work stiff into it    of the screwmandrel   another sort of mandrel is called the screwmandrel and is marked f   in plate    a the rowler of the mandrel b the shank or screw is made of iron having its two ends round and in the middle between the round ends a square the length of the rowler and this square is fitted stiff into a squarehole made through the middle of the rowler that it turn not about in the squarehole in each flatend of this iron shank or spindle is made a centerhole wherein the pikes of the puppets are pitched when this mandrel is used this iron shank or axis must be made very straight and ought to be turned upon the two centerholes for exactness because on one of the round ends or sometimes on both a screw or indeed several screws of several diameters is made that screw next the end of the shank is the smallest viz about three quarters of an inch over and takes up in length toward the middle of the shank about an inch or an inch and an half and so far from the end of the shank it is of an equal diameter all the way and on this portion of the shank is made a malescrew of the finest thread the next inch and half wrought as before has another malescrew but about half a quarter of an inch more in diameter than the former and has its threads courser another inch and half has its diameter still greater and its threads yet courser and thus you may make the shank as long as you will that you may have the more variety of sizes for screws  these sorts of mandrels are made for the making of screws to boxes and their lids as shall be showed in the next paragraph  of sockets or chocks belonging to the screwmandrel to this screwmandrel belongs so many sockets as there are several sizes of screws on the shank they are marked f   in plate    a the socket or chock bb the wooden pin c the stay dd the notch to slip over the malescrew  these hollow sockets have femalescrews in them made before the notch to slip over the malescrew of the screwmandrel is cut the manner of making femalescrews is taught numb   fol     0    only instead of a tap used there you use the several and different sizes of screws made on the screwsmandrel to do the office of a tap into each respective socket which sockets being only made of hard wood it will easily perform though the shank or axis be but iron  therefore as aforesaid to each of the malescrews on the screwmandrel is fitted such a socket that you may choose a thread courser or finer as you please but this femalescrew is open or has a notch on one side of it that it may slip over the malescrew and the threads of each other fit into each others grooves and when they are thus fitted to one another the further or open side of the malescrew is gaged in or pined on the femalescrew with a wooden pin thrust through two opposite holes made for that purpose in the cheeks of the wooden sockets that it shake not  when the treddle comes down in working and the socket is fitted on its proper screw and pinned stiff upon it and the stay held down to the rest of the lathe then will the socket and consequently the stay slide farwards upon the malescrews so that a tool held steady on any part of the stay and applied to the out or inside of your work that tools point will describe and cut a screw whose thread shall be of the same fineness that the screw and the shank is of  vii of collers there are several fashioned collers as the joyntcoller marked g the roundcoller marked h and the collar marked i in plate     the joyntcoller is made of two iron cheeks marked bb which moving upon a joint c at the bottom may be set close together or else opened as the two insides of the joyntrule carpenters use to do on the inner edge of each cheek is formed as many halfround holes or semicircles as you please or the length of the cheeks will conveniently admit these semicircles are made of different diameters that they may fit the shanks or necks of different sized mandrels and these semicircles must be made so exactly against each other on the edges of the cheeks that when the two cheeks moving upon their joint are clapped close together the semicircles on both the cheeks shall become a perfect round hole or circumference  near the top of one of these cheeks is fastened with a centerpin a square iron collar marked d with a small handle to it marked e this square collar is made to contain the breadth of both the cheeks when they are shut together and to hold them so fast together that they shall not start assunder and yet is made so fit that it may slip off and on both the cheeks  this joyntcoller may serve to do the office of the other two collers and its one particular office too yet to save the charge of the price of this tool turners seldom use them but make shift with either of the other or sometimes with a hole made in a board only but its particular office is to hold a mandrel whose neck is fitted to one of its holes and the work they are to turn is required to stand out free from the outer flat of the cheeks of the collar the better to come at it with the tool such as are deep boxes or deep cups etc    mechanic exercises or the doctrine of handyworks applied to the art of turning viii of the mawl the mawl is marked k in plate    the figure of it there is description sufficient its office is to knock and unknock the wedge in the puppets and to knock upon the back of the cleaving knife when they split their wood for their work the joyners mallet would supply the office of this tool but use has made the mawl more handy for them besides when one is battered to shivers they can quickly of a chump of wood accommodate themselves with another  ix of the hatchet drawknife and cleavingknife the hatchet is marked l in plate   it is of the same sort that joyners use which i described numb      and therefore refer you thither and the drawknife is described in numb      plate   marked e the cleavingknife marked m in plate    needs no other description than that figure  x of the choppingblock the choppingblock is marked n in plate    it is made of a piece of elmtree placed with its grain upwards and downwards as it grew it has three leges in it that stand stradling out from the underside of the block to the floor and of such an height as the workman may have most command of the work see the figure sometimes turnners use instead of it a piece of the trunk of a tree of about a foot and an half or two foot in length from the ground or more or less  xi of the callippers the callippers is marked o in plate    as common compasses described numb      are for measuring distances upon a plain superficies so callippers measure the distance of any round cilindrick conical body either in their extremity or any part less than the extreme so that when workmen use them they open the two points aa to their described width and turn so much stuff off the intended place till the two points of the callippers fit just over their work so shall their work have just the diameter in that place as is the distance between the two points of the callippers be it either feet or inches etc  xii of the drillbench there is yet another tool or rather a machine used by some turnners called a drillbench it is described in plate    aaaa a thick board about three inches thick five inches broad and eighteen inches long bb two styles placed toward either end and fastened upright in the hithermost style is a collar described   and plate    h or any of the other collers and in the further style is fitted a square flat tempered piece of steel having a centerhole in the middle of it and is placed just against the center or middle point of the hole of the collar cc the rowler whose hither end is turned away so as it just fit into the collar and at the further end of it it has a tempered steel  to be placed in the centerhole and in the middle of the hither end of it it has a piercerpit fastened straight in so that it lie in a true straight line with the axis of the rowler of these rowlers they have several and bits of different sizes fitted into them that upon all occasions they may choose one to fit their purpose  on the underside about the middle of the bench is fitted and fastened athwart it a square iron collar deep enough to reach through the cheeks of the lathe and so much deeper as it may receive a wooden wedge such a one as belongs to one of the puppets and by the force and strength of the wedge the whole drillbench is drawn down and fastened athwart the cheeks of the lathe  when it is used it stands athwart the cheeks of the lathe as aforesaid with the point or end of the bit toward you and then the string being turned twice or thrice about the rowler will with treading on the treddle turn the rowler and its bit forcibly about and cause it to enter swiftly into a piece of wood that shall be pressed forwards upon the bit  when they use it they hold the piece of wood they intend to drill or pierce fast in both their hands right before them and press it forwards upon the piercerbit so that by its running about it cuts a straight round hole into the wood of what length they please  but while the pole is rising after every tread they press not against the piercerbit so that it is disingaged from doing its office in the wood but in that while they nimbly give the wood a turn in their hands of about one third part of its circumference which makes the bit very successive tread go the straighter through the middle of the wood and thus they reiterate treads and keep the wood turning in their hands till the bit is entered deep enough  thus much of the tools used in common turnning i shall proceed to the working a pattern or two in soft wood which being well understood may render a practicer capable of most common work  xiii of turning a cilinder in soft wood the soft wood turners use is commonly either maple alder birch beech elm oak fir etc and for some particular purposes each of these sorts are best  the first pattern we purpose shall be a cilinder two inches over and eight inches long therefore you must choose a piece of wood  lest two inches and a quarter over lest you wa stuff to work upon nay if your stuff prove shaken or otherwise unsound or your center be not very exactly pitched you may want yet more stuff and that according as it proves more or less faulty or as the centers are more unequally pitched but supposing the stuff good you may take a piece of two inches and a quarter over as i said before and about ten or eleven inches long for though the length of the cilinder be but eight inches yet you must cut your stuff long enough to make a groove at one end of it besides for the string to run in if your stuff be somewhat too big for your scantlin and not round enough to go into the lathe you must hew it pretty near with the hatchet to make it sizable and afterward smoothen it nearer with a drawknife as you were taught numb      but if you have not stuff at hand near your size then you must saw off your length from a billet or some other piece of stuff and with the cleavingknife and the mawl split it into a square piece near the size and with the drawknife ound off the edges to make it fit for the lthe  then set your puppets and wedge them right up so as the points of your spikes stand pretty near the length of your work assunder and move the pole so as the end of it may hang  between the pikes and also fit the iron pin  the treddle into a proper hole in the crosstreddle so as the end of the treddle may draw the string below the work into pretty near a traight line with the string above the work and take the work in your right hand and ut it beyond the string before you and with  left hand wind the string below the work  once about the work lest it should be too strong for your shallow centers as you shall understand by and by and then with a pretty strength press the middle of one end of your work over the point of one of the pikes and so ke a hole in your work for one of the cener holes then screw your pike wider or closer according as the length of your work requires d pitch the other end of your work upon the other pike also and screw your work a little ightly up then try how the centers are pitched by treading the treddle lightly down and if you find the centers are well pitched you may thout more ado screw up your work tight but if your centers or either of them be not well pitched you must alter them you may knw when they are well pitched by treading softly upon your treddle and holding your finger steady on the rest direct the point of it pretty close to the work for if in a revolution of your work its outside keeps it an equal distance from the end of your finger you may conclude your work is well pitched but if you find one side of your work comes nearer your finger than the other side you must with your flat chissel or gouge or what is nearest at hand knock softly or hard upon that side that comes nearest to your finger till you have forced the pikes into the true centers at the end of your work and then you may boldly screw it hard up but you must be sure to screw it hard up because it is soft wood you purpose to work upon and the strength of the pole may endanger the drawing or removing the centers if the pikes have not good hold of them  having found your centers take your work again off the pikes and wind the string once or twice more about your work that your string as i said in numb  0   when i wrote of the string may the better command it and then wind off or no more string at the end of your pole or end of your treddle or both if your work require it till the pole draws the treddle up a little above half the length of the legs of the lathe for about the height your leg may without sudden trying command the pole down again  but before you begin to work upon the stuff i shall inform you how to tread the treddle in which you may observe this general rule that the nearer the foreend of the treddle you tread the easier you bring down the pole but then the pole in its spring rases your leg the higher and may draw the upper side of the your thigh against the underside of the cheek of the lathe and with reiterated risings gawl and also tire your thigh  place therefore your foot steady upon the treddle so far forward as you can to avoid the poles rising from drawing your thigh against the underside of the lathe and tread the treadle nimbly down but not quite so low as to knock against the floor then abate the weight of your tread and let the pole draw the treddle up but still keep your foot steady and lightly bearing upon the treddle for then your succeeding treads will prove easier to your leg and thigh and you will with your foot the better and quicker command the treddle then tread again nimbly down as before and keep this train of treading till your work be finished or that you may have occasion to stop and exaime how rightly you proceed  in all small work the tread is lightly and nimbly performed but in large and heavy work the tread comes slow and heavily down  this being premised you may begin with your gouge lay the round side of it upon the rest and take the handle of it in your right hand and lay the fore and middle fingers of your left hand upon the hollow of the gouge near the work mounting the edge about a quarter of an inch above the axis of your work and sinking your right hand a little for in this position the gouge cuts best and thus cut down on your work near one end a groove for your string to run in the groove may be about an inch or an inch and an half long but it matters not much what depth then slip your string into the groove and if you find the string will not slip easily you may put your foot under the treddle and lift it a little up that the string when no weight is hanged to it may slide the easier into the groove  and by the way you may take notice that the deeper you cut down the groove the oftener will your work come about every tread because the string that comes down every tread measure a small circumference oftener than it does a greater circumference but then the work is not so strongly carried about because it has a less portion of the string to command it this i hint not that in this our small proposed pattern it is very considerable for if you only cut the groove down but so low as there may be a shoulder at the end and another against the work to keep the string from slipping out of the groove it will be sufficient but in heavy work this groove ought to be cut with discretion  now come to the forming of your work and hold your gouge as you were taught before but somewhat lightly against your work beginning at one end and sliding your gouge gradually to the other cutting with its edge all the way you go and bearing somewhat stiff against the work every tread you make on the treddle and withdrawing it again a little lightly from the work every spring of the pole and thus by use you must habituate your self to let the edge of your  bear upon the work when the pole and treddle comes down and to draw it back st off the work as the pole and treddle goes up and thus you must continue till you have rghwrought all your work from end to end  if you have not at first brought your work  that is if you have not gone deep  with your gouge to take off all the risings of the stuff the drawknife left even with the smallest part of your work you must in like manner as before work it over again but you must have a special care you take not too much stuff away on any part of the whole work for this proposed pattern being a cilinder if you take but a small matter to much away from any part and make it smaller than your given measure there the whole work will be spoiled as being smaller than the proposed diameter which to know you may by opening the points of your callippers to two inches on your rule the proposed diameter of your cilinder try if the points at that distance will just slip over the deepest grooves of your work for we will not suppose that the grooves are of an equal depth with the roughworking of the gouge without straining the joint for then your work is just sizeable if not work over again as before etc but we will now suppose you have not taken too much away but have made a due process with your gouge therefore now proceed and use a flat chissel about an inch and an half broad to take off the irregularities the gouge left  take the handle of it in your right hand as you did the gouge and claspsing the blade of it in your left hand lean it steady upon the rest holding the edge a little aslant over the work so as a corner of the thin side of the chissel may bear upon the rest and that the flat side of the chissel may make a small angle with the rest and consequently with the work which is parallel to the rest for should you set the edge of the chissel parallel to the work it might run too fast into the work and dawk it therefore you must set the chissel in such a position that the lower corner or near the lower corner of the edge may cut lightly upon the work but this position is best described by a figure which to that purpose i have inserted in plate    at o where you may perceive in or near what position the chissel must be set to cut the work and how the edge of the chissel ab lying aslant the work and the further corner of the edge of the chissel b being somewhat mounted as the work comes about the bottom or near the bottom of the edge of the chissel is only capable to cut a narrow shaving off the work and just in this manner you must keep the chissel steady bearing upon the work as the pole comes down and withdrawing it from the work as the pole springs up as you were taught to use the gouge and at the same time sliding it forwards from one end of the work to the other till it be wrought down all the way to its true diameter between the points of the callippers for then a straight ruler applied to your work the outside of your purposes cilinder will be formed  only the ends must be cut down square to the length therefore open the points of your compasses to the distance of eight inches on your rule and prick that distance hard off upon your work that the points of your compasses may leave visible marks by placing one point as near one end as you can to leave stuff enough to cut straight down all the way that is to cut it square down at right angles with the outside of the work which to do you must hold the handle of the flat chissel in your right hand as before and clasp the blade of it in your left and lay one of the thin sides of it upon the rest so that the edge may stand upright or very near upright against the work then sink your right hand somewhat below the level of the rest that the lower corner of the edge of the chissel may mount and being thrust steady against the work just in the mark one point of the compasses made tread the treddle and cut a pretty deep circle into the stuff but you must have a care you do not direct the cutting corner of the chissel inwards but rather outward lest you make the end hollow instead of flat for if you do take off too little at first you may by degrees cut it down to a flat afterward as you cut deeper into the stuff you must turn the flat of the chissel and with it cut down the shoulder just at the end on the outside the mark for else that may hinder the corner of the edge of the chissel for coming at the work  note that if you hold not the edge of the chissel truly before the work but direct it inwards and if you hold it not very steady and have a good guidance of it the quick coming about of the work may draw the edge of the chissel into it inwards and run a dawk on cilinder like the grooves of a screw and so spoil your work for being once wrought to the true size you cannot afterward take any more off to cleanse it etc  the other end must be cut down as this     of turning flat boards if your board be thick enough you may boar a round hole in the middle of it and turn a mandrel with a pin a very little tapering to fit hard and stiff into the round hole and if the hole and pin be proportionable in size to the weight of the board the pin will carry it about but you must be very careful the hole be boarded exactly straight through the middle and not inclining on either side the board more to any part of the verge than to another but that the middle of the hole be exactly the center of the board the whole thickness through this pinmandrel is described numb      and plate     if your board be not thick enough to be fastened upon a pinmandrel or that your work will not admit of an hole to be bored through the middle of it you may use the flatmandrel described plate    f   and then you must with your compasses find the center on the backside of the round board with several proffers if need require till you have found it and prick there an hole for a mark then open the points of your compasses to about the thickness of a shilling wider than the semidiameter of the flatmandrel and with the points of your compasses at that distance describe a circle on the backside of the board to be turned by placing one foot in the prickmark and turning about the other foot by this circle you may pitch the center of the brd exactly upon the center of the flatmandrel  points of the compasses being opened about the thickness of a shilling wider than the semidiameter of the flatmandrel will when you have pitched the center of the board on the center of the mandrel place the outer verge of the mandrel the thickness of a shiling round about within the circle described on he the backside of the board and when it is hus pitched you may by laying the board flat own knock upon the rowler end of the manrel and drive the pegs in the flat of the manrel into the board and so hold it steady upon he mandrel then find the center on the foreide of the board also as you were taught to ind the center on the backside and put your board and mandrel upon the pikes of the pupets and screw them hard up as you have been ught before  sometimes turners use this flatmandrel without pegs and then they chalk the flat side of it very well and clap the backside of the board to it which will if the board to be turned be ot too heavy but be well screwed up between the pikes keep the board steady from slipping from its setposition till you work it  if in going about of your work you find it wabble that is that one side of the flat incline either to the right or left hand you must with soft blows of an hammer or other tool at hand set it to right and then again screw it hard up for so often as you thus strike upon the verge to set the board true you force the steel point of the pike more or less according to the softness of the wood toward that side of the verge you strike upon and therefore you may perceive a reason for screwing up the pike so often as you knock upon the outer verge of the board  but we will now suppose the board well pitched and fastened on the mandrel and center therere take the siderest described in   numb  0   and plate    at the figure e and fg and fit it so into the lathe as the upper edge of it may stand range or parallel to the side of the board you are to work upon and so wedge it hard up  now you must come to use the hook described numb      and plate    for this tool is most commodious to serve you instead of the gouge when the work stands athwart the pikes because the end of the blade of this tool being on its flat side turned into a circular figure and that circular figure turned a little backwards one of the edges of this circular figure will conveniently though the tool be not held straight before the work come at any part of the flat of the board and so by the circulation of the board against the edge of the hook cut off its irregular extuberances  in the using of this tool you must place the end of the handle under your armpit and hold your left hand on the upper side of the blade of the tool close to the rest and your right hand close besides your left hand under the tool and with both your hands clasp the tool hard and press it steady upon the rest and at the same time hold it also steady and yet lightly bearing against the work that by the swift coming about of the work it draw not the edge of the thin and tender blade of the hook into it  you must not hold the blade of this tool perpendicularly before the work viz parallel to the pikes but aslant so as somewhat above the middle of the unequal of the hook may touch against the work you may begin at the verge and so lay several grooves close by one another till you come to the center but you must observe as was said before in the cilinder that you lay all your grooves of an equal depth into the board for if you lay one deeper than the rest and an hollow may not properly be in that place you must again go over your work with your hook to work that dawk out and then perhaps your board may be made too thin for its intended purpose but this craft of the hand must be acquired with some continued use and practice which will better inform your judgment what errors you may be subject to commit than many words though significant upon this doctrine and this i am sure i found when i first practiced upon turning  having thus with the hook roughplaind the board for this hook does in turning the office of a foreplain in joynery you must use the triangular grooving tool described in turning   plate    and with one of its edges smoothen down the ridges the hook left on the board  but if your work require any molding near the verge or any other part of it you must work that molding as near as you can with the hook especially where hollows are required for that cuts faster and smoother than any other tool and most artificially forms an hollow  if a flat be to be laid in the board you must first use the triangular point tool and with it strike so many threads as the breadth of the flat requires and lay each thread almost so deep into the board as you intend the flat shall be and afterward to smoothen it down you must use the flat grooving tool or a flat chissel and with either of them finish the flat to its intended depth and breadth and where a fine thread or circle is to be laid in the board you must use the triangular point tool and thus as you see occasion you must accommodate your self with a tool apt and proper for your purpose viz such a tool as will most conveniently come at and from the intended work    mechanic exercises or the doctrine of handyworks applied to the art of turning xv of turning hard wood and ivory if the wood be very hard as ebony lignum vitae or if it be ivory bone or horn they are to turn they neither use the same tools they do for soft wood because their edge is to tender nor do they use their other tools as they do soft wood for the tools made for hard wood are made with a stronger point edge etc than they are for soft as was said in turning   and they use them differently because for turning soft wood they hold the edge of the gouge and flat chissel at some considerable distance from the rest mounting the edge at such an angle as will best cut off from the work as a great chip as they can or desire and as they turn the work smaller they guide the chissel to follow the work but for hard wood they raise the rest near the horizontal plain of the axis of the work setting it as close as conveniently they can to their work and lay their tool flat and steady upon the rest which being hard held in this position does by the coming about of the work cut or tear off all the extuberances the tool touches in the sweep of the work so that as i said before as in turning soft wood the tool does somewhat follow the work in turning hard wood the work comes to the tool and therefore you may perceive a great reason they have to keep the tool steady for should it in one sweep of the work be thrust nearer the axis in any place it would there take off more than it should  having prepared the work fit for the lathe either with hewing or as some hard woods and ivory may require with rasping they pitch it between the pikes as before has been shown or such work as it may be as boxes and generally all hollow work they fit into collers either by screwing the mandrel on an iron axis or fitting it with some other of the mandrels described in turning   as is proper for it as sometimes they fit the work tight into an hollow mandrel and the tight fitting in holds it whilst it is working upon and sometimes if the work be very thin they fix it on a flat mandrel with cement but they are always either to choose one of the mandrels described already in turning   or else contrive as they often do some other mandrel convenient to the opportunity that accidentally their business may require for the work whether it be pitched on the pikes or fitted into hollow mandrels or otherwise must run very steady and tight  but having thus fitted it into the lathe they begin to work with the sharppointed grooving tool or else with the triangular groowing tool and with the point of either of these tools break the grain of the wood by laying small grooves upon its surface till they have pretty well wrought away extuberances and brought the work tollerably near an intended shape by streightning hollowing and leaving risings in their several proper places  afterward with edged grooving tools of a proper breadth they cut down and smoothen away the extuberances left by the sharppointed grooving tool or the triangular grooving tool and bring the work into a perfect shape which done they smoothen the work with the edge of a piece of a blade of a broken knife basild away by following the work with it that is holding the basild edge of the knife close against the work while it comes about for then its sharp edge scrapes or shaves off the little roughness the grosser tools left upon the work  lastly they hold either a piece of sealskin or dutch reeds whose outer skin or filme somewhat finely cuts pretty hard against the work and so make it smooth enough to polish  hard wood they polish with beeswax viz by holding beeswax against it till it have sufficiently touched it all over and press it hard into it by holding hard the edge of a flat piece of hard wood made sizable and suitable to the work they work upon as the work is going about then they set a gloss on it with a very dry woollen rag lightly smeared with sallad oil  but ivory they polish with chalk and water and afterward dry it with a woollen rag and a light touch of sallad oil which at last they rub off again with a dry woollen rag and so set a gloss on it  if there be a screw to be made upon the thin edge of an ivory or hard wood or brass box they use the screwmandrel and its socket described in turning     and   as is shown at the latter end of that section  xvi of turning long and slender work of ivory some turners to show their dexterity in turning and make others that know not the way how it is  the skill trn long and slender  ivory as small as an haystalk  perhaps a foot or more long which  they cut a piece of ivory to its intended lngth but strong enough to bear working till they bring it to as small a cilinder as they can which being thus forwarded they place a joint collar as is described in turning    made small and fit for their purpose just in the middle of their work only that their work may bear at a smaller length and consequently be stronger for being thus supported while it is turned yet smaller then they place other collers between the piles and the middle collar and turn the whole cilinder slender et and thus by placing collers where ever they find the work buckle they as aforesaid with sharp tools tender touches somewhat a loose and fine string weak bow and great care and diligence work the whole cilinder down as small as they list either with moldings or other work upon it as best likes them  the properest lathe to turn this slender work in is the turnbench described    plate     xvii of the brasiers lathe and turning tools and their manner of using them brrasiers that turn andirons pots kettles etc have their lathe made different from the common turners lathe as you may see in plate    at a where the cheeks puppets and rests etc are much stronger and the pikes stronger and longer than those the common turners use their edge tools which they call hooks are also of a different shape as the figures of them described at b   b   b   in the said plate show as being bent backwards and forwards toward the cutting end somewhat like an z and as the common turners work with a round string made of gut as has been described in turning      the brasiers work with a flat leather thong which wrapping close and tight about the rowler of their mandrel commands it the easier and more forciably about their thong runs between the cheeks of the lathe  the whole lathe and its parts are made so strong because the matter they turn being metal is much heavier than wood and consequently with forciable coming about would if the lathe were slight make it tremble and so spoil the work as has been said before  the reason why the hook is so turned backwards and again forwards toward the end is that they may the better direct the edge of it as much below the horizontal plain of the pikes as they list the better in many cases to come at the work for contrary to soft wood hard wood and ivory turners they always dip the end of their hook below the rest that so the hook resting very steady upon the rest and also against one of the iron pins standing upright in the rest and held very steady forwards to the work the strong coming about of the work against the strong edge of the hook scrapes off the extuberant mettle lying in that sweep  i need no further describe the lathe and other tools that belong to brasiers turning or more of the manner of using them because by the whole proceeding discourse these arguments are largely and sufficiently handled especially considering i have given you the figures of them in plate    as aforesaid  only their way of whetting their tools being different from the whetting of other turning tools i shall say somewhat to for they whet their ho upon a broad flat slate holding the hook almost perpendicular that the basil of its edge  with the flat of the slate with  the upper end of the handle in their left  the heavier on it and clutching  of the blade near the hookend in the  hand to guide it and thus with spittle  water rub forwards and backwards on the slate till they have sharpened the edge of the hook but if it be a round end hook they whet they choose a groove in the slate fit to comply with the round edge of the hook for they have different sized grooves in the slate for that purpose and so in it rub forwards and backwards as aforesaid  xviii of turning small work of brass or other mettle small work in metal is turned in an iron lathe called a turnbench the figure of it is described in plate    at c when they use it they screw it in the chaps of a vice and having fitted their work upon a small iron axis with a drillbarrel fitted upon a square shank at the end of the axis next the left hand they with a drillbow and drillstring carry it about as was shown in smithing fol   with this difference that when a hole is drilled in a piece of metal they hold the drillbow in their right hand but when they turn small work they hold the drillbow in their left hand and with their right hand use the tool which is commonly a graver or sometimes a sculpter fit to such moldings as are to be made on the metal  they begin to work first with the sharp point of a graver laying the blade of it firm upon the rest and directing the point to the work and lay circles upon it close to one another till they have wrought it pretty true then with one of the broad edges of the graver they smoothen down what the point left and afterward with sculpters round or flat or great or small they work their intended moldings  the circumstances and considerations in the choice of a drillbow and drillstring for turning are the same with what you find in smithing fol     for drilling  xix of laying moldings either upon metal or wood without fitting the work in a lathe i had soon after the fire of london occasion to lay moldings upon the verges of several round and weighty flat pieces of brass and being at that time by reason of the said fire unaccommodated of a lathe of my own i intended to put them out to be turned but then turners were all full of employment which made them so unreasonable in their prizes that i was forced to contrive this following way to lay moldings on their verges  i provided a strong iron bar for the beam of a sweep for the whole tool marked in plate    is by mathematical instrumentmakers called a sweep to this tool is filed a tooth of steel with such roundings and hollows in the bottom of it as i intended to have hollows and roundings upon my work for an hollow on the tooth makes a round upon the work and a round upon the tooth makes an hollow on the work even as they do in the moldingplains joyners use then i placed the centerpoint of the sweep in a centerhole made in a square stud of metal and fixed in the center of the plain of the work and removed the socket that rides on the beam of the sweep till the tooth stood just upon its intended place on the verge of the work and there screwed the socket fast to the beam  to work it out i employed a labourer directing him in his left hand to hold the head of the centerpin and with his right hand to draw about the beam and tooth which according to the strength he used cut and tore away great flakes of the metal till it received the whole and perfect form the tooth would make which was as complete a molding as any skillful turner could have laid upon it  having such good success upon brass i improved the invention so as to make it serve for wood also and make a plainstock with my intended molding on the sole of it and fitted an iron to that stock with the same molding the sole had  through the sides of this stock i fitted an iron beam to do the office of the beam i used for the sweep viz to keep the plain always at what position i listed from the center for thus the iron in the plain wrought about the center even as the tooth in the sweep before rehearsed and to that purpose i made a round hole of about half an inch diameter near the end of the iron then in the center of the work i fixed a round iron pin exactly to fit the said round hole putting the round hole over the pin and fitting the iron into the stock commodious to work with i used this plain with both hands even as joyners do other plains for the iron pin in the hole of the beam kept it to its due distance from the center so that neither hand was engaged to guide it  but note the stock of this plain was not straight as the stocks of other plains are but by hand cut circular pretty near the size of the diameter of the intended molding and yet was made to slide upon the beam farther from or earer to the center as different diameters of verges might require  xx to turn several globes or balls of ivory within one another with a solid ball in the middle you must first turn your ivory ball or globe truly round of your intended diameter then describe a circle exactly through the middle or equinoctial of the globe divide that circle into four equal parts and pitch one point of a pair of compasses in one of those divisions and extend the other point to either of the ext divisions and describe with it a circle rund about the globe then remove the standng point of the compasses to either of the next divisions in the equinoctial and in like manner describe another circle round about the globe  but note that the moving point of your compasses must be somewhat bended inwards for else its point will not describe a circle on the greatest extuberances of the globe but will slide off it  thus shall the ball or globe be divided into eight spherical quadrants describe as great a circle as you can in each of these quadrants and each two centers of every two opposite circles shall have an imaginary axix pass between them and if the globe be successively pitched upon all the rest of the centers so as the imagined axis passing between it and its opposite center lie in a straight line with the pike and the center of the collar it is turned in the working out of all the hollows on the ball will be but common turners work as you will find hereafter this is in brief the theory but to the practice  you must use an hollowmandrel made fit stiffly to receive the convexity of the globe in its concavity so as it may stick firmly in the mandrel in its position and you must take care that in pitching the globe into the mandrel that the imaginary axis of the globe which is the line passing between the two centers of the two opposite circles as aforesaid lie in a straight lie with the axis of the mandrel which you may know by examining whether the circle described with your compasses as aforesaid on the center aforesaid wabble not in a whole revolution of the globe from the point of a tool applied steady to it  having thus pitched the globe true and fixed it fast into the mandrel you must begin to work with the triangular grooving point described in turning   and plate    placing the point of it pretty near the center of the circle and work into the ball with the grooving point and so by degrees make a hollow in the ball so deep and so wide as you think convenient i mean so deep from the superficies of the globe toward the center of the globe and so wide from the center of the circle described on the superficies of the globe toward that circle as it may have a convenient substance between this hole and the next intended to be turned  thus must every one of the eight circles described on the globe be successively by the same rule and after the same manner be pitched outward and fixed into the mandrel and then hollowed out as the first was where note that every hollow is to be turned to the same depth and width exactly as the first was which to do you must use a gage made of a thin plate of iron or brass as is described in plate    fig d whose two sides from a the bottom of the gage to b the shoulder are the depth of the hollow from the superficies of the globe toward the center bb is the width of the hollow at the superficies of the globe and aa is the bottom width of the hollow and the concave arch between aa is an arch that the convexity of the little solid ball to be turned within all the spheres must comply with so that when each hollow is turned the gage must be put into it to try how the sides of the hollow complies with the sides of the gage and also how the arch in the bottom of the gage complies with the surface of the solid ball in the middle  having thus turned all the hallows in the globe you must provide several thin and narrow arching grooving tools whose unequal and concave arches comply both with the convexity and concavity of each globe or sphere to be turned within the outermost so that beginning at the bottom of the hollow you turn just half way of the solid ball loose from the sphere it is contained in viz as far as the equinoctial of the globe and in thus turning it you must take great care that the solid ball on its convexity and the concavity of the sphere it is contained in be both at the ame time turned exactly spherical  thus one half of the solid ball being turned loose you may in like manner turn the next sphere it is included in half loose also and so successively as many spheres as you list  having thus turned one half of all the spheres loose you must take the whole globe out of the hollowmandrel and pitched and fix the globe again into the mandrel so as the imagined axis of the hllow opposite to the last loosned hollow lie in a straight line as before was taught with the pike and center of the collar the mandrel runs in and then turn the other half of the solid ball and spheres also loose as the first hal was turned  xxi to turn a globe with several loose spheres in it and a solid cube or die in the middle of it this is turned after the same manner the frmer ball was turned only instead of diding the equinoctial of that globe into four equal parts the equinoctial of this must be divided but into three equal parts and their semicircle draw through the divisions into either pole of the globe so shall the globe be divided into six equal parts or segments in each of which parts must be described a circle as was described before in the globes of eight equal parts and in these six crcles must be made six hollows as before there was eight but instead of working the bottom of each hollow spherical now the bottom must be wrought flat so shall the cube when these six hollows are thus made be formed and the hollows being exactly of the same depth and flat in the bottom the cube or die will loosen and each of the six flats in the bottom will become the six sides or faces of the cube  the manner of loosning all the other inward spheres is as the former only that was loosned with twice pitching the ball in the mandrel because the centers of the hollows lay opposite to one another but to loosen this ball will require three pitchings into the mandrel because the centers lie not opposite to one another  xxii to turn a cube or die in an hollow globe that shall have but one hole on the outside to work at the outside of this globe must be turned round viz spherical as the former and fixed in an hollow socket as before has been taught then must an hole be turned in the globe so deep and so wide as you please as in the former globes and the bottom of that hole turned flat for one side or face of the cube or die then with a semicircular tool loosen the whole core or middle of the ball and pitch the core with the point opposite to the center of the already flatted face of the die outward against the hole in the globe and so fasten it in this position by pouring in some melted hard wax or other cement and then with a flat tool turn the foreside  viz the side opposite to the first side flat also which done loosen it out of the wax and successively pitch the other sides to be turned flat carefully against the hole so as all the sides have right angles to each other and fastening them with wax or cement as before turn them by the same rule flat also  now to make this thing more admirable to the ignorant spectator you may make the die as big as you can and the hole you turn it at as little as you can that it may the more puzzle the wit of the enquirer to find how so great a die should have entrance at a small hole unless the hollow ball were turned in two halves etc  mechanic exercises or the doctrine of handyworks applied to the art of turning xxiii of turning oval work this work may be performed in the common lathe that goes either with the treddlewheel or the great wheel because the work must run always one way if the puppet be made to it with the machination described in plate    and an iron axis be made to carry the work about and to its end be fitted and fastened a brass collar with a female screw in it to screw on the mandrel that the work you intend to turn is fixed upon  to the foreside of this puppet is fastened at b as on a centerpin a strong iron collar marked bb and this collar is called the moving collar because it moves between the iron shackle cc and the foreside of the puppet into this moing collar is fitted the hollow axis marked c so as to turn round in it as if it were in any of the other collors formerly described but the moving collar moving between the shackles and the foreside of the puppet carries the hollow axis with it athwart the puppet even so far as is the width of the hollow between the shackle and the foreside of the puppet and thus by the moving of the hollow axis backwards and forwards the work screwed in it having an edged or a pointedtool applied to it receives that oval form which is made upon the guide  but to make it move thus to and from you there are required several machinal helps for there is a strong steel bow as at a fastened about its middle part to the further side of the puppet which stands about an inch forwarder than the foreside of the puppet with its hollow side to the workman and to the ends of this steel bow is fastened a strong string of gut and to the middle of that string in a noos is fastened another strong gutstring with a noos at its end this last mentioned string is made exactly of that length that when the nearest side of the guide viz its least diameter is set into the groove of the guidepulley and the bow is strained and this string laid in the groove of the stringpulley the noos at the end of it may be put over the iron button fixed in the top of the movingcoller for then as the treddlewheel carries the axis about the guide being firmly fastened upon the axis comes also about and having the groove of the guidepulley set against the outer edge of the guide as the great diameter of the guide is turned against the guidepulley the movingcoller being drawn by the strength of the bow draws the hollow axis along with it as also the work screwed in the hollow axis and thus as the small diameter of the guide comes to the guide pulley the small diameter of the work is fmed and as the great diameter of the guide comes to the guidepulley the great diameter of the work is formed  this is the sum of oval turning    but that the whole machine may be yet better understood i shall more particularly give you the names of all its parts together with a description upon its most material parts where the forepuppet is more largely delineated in plate    at a where also some of the members most difficult to be described are drawn more at large by themselves  a the bow b the moving collar cc the socket in which the collar is moved d the stopscrew to take out when the hollow axis moves in the movingcoller e the hollow axis f the head in which is contained the several guides g the center head h the button i the stringpulley k the wheelpulley l the guidepulley   of the hollow axis and its shank marked a in plate    the shank is a bar of iron about an inch thick and two foot long having in its further end a centerhole to pitch upon the pike in the further puppet but its hither end is made square to fit tight into a square socket in the brass hollow axis and when it is thus fitted into the hither end of the brass it is turned true cilindrically round so as to fit into the round hole in the moving collar the diameter of the round is about two inches and the length about two inches straight but then a shoulder is turned to the brass cilinder to stop it from sliping through the moving center in the foreend of this hollow axis viz in the brass cilinder is turned a wide hole about an inch and a quarter diameter and an inch deep and in this wide hole is turned a female screw with a course thread to receive a male screw made behind the mandrel that the work is fixed upon  about the middle of this iron shank is placed a pulley made of wainscot board about eight inches diameter and an inch thick with a groove on its outer edge about half an inch wide and half an inch deep for the string of the treddle wheel that carries the axis about to run in and between this pulley you may if you will have several lengths of such malescrews as was described in turning     and plate    to make screws with if you please  see the figure adcb disjunct from the rest of the work  a the hinder end d the pulley of the axis or wheelpulley c the hollow or hole in the foreend of the hollow axis b the shoulder of the hollow axis   of the moving collar marked b in plate    this whole member is called the moving collar though the collar strictly is only the round hole at a into which the hollow axis is fitted it is made of iron to reach from its top at h the button down to the bottom of the cheeks of the lathe as at b upon which pin as on a center the whole moving collar moves backwards and forwards its extreme breadth is about three inches and its thickness above a quarter of an inch its neck at c is clasped but not fixed down to the foreside of the puppet for this neck is only gaged in the shackle marcked c so as the nec and consequently the whole moving collar may slide from end to end of the shackle forwards and backwards d a small female screw into which through a hole in the shackle is fitted a male screw to hold the moving collar and the shackle together that the moving collar may not move when only round work is turned in the collar    of the foreside of the puppet and the shackle marked c under this shackle viz between it and the foreside of the puppet moves the neck of the slidingcoller from a to b when the ends at cc are fixed down to the foreside of the puppet with two iron screws    of the hollow in the puppet marked d in the middle of the puppet is hollowed out a hole about three inches between the fore and backside of the puppet and four inches athwart the cheeks in the puppet and four inches deep so that about an inch of substance remains on each of the four upright sides but the top is quite open as at a through the middle of this square hole runs the iron axis marked bb on which is fixed the several guides that are to be used in this sort of working  it is open at the top that light may be let in to set the guidepulley to which guide you please and it is open on the hither side as at ee about an inch and an half above and below the axis that the guidepulley may be slid on its axis to any of the guides  the guidepulley marked d is a brass pulley of about an inch diameter and a little above a quarter of an inch thick having a groove in the edge of it to receive the edge of the guide it has in its middle a round hole about half an inch diameter which round hole slips over a round iron pin of the same diameter marked ff so as it may slide from one end of the said iron pin to the other according as the guides may be fixed toward either end  when it is used the groove in the edge of this guidepulley is set against the edge of the guide and being fitted tight on the round iron pin aforesaid and the two ends of the iron pin fast fixed into the wood of the puppet the guidepulley may indeed move round on the iron pin but the strength of the iron pin and guidepulley will resist the extuberick parts of the edge of the guide and so with the assistance of the strength of the steel bow force the guide and hollow axis to move backwards and then an edgetool held to the work in the mandrel screwed in the hollow axis will describe the same figure on the work as is on the out edge of the guide  note that when you are at work you must keep the hole in the middle of the guidepulley well oiled as also the round iron pin it slides and turns round upon because this guidepulley ought to run round for then the axis will have and easier and swifter motion though it may indeed perform the work if it run not round upon the iron pin  xxiv of rosework etc rosework turning or works of any other figure are performed by the same rule and after the same manner as oval work is made only by changing the guides and using one whose outer edge is made with the figure or several figures you intend to have on your work  xxv of turning swashwork to the turning of swashwork you must have two such puppets as the forepuppet described in    and also a round swashboard about ten inches diameter and an inch and an half thick as is a in fig b plate    upon both the flat sides of this swashboard in a diametrical line is fastened upright an arch of a quadrant made of a steel plate about half a quarter of an inch thick and an inch and a quarter broad as at bb cc the unequal edges of these quadrants are cut into notches like the teeth of an handsaw that according as you may have occasion to set the swashboard more or less aslope you may be accommodated with a notch or tooth to set it at this swashboard has an hole made about its center to slip over the iron axis and being thus slipped over the iron axis you set it to that slope you intend the swash on your work shall have and to fix it fast in this position you must put the blades of the quadrants into two slits made in the iron axis as at dd and fit the two opposite teeth against the two outer shoulders of the slits  you must moreover make two strong steel springs as at cc to reach from the bottom of the outer sides of the puppets being strong nailed or rather screwed down there which must reach up so high as the axis and in the inner sides of these springs must be made two center holes for the points of the axis to be fitted in for the ovalguide being fitted to one end of the axis and a lowpuppet as at f wedged close to one side of the swashboard when the swashboard stands in its greatest declirity then in a revolution of the axis as the farther part of the circumference of the swashboard comes to the lowpuppet one spring will be forced backwards and the other will spring forwards and an edgdtool held against the work fixed on the axis will make on the work the form of a swash etc  these ovalengines swashengines and all other engines are excellently well made by mr thomas oldfield at the sign of the flowerdeluce

plate    at k there are several other terms used in these exercises of turning not explained here but because they are used in some of the former exercises and there explained i shall referr you to them     mechanic exercises or the doctrine of handyworks applied to the art of bricklayers work definition bricklayerswork is an art manual which joins several bodies so together that they adhere like one entire body  whether the white mason which is the hewer of stone or the red mason which is the hewer of brick be the most ancient i know not but in holy writ we read of making of bricks before we read of digging or hewing of stones therefore we may suppose the red mason or bricklayer to be the most ancient  the method that i shall use in treating of this art shall be this  first i will show what materials they use and their composition  secondly i will treat of their tools and describe their names and uses  thirdly i will declare their method of working both in bricks tiles etc  and first of materials which are comprised under six heads viz   bricks   tiles   mortar   laths   nails   tilepins  of bricks they are made of earth of which the whiteish chalky sort of earth and the redish are the best  at lunenburg in saxony they make them of a fat earth full of allom also there are good bricks made at pitane in asia of a pumice sort of earth which being dried will swim in water and not sink  likewise the ancients made them of earth which was sandy  but here in england they are made for the most part of a yellowish colored fat earth somewhat redish  and they are made of several sorts and sizes in holland they make small ones being about six inches long three inches broad and one inch in thickness  which sort of bricks is commonly used here in england to pave yards or stables withal and they make a good pavement and are very durable and being laid edgeways looks handsomely especially if laid herringbone fashion  they are also used in soapboilers fats and in making of cisterns the common bricks that are made here in england are nine inches in length four inches and in breadth and two and an half in thickness and sometimes three inches thick  most counties in england afford earth for the making of bricks but the best earth that we have in england for making of bricks is in the county of kent from whence we have most of the bricks which are rubbed and hewed for the ornaments of the chief fronts in the city of london the ornamental part of which fronts are done with the reddest bricks they can pick from among them and the rough or plain work is done with the gray kentish bricks also those gray kentish bricks are used in making of cisterns to hold water and horseponds and also fats for soapboilers and i am of the opinion that no time will impair or decay those gray kentish bricks but as pliny says speaking of bricks that they will last to eternity  there are also in most counties of england bricks made for the paving of floors of rooms cellers daryhouses etc which are made of a stronger sort of earth than the common bricks for building the earth being a kind of clay and in some countries are called clay bricks which are dearer than the ordinary bricks by about six shillings in a thousand  likewise in several counties but chiefly in surrey are made paving tiles of three several magnitudes the largest sort being twelve inches long and twelve broad and one inch and an half in thickness  the second sort are ten inches long and ten inches broad and one inch and a quarter thick  the third sort are eight inches long eight broad and one inch thick  either of which sorts being polished or rubbed with sharp sand on the surface and the joints made exactly square and the sides equal by hewing them with a brick ax and rubbing them on a rubbing stone with sharp sand maes an excellent pavement and pleasing to the eye especially when laid arris ways  having thus described the several sorts of bricks and also paving tiles we come in the next place to treat of tiles made and used in the covering of roofs of houses both public and particular of which are four sorts or kinds  the first sort are called plains tiles being made of a strong sort of earth like clay and are or should be ten inches and an half in length in breadth six inches and a quarter and in thickness three quarters of an inch  the second sort are gutter or hip tiles which are used sometimes for valleys and hips of rooffs although here at london the valleys are commonly tiled with plain tiles and the hips with ridge or as some call them roof toiles these gutter tiles are in length ten inches and an half with convenient breadth and thickness accordingly and are made circular or hollow and wider at one end than at the other  the third sort are ridge or roof tiles being in length thirteen inches and made circular breadthways like an half cylinder whose diameter is about ten inches or more and about half an inch and half a quarter in thickness these are laid upon the upper parr or ridge of the roof and also on the hips  the fourth sort are pantiles being about thirteen inches long with a nob or button to hang on the laths and are made hollow or circular breadthways being eight inches in breadth and about half an inch in thickness or somewhat more the best sort of these are brought from holland into england and are called flemmish pantiles we having such tiles made here in england but not so good which flemmish tiles are sometimes glazed and are of a lead or bluish color and being glazed they are very durable and handsome  having done with the description of tiles for the covering of roofs we come in the next place to treat of mortar and first of lime being the chief material of which the mortar is made for the cementing or joining of tiles as well as bricks together we will treat of it in the first place  of lime there are two sorts one made of stone which is the strongest and the other of chalk both sorts being burnt in a kilne  the lime that is made of soft stone or chalk is useful for plastering of seelings and walls within doors or on the insides of houses and that made of hard stone is fit for structures or buildings and plastering without doors or on the out side of buildings that lies in the weather and that which is made of greasy clammy stone is stronger than that made of lean poor stone and that which is made of spongy stone is lighter than that made of firm and close stone that is again more commodious for plastering this for building  also very good lime may be made of millstone not course and sandy but fine and greasy  likewise of all kinds of flints but they are hard to burn except in a reverbratory kilne except those that are roled in the water because a great part of its increase goes away by a kind of glass  but the shells of fish as of cockles oysters  are good to burn for lime  and the fire in lime burnt asswages not but lies hid so that it appears to be cold but water excites it again whereby it slacks and crumbles into fine powder  lime also is useful in diverse things for it is useful in oils and wines and good to manure land with some season new wine with it mittigating the unpleasantness of the wine therewith  moreover quick lime being cast into an arched vault and water thrown upon it consumes dead bodies put therein  also diers and tanners and likewise physicians use it but they choose the newest to wit that which is newly drawn out of the kiln and not slackd with water or air  it will burn so vehemently that it makes crusts and will fire boards or timber against which it lies but being slackt for sometime it burns no more yet it warms and dries and dissolves flesh and being washed three or four times it bites or eats not but dries quickly  lime mixed with sand is much used in buildings and vitruvius says that you may put three parts of sand that is dug or pit sand and one part of lime to make mortar but if the sand be taken out of a river or out of the sea then two parts thereof and one of lime as also to river to seasand if you put a third part of powder of tiles or bricks to wit tile o brick dust it works the better  but vitruvius his proportion of sand seems too much although he should mean the lime before it is slacked for one bushel of lime before it is slackd will be five pecks after it is slackd  here at london where for the most part our lime is made of chalk we put about thirty six bushels of pitsand to twenty five bushels o quicklime that is about one bushel and half of sand to one bushel of lime  and lime mixed with sand and made into mortar if it lie in an heap two or three years before it is used it will be the stronger and better and the reason of so many insufficient buildings is the using of the mortar as soon as it is made as agricola says  moreover there is other mortar used in making of watercourse cisterns fish ponds etc which is very hard and durable as may be seen at rome at this day which is called maltha from a kind of bitumen dug there for as they build most firm walls thereof naturally so they use it in making of cisterns to hold water and all manner of waterworks and also in finishing or plastering of fronts to represent stone  and i find two kinds of artifices used by the ancients both of which is compounded of lime and hogs grease but to one is added the juice of figs and to the other liquid pitch and the lumps of lime are first wet or slackd with wine then pounded or beat with hogs grease and juice of figs or with the same pitch that which has pitch in it is blacker and easily distingushed from the other by its color and that which is plastered with this tarrace is done over with linseed oil  metalists use a kind of tarrace in their vessels for fining of metals that the melted mettle run not out for as the moderns restrain water and contain it so the ancients this liquid metal and it is compounded or made of quicklime and ox blood the lime being beat to powder and sifted and then mixed with the blood and bea with a beater  but their cement differs from both the malths in composition and use for it is made of dust or powder of marble and glue made of bull or ox leather and with this they glue pieces of marble or stones together  in latter times two kinds of cement are in use in both which they use the powder of marble or other stone to one is added the whites of eggs to the other is added pitch to these some add other things as the gravers of gems they make it of tile dust and pitch  another material which bricklayers use are laths which are made of heart of oak for out side work as tiling and plastering and of fir for inside plastering and pantile lathing their usual lengths being   foot and   foot and sometimes longer or shorter their breadth sometimes   inches and one inch and an half the thickness about of an inch or thicker but for pantiling the laths are about ten foot long one inch and half broad and half an inch or more thick  another material is nails of which they use three sorts one is called reparation or lath nails which are used for plain tile lathing and outside and inside lathing for plastring another sort are four penny and six penny nails used for pantile lathing and a third sort are great nails for scaffolding  moreover they use tilepins which are sometimes made of oak and sometimes of fir which they drive into holes that are made in the plain tiles to hang them upon their lathing  they also put ox or cow hair into the mortar which they use for plastering being called lime and hair which hair keeps the mortar from cracking or chaping and makes it hold or bind together  and whereas they make use of the sharpest sand they can get that being best for mortar to lay bricks and tiles in so they chose a fat loamy or greasy sand for inside plasterning by reason it sticks together and is not so subject to fall assunder when they lay it on selings or walls  having given you an account of the several materials that are used in bricklayers work we shall in the next place treat of their tools and their uses which are as follows  tools used in brick work   a brick trowel to take up the mortar with and to spread it on the bricks with which also they cut the bricks to such lengths as they have occasion and also stop the joints    a brick ax with which they cut bricks to what shape they please as some for arches both straight and circular others for the mouldings of architecture as archytrave friez and cornice    a saw made of tinn to saw the bricks which they cut    a rubstone which is round and is about fourteen inches diameter and sometimes more or less at pleasure on which they rub the bricks which they cut into several shapes and also others which they cut not being called rubbed returns and rubbed headers and stretchers    a square to try the bed of the brick  viz that side which lies in the mortar with the superficies or face of the brick to make the brick square or at rectangles one side with the other which is done by rubing it on the rubstone till it exactly answers or fits to the square    a bevel by which they cut the undersides of the bricks of arches straight or circular to such oblique angles as the arches require and also for other uses    a small trannel of iron or a large nail groundd to a sharp point with which they mark the brick either from a square or bevel or a mould made of thin wainscot or pastboard to direct them in the cutting thereof    some use a float stone with which they rub the moulding of the brick after they have cut it with the ax pretty near to the pattern described on the brick by the trannel from the wainscot or pastboard mould that so they may make the brick exactly to answer to the pattern or mould others use no stone at all but cut the brick exactly to the pattern with their brickax leaving the ax strokes to be seen on the brick which if they be straight and parallel one to another look very prettily and is the truest way of working but then they must take care to ax the brick off with an ax that is exactly straight on the edge that the moulding in the brick be neither round nor hollow from side to side of a header or from end to end of a stretcher    a little ruler about    inches in length and   inch and broad which they lay on the brick to draw straight lines by with the trannel or nail   0 a banker to cut the bricks upon which is a piece of timber about six foot long or more according to the number of those who are to work at it and   or  0 inches square which must be laid on two piers of brick or fixed on bearers of timber about three foot high from the floor on which they stand to work     they work up a pier of brickwork about the same height to lay their rubbingstore upon which must be laid in mortar that it may lie fast     a grindingstone to sharpen their axes hammers trowels etc upon     a pair of line pins of iron with a length of line on them about sixty feet in length to lay each row or course of bricks level on the bed and straight on the surface by a line seldom holding to strein or draw straight in length above  0 or  0 feet     a plumb rule about   foot long with a line and plumet of lead to carry their work upright or perpendicular withal     a level about  0 or    foot long to set out their foundations level or parallel to the horizon and also to try whether the walls of the building or jambs of chimneys be carried level as they raise the work that so they may bring up all their brickwork to an exact horizontal height at the laying on of ever floor of carpentry     a large square to set their walls at rectangles which may also be done without a square by setting   foot from the angle one way and   foot the other way then if the diagonal line or hypotenuse be exactly  0 feet the angle is a rectangle if not you must set the wall that is to be at rectangles to the other either this or that way till the two measures of   and   feet answer exactly to  0 feet     a ten foot and a five foot rod as also a two foot rule to take and lay down lengths and breadths and heights     a jointing rule about  0 foot long and about   inches broad whereby to run the long joints of the brickwork     a jointer of iron with which and the foresaid rule they joint the long joints and also the cross joints these being done with the jointer without the rule   0 compasses to describe the several mouldings on wainscot or pastboard     a hammer to cut holes in brickwork and drive nails for scarfolding     a rammer to ram the foundations     a crow of iron to dig through a wall and also a pickax  the manner and shapes of the aforesaid tools you may see in plate   and the name of each tool in the page next the plate wherein they are delineated  the names and uses of tools relating to tyling   a lathing hammer to nail on the laths withal with two gauge strokes for lathing for tyling cut upon the handle of it one at   inches from the head and the other at   inches and an half some indeed lath at   inches but that is too wide occasioning rainings in    a lathing staff of iron in the form of a cross to stay the cross laths while they are nailed to the long laths and also to clinch the nails    a tyling trowel to take up the mortar and lay it on the tiles it being longer and narrower than a bricktrowel although for a shift many times they use a bricktrowel to tyle withal when they have not a tylingtrowel    a bosse made of wood with an iron hook to hang on the laths or on a ladder in which the labourer puts the mortar which the tyler uses    a striker which is only a piece of lath about  0 inches long with which they strike or cut off the mortar at the britches of the tiles    a broom to sweep the tyling after it is struck  of the names and uses of tools relating to plastering   a lathing hammer being the same as before in tyling with which the laths are nailed on with its head and with its edge they cut them to any length and likewise cut off any part of a qurter or joyst that sticks further out than the rest    a laying trowel to lay the lime and hair withal upon the laths it being larger than a brick trowel and fastened its handle in a different manner from the brick trowel    a hawke made of wood about the bigness of a square trencher with a handle to hold it by whereon the lime and hair being put they take from it more or less as they please    a setting trowel being less than the laying trowel with which they finish the plastering when it is almost dry either by trowelling and brishing it over with fair water or else by laying a thin coat of fine stuff made of clean lime and mixed with hair without any sand and setting it that is to say trowelling and brishing it    a small pointing trowel to go into sharp angles    brishes of three sorts viz a stock brish a round brish and a pencil with these brishes they wet old walls before they mend them and also brish over their new plastering when they set or finish it and moreover white and size their plastering with them the pencil or drawing tool is used in blacking the bottoms or lower ports of rooms etc    floats made of wood with handles to them which they sometimes use to float seelings or walls with when they are minded to make their plastering very straight and even these floats being some larger and some lesser than the laying trowels likewise they use floats made to fit to mouldings for the finishing of several sorts of mouldings with finishing mortar to represent stone such as cornices facias archytraves etc  the finishing mortar to represent stone should be made of the strongest lime and the sharpest sand you can get which sand must be washed in a large tub very well till no scum or filth arise in the water when you stir it about which sometimes will require to have water   or   times when the sand is somewhat foul and it requires a greater proportion of sand than the ordinary mortar because it must be extremely beaten which will break all the knots of lime and by that means it will require more sand    straight rules of several lengths to lay quines straight by and also to try whether the plastering be laid true and straight by applying the rules to their work    a pale to hold water or whitewash or white and size   0 some use a budget or pocket to hang by their sides to put their nails in when they lath and others tuck and tie up their aprons and put the nails therein  having given you a description of the several tools and uses there are some things yet remaining which though they cannot be properly called tools yet they are utensils without which they cannot well perform their work  and they are   ladders of several lengths as standardladders two story and one story ladders etc    fir poles of several lengths for standards and ledgers for scaffolding    putlogs which are pieces of timber or short poles about   foot long which lies from the leggers into their brickwork to bear the boards they stand on to work and to lay bricks and mortar upon    fir boards about  0 foot long and any breadth but commonly about a foot broad because for the most part four of them in breadth makes the breadth of the scaffold which boards ought to be one inch and or two inches in thickness although commonly they make use of some which are not above one inch thick which are sometimes subject to break especially when the putlogs lie far asunder from one another    chords which should be well pitched to preserve them from the weather and rotting with which they fasten the ledgers to the standards or upright poles    sieves of several sorts some larger others lesser some finer others courser to sift the lime and sand withal before they wet it into mortar or lime and hair    a loamehook beater shovel pickax basket and hod which commonly belong to bricklayers laborers and may be called the laborers tools    a skreen made of boards and wire which performs the office of a sieve and with which one man will skreen as much lime mixed with sand or rubish as two men can with a sieve    boards or tubs to put the mortar in  and except my memory fails me these are all or the most usual tools and utensils which they make use of  having now given you an account of their several materials together with their necessary tools and utensils we shall proceed in the next place to treat of the method of working which is various some working after a better method and more concisely than others  and first of foundations it is usual and also very convenient for any person before he begins to erect a building to have designs or draughts drawn upon paper or vellum and also if it be a large building to have a model of it made in wainscot in which designs and model the ground plat or ichnography of each floor or story is delineated and represented as also the fashion and form of each front together with the windows doors and ornaments if they intend any to wit facias rustic quines architraves friezes and cornices are to be shown in the draughts or designs of the uprights or orthographyes  if more fronts than one be shown perspectively in one draught then it is called scenography which is not easily understood except by those who understand the rules of perspective  therefore it will be more intelligible to the several workmen to have a draught of each front in a paper by it self and also to have a draught of the groundplat or ichnography of every story in a paper by it self because many times the conveniences or contrivances in one story differs from those in another either in bigness of chimneys or division of the rooms some being larger in one story than another and sometimes having more chimnies in one story than in another etc  all which things being well considered and drawn on papers or a model made thereof before the building is begun there will be no need of alterations or tearing and pulling the building to pieces after it is begun for besides the hindrance of the procedure of the work it makes the building lame and deficient nothing being so well done when it is put up and pulled down and set up again as if it were well done at first  besides it makes the workmen uneasy to see their work in which they have taken a great deal of pains and used a great deal of art to be pulled to pieces  the drawing of draughts is most commonly the work of a surveyor although there be many master workmen that will contrive a building and draw the designs thereof as well and as curiously as most surveyors yea some of them will do it better than some surveyors especially thse workmen who understand the theorick pa of building as well as the practick  mechanic exercises or the doctrine of handyworks and now concerning the foundations after the cellars are dug if there are to be any or if none after the trenches are dug in which the walls are to stand the masterbricklayer or else his foreman which ought to be an ingenious workman must in the first place try all the foundations in several places with an iron croe and rammer or indeed with a borer such as welldiggers use to try what ground they have to produce water to see whether the foundations are all sound and fit to bear the weight which is to be set upon them if he find any part of the foundations defective he ought to dig it deeper till he comes to firm ground or if it proves to be loose or made ground to a great depth then he must take care to make it good and sufficient to carry its weight by art which may be done several ways  first if the foundation be not very lose and insufficient it may be made good by ramming in great stones with a heavy rammer the stones being placed close together and about a foot wider on each side of the trench than the width of the wall is to be because all walls ought to have a basis or footing at least   inches on a side broader than the thickness of the wall which stones being well rammed and the basis being   inches more in breadth than the thickness of the wall and this   inches being set off about one inch or one inch and an half at a time on both sides that so the middle of the wall may stand on the middle of the basis may make the foundation good and able to bear its burden  but if the foundation be somewhat worse than as aforesaid then he must get good pieces of oak whose length must be the breadth of the trench or about two foot longer than the breadth of the wall which must be laid cross the foundation about foot asunder and being well rammed down lay long planks upon them which planking need not be the length of the cross pieces but only   inches of a side wider than the basis or footing of the wall is to be and pined or spiked down to the pieces of oak on which they lie  but if the foundations be so bad that this will not do then he must provide good piles made of heart of oak of such a length as will reach ground whose diameter must be about     part of their length which must be drove or forced down with a commander or an engine for that purpose and then lay long planks upon them and spike or pin the planks to them and the closer together that these piles are drove the better it will be  moreover if the foundation be faulty but in here and there a place and there be good ground in the other parts of it you may turn arches over those insufficient places which will discharge and take off the weight from the loose places  and when you make these arches to shun the difficulty of the earth and to save the charge of expense they must be made of bricks and mortar that are very good and be well wrought that they do neither settle nor give way  you may observe for the greater strength of these arches or discharges to make them higher than a semicircle or half round if the work will admit of it and to make the same of portions of arches as in plate   fig   you may see they are described from an equilateral triangle that is to say supposing the breadth of the arch between the piers to be ab with this width and from the points a and b make the two portions of the arches ac and bc this rising so high adds great strength to the arches to resist or carry the weight which they are to bear  the ancient architect leon baptista albert advises when the earth on which we would make pillars or piers is of equal resistance that is to say not good to turn arches inversed or upside down and says by this means one pillar shall bear no more weight than another when the earth that is underneath is not so strong or that it bears more than another part which he does thus  having wrought up the pillars or piers as high as is necessary from the foundation make from these piers inverse arches as abc in plate   fig   whose joints tend to the center d    by this construction he pretends for example that if the pier f has a worse foundation or has a greater weight that is to say is more charged than the other piers this charge or weight will be stopped or stayed by the inverse arches abc ihk because the earth which is under these arches keeps the piers in the same height that is to say that they shall not sink  but he must also suppose that this earth is as firm as that of the foundation of the piers or at least it must be made so  the ingenious surveyor mr hook made use of this artifice as i am informed in building the lord montagues brave house in bloomsbury in the county of middlesex and where he was then surveyor  the foundation being all made firm and levelled the masterbricklayer or his foreman must take care to see all the foundations set truly out according to the design of the groundplat or cellarfloor and that all his walls be made of the same thickness as they are in the design which is very difficult to do to wit to take the true thickness of the walls from a design that is drawn to a small scale because the breadth of the points of the compasses will vary somewhat therefore it is advisable for him that draws the draught to set the dimensions in figures to each wall chimney window etc and then the workman cannot so easily make a mistake  and because the wellworking and bonding of brickwalls conduces very much to their strength i will here add some some necessary rules to be observed in the laying of bricks to make the walls and strong and durable  first that the mortar be made of well burnt good lime and sharp sand and that it have a due proportion of sand that is to say if it be very sharp a load of sand being about    bushels is sufficient for an hundred of lime being    bushels or an hundred pecks for i imagine that the word hundred of lime is used because it contains an hundred pecks and that in old time they used to sell it by the peck but now by the bushel to wit to one bushel of quick lime a bushel and half of sand  but if the sand be not very sharp then you may put a greater quantity of sand for mortar which has its due proportion of sand is stronger than that which has less sand in it although some think otherwise  secondly when you slack the lime take care to wet it every where a little but do not overwet it and cover with sand every laying or bed of lime being about a bushel at a time as you slack it up that so the stream or spirit of the lime may be kept in and not flee away but mix it self with the sand which will make the mortar much stronger than if you slack all your lime first and throw on your sand altogether at last as some use to do  thirdly that you beat all your mortar with a beater three or four times over before you use it for thereby you break all the knots of lime that go through the sieve and incorporate the sand and lime well together and the air which the beater forces into the mortar at every stroke conduces very much to the strength thereof  if i might advise any one that is minded to build well or use strong mortar for repairs i would have them beat the mortar well and let it lie   or   days and then beat it well again when it is to be used  fourthly if you lay bricks in hot dry weather and be it some small piece of work that you would have very strong dip every brick you lay all over in a pale of water which will make the wall much stronger than if the bricks were laid dry the reason why i mention a small piece of work is because it is a great deal of trouble to wet them for much work or a whole building and besides it makes the workmens fingers sore to prevent which they may throw pales of water on the wall after the bricks are laid as was done at the building of physicians college in warwick lane by order of the surveyor which was the aforesaid ingenious mr hook if i mistake not  fifthly cover all your walls in the summertime to keep them from drying too hastily for the mortar does not cement so strngly to the bricks when it dries hastily as when slowly  sixthly be sure to cover them very well in the wintertime to preserve them from rain snow and frost which last is a great enemy to all kinds of mortar especially to that which has taken wet just before the frost  seventhly in working up the walls of a building do not work any wall above   foot high before you work up the next adjoining wall that so you may join them together and make good bond in the work for it is an ill custom among some bricklayers to carry or work up a whole story of the partywalls before they work up the fronts or other work adjoining that should be bonded or worked up together with them which occasions cracks and setlings in the walls  eighthly take care that you do not lay joint on joint in the middle of the walls as seldom as may be but make bond there as well as on the outsides for i have seen some who in working of a brick and half wall have laid the header on one side of the wall upright upon the header on the other side of the wall and so all along through the whole course which indeed necessarily follows from the inconsiderate setting up of the quine at a toothing for it is common to tooth in the stretching course two inches with the stretcher only and the header on the other side to be set upright upon the header on this side which causes the headers to lie joint in joint in the middle of the wall as in plate   fig   you may see  whereas if the header of one side of the wall toothed as much as the stretcher on the other side it would be a stronger toothing and the joints of the headers of one side would be in the middle of the headers of the course they lie upon of the other side as in plate   fig    all that can be said for this ill custom of working is this that the header will not well hang two inches over the bricks underneath it i grant it will not but then it may be made by having a piece of fir or any other wood of the thickness of a course of bricks and two inches broad and lay it on the last toothing course to bear it or a bat put upon the last toothing will bear it till the next quine is set upon it and then the bat may be taken away  ninthly the same inconveniency happens at an upright quine in a brick and half wall where it is usual to lay a closier next the header on both sides of the wall and in so doing it is joint in joint all the length of the wall except by chance a three quartern bat happen to be laid  to prevent which inconveniency and to make the wall much stronger lay a closure on one side and none on the other but lay a three quarter bat at the quine in the stretching course and in the heading course adjoin an header next to the header at the quine as you may see it done in plate   fig   and    where a and b in both figures or diagrams represents a brick and half wall having an upright quine at a and a toothing at b and the prick lines represents the course of bricks laid upon the other course so in fig   the black lines next you are an heading course and the pricklines next you show a stretching course and on the further side from you the black lines show a stretching course and the pricklines an heading course  in which fig   is shown the usual way of bad working but in fig   is shown the true way it should be wrought to be made firm and strong  also in working a two brick wall i would advise in the stretching courses wherein you lay stretching on both sides the wall next the line so also to lay stretching in the middle of the wall and closiers next to each stretching course that lies next the line as in fig   of plate   you may see  where the diagram or fig ab signifies a two rick wall a being an upright quine and b the toothing in which the black lines represent the stretching course and the pricked lines the heading course that lies upon the stretching course in a two brick wall if you lay a closier next the upright quine on both sides of the wall it makes good bond  tenthly in summer time use your mortar as soft as you can but in the winter time pretty stiff or hard  eleventhly if you build in the city of london you must make all your walls of such thicknesses as the act of parliament for rebuilding of the said city enjoins but in other places you may use your discretion  and because the act of parliament may not be in every builders hands i will therefore incert so much of it as relates to bricklyers work to wit the heights and number of stories and the thickness of walls of the four several sorts of buildings which is as follows  and be it further enacted that the said houses of the first and least sort of building fronting by streets or lanes as aforesaid shall be of two stories high besides cellars and garrats that the cellars thereof   foot and an half high if the springs of water hinder not and the first story be   foot high from the floor to the seeling and the second story   foot high from the floor to the seeling that all walls in front and rear as high as the first story be o the full thickness of the length of two bricks and thence upwards to the garrats of the thickness of one brick and an half and that the thickness of the garrat walls on the back part be left to the discretion of the builder so that the same be not less than the length of one brick and also that the thickness of the party walls between these houses of the first and lesser sort of building be one brick and as high as the said garrats and that the thickness of the party wall in the garrat be of the thickness of the length of one brick at the least  and be further enacted that the houses of the second sort of building fronting streets and lanes of note and the river of thames shall consist of three stories high besides cellars and garrats as aforesaid that the cellars thereof e   foot and high if the springs hinder not that the first story contain full  0 foot in height from the floor to the seeling the second full  0 foot the third   foot that all the said walls in front and rear as high as the first story be two bricks and thick and from thence upwards to the garrat floor of one brink and thick and the thickness of the garrat walls on the back part be left to the discreation of the builder so that the same be not less than one brick thick and also that the thickness of the partywalls between every house of this second and larger sort of building be two bricks thick as high as the first story and thence upwards to the garrats of the thickness of one brick and  also that the houses of the third sort of buildings fronting the high and principle streets shall consist of   stories high besides cellars and garrats as aforesaid that the first story contain full  0 foot in height from the floor to the seeling the second  0 foot and the third   foot the fourth   foot and that all the said walls in front and rear as high as the first story be of two bricks and in thickness and from thence upwards to the garrat floor of the thickness of one brick that the thickness of the garrat walls on the back part be left  the discretion of the builder so as the same be not less than one brick and also that the partywalls between every house of this third and larger sort of building be two bricks thick as high as the first floor and thence upwards to garrat floor the   brick in thickness  and be it further enacted that all houses of the fourth sort of building being mansion houses and of the greatest bigness not fronting upon any of the streets or lanes as aforesaid the number of stories and the height thereof shall be left to the discretion of the builder so as he exceeds not four stories  also the same act enjoins that no timber be laid within    inches of the foreside of the chimny jambs and that all joysts on the back of any chimny be laid with a trimmer at six inches distant from the back also that no timber be laid within the tunnel of any chimny upon penalty to the workman for every default ten shillings and ten shillings every week it continues unreformd  twelfthly when you lay any timber on brickwork as torsels for mantletrees to lie on or lintols over windows or templets under girders or any other timbers lay them in loam which is a great preserver of timber for mortar eats and corrodes the timber likewise the joyst ends and girders which lie in the walls must be loamed all over to preserve them from the corroding of the mortar some workmen pitch the ends of the timber that lie in the walls to preserve them from the mortar  in the next place you shall have the ground plat of a building and its explanation in plate   you have the draught of a ground plat of a building which is    feet both in the front and rear front and  0 feet in the flank or depth the front and rear front walls are   bricks and in thickness the flank walls are   bricks in thickness as you may prove by the scale of feet and inches annexed to the design  you may imagine this design to be the ground floor having no cellar beneath it and the height of the story between the floor and the seeling to be  0 foot and because we do suppose this building to have houses adjoining it on each side therefore we have drawn the staircase with an open nuel to give light to the stairs but if the house had stood by it self without other houses adjoining then we might have had light to the stairs from the flank wall  explanation of the design f the

to show the inches in a foot for example if you would take of   inches take the interval from   in the horizontal line to the diagonal line and that is   inches from   in the horizontal line to the diagonal line is   inches and so of the rest  in the next plate you have the orthography or upright of this ground plat and this the explanation thereof with a scale of feet and inches annexed thereto explanation of plate   a the watertable b first fascia c second fascia d three plain courses of bricks over the arches e cornice f chimnies g gableend h straight arches w shas frames s shas lights k doorcase l windowlighte over the door       the scale of feet and inches being the same as in the ground plat of plate   i need not say any thing concerning it because i have there shown the use of it  and although i have in this design drawn the fascias plain without any mouldings yet sometimes they are made with mouldings which show very neat and handsome i have therefore in plate   given you a design of a brick fascia wrought with mouldings in which design s is scima reversa o joints of mortar p plain courses a astragal b ovolo or boltel reversed   in the same plate you have the design of a brick cornice and the names of the mouldings are a scima recta or ogee o joint of mortar b scima reversa or scimatium c corona or plancheer d ovolo or boltel e cavetto or casement   in which cornice the corona or plancher ought according to the rules of architecture to sail over or project more but the length of a brick being but about   inches when its head is rubbed for hewing it will not hang if it sail over more than is shown in the draught which is about   inches and an half but if you would make it to project more then you must cement pieces to the ends of your bricks for railing or to make them longer of which cement there is two sorts one is called cold cement and the other is hot the making and use whereof we will show toward the latter end  to describe mouldings on wainscot or pastboard for patterns to cut bricks by there are two ways to describe the hollows and rounds of moulding in fascias or cornices one from the oxi or oxigonium the other from the half round or semicircle that makes the moulding flatter this more circular i will show both ways and then you may make use of which you please  first we will describe a cavetto or casement both ways  in plate   the fig   is described from the oxi in this manner having allowed the projecture of the moulding at the bottom and the fillet at top draw the line ab then with the compasses taking the interval ab place one point of the compasses in a and with the other describe the arch dd then with one foot in b with the other describe the arch cc and where these two arches intersect each other there is the center to describe the cavetto then fixing one foot in the center extend the other to a or b and describe the arch agb  you may describe it from a semicircle thus in fig   having allowed the projecture at bottom and the fillet at top as before draw the line ab bisect or middle it as at c then upon c as a center with the interval ca or cb describe the semicircle adb and bisect it in d which is the center to describe the cavetto or casement by then fixing one point of the compasses in d extend the other to a or b and describe the arch agb  to describe the scima recta or ogee both ways fig   is described by the oxi in this manner having allowed the fillet at top af draw the line ab and bisect it that is part it in the middle in e then with your compasses take the interval eb and fixing one point in e with the other describe the arch cc then with the same interval or distance fixing one point in b with the other describe the arch dd and where these two arches intersect or cut each other there is the center to discribe the round or lower part of the ogee to wit ehb then fixing one point of the compasses on the intersection by d extend the other to b or e and describe the arch ehb then to describe the hollow or upper part of the ogee take with your compasses the distance or interval ea and fixing one point in e with the other describe the arch cc then keeping the compasses at the same distance fix one foot in a and with the other describe the arch dd intersecting the other arch in g then fixing one foot in g extend the other to e or a and describe the arch eha which compleats the scima recta or ogee  to describe the same ogee by a semicircle fig     after you have allowed the fillet af draw the line ab    bisect the line in s    bisect eb and sa as at cc    on the center c with the interval ca describe the semicircle sda    middle it as at d    fixing one point in d extend the other to a or s and describe the arch ahs    on the center c with the distance cb describe the semicircle bds    middle it as at d    fix one foot in d and extend the other to b or s   0 describe the arch bhs which compleats the scima recta or ogee and after either of these ways which you like best you may describe any other moulding  and because many times bricklayers make archytrave jambs and arches about windows and doorcases in a front i will therefore delineat an archytrave to be cut in the length of a brick which is most usual although you may make your archytrave larger and cut it in the length of one brick and an half  in plate   fig   you have delineated the ground plat of an archytrave jamb to be cut in the length of a brick which suppose to be fg and also imagine feg to be a stretcher or a stretching archytrave also you may understand the design to be divided in the middle by the two prick lines on each side e which represents a joint of mortar and imagining it to be thus divided then of is called a header or a heading archytrave and eg is called a ak  here follows the names of the several parts of the archytrave a fillet b scima c upper fascia d lower fascia i did intend here to have added something about the arching of vaults but intending god willing to treat largely of the description of all manner of arches and making of moulds or patterns to cut them by when i come to exercise in masonry which will succeed this i shall therefore omit speaking of vaults in this exercise  i shall now in the next place show how to describe any ellipsis arch in brick and make the moulds as also to describe straight arches and make the moulds for the same  to describe an oval to any length and breadth given an ellipsis arch is an half oval therefore in plate   fig   let the length given be ab and the breadth cd  apply the two given lines together so that they may cut each other into two equal parts and at right angles in the point e then take half the line ab between your compasses and setting one point of the compasses in c extend the other till it touch the line ab in k and l which two points are called the focasses o burning points in which points drive two nails if you describe it on boards but upon paper as here two pins will do the pins being stuck fast in the points k and l stick also another pin in the point c then take a thread and encompass these   pins in form of a triangle pulling the thread tight tie the two ends of the thread together by a knot at c then taking out the pin at c take a pencil of blacklead holding it close to the inside of the thread and carrying the pencil round upon the paper about the pins with the thread always straight the ellipsis or oval acbd will be thereby described  another way to describe the same here i shall only describe a semioval being an ellipsis arch in fig   let the length given be ab and the semidiameter or height of the arch cd divide ab into seven equal parts then upon one seventh part from a as at e raise a perpendicular from the line ab viz eg also at one seventh part from b as at f raise another perpendicular fh then divide the semidiameter given cd into    equal parts and take eleven of those parts and set upon the perpendicular from e to g and likewise from f to h then taking the space between a and g setting one point of the compasses in a describe the arch g i keeping the compasses at the same distance set one point in g and describe another arch which will cut the former in the point by i from which point with the radius a i describe the hanse ag this being done take between your compasses the space bh and setting one point in b describe the arch i i then remove your compasses to h and intersect that arch in the point by i then setting your compasses on the point i with the same distance describe a part of the ellipsis bh which is called the hanse the other part to be described from g to h is called the scheam which to describe continue or draw longer the semidiameter dc and in that line find a center whereon setting one point of the compasses the other point may touch the three points gdh as on the center i whereby describe the scheam gdh which was to be done  these ellipsis or semioval arches being neatly wrought in brick show very pleasant and are sometimes made over gateways and also over kitchinchimnies instead of mantletrees  we will suppose an ellipsis arch to be made over a chimny whose diameter between the jambs is eight feet and the under side of the arch at the key to rise in height    inches from the level of the place whence you begin to spring the arch the height or depth of the arch we will suppose to be made of the length of two bricks which when they are cut to the sweep of the arch will not contain above    inches and perhaps you must cement pieces to many of the courses in the hanse to make them long enough to contain or hold    inches especially if you intend to make the courses of the hanse and the courses of the scheam to seem alike in greatness on the under side of the arch for if you make the hanse to come to a true sommering for the scheam by that time that you have ended the hanse and are ready to set the first courses of the scheam the mould and so likewise each course in the hanse will be much less at the lower part or under side of the arch than the mould or courses of the scheam as you may perceive by the hanse bk in the  d fig which way of working these kind of arches is stronger than to make the courses seem alike in bigness in hanse and scheam although it be not so pleasing to the eye in the  d fig i will show how to make one half of the arch this way and in the other half show how to make the courses in hanse and scheam of a bigness  first describe the under side of the arch  viz the ellipsis adb whose diameter ab is eight feet and the height cd    inches upon some smooth floor or straight plaistered wall or such like then continue  viz draw longer both the lines ab cd cutting each other at right angles then from a to e also from b to f likewise from d to g set    inches the intended height of your arch then describe another ellipsis to that length and height after this manner lay a straight ruler on the center by i and on the joining of the hanse and the scheam together as at k and draw the line kl then set one point of your compasses in the center of the hanse at m and open the other point of the compasses to f and describe the upper hanse fl likewise setting one point of the compasses in the center by i with the other extended to g describe the scheam gl although i speak here of compasses yet when you describe an arch to its full bigness you must make use of center lines or rules the last are best because lines are subject to stretch then taking between your compasses the thickness of a brick abating some small matter which will be rubbed off from both beds of the brick with the compasses at this distance divide the upper hanse from l to f into equal parts and if they happen not to divide it into equal parts then open them a small matter wider or shut them a small matter closer till it does divide it into equal parts and look how many equal parts you divide the upper hanse into so many equal parts you must divide the lower hanse from k to b into likewisewise or you may divide the upper hanse from the center o making a right angle from each sommering line to the ellipsis as is shown in describing the straight arches following and from the center o and the divisions in the upper hanse being thus divided you may draw the straight lines to the lower hanse and not divide it with the compasses through each of which divisions with a rule and pencil draw straight lines then get a piece of thin wainscot and make it to fit between two of these lines allowing what thickness for mortar you intend this will be the sommering mould for the hanse then divide the upper scheam likewise with the compasses at the same distance into equal parts and laying a ruler on the center i from each division in the scheam gl draw straight lines to the lower scheam dk then make another sommering mould to fit between two of these lines abating so much as you intend the thickness of your joints of mortar to be which if you set very close morters the breadth of the line will be enough to allow then laying the inner edge of a bevil straight on the line kl bring the tongue to touch the under side of the first course of the scheam then take up the bevil and set that bevil line upon the sommering mould of the scheam which bevil line serves for each course in the scheam but you must take the bevil of each course in the hanse and set them upon your sommering mould by themselves and number them with         etc because each course varies  thus having made your sommering moulds in the next place you must make the moulds for the length of your stretchers and for the breadth of the headers and the closiers a piece of wainscot seven inches long and three inches and an half broad will serve for the length of the stretchers and the breadth of the headers the closiers will be   inch and broad so the closier will be half the breadth of the header and the header half the length of the stretcher which will look well  it remains now to speak something to the other part of the arch to wit ad whose courses both in hanse and scheam run alike upon the ellipsis lines and seem of one bigness although perhaps there may be some small matter of difference by reason i have not divided the courses to this figure from a right angle but every course from the angle which it makes with the ellipsis which i chose rather to do that so the bevil of one course might not seem to run more upon the ellipsis than the bevil of another and the difference of the thicknesses being so inconsiderate is not discerned  having described both the ellipsis lines ad eg divide each of them into a like number of equal parts always remembering to make each division on the upper ellipsis line no greater than the thickness of the brick will contain when it is wrought then through each division in both the ellipses draw straight lines continuing them four or five inches above the upper ellipsis line and as much below the lower ellipsis line then having provided some thin sheets of fine pastboard about  0 inches square cutting one edge straight take one sheet and lay the straight edge even upon the line ae so that it may cover both the ellipsis lines and being cut to advantage it may cover eight courses or nine of the straight lines having laid it thus upon the figure of the arch stick a pin or two through it to keep it in its place then lay a ruler upon the pastboard true to the     or  th straight line of the arch according as the pastboard is in bigness to cover them and take a sharp penknife laying the ruler upon the pastboard true to the straight line whose ends being continued longer than the arch is deep as i directed before will be seen beyond the pastboard and cut the pastboard true to the line then take another sheet and join to it and cut it as you did the first so continue till you have covered the arch from ae just to the line dg sticking pins in each sheet to keep them in the places where you lay them then describe both the ellipsis lines upon the pastboard from the same centres and radii that you described the ellipsiss under the pastboard and either divide the ellipsis lines with the compasses on the pastboard or else draw lines upon the pastboard from or by the straight lines underneath them whose ends you see but the surer way is to divide the ellipsiss on the pastboard and draw lines through those divisions as you did beneath the pastboard then set seven inches being the length of each stretcher from a toward e and from d toward g and describe from the former centres the  oo through each other course on the pastoard as you may see in the fig also set three inches and an half being the breadth  header from a toward e and  from d toward g also set the ame three inches and an half from e toward a and from g toward d and describe these two ellipsis lines from the same centres through each course which the ellipsis line of the stretchers missed likewise draw in the same courses two other ellipsis lines one inch and  from each of those two lines you drew last which is the breadth of the closiers thus one course of the arch will be divided into two stretchers and the next to it into three headers and two closiers through the whole arch this being done cut the pastboard according to the lines into several courses and each other course into two stretchers and the headingcourses into three headers and two closiers exactly according to the sweep of the blacklead lines and mark each course with figures marking the first course of the hanse with   the next with   the third with   and so continue till you have marked all the courses to the key or middle for every course differs you were best to mark the lower closier in each course with a cipher on the left hand of its own number that you may know it readily from the upper closier and make no mistakes when you come to set them also the middle headers in each course should be marked besides its own number the thickness of the upper header being easily discerned from the lower header needs no marking besides its own number the cross joints and likewise the under side and upper side of each course must be  circular as the pastboards which are your moulds direct you  if you will add a keystone and chaptrels to the arch as in the figure let the breadth of the upper part of the keystone be the height of the arch viz    inches and summer from the center at i then make your chaptrels the same thickness that your lower part of the keystone is and let the keystone break without the arch so much as you project or sale over the jaums with the chaptrels  other kind of circular arches as half rounds and scheams being described from one center are so plain and easy that i need say nothing concerning them but since straight arches are much used and many workmen know not the true way of describing them i shall write something briefly concerning them straight arches are used generally over windows and doors according to the breadth of the piers between the windows so ought the skewback or sommering of the arch to be for if the piers be of a good breadth as three or four bricks in length then the straight arch may be described as its vulgarly said from the oxi which being but part of a word is taken from the word oxigonium signifying an equilateral triangle with three sharp angles but if the piers are small as sometimes they are but the length of two bricks and sometimes but one brick and an half then the breadth of the window or more may be set down upon the middle line for the center which will give a less skewback or sommering than the center from an oxi i will show how to describe them both ways and first from the oxi  suppose a straight arch one brick and an half in height to be made over a window   feet in width see fig   wherein one half of the arch is described from the oxi and the other half from the width of the window let the width of the window be ab taking the width between the compasses from a and b as two centres describe the two arches intersecting each other at p though i speak here of compasses yet when you describe the arch to its full bigness you must use a ruler or a line scarce any compasses being to be got large enough then draw another line above the line ab as the line cd being parallel to it at such a height as you intend your arch to be as in this fig at    inches but most commonly these sort of arches are but    inches in the height or thereabouts which answers to four courses of bricks but you may make them more or less in height according as occasion requires then laying a ruler on the center p and on the end of the line a draw the line ac which is vulgarly called the skewback for the arch  the next thing to be done is to divide those two lines ab and cd into so many courses as the arch will contain the thickness of a brick being one of them which some do by dividing the upper line into so many equal parts and from those parts and from the center p draw the sommering lines or courses others divide both the upper and lower line into so many equal parts and make no use of a center but draw the courses by a ruler being laid from the divisions on the upper line to the divisions on the lower line both which ways are false and erroneous but this by way of caution  having drawn the skewback ac take between your compasses the thickness that a brick will contain which i suppose to be two inches when it is rubbed and setting one point of the compasses on the line cd so that when you turn the other point about it may just touch the line ac in one place and there make a prick in the line cd but do not draw the sommering lines until you have gone over half the arch to see how you come to the key or middle and if you happen to come just to the middle line or want an inch of it then you may draw the lines but if not then you must open or shut the compasses a little till you do  then keeping one end of the rule close to the center at p the surest way is to strike a small nail in the center p and keep the rule close to the nail lay the other end of the rule close to the prick that you made on the line cd keeping the compasses at the same width  viz two inches set one point of the compasses on the line cd as before so that the other point being turned about may just pass by the rule and as it were touch it in one place you must remove the point of the compasses upon the line cd farther or nearer to the rule until it just touch the rule in one place and so continue with the rule and compasses until you come to the middle line and if it happen that your last space want an inch of the middle then the middle of the keycourse will be the middle of the arch and the number of the courses in the whole arch will be odd but if the last space happen to fall just upon the middle line of as it does in the fig then the joint is the middle of the arch but if it should happen neither to come even to the line nor want an inch of it then you must open or shut the compasses a small matter and begin again till it does come right and the number of the courses in the whole arch is an even number  note when the number of all the courses in the arch is an even number then you must begin the two sides contrary viz a header to be the lower brick of the first course on one side or half of the arch and a stretcher the lower brick of the first course on the other side or half of the arch and contrariwise if it happen that the number of the courses be an odd number as    or    or such like then the first courses of each half of the arch must be alike that is either both headers or both stretchers at the bottom  thus having described the arch the next thing to be done is to make the sommering mould which to do get a piece of thin wainscot being straight on one edge and having one side plained smooth to set the bevil strokes upon about    inches long and any breadth above two inches then laying your ruler one end at the center p and the other end even in the skewback line clap the straight edge of the wainscot close to the rule so that the lower end of the wainscot may lie a little below the line ab then take away the center rule but stir not the wainscot and laying a ruler upon the wainscot just over the line cd strike a line upon the wainscot then set one point of the compasses being at the width of a course  viz two inches upon that line so that the other point being turned about may just touch the straight edge of the wainscot as you did before in dividing the courses then make a prick on the line on the wainscot and laying your center rule upon it and on the center p draw a line upon the wainscot by the ruler with a pencil or the point of a compass and cut the wainscot to that line and make it straight by shooting it with a plain then your wainscot will fit exactly between any two lines of the arch you may let it want the thickness of one of the lines or some small matter more which is enough for the thickness of a mortar the length of your stretcher in this arch may be   inches and and the header   inches and but if your arch be but    inches in height then make your stretcher   inches and long and the header   inches one piece of wainscot will serve both for the length of the stretcher and the length of the header making it like a long square or oblong whose sides are   inches and   inches and then take a bevil and laying the inner edge of it straight with the line ab and the angle of the bevil just over the angle at a take off the angle that the skewback line ac makes with the line ab and set it upon the smoothed side of your sommering mould for the bevil stroke of your first course then drawing your bevil toward e straight in the line until the angle of the bevil be just over the angle that the second sommering line makes with the line ab when it is so draw the tongue of the bevil to lie even upon the second sommering line in brief cause the bevil to lie exactly on the line ab and on the second sommering line then take up your bevil and lay it on the mould and strike that bevil line on the mould with the point of the compasses about half a quarter of an inch distant from the first and that is the bevil of the underside of the second course proceed thus until you come to the middle line of but after you have set three bevil lines upon your sommering mould leave about of an inch between the third and the fourth and so likewise between the  th and  th and the  th and  0th which will be a great help to you in knowing the number of each line on the mould  the moulds for the other half of the arch namely eb are made after the same manner but but the arch is described from a center beneath p as q which causes a less skewback  viz b d  the diminishing of the sommering mould to any skewback may be found by the rule of three by dividing a foot into  0 equal parts and each of these into  0 parts so that the whole foot may contain  00 parts then proceed thus the upper line cf will be  0  that is three feet and almost one inch and the lower line ae will be     that is two feet and an half an   00 and the upper part of the sommering mould will be    almost that is two inches of such whereof there are    in a foot line measure having these three numbers viz  0         work according to the rule of three and you will find    and    of  00 parts that is almost    such parts whereof there are  00 in a foot line measure for the breadth of the lower part of the mould  yau may likewise find it geometrically thus having drawn the upper line and under line of the arch as cf and ae and drawn any skewback as suppose ac in  fig   make at discretion the angle gch in  fig   then take the upper line cf and set it from c to f also take the lower line ae and set it from c to e and draw the line of then take the thickness of your brick which suppose to be two inches and set it from f to g and draw gh parallel to fe i say fg is the breadth of the upper part of the sommering mould and eh the breadth of the lower part then make your sommering mould true to those two lines and beginning in the middle line fe describe the straight lines by the mould from the key fe until you come to the skewback ac and then take of the bevil lines and set them on your sommering mould  i shall conclude this exercise with the art of making two sorts of cements for the cementing bricks there are two sorts of cement which some bricklayers use in cementing of bricks for some kind of mouldings or in cementing a block of bricks as they call it for the carving of scroles or capitals or such like etc one is called cold cement the other is called hot cement because the former is made and used without fire but the latter is both made and used with fire the cold cement being accounted a secret is known but to few bricklayers but the hot cement is common  to make the cold cement take a pound of old cheshirecheese pair of the rine and throw it away cut or grate the cheese very small and put it into a pot put to it about a pint of cowsmilk let it stand all night the next morning get the whites of    or    eggs then take a pound of the best unslackt or quick lime that you can get and beat it to powder in a mortar then sift it through a fine hair sieve into a tray or bole of wood or into an earthen dish to which put the cheese and milk and stir them well together with a trowel or such like thing breaking the knots of cheese if there be any then add the whites of the eggs and temper all well together and so use it this cement will be a white color but if you would have it of the color of the brick put into it either some very fine brickdust or almegram not too much but only just to color it  to make the hot cement take one pound of rozin one quarter of a pound of beeswax half an ounce of fine brickdust half an ounce of chalkdust or powder of chalk sift both the brickdust and chalkdust through a fine hair sieve you may beat the brick and the chalk in a mortar before you sift it boil altogether in a pipkin or other vessel about a quarter of an hour stirring it all the while with an iron or a piece of lath or such like then take it of and let it stand   or   minutes and it is fit for use  note that the bricks that are to be cemented with this kind of cement must be made hot by the fire before you spread the cement on them and then rub them to and fro on one another as joiners do when they glue two boards together  finis mechanic dyalling teaching any man though of an ordinary capacity and unlearned in the mathematics to draw a true sundyal on any given plane however situated only with the help of a straight rule and a pair of compasses and without any arithmetical calculation  the fourth edition  by joseph moxon fellow of the royal society and hydrographer to the late king charles  london printed for tho leigh and dan midwinter at the rose and crown in st pauls churchyard   0   mechanic dyalling description of dyalling dyalling originally is a mathematical science attained by the philosophical contemplation of the motion of the sun the motion of the shadow the constitution of the sphere the situation of planes and the consideration of lines  explanation the motion of the sun is reguler it moving in equal space in equal time but the moon of the shadow irregular in all parts of the earth unless under the two poles and that more or less according to the constitution of the sphere and situation of the plane and therefore scientifick dyalists by the geometrick considerations of lines have found out rules to mark out the irregular motion of the shadow in all latitudes and on all planes to comply with the regular motion of the sun and these rules of adjusting the motion of the shadow to the motion of the sun may be called scientifick dyalling  but though we may justly account dyalling originally a science yet such have been the giolity of many of its studious contemplations that they have communicated their acquired  whereby it is now become to many of the  no more difficult than an at  authors so entitled nay more by this small treatise it will scarce be accounted more than a manual operation for though hitherto all the authors i have met with seem to presuppose their reader to understand geomery and the projecting of the sphere already or else endeavor in their works to make him understand them as if they were absolutely necessary to be known by every one that would make a dyal when as in truth the contemplative pains of others aforesaid of considered they are not but indeed are only useful to those that would know the reason of dyalling thus they do not only discourage young beginners but also disappoint many gentlemen and others that would willingly either make them themselves or set their workmen about them it they knew how to make them  this little piece i have therefore composed for the help of those who understand neither the projection of the sphere or geometrical operations only if they know how to draw a straight line between two points by the side of a ruler describe a circle with a pair of compasses erect a perpendicular and draw one line parallel to another they may know how to draw a dyal for any given plane however situated in any latitude  but perhaps these two last little tricks are not known to all new beginners therefore i shall show them first  how to erect a perpendicular for example in fig   upon the line ab you would erect a perpendicular to the point c place one foot of your compasses upon the point c and open the other to what distance you please for example to the point a make there a mark then keeping the first foot still in c turn the other foot toward b and make there another mark then open your compasses wider suppose to the length ab and placing one foot in the point a with the other foot describe a small arch over the point c and removing the foot of your compasses to the point b with the other foot describe another small arch to cut the first arch as at d then lay your straight ruler to the point where the two small arches cut each other and upon the point c and by the side of the ruler draw the line cd which shall be a perpendicular to the line ab  another way with once opening the compasses as by fig   draw the line ab and place one foot of your compasses upon the point you would have the perpendicular erected as at the point c and with the other foot describe the semicircle a abb then placing one foot in b extend the other foot to b in the semicircle and keeping that foot in b extend the other foot to d and make there a small arch then remove one foot of your compasses to a and extend the other foot to a in the semicircle and keeping that foot in a extend the other to d and make there another small arch to cut the first small arch and laying a straight ruler to the point where these two small arches cut each other and upon the point c draw by the side of the ruler the line cd which shall be perpendicular to the line ab  to erect a perpendicular upon the end of a line as by fig   on the point b at one end of the line ab place one foot of your compasses in the point b and extend the other on the line toward a as to b and with it describe the arch bac then placing one foot in b extend the other to a in the arch and make there a mark divide with your compasses the arch ba into two equal parts and keeping the feet of your compasses at that distance measure in the arch from a to c then draw a straight line from the point c to the end of the line b and that straight line shall be perpendicular to the end of the line ab  to draw a line parallel to another line as by fig   example if you would draw a line parallel to the line ab open your compasses to the distance you intend the lines shall stand off each other and placing one foot successively near each end describe with other foot the small arches cd lay a straight ruler to the top of these arches and draw a line by the side of it and that line shall be parallel to the line ab  definitions a dyal plane is that flat whereon a dyal is intended to be projected  of dyal planes some be direct others decliners others oblique  of direct planes there are five sorts    the horizontal whose plane lies flat and is parallel to the horizon beholding the zenith    the south erect whose plane stands upright and directly beholds the south    the north erect whose plane stands upright and directly beholds the north    the east erest whose plane stands upright and directly beholds the east    the west erect whose plane stands upright and directly beholds the west  of decliners there are infinite and yet may be reduced into these two kinds    the south erect plane declining more or less toward the east or west    the north erect plane declining more or less toward the east or west  of obliqe planes some are direct other declining and are of four sorts    direct inclining planes which lean toward you and lie directly in the east west north or south quarters of heaven    direct reclinig planes which lean from you and lie directly in the east west north or south quarters of heaven    inclining declining planes which lean toward you but lie not directly in the east west north or south quarters of heaven but decline more or less from the north or south toward the east or west    reclining declining planes which lean from you but lie not directly in the east west north or south quarters of heaven but decline more or less from the north or south toward the east or west  if the situation of the plane be not given you must seek it for there are several ways how to know these several kinds of planes used among artists but the readiest and easiest is by an instument called a declinatory fitted to the variation of your place and if it be truly made you may as safely rely upon it as any other  operartioni i the description of the clinatory the clinatory is made of a square board abcd of a good thickness and the larger the better between two of the sides is described on the center a a quadrant as of divided into  0 equal parts or degrees which are figured with  0  0  0 to  0 and then back again with the complements of the same numbers to  0 between the limb and the two semidiameters is made a round box into which a magnetical needle is fitted and a card of the nautical compass divided into four nineties beginning their numbers at the east west north and south points of the compass from which points the opposite sides of the clinatory receives their names of east west north and south  but note that the north point of the card must be placed so many degrees toward the east or west sides of the clinatory as the needle varies from the true north point of the world in the place where you make your dyal which your workman that makes your clinatory will know how to sit  upon the center a whereon the quadrant was described is fastened a plumbline having a plummet of lead or brass fastened to the end of it which plumbline is of such length that the plummet may fall just into the groove gh below the quadrant which is for that purpose made of such a depth that the plummet may ride freely within it without stopping at the sides of it see the figure annexed    with this clinatory you may examine the situation of planes as if your plane be horizontal it is direct and then for the true scituating your dyal you have only the true north and south line to find which is done only by setting the clinatory flat down upon the plane and turning it toward the right or left hand till you can bring the north point of the needle to hang just over the flowerdeluce for then if you draw a line by either of the sides parallel to the needle that line shall be a north and south line  if your plane either recline or incline apply one of the sides of your clinatory parallel to one of the semidiameters of the quadrant to the plane in such sort that the plumbline hanging at liberty may fall upon the circumference of the quadrant for then the number of degrees of the quadrant comprehended between the side of the quadrant parallel to the plane and the plumbline shall be the number of degrees for reclination if the center of the quadrant points upwards or inclination if the center points downwards  if your reclining or inclining plane decline draw upon it a line parallel to the horizon which you may do by applying the backside of the clinatory and raising or depressing the center of the quadrant till the plumbline hang just upon one of the semidiameters for then you may by the upperside of the clinatory draw an horizontal line if the plane incline or by the underside if it recline if it neither incline or recline you may draw a horizontal line both by the upper and under sides of the clinatory having drawn the horizontal line apply the north side of the clinatory to it and if the north end of the needle points directly toward the plane it is then a south plane if the north point of the needle points directly from the plane it is a north plane but if it points toward the east it is an east plane if toward the west a west plane if it do not point directly either east west north or south then so many degrees as the needle declines from any of these four points to any of the other of these four points so many degrees is the declination of the plane  you may find a meridian line another way thus if the sun shine just at noon hold up a plumbline so as the shadow of it may fall upon your plane and that shadow shall be a meridian line  operat ii to describe a dyal upon a horizontal plane first draw a north and south line which is called a meridian line through the middle of the plane thus set your declinatory flat upon the plane and turn it too and fro till the needle hang precisely over the meridian line of the declinatory then by the side of the declinatory parallel to its meridian line draw a straight line on the plane and if that straight line be in the middle of the plane it shall be the meridian line whithout more ado but if it be not in the middle of the plane you must draw a line parallel to it through the middle of the plane for the meridian lane or twelve a clock line and it shall be the mridian line and also be the substilar line then draw another straight line through the middle of this line to cut it at right angles for the vi a clock lines and where these two lines cut one another make your center whereon you describe a circle on your plane as large as you can which by the meridian line and the line drawn at right angles with it will be divided into four quadrants one of the quadrants divide into  0 degrees thus keeping your compasses at the same width they were at when you described the quadrant place one foot in the twelve a clock line and extend the other in the quadrant and make in the quadrant a mark with it so shall you have the sixtieth degree marked out then place one foot of your compasses in the six a clock line and extend the other in the quadrant and make in the quadrant another mark with it so shall that quadrant be divided into three equal parts each of hse three equal parts contains  0 degrees then with your compasses divide one of thse three equal parts into three parts and transfer that distance to the other two third parts of the quadrant so shall the whole quadrant be divided into nine equal parts then divide one of these nine equal parts into two equal parts and transfer that distance to the other eight equal parts so shall the quadrant be divided into eighteen equal parts then divide one of these eighteen equal parts into five equal parts and transfer that distance to the other seventeen equal parts so shall the whole quadrant be divided into  0 equal parts each of these  0 equal parts are called degrees  note that you may in small quadrants divide truer and with less trouble with steel dividers which open or close with a screw for that purpose then you can with compasses  in this quadrant thus divided count from the substilar or meridian line the elevation of the pole that is the number of degrees that the pole of the world is elevated above the horizon of your place and draw a line from the center through that number of degrees for the stilar line then on the substilar line chose a point where you please and through that point draw a line at right angles to the substilar line as long as you can for the line of contingence and from that point in the substilar line measure the nearest distance any part of the stilar line has to that point and keeping one foot of your compasses still in that point set of that distance in the substilar line and at that distance describe against the line of contingence a semicircle which divide from either side the meridian or substilar line into six equal parts thus draw a line through the center of this semicircle parallel to the line of contingence which shall be the diametral line and shall devide this semicircle into two quadrants one on one side the substiler line and the quadrant on the other side the substiler line then keeping your compasses at the same distance they were at when you described the semicircle place one foot first on one side the diametral line at the intersection of it and the semicircle and then on the other side at the intersection of it and the semicircle and extend the other in the semicircle and make marks in the semicircle on either side the substilar line then place one foot of your compasses at the intersection of the semicircle and the substilar line and turn the other foot about on either side the semicircle and make marks in the semicircle so shall the semicircle be divided into six equal parts divide one of these equal parts into two equal parts and transfer that distance to the other five equal parts so shall the whole semicircle be divided into twelve equal parts these twelve divisions are to describe the twelve hours of the day between six a clock in the morning and six a clock at night  if you will have half hours you may divide each of these twelve into two equal parts as before if you will have quarters you may divide each of these twenty four into two equal parts more as before  for thus proportioning the divisions in the semicircle you may proportion the divisions and subdivisions of hours upon the dyal plane for a straight ruler laid upon each of these divisions and on the center of this semicircle shall show on the line of contingence the several distances of all the hours and parts of hours on the dyal plane and straight lines drawn from the center of the dyal plane through the several divisions on the line of contingence shall be the several hour lines and parts on the dyal plane  but an horizontal dyal in our latitude will adadmit of four hours more viz v iv in the morning and vii viii in the evening therefore in the circle described on the center of the dyal plane transfer the distance between vi and v and vi and iv on the other side the six a clock line and transfer the distances between vi and vii and vi and viii on the other side the opposite six a clock hour line and from the center of the dyal plane draw lines through those transferred distances for the hour lines before and after vi  then mark your hour lines with their respective numbers the substilar line in this dyal as aforesaid is xii from thence toward the right hand mark every successive hour line with i ii iii etc and from xii toward the left hand with xi x ix etc  the style must be erected perpendicularly over the substilar line so as to make an angle with the dyal plane equal to the elevation of the pole of your place  example you would draw a dyal upon a horizontal plane here at london first draw the meridian or north and south line as xii b and cross it in the middle with another line at right angles as vi vi which is an east and west line where these two lines cut each other as at a make the center whereon describe the semicircle b vi vi but one of the quadrants viz the quadrant from xii to vi toward the right hand you must divide into  0 equal parts as you were taught in fol    and at    degrees which is londons latitude make a mark and laying a straight ruler to the center of the plane and to this mark draw a line by the side of it for the stilar line then on the substilar line choose a point as at c and through that point draw a line as long as you can perpendicular to the east and west line vi vi as of which is called the contingent line where this contingent line cuts the substilar line place one foot of your compasses and from thence measure the shortest distance between the point c and the stilar line and keeping one foot of your compasses still in the point c set off the shortest distance between the point c and the stilar line on the substilar line as at d which point d shall be a center whereon with your compasses at the same width you must describe a semicircle to represent a semicircle of the equinoctial this semicircle divide into six equal parts as you were taught fol    to each of which equal parts and to the center the equinoctial semicircle lay a straight ruler and where the straight ruler cuts the line of contingence make marks in the line of contingence then lay the straight ruler to the semicircle of the dyal plane and to each of the marks in the line of contingence and by the side of it draw twelve straight line for the twelve for and afternoon hour lines viz from vi in the morning to vi in the evening then in the quadrant vi b measure the distance between the vi  clock hour line and the v a clock hour line and transfer the same distances from the vi a clock line to vii and v  both sides the vi a clock hour lines and through those distances draw from the center of the plane the vii and v a clock hour lines and measure the distance between the vi a clock hour line and the iv a clock hour line and transfer the same distance from the vi a clock line to viii and iv and through those diststances draw from the center of the plane the viii a clock and iv a clock hour lines    if you will have the half hours and quarter hours or any other division of hours you must divide each six divisions of the equinoctial into so many parts as you intend and by a straight ruler laid to the center of the equinoctial and those divisions in the equinoctial circle make marks in the line of contingence as you did before for the whole hour lines and lines drawn from the center of the plane through those marks shall be the subdivisions or the hours but you must remember to make all subdivisions short lines and near the verge of the dyal plane that you may the easier distinguish between the whole hours and the parts of hours as you may see in the figure  having drawn the hour lines set the number of each hourline under it as you see in the figure last of all fit a triangular iron whose angular point being laid to the center of the dyal plane one side must agree with the substilar line and its other side with the stilar line so is the style made and this style you must erect perpendiculary over the substilar line on the dyal plane and there fix it then is your dyal finished  operat iii to describe an erect direct southdyal you may know an erect direct south plane by applying the northside of the declinatory to it for then if the northend of the needle hang directly over the northpoint of the card in the bottom of the box it is a southplane but if it hang not directly over the northpoint of the card it is not a direct southplane but declines either east or west and that contrary to the pointing of the needle easterly or westerly from the northpoint of the card for if the northpoint of the needle points easterly the plane declines from the south toward the west if it point westerly the plane declines from the south toward the east  you may know if the plane be truly erect or upright by applying one of the sides ad or ab to it for then by holding the center a upwards so as the plumbline play free in the groove if the line falls upon 0 or  0 the plane is upright but if it hang upon any of the intermediate degrees it is not upright but inclines or reclines  if you find it incline apply the side ab to it and see what number of degrees the plumbline falls on for that number of degrees counted from the said ab is the number of degrees of inclination  if you find the plane reclines apply the side ad to it and see what number of degrees the plumbline falls on for that number of degrees counted from the side ad is the number of degrees of reclination  these rules being well understood may serve you to find the situation of all other sort of planes  but for the making a dyal on this plane you must first draw a meridian line through the middle of the plane by applying a plumbline to the middle of it till the plumbet hang quietly before it for then if the plumbline be blacked for a white ground or chalked for a dark ground and strained as carpenters do their lines you may with one stroke of the string on the plane describe the meridian line as a xii this meridian is also the substilar line    then on the top of this meridian line as at a draw another line athwart it to cut it at right angles as vi vi for an east and west line at the meeting of these two lines at the top make your center whereon describe a semicircle on your plane as large as you can which by the meridian line and the east and west line will be divided into two quadrants one of these quadrants divide into  0 degrees as you were taught fol    and from the substilar line count the complement of the poles elevation which here at london where the pole is elevated    degrees its complement to  0 is    degrees and make there a mark as at e then on the substilar line choose a point where you please as at f for the line of contingence to pass through which line of contingence draw as long as you can so as it may cut the substilar line at right angles and from the point f in the substilar line measure the shortest distance between it and the stilar ne and keeping one foot of your compasses still in the point f transfer that distance into the substilar line as at g then on the point g describe a semicircle of the equinoctial against the ire of contingence which semicircle divide into twelve equal parts as you were taught by the example in the horizontal dyal fol    and by a straight ruler laid to each of these divisions and to the center of the semicircle make marks in the line of contingence by the side of the ruler for straight lines drawn from the center of the dyal plane through these marks in the contingent line shall be the    hour lines before and after noon  then mark your hour lines with their respective numbers the substilar or meridian line is xii from thence toward the right hand with i ii iii etc and from thence toward the left hand with a xi x ix etc  the style must be erected perpendicular over the substilar line so as to make an angle with the dyal plane equal to the complement of the poles elevation viz    degrees  operat iv to make an erect direct north dyal the erect direct north dyal style and all is made by the same rules changing upwards for downwards and the left side for the right the erect direct south dyal is made for if the erect direct south dyal be drawn on any transparent plane as on glass horn or an oyled paper and the horizontal line vi vi turned downwards and the line vii marked with v the line viii with iiii the line v with vii and the line iiii with viii then have you of it a north erect direct dyal  all the other hour lines in this dyal are useless because the sun in our latitude shines on a north face the longest day only before vi in the morning and after vi at night  operat v to describe an erect direct east dyal having a plumbline a little above the place on the wall where you intend to make your  and wait till it hang quietly before the wall then if the line be rubbed with chalk like a carpenters line you may by holding the plumbet end close to the wall and straining it pretty stiff strike with it a straight line as carpenters do this line shall be a perpendicular as ab then choose a convenient point in this perpendicular as at c for a center whereon describe an occult arch as de this arch must contain the number of degrees of the elevation of the equinoctial counted between d and e which in our latitude is    or which is all one the complement of the poles elevation therefore in a quadrant of the same radius with the occult arch measure    degrees and set them off in the plane from e to d then from d to the center c in the perpendicular draw the pricked line dc this pricked line shall represent the axis of the world then cross this line at right angles with the line cf and draw it from c to f so long as possibly you can this line shall be the contingent line then choose a point in this contingent line as at vi draw a line through that point at right angles for the substlar line as gvih for the substilar line then open your compasses to a convenient width as to vig and pitching one foot in the point g with the other foot describe a semicircle of the equinoctial against the line of contingence which semicircle divide from vi both ways into six equal parts as you were taught by the example in the horizontal dyal and laying a straight ruler on the center of this semicircle of the equinoctial and to each of those equal parts mark on the contingent line where the ruler cuts it for those marks shall be the several points from whence lines drawn parallel to the line cd shall be the respective hour lines    the reason why the contingent line is drawn from vi to f so much longer than from vi to c is because the hour lines from vi toward xii are more in number toward noon than they are from vi backwrd toward iiii for this dyal will only show the hours from a little before iv in the morning to almost noon for just at noon the shadow goes off the plane as you may see if you apply a straight ruler to the center of the equinoctial semicircle g and lay it to the point    in the semicircle for the straight ruler will then never cut the line of contingence because the line of contingence is parallel to the line g xii on the equinoctial circle and lines parallel though continued to never so great a length never meet  to these hour lines set figures as may be seen in the scheme  the style ik of this dyal as well as of all others must stand parallel to the axis of the world and also parallel to the face of the plane and parallel to all the hour lines and stand directly over the substilar or vi a clock hour line and that so high as is the distance of the center of the equinoctial semicircle from the contingent line  operat vi to describe a dyal on an erect direct west plane an erect direct westdyal is the same in all respects with an erect direct eastdyal only as the eastdyal shws the forenoon hours so the west shows the afternoon hours  thus if you should draw the eastdyal on any transparent plane as on glass horn or oyl paper on the one side will appear an east dyal on the other side a west only the numbers to the hour lines as was said before in the northdyal must be changed for that which in the eastdyal is xi in the west must be i that which in the eastdyal is x in the west must be ii that which in the east dyal is ix in the west must be iii etc the style is the same  operat vii to describe a dyal on an erect north or erect south plane declining eastwards or westwards these four dyals viz the erect north declining eastwards the erect north declining westwards the erect south declining eastwards and the erect south declining westward are all projected by the same rules and therefore are in effect but one dyal differently placed as you shall see hereafter  first draw on your plane a straight line to represent the horizon of your place and mark one end of it w for west and the other end e for east choose a point in this horizontal line for a center as at a whereon you may describe a circle to comprehend all these four dyals draw line as mam perpendicular to the horizontal line we through the center a for a meridian line and on that center describe a circle which by the two lines wae and mam will be divided into four quadrants which will comprehend the four dyals aforesaid for if it be a north declining west you are to draw the upper quadrant to the left hand serves your purpose if a south declining west the same lines continued through the center a into the lower quadrant to the right hand serves your turn if a north declining east the upper quadrant to the right hand serves your turn or if a south declining east the same lines continued through the center a into the lower quadrant to the left hand serves your turn and you must draw the declination complement of the poles altitude substile style and hour lines in it but the hour lines must be differently marked as you shall see hereafter i shall only give you an example of one of these dyals viz a south declining east    we will suppose you are to draw a dyal that declines from the south  0 degrees toward the east here being but one dyal you need describe but one quadrant of a circle set off in the lower quadrant wam  0 degrees from the meridian line m toward w and from the center a draw a straight line through that mark in the quadrant as da which may be called the line of declination then set off from the meridian line the complement of the poles elevation which in our latitude is    degrees and there draw another line from the center as ap which we will call the polar line then take in the horizontal line a convenient portion of the quadrant as ab and from the point b draw a line parallel to the meridian line am and continue that line till it intersect the polar line as at p from which point p draw a line parallel to wa as pc then measure the distance of ab in the hrizontal line and set off that distance in the line of declination as from a to d and from that point of distance draw a line parallel to the meridian am through the horizontal line at r and through the point d and continue it through the line pc as at s then laying a straight ruler to the center a and the intersection of the line pc at s draw the line as for the substile then upon the point s erect a line perpendicularly as st then measure the distance between r and d and set that distance off from s to t and from the center to the point t draw the line at for the style or gnomon and the triangle sat made of iron or brass and erected perpendicularly over the substile sa shall by its upper side ta cast a shadow upon the hour of the day but you will say the hour lines must be drawn first it is true therefore to draw them you must choose a point in the substile line where you think good and through it draw the line ff as long as you can for the line of contingence then with your compasses take the distance between this point and the style and transfer that distance below the line of contingence on the substile as at ae and with your compasses at that distance describe on the center ae a circle to represent the equinoctial then as you were taught in the example of the horizontal dyal divide the semicircle of the equinoctial into twelve equal parts beginning at the point in the equinoctial circle where a straight line drawn from the center of it to the intersection of the line of contingence with the meridian line cuts the equinoctial line as here at the point g then lay a straight ruler to the center of the equinoctial circle and to every one of the divisions in the semicle and mark where the straight ruler cuts the contingent line for straight lines drawn from the center a of the dyal to those several marks on the contingent line shall be the hour lines and must be numbered from the noon line or meridian am backwards as xii xi x ix etc toward the left hand so is your dyal finished  this dyal drawn on any transparent matter as horn glass or an oyled paper shall on the other side the transparent matter become a south declining west style and all but then the i a clock hour line must be marked ii the xii xii the xi a clock hour line i x ii ix iii etc  if you project it a new you must describe the quadrant mw on the other side the meridian line on the center a from m to e and then count as before the declination altitude of the pole substile and stie in the quadrant beginning at m toward e and work in all respects as with the south declining east only number this south declining west as in the foregoing paragraph  if you project a north declining east you must describe the quadrant above the horizontal line from m upwards toward e on your right hand and count as before the declination altitude complement of the pole substile and style from the meridian line and work as with the south declining east it must be numbered from the meridian line m toward the right hand with xi x ix viii etc  if this dyal were drawn on transparent matter the other side would show a north declining west but if you will project it anew you must describe the quadrant above the horizontal line from m upwards toward w and count from the meridian line am the declination complement altitude of the pole substile and style and work with them in all respects as with the suth decining east but then the xi a clock hour line must be marked i the x ii the ix iii etc  operat viii to draw a dyal on an east or west plane reclining or inclining draw a straight line parallel to the horizon to represent the meridian or xii a clock line and mark one end n the other s choose a point in this line as at a for a center then if your plane be an east or a west incliner let fall a perpendicular upon this center that is the perpendicular must stand above the meridian line ns as ae and upon the center a describe a semicircle above the meridian line ns but if your plane be an east incliner or a west recliner let fall a perpendicular from the center a under the meridian line and upon the center a describe a semicircle under the meridian line if your plane be a west incliner work as shall be taught in the quadrant on the left hand above the meridian line if an east recliner in the quadrant on the right hand above the meridian line if it be a west recliner work in the quadrant on the left hand under the meridian if an east incliner in the quadrant under the meridian line the right hand  for example an east dyal reclining    degrees you would draw a dyal on an east plane reclinining    degrees therefore in the quadrant on the right hand above the meridian line set off from the perpendicular ae    degrees on the quadrant for the reclination of the plane and set off also in the quadrant    degrees from the perpendicular for the complement of the poles elevation and at these settings off make marks in the quadrant then lay a straight ruler to the center a and to the marks in the quadrant and draw straight lines through them from the center then choose in the meridian line ns a convenient point as at b and through that point draw a line parallel to the perpendicular ae which will intersect the line drawn for the complement of the poles elevation ap in p from which point p draw a line parallel to the meridian line ns to cut the perpendicular ae in c and also the line of obliquity ao in o then measure the length ao and set off that length in the perpendicular ace from a to e and draw the line eg parallel to the meridian line ns which will cut the line bp prolonged in g measure also the length of co and set that length off from a to q on the line of obliquity ao and draw the line qr parallel to the perpendicular ace then measure the distance of ar and upon the line gpb set it off from g to s and laying a straight ruler to the point s and the center a draw by the side of it the line as for the substile line then measure the length of qr and from s raise a perpendicular and in that perpendicular set that length off from s to t and laying a straight ruler to the center a and the point t draw the line at for the stilar line which stilar line being perpendicular erected over the substilar line as will stand parallel to the axis of the world and cast its shadow on the hour of the day    to draw the hour lines on this plane you must as you have several times before been directed choose a point in the substilar line and through that point draw at right angles with the substilar line the line of contingence so long as you can then measure the shortest distance between that point and the stilar line and transfer that distance below the line of contingence in the substilar line as at ae and with your compasses at that distance describe against the line of contingence the equinoctial circle then divide the semicircle of the equinoctial next the line of contingence into twelve equal parts as you have formerly been taught beginning at the point in the equinoctial circle where a straight line drawn from the center of it to the intersection of the line of contingence with the meridian line ns cuts the equinoctial circle as here at the point d then lay a straight ruler to the center of the equinoctial circle and to every one of the divisions in the equinoct semicircle and mark where the straight ruler cuts the contingent line for straight lines drawn from the center a of the dyal through these several marks in the contingent line shall be the hour lines and must be numbered from the meridian or noonline ns which is the xii a clock line upwards with xi x ix viii etc the center of this dyal must stand downward  if this dyal were turned with its center upwards it would show a west inclining    degrees only the numbers to the hour lines must be changed for to xi you must set i to x ii to ix iii etc and the substile over which the style must stand must be placed in the semicircle at first described as much to the right hand the perpendicular ae as it does on the left hand  if this dyal were drawn on glass or horn or an oyled paper and you turn the meridian line ns upwards the back side shall be an east inclining    degrees and the hour lines must be numbered as they are on the east reclining but the substile over which the style must stand must be placed in the semicircle at first described as much to the left hand the perpendiculer ae as it is on the oyled paper to the right hand  if you turn the meridian line ns downwards the backside shall be a west recliner    degrees and the hour lines must be numbered from the xii a clock line upwads with i ii iii etc  you must note that all the hour lines of the day will nor be described in this single quadrant nor does the quadrant at all relate to the hour lines but is described only for setting off the complement of the poles elevation and reclination of the plane that by working as has been shown you may find the place of the substilar line and the angle the style makes with it for having the substilar line you know how to draw the line of contingence and to describe the equinoctial circle by which all the hours are described on the plane  to draw a dyal on a direct south or north plane inclining or reclining direct reclining or inclining dyals are the same with erect direct dyals that are made for the latitude or some other places the latitude of which places are either more then the latitude of your place if the plane recline or less if it incline and that in such a proportion as the arch of reclination or inclination is  thus a direct south dyal reclining  0 degrees in londons latitude  viz    degrees is an erect direct south dyal made for the latitude of    degrees and a direct south dyal inclining  0 in the latitude of    is an erect direct south dyal in the latitude of    degrees and is to be made according to the direction given in operat iii  operat ix to draw a dyal on a south or north inclining declining or reclining declining plane these four sorts of dyals viz the south inclining declining and south reclining declining and north inclining declining and south reclining declining are all projected by the same rules and therefore are in effect but one dyal differently placed as you shall see hereafter  first draw on your plane a straight line parallel to the horizon and mark one end w for west and the other e for east on south incliners and recliners e on the right hand and w on the left on north incliners and recliners e on the left and w on the right choose a point in this horizontal line for a center as at a through this point a draw a line perpendicular to the horizon and on this point as on a center describe a semicircle one quadrant above and another below the horizontal lines though for this example i describe but one then if the plane respect the south set off in the lower quadrant from the perpendicular the declination the inclination or the reclination and the complement of the altitude of the pole and through these several settings off in the quadrant draw straight lines from the center a then take in the horizontal line toward the semicircle a convenient distance from the center a as b and through the point b draw a straight line parallel to the perpendicular and prolong it through the polar line as bp through the point p draw a line parallel to the horizontal line as pc this line will cut the line of obliquity in the point o then measure the distance of ao and set off that distance on the perpendicular from a to f and through the point f draw a straight line parallel to the horizontal line as fg for the horizontal intersection then measure the distance of co and set off that distance on the perpendicular from a to l from the point l draw the line ld parallel to the horizontal line to cut the line of declination in the point d then measure the distance of ab and set off that distance in the line of declination from a to e and from the point e draw a straight line parallel to the horizontal line we to cut the perpendicular in the point k measure the distance of ek and set set off that distance on the other side the perpendicular in the horizontal intersection from f to h and from the point h draw hn parallel to the perpendicular to cut the horizontal line in the point n    then to find the meridian line substile and style do thus if your plane be a southern incliner or a norhern recliner measure the distance of ld and and set off that distance in the horizontal intersection from f to m and through the point m draw the line am for the meridian line then add the distance of al to ak thus measure the distance of al and place one foot of your compasses in the point k in the perpendicular line and extend the other to x and measuring the distance of ax set it off in the line of obliquity from a to q and from the point q draw the line qr parallel to the perpendicular and cutting the horizontal line in the point r then measure the distance of ar and set off that distance from h in the horizontal intersection to s on the line hn and to the point s draw the line as for the substile then measure the distance of qr and set off that distance perpendicularly from the point s to t and lastly from the point a draw the straight line at for the stilar line which stilar line being perpendicularly erected over the substilar line as will stand parallel to the axis of the world and cast its shadow on the hour of the day  but if the plane be a southern recliner or northern incliner measure as before the distance of ld and as before you were directed to set it off from f in the horizontal intersection on the right hand the perpendicular line so now set that distance from f to m in the horizontal intersection on the left hand in the perpendicular line and draw the line a m for the meridian line then as before you were directed to add al to ak so now substract the distance of al from ak and the remainder will be lk set therefore the distance of lk from a to q in the same line of obliquity and from the point q draw the line qr parallel to the perpendicular measure then the distance of a r and set of that distance in the line hn from h to s for the substilar line then erect on the point s a perpendicular and on that perpendicular set off from s to t the distance of qr and lastly from a draw the line a t for the stilar line  if k falls upon l the plane is parallel to the axis of the world and the dyal drawn upon it will have no center but s will fall upon h and ah or a s will be the substile  i shall give you two examples of these rules one of a dyal with a center and the other of a dyal without a center and first  operat x how to draw a dyal with a center declining  0 degrees and inclining  0 degrees   having by the foregoing precepts of the last operat found the substile style and meridian you must as you have often been directed choose a point in the substilar line through which at right angles to the substilar line draw the line of contingence as long as you can then measure the shortest distance between the point of intersection and the stilar line and transfer that distance on one side of the line of contingence upon the substilar line and so describe the equinoctial semicircle against the line of contingence then lay a straight ruler to the center of the equinoctial circle as at ae and to the point where the line of contingence cuts the meridian line as at z and mark where the straight ruler cuts the equinoctial circle and from that mark begin to divide the semicircle into twelve equal parts and by a straight ruler laid to those divisions and the center of the equinoctial make marks in the line of contingence then shall straight lines drawn from the center a of the dyal through every one of the marks in the contingent line be the hour lines of the dyal and must be numbered from the xii a clock line toward the right hand with i ii iii iv etc and the other way with xi x ix etc  operat xi how to draw a dyal without a center on a south plane declining east  0 degrees recilning    degrees    minutes having by the precepts of operat ix found the substile you must find the meridian line otherwise than you were there taught for having drawn the lines of latitude declination and reclination and found the substile measure the distance of bp and set it off on the line of declination from a to k and draw from the perpendicular af the line kq parallel to ab then measure the length of kq and set it off on the polar line ap from a to v then take the nearest distance between the point v and the line ab and set it off on the line qk from q to m through which point m draw a line from the center a then measure with your compasses in the semicircle wne which in this dyal may represent the equinoctial the distance of the arch n m and set off that distance from the intersection of the substile with the semicircle at s to t in the semicircle which point t shall be the point in the equinoctial that you must begin to divide the hours at for the finding their distances on the line of contingence    then consider according to the bigness of your plane what height your style shall stand above the substile and there make a mark in the substile for the distance between the center a and that mark must be the height of the style perpendicularly erected over the substile as at i draw through this point i a line of contingence as long as you can to ut the substile at right angles and then laying a ruler to the center a and sucessively to to each division of the equinoctial make mks in the line of contingence and through those marks draw straight lines parallel to the substile which shall be the hur lines and must be numbered from the left hand toward the right beginning at the xii a clok line with i ii iii etc and from the right hand toward the left on the xii a clock line with xi x ix etc  the stil to this dyal may be either a straight pi of the length o ai or else a square of the same height erected perpendicularly upon the i in the subterne  operat xii to make a dyal on the cieling of a room where the direct beams of the sun never come find some convenient place in the transum of a window to place a small round piece of lookingglass about the bigness of a groat or less so as it may lie exactly horizontal the point in the middle of this glass we will mark a and for distinctionsake call it nodus through this nodus you must draw a meridian line on the floor thus hang a plumbline in the window exactly over nodus and the shadow that the plumbline casts on the floor just at noon will be a meriian line or you may find a meridian line otherwise by the clinatory having drawn the meridian line on the cieling thus hold a plumbline to the cieling over that end of the meridian line nex the window if the plumbet hang not exactly on the meridian line on the floor remove your hand on the cieling one way or other as you see cause till it do hang quietly just over it and at the point where the plumb line touches the cieling make a mark as at b that mark b shall be directly over the meridian line on the floor then remove your plumb line on the floor and find a point on the cieling directly over it as you did the former point as at c and through these two points b and c on the cieling strain and strike a line blackt with smallcoal or any other coluor as carpenters do and that line bc on the cieling shall be the meridan line as well as that on the floor then faster a string just on the nodus and remove that string forwards or backwards in the meridian line on the cieling till it have the same elevation in the quadrant on the clinatory above the horizon that the equinoctial has in your habitation and through the point where the string touches the meridian line in the cieling shall a line be drawn at right angles with the meridian to represent the equinoctial line  thus in our latitude the elevation of the equator being    degrees i remove the string fastened to the nodu forwards or backwards in the meridian line of the cieling till the plumbline of the quadrant on the clinatory when one of the sides are applied to the string falls upon    degrees and then i find it touch the meridian line at d in the cieling therefore at d i make a mark and through this mark strike the line de as before i did in the meridian line to cut the mridian line at right angles this line shall be the equinoctial line and serve to denote the hour distances as the contingent lines does on other dyals as you have often seen  then i place the center of the quadrant on the clinatory upon nodus so as the arch of the quadrant may be on the east side the mridian line and underprop it so that the flat side of the quadrant may lie parallel to the string when it is strained between the nodus and the equinoctial and also so as the string may lie on the semidiameter of the quadrant when it is held up to the meridian line on the cieling then removing the string the space of   degrees in the quadrant and extending it to the equator on the cieling where the string touches the equator there shall be a point through which the i a clock hourline shall be drawn and removing the string yet    degrees futher to the eastwards in the semicircle of position and extending it also to the equator where it touches the  there shall be a point throuh which the ii a clock hourline shall be drawn remving the string     further to the eastwards in the semicircle of potion and extending it also to the equator where it touches the equator there shall be a point through which the ii a clock hourline shall be drawn removing the string yet    degrees further to the eastwards in the semi circle of position and extending to the equator there shall be a point through which the iii a clock hourline shall be drawn the like for all other afternoon hour lines so often as the string is removed through    degrees on the quadrant so often shall it point out the afternoon distances in the meridian line on the cieling  having thus found out the points in the equator through which the afternoon hour lines are to be drawn i may find the forenoon hourdistances also the same way viz by removing the arch of the quadrant to the west side the meridian as before it was placed on the east and bringing the string to the several    degrees on the west side the quadrant or else i need only measure the distances of each hours distance found in the equator from the meridian line on the cieling for the same number of the hours from xii have the same distance in the equinoctial line on the other side the meridian both before and afternoon the xi a clock hour distance is the same from the meridian line with the i a clock distance on the other side the meridian the x a clock distance the same with the ii a clock distance the ix with the iii etc and thus the distances of all the hour lines are found out on the equator    now if the center of this dyal lay within doors you might draw lines from the center through these pricks in the equator and those lines should be the hour lines as in other dyals but the center of this dyal lies without doors in the air and therefore not convenient for this purpose so that for drawing the hour lines you must consider what angle every hour line in a horizontal dyal makes with the meridian that is at what distance in degrees and minutes the hour lines of an horizontal dyal cut the meridian which you may examine as by operat ii for an angle equal to the complement of the same angle must each respective hour line with the equator on the cieling have  thus upon the point marked for each hours distance in the equinoctial line on the cieling i describe the arches i ii iii iv as in the figure and finding the distance from the meridian of the hour lines of an horizontal dyal to be according to operat ii thus te   a clock hourline    0 whose complement to  0 is    0 te   a clock hourline      whose complement to  0 is      te   a clock hourline      whose complement to  0 is      te   a clock hourline       whose complement to  0 is        i measure in a quadrant of the same radius with those arches already drawn from the equinoctial line for the   a clock hour    0 for the   a clock hour      for the   a clock hour      for the   a clock hour      and transfer the distances to the arches drawn on the cieling for then straight lines drawn through the mark in the arch and through the mark in the equator and prolonged both ways to a convenient length shall be the several hours lines aforesaid and when the sun shines upon the glass at nodus its beams shall reflect upon the hour of the day  some helps to a young dyalist for his more orderly and quick making of dyals it may prove somewhat difficult to those that are unpractised in mathimatical projections to divide a circle into   0 degrees or which is all one a semicircle into   0 or a quadrant into  0 degrees and though i have taught you in the projectioning the horizontal dyal the original way of doing this yet you may do it a spedier way by a line of cords which if you will be curious in your practice you may make your self or if you cacount it not worth your while you may by it already made on box or brass of most mathematical instrument makers this instrument is by them call a  which does not only accommodate you with the divisions of a quadrant but also serves for a ruler to draw straight lines with the manner of making it is as follows  describe upon a smooth at even grained board a quarter of an whole circle as bc whose radius ab or ac may be our inches if you intend to mke large dyals or two inches if small but if you will you may have several lines of chords on your scale or rule divide this quadrant into  0 equal parts as you were taught in the making the horizontal dyal    then draw close by the edge of your straight ruler a line parallel to the edge and at about  part of an inch a second line parallel to that and at about of an inch a third line parallel to both then place one foot of your compasses at the beginning of the first degree on the quadrant described on the board as at b and open the other foot to the end of the first degree and transfer that distance upon your rule from b to the first mark or division between the two first drawn lines then place one foot of your compasses again at the beginning of the first degree on the quadrant described on the board as at b and open the other foot to the end of the second degree and transfer that distance upon your rule from b to the second mark or division between the two first drawn lines and thus measure the distance of every degree from the first degree describe on the quadrant and transfer it to the rule but for distinction sake you may draw every tenth division from the first line parallel to the edge of the third line and mark them in succession from the beginning with  0  0  0 to  0 and the fifth divisions you may draw half way between the second and the third parallel lines the single divisions only between the two first parallel lines so is your lines of chords made  the use of the line of chords as its use is very easy so its convenience is very great for placing one foot of your compasses at the first division on the scale and opening the other to the  0th degree you may with the points of your compasses so extended describe a circle and the several divisions on the scale shall be the degrees of the four quadrants of of that circle as you may try by working backwards to what you were just now taught in the making the scale for as before you measured the distance of the degrees of the quadrant and transferred them to the scale so now you only measure the divisions on the scale and transfer them to the quadrant semicircle or whole circle discribed on your paper for example  if you would measure  0 degrees in your described circle place one foot of your compasses at the beginning of divisions on the scale as at a and extend the other foot to the divisions marked  0 and that distance transferred to the circle shall be the distance of  0 degrees in that circle do the like for any other number of degrees  you may draw your dyal first on a large sheet of paper if your dyal plane be so large if it be not so large draw it on a smaller piece of paper then rub the backside of your paper dyal with small coal till it be well blackt and laying your paper dyal on your dyal plane so that the east west north or south lines of your paper agree exactly with the east west north or south situation of your dyal plane then with wax or pitch fasten the corners of the paper on the plane and laying a straight ruler on the hour lines of your dyal draw with the blunted point of a needle by the side of the ruler and the smallcoal rubbed on the back side of the paper will leave a mark of the lines on the plane  if you will have the lines drawn red you may rub the back side of your paper with vermillion if blew with verditer if yellow with orpiment etc then draw upon these marked lines with oil colors as you please  if your dyal decline far toward the east or west the hour lines unless projected to a very great lenght will run very close to one another therefore in this case you must project your dyal on a large table or sometimes on the floor of a room and cut it off as far as you think good from the center for the further from the center the larger the distance of the hour lines see the figure  an
