afternoon of friday the  th of february having tacked    o february friday   sunday    we stood s w and continued to make sail to the southward till sunset on the   th when a fresh breeze at n e had carried us back again the length of cape palliser of which as the weather was clear we had a good view between the foot of the high land and the sea there is a low flat border off which there are some rocks that appear above water between this cape and cape turnagain the land near the shore is in many places low and flat and has a green and pleasant appearance but farther from the sea it rises into hills the land between cape palliser and cape tierawitte is high and makes in tablepoints    0 february sunday    it also seemed to us to form two bays but we were at too great a distance from this part of the coast to judge accurately from appearances the wind having been variable with calms we had advanced no farther by the   th at noon than latitude       monday    cape palliser then bearing north distant about five leagues and the snowy mountain s    w  tuesday    at noon on the   th we found ourselves in the latitude of      s cape palliser bearing n  0 e distant eight leagues in the afternoon a fresh gale sprung up at n e and we steered s w by w for the southermost land in sight which at sunset bore from us s    w at this time the variation was      e  wednes    at eight oclock in the morning of the   th having run one and twenty leagues s    w since the preceding noon it fell calm we were then abreast of the snowy mountain which bore from us n w and in this direction lay behind a mountainous ridge of nearly the same height which rises directly from the sea and runs parallel with the shore which lies n e n and s w s the north west end of the ridge rises inland not far from cape campbell and both the mountain and the ridge are distinctly seen as well from cape koamaroo as cape palliser from koamaroo they are distant two and twenty leagues s w s and from cape palliser thirty leagues w s w and are of a height sufficient to be seen at a much greater distance at noon this day we were in latitude       s the southermost land in sight bore s w w and some low land that appeared like an island and lay close under the foot of the ridge bore n w by n about five or six leagues  in the afternoon    0 february wednes    when mr banks was out in the boat a shooting we saw with our glasses four double canoes having on board fiftyseven men put off from that shore and make toward him we immediately made signals for him to come on board but the ship with respect to him being right in the wake of the sun he did not see them we were at a considerable distance from the shore and he was at a considerable distance from the ship which was between him and the shore so that it being a dead calm i began to be in some pain for him fearing that he might not see the canoes time enough to reach the ship before they should get up with him soon after however we saw his boat in motion and had the pleasure to take him on board before the indians came up who probably had not seen him as their attention seemed to be wholly fixed upon the ship they came within about a stones cast and then stopped gazing at us with a look of vacant astonishment tupia exerted all his eloquence to prevail upon them to come nearer but without any effect after surveying us for some time they left us and made toward the shore but had not measured more than half the distance between that and the ship before it was dark we imagined that these people had heard nothing of us and could not but remark the different behavior and dispositions of the inhabitants of the different parts of this coast upon their first approaching the vessel these kept aloof with a mixture of timidity and wonder others had immediately commenced hostilities by pelting us with stones the gentleman whom we had found alone fishing in his boat seemed to think us entirely unworthy of his notice and some almost without invitation had come on board with an air of perfect confidence and good will from the behavior of our last visitors i gave the land from which they had put off    0 february wednes    and which as i have before observed had the appearance of an island the name or lookerson  at eight oclock in the evening a breeze sprung up at ssw with which i stretched off south east because some on board thought they saw land in that quarter in this course we continued till six oclock the next morning thursday    when we had run eleven leagues but saw no land except that which we had left having stood to the se with a light breeze which veered from the west to the north till noon our latitude by observation was       s and the high land that we were abreast of the preceding noon bore n n w w in the afternoon we had a light breeze at n e with which we steered west edging in for the land which was distant about eight leagues at seven in the evening we were about six leagues from the shore and the southermost extremity of the land in sight bore w s w  friday    at daybreak on the   th we discovered land bearing s by w and seemingly detached from the coast we were upon about eight a breeze sprung up at n by e and we steered directly for it at noon we were in latitude      s the peak on the snowy mountain bore n  0 e distant twentyseven leagues the southern extremity of the land we could see bore west and the land which had been discovered in the morning appeared like an island extending from s s w to s w by w w distant about eight leagues in the afternoon we stood to the southward of it with a fresh breeze at north at eight in the evening we had run eleven leagues and the land then extended from s w by w to n by w we were then distant about three or four leagues from the nearest shore and in this situation had fifty fathom water with a fine sandy bottom the variation of the compass by this mornings amplitude was       e  at sunrise the next morning    0 february saturday    our opinion that the land we had been standing for was an island was confirmed by our seeing part of the land of tovy poenammoo open to the westward of it extending as far as w by s at eight in the morning the extremes of the island bore n    w and n n e e and an opening near the south point which had the appearance of a bay or harbor n  0 w distant between three and four leagues in this situation we had thirtyeight fathom water with a brown sandy bottom  this island which i named after mr banks bankss island lies about five leagues from the coast of tovy poenammoo the south point bears s    w from the highest peak on the snowy mountain and lies in latitude       s and in longitude      0 w by an observation of the sun and moon which was made this morning it is of a circular figure and about twentyfour leagues in compass it is sufficiently high to be seen at the distance of twelve or fifteen leagues and the land has a broken irregular surface with the appearance rather of barrenness than fertility yet it was inhabited for we saw smoke in one place and a few straggling natives in another  when this island was first discovered in the direction of s by w some persons on board were of opinion that they also saw land bearing s s e and s e by e i was myself upon the deck at the time and told them that in my opinion it was no more than a cloud and that as the sun rose it would dissipate and vanish however as i was determined to leave no subject for disputation which experiment could remove i ordered the ship to be wore and steered e s e by compass in the direction which the land was said to bear from us at that time at noon we were in latitude      s the south point of bankss island bearing north distant five leagues    0 february saturday    by seven oclock at night we had run eight and twenty miles when seeing no land nor any signs of any but that which we had left we bore away s by w and continued upon that course till the next day at noon sunday    when we were in latitude       the south point of bankss island bearing n    0 w distant twentyeight leagues the variation by the azimuth this morning was     0 e as no signs of land had yet appeared to the southward and as i thought that we had stood far enough in that direction to weather all the land we had left judging from the report of the natives in queen charlottes sound i hauled to the westward  we had a moderate breeze at n n w and n till eight in the evening when it became unsettled and at ten fixed at south during the night it blew with such violence that it brought us under our close reefed topsails at eight the next morning monday    having run twentyeight leagues upon a w by n n course and judging ourselves to be to the westward of the land of tovy poenammoo we bore away n w with a fresh gale at south at ten having run eleven miles upon this course we saw land extending from the s w to the n w at the distance of about ten leagues which we hauled up for at noon our latitude by observation was       the south east point of banks island bore n     0 e distant thirty leagues and the main body of the land in sight w by n a head sea prevented us from making much way to the southward at seven in the evening the extremes of the land stretched from s w by s to n by w and at six leagues from the shore we had thirtytwo fathom water tuesday  0 at four oclock the next morning we stood in for the shore w by s and during a course of four leagues our depth of water was from thirtytwo to thirteen fathom when it was thirteen fathom we were but three miles distant from the shore and therefore stood off    0 february tuesday  0 its direction is here nearly n and s the surface to the distance of about five miles from the sea is low and flat but it then rises into hills of a considerable height it appeared to be totally barren and we saw no signs of its being inhabited our latitude at noon was       and the longitude which we made from bankss island to this place was      w during the last twentyfour hours though we carried as much sail as the ship would bear we were driven three leagues to the leeward  we continued to stand off and on all this day and the next wednes    keeping at the distance of between four and twelve leagues from the shore and having water from thirtyfive to fiftythree fathom on the   d at noon we had no observation thursday    but by the land judged ourselves to be about three leagues farther north than we had been the day before at sunset the weather which had been hazey clearing up we saw a mountain which rose in a high peak bearing n w by n and at the same time we saw the land more distinctly than before extending from n to s w by s which at some distance within the coast had a lofty and mountainous appearance we soon found that the accounts which had been given us by the indians in queen charlottes sound of the land to the southward were not true for they had told us that it might be circumnavigated in four days  on the   d friday    having a hollow swell from the s e and expecting wind from the same quarter we kept plying between seven and fifteen leagues from the shore having from seventy to fortyfour fathom at noon our latitude by observation was     0 s and our longitude from bankss island      w from this time to six in the evening it was calm    0 february friday    but a light breeze then springing up at ene we steered s s e all night edging off from the land the hollow swell still continuing our depth of water was from sixty to seventyfive fathom while we were becalmed mr banks being out in the boat shot two port egmont hens which were in every respect the same as those that are found in great numbers upon the island of faro and were the first of the kind we had seen upon this coast though we fell in with some a few days before we made land  saturday    at daybreak the wind freshened and before noon we had a strong gale at nne at eight in the morning we saw the land extending as far as s w by s and steered directly for it at noon we were in latitude       s and the land which now stretched from s w s to nnw appeared to be rudely diversified by hill and valley in the afternoon we steered s w by s and s w edging in for the land with a fresh gale at north but though we were at no great distance the weather was so hazey that we could see nothing distinctly upon it except a ridge of high hills lying not far from the sea and parallel to the coast which in this place stretches s by w and n by e and seemed to end in a high bluff point to the southward by eight in the evening we were abreast of this point but it being then dark and i not knowing which way the land trended we brought to for the night at this time the point bore west and was distant about five miles our depth of water was thirtyseven fathom and the bottom consisted of small pebbles  sunday    at daybreak having made sail the point bore north distant three leagues and we now found that the land trended from it s w by w as far as we could see this point i named cape saunders in honor of sir charles our latitude was       s and longitude       w by the latitude and the angles that are made by the coast    0 february sunday    this point will be sufficiently known there is however about three or four leagues to the south west of it and very near the shore a remarkable saddlehill which is a good direction to it on that quarter from one league to four leagues north of cape saunders the shore forms two or three bays in which there appeared to be good anchorage and effectual shelter from the s w westerly and n westerly winds but my desire of getting to the southward in order to ascertain whether this country was an island or a continent prevented my putting into any of them  we kept at a small distance from the shore all this morning with the wind at s w and had a very distinct view of it it is of a moderate height and the surface is broken by many hills which are green and woody but we saw no appearance of inhabitants at noon cape saunders bore n  0 w distant about four leagues we had variable winds and calms till five oclock in the evening when it fixed at w s w and soon blew so hard that it put us past our topsails and split the foresail all to pieces after getting another to the yard we continued to stand to the southward under two courses and at six the next morning the southermost land in sight bore w by n and cape saunders n by w distant eight leagues monday    at noon it bore n  0 w fourteen leagues and our latitude by observation was       the gale continued with heavy squalls and a large hollow sea all the afternoon and at seven in the evening we lay to under our foresail with the ships head to the southward at noon on the   th tuesday    our latitude was       and our longitude from cape saunders      e at seven in the evening we made sail under our courses wednes    and at eight the next morning set the topsails close reefed at noon our latitude was       and our longitude east from cape saunders    0 at this time we wore and stood to the northward    0 february wednes    in the afternoon we found the variation to be       e at eight in the evening we tacked and stood to the southward with the wind at west  march thursday   at noon this day our latitude by account was       and our longitude from cape saunders     e we stood to the southward till half an hour past three in the afternoon and then being in latitude    s and longitude     w and seeing no appearance of land we tacked and stood to the northward having a large swell from the s w by w at noon the next day friday   our latitude was       s and cape saunders bore n    w distant eightysix miles the south west swell continuing till the  d saturday   confirmed our opinion that there was no land in that quarter at four in the afternoon we stood to the westward with all the sail we could make in the morning of the  th sunday   we found the variation to be       e this day we saw some whales and seals as we had done several times after our having passed the straight but we saw no seal while we were upon the coast of eahienomauwe we sounded both in the night and this morning but had no ground with one hundred and fifty fathom at noon we saw cape saunders bearing n w and our latitude by observation was       s at half an hour past one oclock we saw land bearing w by s which we steered for and before it was dark were within three or four miles of it during the whole night we saw fires upon it and at seven in the morning were within about three leagues of the shore monday   which appeared to be high but level at three oclock in the afternoon we saw the land extending from n e by n to n w n and soon after we discovered some low land which appeared like an island bearing s w we continued our course to the w by s and in two hours we saw high land over the low land extending to the southward as far as s w by s but it did not appear to be joined to the land to the northward so that there is either water    0 march a deep bay or low land between them  at noon on the  th tuesday   we were nearly in the same situation as at noon on the day before in the afternoon we found the variation by several azimuths and the amplitude to be     0 e on the  th at noon wednes   we were in latitude      s and had made twelve miles easting during the last twentyfour hours we stood to the westward the remainder of this day and all the next till sunset thursday   when the extremes of the land bore from n by e to w distant about seven or eight leagues in this situation our depth of water was fiftyfive fathom and the variation by amplitude      e the wind now veered from the n to the w and as we had fine weather and moonlight we kept standing close upon the wind to the s w all night at four in the morning friday   we had sixty fathom water and at daylight we discovered under our bow a ledge of rocks extending from s by w to w by s upon which the sea broke very high they were not more than three quarters of a mile distant yet we had five and forty fathom water as the wind was at n w we could not now weather them and as i was unwilling to run to leeward i tacked and made a trip to the eastward the wind however soon after coming to the northward enabled us to get clear of all our soundings while we were passing within the ledge were from thirtyfive to fortyseven fathom with a rocky bottom  this ledge lies s e six leagues from the southermost part of the land and s e by e from some remarkable hills which stand near the shore about three leagues to the northward of it there is another ledge which lies full three leagues from the shore and on which the sea broke in a dreadful surf as we passed these rocks to the north in the night    0 march friday   and discovered the others under our bow at break of day it is manifest that our danger was imminent and our escape critical in the highest degree from the situation of these rocks so well adapted to catch unwary strangers i called them the traps our latitude at noon was       s the land in sight which had the appearance of an island extended from n e by n to n w by w and seemed to be about five leagues distant from the main the eastermost ledge of rocks bore s s e distant one league and an half and the northermost n e e distant about three leagues this land is high and barren with nothing upon it but a few straggling shrubs for not a single tree was to be seen it was however remarkable for a number of white patches which i took to be marble as they reflected the suns rays very strongly other patches of the same kind we had observed in different parts of this country particularly in mercury bay we continued to stand close upon a wind to the westward and at sunset the southermost point of land bore n    e distant four leagues and the westermost land in sight bore n   e the point which lies in latitude       s longitude        w i named south cape the westermost land was a small island lying off the point of the main  supposing south cape to be the southern extremity of this country as indeed it proved to be i hoped to get round it by the west for a large hollow swell from the south west ever since our last hard gale had convinced me that there was no land in that direction  saturday  0 in the night we had a hard gale at n e by n and n which brought us under our courses but about eight in the morning it became moderate and at noon veering to the west we tacked and stood to the northward having no land in sight our latitude by observation was       s our longitude west from the south cape       0 march we stood away n n e close upon a wind without seeing any land till two the next morning sunday    when we discovered an island bearing n w by n distant about five leagues about two hours afterward we saw land ahead upon which we tacked and stood off till six when we stood in to take a nearer view of it at eleven we were within three leagues of it but the wind seeming to incline upon the shore i tacked and stood off to the southward we had now sailed round the land which we had discovered on the  th and which then did not appear to be joined to the main which lay north of it and being now come to the other side of what we supposed to be water a bay or low land it had the same appearance but when i came to lay it down upon paper i saw no reason to suppose it to be an island on the contrary i was clearly of opinion that it made part of the main at noon the western extremity of the main bore n    w and the island which we had seen in the morning s    w distant about five leagues it lies in latitude       s longitude        w and is nothing but a barren rock about a mile in circuit remarkably high and lies full five leagues distant from the main this island i named after dr solander and called it solanders island the shore of the main lies nearest e by s and w by n and forms a large open bay in which there is no appearance of any harbor or shelter for shipping against s w and southerly winds the surface of the country is broken into craggy hills of a great height on the summits of which are several patches of snow it is not however wholly barren for we could see wood not only in the valleys but upon the highest ground yet we saw no appearance of its being inhabited  we continued to stand to the s w by s till eleven oclock the next morning monday    when the wind shifted to the s w by w upon which we wore    0 march and stood to the n n w being then in latitude     0 s longitude      0 w and having a hollow sea from the s w  tuesday    during the night we steered n n w till six in the morning when seeing no land we steered n by e till eight when we steered n e by e e to make the land which at ten we saw bearing e n e but it being hazy we could distinguish nothing upon it at noon our latitude by observation was    s about two it cleared up and the land appeared to be high rude and mountainous about half an hour after three i hauled in for a bay in which there appeared to be good anchorage but in about an hour finding the distance too great to run before it would be dark and the wind blowing too hard to make the attempt safe in the night i bore away along the shore  this bay which i called dusky bay lies in latitude       s it is between three and four miles broad at the entrance and seems to be full as deep as it is broad it contains several islands behind which there must be shelter from all winds though possibly there may not be sufficient depth of water the north point of this bay when it bears s e by s is rendered very remarkable by five high peaked rocks which lie off it and have the appearance of the four fingers and thumb of a mans hand for which reason i called it point five fingers the land of this point is farther remarkable for being the only level land within a considerable distance it extends near two leagues to the northward is lofty and covered with wood the land behind it is very different consisting wholly of mountains totally barren and rocky and this difference gives the cape the appearance of an island  at sunset the southermost land in sight bore due south    0 march tuesday    distant about five or six leagues and as this is the westermost point of land upon the whole coast i called it west cape it lies about three leagues to the southward of dusky bay in the latitude of       s and in the longitude of        w the land of this cape is of a moderate height next the sea and has nothing remarkable about it except a very white cliff two or three leagues to the southward of it to the southward of it also the land trends away to the s e and to the northward it trends n n e  having brought to for the night wednes    we made sail along the shore at four in the morning in the direction of n e n with a moderate breeze at s s e at noon our latitude by observation was       s at this time being about a league and an half from the shore we sounded but had no ground with seventy fathom we had just passed a small narrow opening in land where there seemed to be a very safe and convenient harbor formed by an island which lay in the middle of the opening at east the opening lies in latitude       s and on the land behind it are mountains the summits of which were covered with snow that appeared to have been recently fallen and indeed for two days past we had found the weather very cold on each side the entrance of the opening the land rises almost perpendicularly from the sea to a stupendous height and this indeed was the reason why i did not carry the ship into it for no wind could blow there but right in or right out in the direction of either east or west and i thought it by no means advisable to put into a place whence i could not have got out but with a wind which experience had taught me did not blow more than one day in a month in this however i acted contrary to the opinion of some persons on board who in very strong terms expressed their desire to harbor for present convenience    0 march wednes    without any regard to future disadvantages  in the evening being about two leagues from the shore we sounded and had no ground with  0  fathom the variation of the needle by azimuth was    e and by amplitude      we made the best of our way along the shore with what wind we had keeping at the distance of between two and three leagues at noon we were in latitude       having run only twelve leagues upon a ne n course during the last four and twenty hours  we continued to steer along the shore in the direction of ne e till six oclock in the evening when we brought to for the night thursday    at four in the morning we stood in for the land and when the day broke we saw what appeared to be an inlet but upon a nearer approach proved to be only a deep valley between two high lands we proceeded therefore in the same course keeping the shore at the distance of between four and five miles friday    at noon on the   th the northermost point of land in sight bore n  0 e at the distance of ten miles and our latitude by observation was      our longitude from cape west     e about two we past the point which at noon had been distant ten miles and found it to consist of high red cliffs down which there fell a cascade of water in four small streams and i therefore gave it the name of cascade point from this point the land trends first n    e and afterward more to the northward at the distance of eight leagues from cascade point in the direction of ene and at a little distance from the shore lies a small low island which bore from us s by e at the distance of about a league and a half  at seven in the evening we brought to    0 march in thirtythree fathom with a fine sandy bottom at ten we had fifty fathom and at twelve wore in sixtyfive fathom having driven several miles nnw after our having brought to saturday    at two in the morning we had no ground with   0 fathom by which it appears that the soundings extend but a little way from the shore about this time it fell calm at eight a breeze sprung up at sw with which we steered along the shore in the direction of ne by e e at the distance of about three leagues at six in the evening being about one league from the shore we had seventeen fathom and at eight being about three leagues from the shore we had fortyfour we now shortened sail and brought to having run ten leagues ne by e since noon  it was calm most part of the night sunday    but at ten in the morning a light breeze sprung up at sw by w when we made sail again along the shore ne by n having a large swell from the wsw which had risen in the night at noon our latitude by observation was      s and our longitude from cape west      e we observed that the valleys as well as the mountains were this morning covered with snow part of which we supposed to have fallen during the night when we had rain at six in the evening we shortened sail and at ten brought to at the distance of about five leagues from the shore where we had     fathom at midnight there being little wind we made sail monday    and at eight in the morning we stood to the ne close upon a wind till noon when we tacked being about three leagues from the land and by observation in latitude      and longitude from cape west     e  we continued to stand westward till two in the morning tuesday  0 when we made a trip to the eastward and afterward stood westward till noon when by our reckoning we were in the latitude of          0 march and longitude from cape west      e we now tacked and stood eastward with a fresh gale at n by w till six in the evening when the wind shifted to the s and ssw with which we steered ne by n till six in the morning wednes    when we hauled in e by n to make the land which we saw soon afterward at noon our latitude by account was       and our longitude from cape west      e we were now within three or four leagues of the land but it being foggy we could see nothing upon it distinctly and as we had much wind and a vast swell rolling in upon the shore from the wsw i did not think it safe to go nearer  in the afternoon we had a gentle breeze from the ssw with which we steered north along the shore till eight when being within between two and three leagues we sounded and had but thirtyfour fathom upon which we hauled off nw by n till eleven at night and then brought to having sixtyfour fathom thursday    at four in the morning we made sail to the ne with a light breeze at ssw which at eight veered to the westward and soon after died away at this time we were within three or four miles of the land and had fiftyfour fathom with a large swell from the wsw rolling obliquely upon the shore which made me fear that i should be obliged to anchor but by the help of a light air now and then from the sw i was able to keep the ship from driving at noon the northermost land in sight bore ne by e e distant about ten leagues our latitude by account was  0    s longitude from cape west      e from this time we had light airs from the southward with intervals of calm friday    till noon on the   d when our latitude by observation was  0     0 s and our longitude from cape west      e the eastermost point of land in sight bore e  0 n at the distance of seven leagues and a bluff head or point of which we had been abreast at noon the day before and off which lay some rocks above water    0 march friday    bore s    w at the distance of six leagues this point i called rocks point our latitude was now  0    s and having nearly run down the whole of the north west coast of tovy poenammoo i shall give some account of the face of the country  i have already observed that on the   th when we were off the southern part the land then seen was craggy and mountainous and there is great reason to believe that the same ridge of mountains extends nearly the whole length of the island between the westermost land which we saw that day and the eastermost which we saw on the   th there is a space of about six or eight leagues of which we did not see the coast though we plainly discovered the mountains inland the sea coast near cape west is low rising with an easy and gradual ascent to the foot of the mountains and being in most parts covered with wood from point five fingers down to latitude     0 there is a narrow ridge of hills that rises directly from the sea and is covered with wood close behind these hills are the mountains extending in another ridge of a stupendous height and consisting of rocks that are totally barren and naked except where they are covered with snow which is to be seen in large patches upon many parts of them and has probably lain there ever since the creation of the world a prospect more rude craggy and desolate than this country affords from the sea cannot possibly be conceived for as far inland as the eye can reach nothing appears but the summits of rocks which stand so near together that instead of valleys there is only fissures between them from the latitude of     0 to the latitude of      these mountains lie farther inland and the sea coast consists of woody hills and valleys    0 march friday    of various height and extent and has much appearance of fertility many of the valleys form plains of considerable extent wholly covered with wood but it is very probable that the ground in many places is swampy and interspersed with pools of water from latitude      to     0 the land is not distinguished by any thing remarkable it rises into hills directly from the sea and is covered with wood but the weather being foggy while we were upon this part of the coast we could see very little inland except now and then the summits of the mountains towering above the cloudy mists that obscured them below which confirmed my opinion that a chain of mountains extended from one end of the island to the other  in the afternoon we had a gentle breeze at sw which before it was quite dark brought us abreast of the eastern point which we had seen at noon but not knowing what course the land took on the other side of it we brought to in thirtyfour fathom at the distance of about one league from the shore at eight in the evening there being little wind we filled and stood on till midnight and then we brought to till four in the morning saturday    when we again made sail and at break of day we saw low land extending from the point to the sse as far as the eye could reach the eastern extremity of which appeared in round hillocks by this time the gale had veered to the eastward which obliged us to ply to windward sunday    at noon next day the eastern point bore sw by s distant sixteen miles and our latitude was  0    the wind continuing easterly we were nearly in the same situation at noon on the day following monday    about three oclock the wind came to the westward and we steered ese with all the sail we could set till it was dark and then shortened sail till the morning tuesday    as we had thick hazey weather all night we kept sounding continually    0 march tuesday    and had from thirtyseven to fortytwo fathom when the day broke we saw land bearing se by e and an island lying near it bearing ese distant about five leagues this island i knew to be the same that i had seen from the entrance of queen charlottes sound from which it bears nw by n distant nine leagues at noon it bore south distant four or five miles and the north west head of the sound se by s distant ten leagues and an half our latitude by observation was  0    s  as we had now circumnavigated the whole country it became necessary to think of quitting it but as i had thirty tons of empty water casks on board this could not be done till i had filled them i therefore hauled round the island and entered a bay which lies between that and queen charlottes sound leaving three more islands which lay close under the western shore between three or four miles within the entrance on our starboard hand while we were running in we kept the lead continually going and had from forty to twelve fathom at six oclock in the evening we anchored in eleven fathom with a muddy bottom under the west shore in the second cove that lies within the three islands and as soon as it was light the next morning wednes    i took a boat and went on shore to look for a wateringplace and a proper birth for the ship both which i found much to my satisfaction as soon as the ship was moored i sent an officer on shore to superintend the watering and the carpenter with his crew to cut wood while the longboat was employed in landing the empty casks  in this employment we were busy till the  0th friday  0 when the wind seeming to settle at se and our water being nearly completed we warped the ship out of the cove that we might have room to get under sail and at noon i went away in the pinnace to examine as much of the bay as my time would admit    0 march friday  0   after rowing about two leagues up it i went ashore upon a point of land on the western side and having climbed a hill i saw the western arm of this bay run in sw by w about five leagues farther yet i could not discover the end of it there appeared to be several other inlets or at least small bays between this and the north west head of queen charlottes sound in each of which i make no doubt there is anchorage and shelter as they are all covered from the sea wind by the islands which lie without them the land about this bay as far as i could see of it is of a hilly surface chiefly covered with trees shrubs and fern which render traveling difficult and fatiguing in this excursion i was accompanied by mr banks and dr solander who found several new plants we met with some hutts which seemed to have been long deserted but saw no inhabitants mr banks examined several of the stones that lay upon the beach which were full of veins and had a mineral appearance but he did not discover any thing in them which he knew to be ore if he had had an opportunity to examine any of the bare rocks perhaps he might have been more fortunate he was also of opinion that what i had taken for marble in another place was a mineral substance and that considering the correspondence of latitude between this place and south america it was not improbable but that by a proper examination something very valuable might be found  at my return in the evening i found all the wood and water on board and the ship ready for the sea i resolved therefore to quit the country and return home by such a route as might be of most advantage to the service and upon this subject took the opinion of my officers    0 march friday  0 i had myself a strong desire to return by cape horn because that would have enabled me finally to determine whether there is or is not a southern continent but against this it was a sufficient objection that we must have kept in a high southern latitude in the very depth of winter with a vessel which was not thought sufficient for the undertaking and the same reason was urged against our proceeding directly for the cape of good hope with still more force because no discovery of moment could be hoped for in that rout it was therefore resolved that we should return by the east indies and that with this view we should upon leaving the coast steer westward till we should fall in with the east coast of new holland and then follow the direction of that coast to the northward till we should arrive at its northern extremity but if that should be found impracticable it was further resolved that we should endeavor to fall in with the land or islands said to have been discovered by quiros  with this view saturday    at break of day on saturday the   st of march    0 we got under sail and put to sea with the advantage of a fresh gale at s e and clear weather taking our departure from the eastern point which we had seen at noon on the   d and to which on this occasion i gave the name of cape farewell  the bay out of which we had just sailed i called admiralty bay giving the name of cape stephens to the north west point and of cape jackson to the south east after the two gentlemen who at this time were secretaries to the board  admiralty bay may easily be known by the island that has been just mentioned which lies two miles n e of cape stephens in latitude  0    s longitude       w and is of a considerable height between this island and cape farewell which are between fourteen and fifteen leagues distant from each other    0 march saturday    in the direction of w by n and e by s the shore forms a large deep bay the bottom of which we could scarcely see while we were sailing in a strait line from one cape to the other it is however probably of less depth than it appeared to be for as we found the water shallower here than at the same distance from any other part of the coast there is reason to suppose that the land at the bottom which lies next the sea is low and therefore not easily to be distinguished from it i have for this reason called it blind bay and am of opinion that it is the same which was called murderers bay by tasman  such particulars of this country and its inhabitants with their manners and customs as could be learnt while we were circumnavigating the coast shall now be related  chap viii a general account of new zealand its first discovery situation extent climate and productions new zealand was first discovered by abel jansen tasman a dutch navigator    0 march whose name has been several times mentioned in this narrative on the   th of december in the year      he traversed the eastern coast from latitude    to    and entered the straight which divides the two islands and in the chart is called cooks straight but being attacked by the natives soon after he came to an anchor in the place to which he gave the name of murderers bay he never went on shore he gave the country the name of staaten land or the land of the states in honor of the states general and it is now generally distinguished in our maps and charts by the name of new zealand as the whole of this country except that part of the coast which was seen by tasman from on board his ship has from his time to the voyage of the endeavor remained altogether unknown it has by many been supposed to be part of a southern continent it is however now known to consist of two large islands divided from each other by a straight or passage which is about four or five leagues broad  these islands are situated between the latitudes of    and    s and between the longitudes of     and     w which is now determined with uncommon exactness from innumerable observations of the sun and moon and one of the transits of mercury    0 march by mr green a person of known abilities who as has been observed before was sent out by the royal society to observe the transit of venus in the south seas  the northermost of these islands is called by the natives eaheinomauwe and the southermost tovy or tavai poenammoo yet as i have observed before we are not sure whether the name tovy poenammoo comprehends the whole southern island or only part of it the figure and extent of these islands with the situation of the bays and harbors they contain and the smaller islands that lie about them will appear from the chart that i have drawn every part of which however i cannot vouch to be equally accurate the coast of eaheinomauwe from cape palliser to east cape is laid down with great exactness both in its figure and the course and distance from point to point for the opportunities that offered and the methods that i used were such as could scarcely admit of an error from east cape to st maria van diemen the chart though perhaps not equally exact is without any error of moment except possibly in some few places which are here and in other parts of the chart distinguished by a dotted line and which i had no opportunity to examine from cape maria van diemen to latitude       we were seldom nearer the shore than between five and eight leagues and therefore the line that marks the sea coast may possibly be erroneous from latitude       to nearly the length of entry island our course was very near the shore and in this part of the chart therefore there can be no material error except perhaps at cape tierawitte between entry island and cape palliser we were again farther from the shore and this part of the coast therefore may not be laid down with minute exactness yet upon the whole i am of opinion that this island will be found not much to differ from the figure that i have given it    0 march and that upon the coast there are few or no harbors which are not noticed in the journal or delineated in the chart i cannot however say as much of tovy poenammoo the season of the year and the circumstances of the voyage would not permit me to spend so much time about this island as i had employed upon the other and the storms that we met with made it both difficult and dangerous to keep near the shore however from queen charlottes sound to cape campbel and as far to the sw as latitude    the chart will be found pretty accurate between latitude    and latitude     0 the line may be doubted for of some part of the coast which it represents we had scarcely a view from latitude     0 to cape saunders our distance would not permit me to be particular and the weather was besides extremely unfavourable from cape saunders to cape south and even to cape west there is also reason to fear that the chart will in many places be found erroneous as we were seldom able to keep the shore and were sometimes blown to such a distance that it could not be seen from cape west to cape farewell and even to charlottes sound it is not more to be trusted  tovy poenammoo is for the most part a mountainous country and to all appearance a barren country and the people whom we saw in queen charlottes sound those that came off to us under the snowy mountains and the fires to the west of cape saunders were all the inhabitants and signs of inhabitants that we discovered upon the whole island  eaheinomauwe has a much better appearance it is indeed not only hilly but mountainous yet even the hills and mountains are covered with wood and every valley has a rivulet of water    0 march the soil in these valleys and in the plains of which there are many that are not overgrown with wood is in general light but fertile and in the opinion of mr banks and dr solander as well as of every other gentleman on board every kind of european grain plants and fruit would flourish here in the utmost luxuriance from the vegetables that we found here there is reason to conclude that the winters are milder than those in england and we found the summer not hotter though it was more equally warm so that if this country should be settled by people from europe they would with a little industry be very soon supplied not only with the necessaries but the luxuries of life in great abundance  quadrupeds in this country there are no quadrupeds but dogs and rats at least we saw no other and the rats are so scarce that many of us never saw them the dogs live with the people who breed them for no other purpose than to eat there might indeed be quadrupeds that we did not see but this is not probable because the chief pride of the natives with respect to their dress is in the skins and hair of such animals as they have and we never saw the skin of any animal about them but those of dogs and birds there are indeed seals upon the coast and we once saw a sea lion but we imagine they are seldom caught for though we saw some of their teeth which were fashioned into an ornament like a bodkin and worn by the natives at their breast and highly valued we saw none of their skins there are whales also upon this coast and though the people did not appear to have any art or instrument by which such an animal could be taken and killed we saw pattoopattoos in the possession of some of them which were made of the bone of a whale or of some other animal whose bone had exactly the same appearance  of birds the species are not many and of these none    0 march birds except perhaps the gannet is the same with those of europe here are ducks indeed and shags of several kinds sufficiently resembling those of europe to be called the same by those who have not examined them very nicely here are also hawks owls and quails which differ but little from those of europe at first sight and several small birds whose song as has been remarked in the course of the narrative is much more melodious than any that we had ever heard  the sea coast is also visited by many oceanic birds particularly albatrosses sheerwaters pintados and a few of the birds which sir john narborough has called penguins and which indeed are what the french call nuance and seem to be a middle species between bird and fish for their feathers especially those upon their wings differ very little from scales and their wings themselves which they use only in diving and not to accelerate their motion even upon the surface of the water may perhaps with equal propriety be called fins  neither are insects in greater plenty than birds a few butterflies and beetles flesh flies very like those in europe and some musquitos and sand flies perhaps exactly the same with those of north america make up the whole catalogue of musquitos and sand flies however which are justly accounted the curse of every country where they abound we did not see many there were indeed a few in almost every place where we went on shore but they gave us so little trouble that we did not make use of the shades which we had provided for the security of our faces  for this scarcity of animals upon the land the sea however makes an abundant recompense every creek swarming with fish    0 march fish which are not only wholesome but equally delicious with those of europe the ship seldom anchored in any station or with a light gale passed any place that did not afford us enough with hook and line to serve the whole ships company especially to the southward when we lay at anchor the boats with hook and line near the rocks could take fish in any quantity and the seine seldom failed of producing a still more ample supply so that both times when we anchored in cooks straight every mess in the ship that was not careless and improvident salted as much as lasted many weeks after they went to sea of this article the variety was equal to the plenty we had mackrel of many kinds among which one was exactly the same as we have in england these came in immense shoals and were taken by the natives in their seines who sold them to us at a very easy rate besides these there were fish of many species which we had never seen before but to all which the seamen very readily gave names so that we talked here as familiarly of hakes bream colefish and many others as we do in england and though they are by no means of the same family at must be confessed that they do honor to the name but the highest luxury which the sea afforded us even in this place was the lobster or sea crayfish which are probably the same that in the account of lord ansons voyage are said to have been found at the island of juan fernandes except that although large they are not quite equal in size they differ from ours in england in several particulars they have a greater number of prickles on their backs and they are red when first taken out of the water these we also bought every where to the northward in great quantities of the natives who catch them by diving near the shore and finding out where they lie with their feet we had also a fish that frezier in his voyage to the spanish main in south america has described by the names of elefant pejegallo    0 march or poison coq which though coarse we eat very heartily several species of the skate or stingray are also found here which were still coarser than the elefant but as an atonement we had among many kinds of dogfish one spotted with white which was in flavor exactly similar to our best skate but much more delicious we had also flat fish resembling both soles and flounders besides eels and congers of various kinds with many others of which those who shall hereafter visit this coast will not fail to find the advantage and shellfish in great variety particularly clams cockles and oysters  among the vegetable productions of this country trees plants etc the trees claim a principal place for here are forests of vast extent full of the straitest the cleanest and the largest timber trees that we had ever seen their size their grain and apparent durability render them fit for any kind of building and indeed for every other purpose except masts for which as i have already observed they are too hard and too heavy there is one in particular which when we were upon the coast was rendered conspicuous by a scarlet flower that seemed to be a compendage of many fibers it is about as large as an oak and the wood is exceedingly hard and heavy and excellently adapted to the use of the millwright there is another which grows in the swamps remarkably tall and strait thick enough to make masts for vessels of any size and if a judgment may be formed by the direction of its grain very tough this which as has been before remarked our carpenter thought to resemble the pitchpine may probably be lightened by tapping and it will then make the finest masts in the world it has a leaf not unlike a yew and bears berries in small bunches     0 march great part of the country is covered with a luxuriant verdure and our natural historians were gratified by the novelty if not the variety of the plants sowthistle garden nightshade one or two kinds of grass the same as in england and two or three kinds of fern like those of the west indies with a few of the plants that are to be found in almost every part of the world were all out of about four hundred species that have hitherto been described by any botanists or had been seen elsewhere during the course of this voyage except about five or six which had been gathered at terra del fuego  of eatable vegetables there are but few our people indeed who had been long at sea eat with equal pleasure and advantage of wild celery and a kind of cresses which grew in great abundance upon all parts of the seashore we also once or twice met with a plant like what the country people in england call lambs quarters or fathen which we boiled instead of greens and once we had the good fortune to find a cabbage tree which afforded us a delicious meal and except the fernroot and one other vegetable totally unknown in europe and which though eaten by the natives was extremely disagreeable to us we found no other vegetable production that was fit for food among those that appeared to be the wild produce of the country and we could find but three esculent plants among those which are raised by cultivation yams sweet potatoes and coccos of the yams and potatoes there are plantations consisting of many acres and i believe that any ship which should happen to be here in the autumn when they are dug up might purchase them in any quantity  gourds are also cultivated by the natives of this place the fruit of which furnishes them with vessels for various uses we also found here the chinese paper mulberry tree    0 march the same as that of which the inhabitants of the south sea islands make their cloth but it is so scarce that though the new zealanders also make cloth of it they have not enough for any other purpose than to wear as an ornament in the holes which they make in their ears as i have observed before  but among all the trees shrubs and plants of this country there is not one that produces fruit except a berry which has neither sweetness nor flavor and which none but the boys took pains to gather should be honored with that appellation there is however a plant that serves the inhabitants instead of hemp and flax which excels all that are put to the same purposes in other countries of this plant there are two sorts the leaves of both resemble those of flags but the flowers are smaller and their clusters more numerous in one kind they are yellow and in the other a deep red of the leaves of these plants with very little preparation they make all their common apparel and of these they make also their strings lines and cordage for every purpose which are so much stronger than any thing we can make with hemp that they will not bear a comparison from the same plant by another preparation they draw long slender fibers which shine like silk and are as white as snow of these which are also surprisingly strong the finer clothes are made and of the leaves without any other preparation than splitting them into proper breadths and tying the strips together they make their fishing nets some of which as i have before remarked are of an enormous size  a plant which with such advantage might be applied to so many useful and important purposes would certainly be a great acquisition to england    0 march where it would probably thrive with very little trouble as it seems to be hardy and to affect no particular soil being found equally in hill and valley in the driest mould and the deepest bogs the bog however it seems rather to prefer as near such places we observed it to be larger than elsewhere  i have already observed that we found great plenty of iron sand in mercury bay and therefore that iron ore is undoubtedly to be found at no great distance as to other metals we had scarcely knowledge enough of the country for conjecture  if the settling of this country should ever be thought an object worthy the attention of great britain the best place for establishing a colony would be either on the banks of the thames or in the country bordering upon the bay of islands in either place there would be the advantage of an excellent harbor and by means of the river settlements might be extended and a communication established with the inland parts of the country vessels might be built of the fine timber which abounds in these parts at very little trouble and expense fit for such a navigation as would answer the purpose i cannot indeed exactly assign the depth of water which a vessel intended to navigate this river even as far up as i went with the boat should draw because this depends upon the depth of water that is upon the bar or flats which lie before the narrow part of the river for i had no opportunity to make myself acquainted with them but i am of opinion that a vessel which should draw not more than twelve feet would perfectly answer the purpose  people when we first arrived upon the coast of this country we imagined it to be much better peopled than we afterward found it    0 march concluding that the inland parts were populous from the smoke that we saw at a considerable distance from the shore and perhaps that may really be the case with respect to the country behind poverty bay and the bay of plenty where the inhabitants appeared to be more numerous than in other places but we had reason to believe that in general no part of the country but the sea coast is inhabited and even there we found the people but thinly scattered all the western coast from cape maria van diemen to mount egmont being totally desolate so that upon the whole the number of inhabitants bears no proportion to the extent of country  chap ix a description of the inhabitants their habitations apparel ornaments food cookery and manner of life    0 march the stature of the men in general is equal to the largest of those in europe they are stout well limbed and fleshy but not fat like the lazy and luxurious inhabitants of the islands in the south seas they are also exceedingly vigorous and active and have an adroitness and manual dexterity in an uncommon degree which are discovered in whatever they do i have seen the strokes of fifteen paddles on a side in one of their canoes made with incredible quickness and yet with such minute exactness of time that all the rowers seemed to be actuated by one common soul their color in general is brown but in few deeper than that of a spaniard who has been exposed to the sun in many not so deep the women have not a feminine delicacy in their appearance but their voice is remarkably soft and by that the dress of both sexes being the same they are principally distinguished they have however like the women of other countries more airy cheerfulness and a greater flow of animal spirits than the other sex their hair both of the head and beard is black and their teeth extremely regular and as white as ivory the features of both sexes are good they seem to enjoy high health and we saw many who appeared to be of a great age the dispositions both of the men and women seemed to be mild and gentle they treat each other with the tenderest affection    0 march but are implacable toward their enemies to whom as i have before observed they never give quarter it may perhaps at first seem strange that where there is so little to be got by victory there should so often be war and that every little district of a country inhabited by people so mild and placid should be at enmity with all the rest but possibly more is to be gained by victory among these people than at first appears and they may be prompted to mutual hostilities by motives which no degree of friendship or affection is able to resist it appears by the account that has already been given of them that their principal food is fish which can only be procured upon the seacoast and there in sufficient quantities only at certain times the tribes therefore who live inland if any such there are and even those upon the coast must be frequently in danger of perishing by famine their country produces neither sheep nor goats nor hogs nor cattle tame fowls they have none nor any art by which those that are wild can be caught in sufficient plenty to serve as provision if there are any whose situation cuts them off from a supply of fish the only succedaneum of all other animal food except dogs they have nothing to support life but the vegetables that have already been mentioned of which the chief are fern root yams clams and potatoes when by any accident these fail the distress must be dreadful and even among the inhabitants of the coast many tribes must frequently be reduced to nearly the same situation either by the failure of their plantations or the deficiency of their dry stock during the season when but few fish are to be caught these considerations will enable us to account not only for the perpetual danger in which the people who inhabit this country appear to live by the care which they take to fortify every village but for the horrid practice of eating those who are killed in battle    0 march for the hunger of him who is pressed by famine to fight will absorb every feeling and every sentiment which would restrain him from allaying it with the body of his adversary it may however be remarked that if this account of the origin of so horrid a practice is true the mischief does by no means end with the necessity that produced it after the practice has been once begun on one side by hunger it will naturally be adopted on the other by revenge nor is this all for though it may be pretended by some who wish to appear speculative and philosophical that whether the dead body of an enemy be eaten or buried is in itself a a matter perfectly indifferent as it is whether the breasts and thighs of a woman should be covered or naked and that prejudice and habit only make us shudder at the violation of custom in one instance and blush at it in the other yet leaving this as a point of doubtful disputation to be discussed at leisure it may safely be affirmed that the practice of eating human flesh whatever it may be in itself is relatively and in its consequences most pernicious tending manifestly to eradicate a principle which is the chief security of human life and more frequently restrains the hand of murder than the sense of duty or even the fear of punishment  among those who are accustomed to eat the dead death must have lost much of its horror and where there is little horror at the sight of death there will not be much repugnance to kill a sense of duty and fear of punishment may be more easily surmounted than the feelings of nature or those which have been engrafted upon nature by early prejudice and uninterrupted custom the horror of the murderer arises less from the guilt of the fact than its natural effect and he who has familiarised the effect will consequently lose much of the horror by our laws and our religion murder and theft incur the same punishment    0 march both in this world and the next yet of the multitude who would deliberately steal there are but very few who would deliberately kill even to procure much greater advantage but there is the strongest reason to believe that those who have been so accustomed to prepare a human body for a meal that they can with as little feeling cut up a dead man as our cookmaids divide a dead rabbit for a fricassee would feel as little horror in committing a murder as in picking a pocket and consequently would take away life with as little compunction as property so that men under these circumstances would be made murderers by the slight temptations that now make them thieves if any man doubts whether this reasoning is conclusive let him ask himself whether in his own opinion he should not be safer with a man in whom the horror of destroying life is strong whether in consequence of natural instinct unsubdued or of early prejudice which has nearly an equal influence than in the power of a man who under any temptation to murder him would be restrained only by considerations of interest for to these all motives of mere duty may be reduced as they must terminate either in hope of good or fear of evil  the situation and circumstances however of these poor people as well as their temper are favorable to those who shall settle as a colony among them their situation sets them in need of protection and their temper renders it easy to attach them by kindness and whatever may be said in favor of a savage life among people who live in luxurious idleness upon the bounty of nature civilization would certainly be a blessing to those whom her parsimony scarcely furnishes with the bread of life and who are perpetually destroying each other by violence as the only alternative of perishing by hunger     0 march but these people from whatever cause being inured to war and by habit considering every stranger as an enemy were always disposed to attack us when they were not intimidated by our manifest superiority at first they had no notion of any superiority but numbers and when this was on their side they considered all our expressions of kindness as the artifices of fear and cunning to circumvent them and preserve ourselves but when they were once convinced of our power after having provoked us to the use of our firearms though loaded only with small shot and of our clemency by our forbearing to make use of weapons so dreadful except in our defense they became at once friendly and even affectionate placing in us the most unbounded confidence and doing every thing which could incite us to put equal confidence in them it is also remarkable that when an intercourse was once established between us they were very rarely detected in any act of dishonesty before indeed and while they considered us as enemies who came upon their coast only to make an advantage of them they did not scruple by any means to make an advantage of us and would therefore when they had received the price of any thing they had offered to sell pack up both the purchase and the purchasemoney with all possible composure as so much lawful plunder from people who had no view but to plunder them  i have observed that our friends in the south seas had not even the idea of indecency with respect to any object or any action but this was by no means the case with the inhabitants of new zealand in whose carriage and conversation there was as much modest reserve and decorum with respect to actions which yet in their opinion were not criminal as are to be found among the politest people in europe the women were not impregnable but the terms and manner of compliance were as decent as those in marriage among us    0 march and according to their notions the agreement was as innocent when any of our people made an overture to one of their young women he was given to understand that the consent of her friends was necessary and by the influence of a proper present it was generally obtained but when these preliminaries were settled it was also necessary to treat the wife for a night with the same delicacy that is here required by the wife for life and the lover who presumed to take any liberties by which this was violated was sure to be disappointed  one of our gentlemen having made his addresses to a family of the better sort received an answer which translated into our language according to the mode and spirit of it as well as the letter would have been exactly in these terms any of these young ladies will think themselves honored by your addresses but you must first make me a suitable present and you must then come and sleep with us on shore for daylight must by no means be a witness of what passes between you  i have already observed that in personal cleanliness they are not quite equal to our friends at otaheite because not having the advantage of so warm a climate they do not so often go into the water but the most disgustful thing about them is the oil with which like the islanders they anoint their hair it is certainly the fat either of fish or of birds melted down and though the better sort have it fresh their inferiors use that which is rancid and consequently are almost as disagreeable to the smell as a hottentot neither are their heads free from vermin though we observed that they were furnished with combs both of bone and wood these combs are sometimes worn stuck upright in the hair as an ornament    0 march a fashion which at present prevails among the ladies of england the men generally wear their beards short and their hair tied upon the crown of the head in a bunch in which they stick the feathers of various birds in different manners according to their fancies sometimes one is placed on each side of the temples pointing forwards which we thought made a very disagreeable appearance the women wear their hair sometimes cropped short and sometimes flowing over their shoulders  the bodies of both sexes are marked with the black stains called amoco by the same method that is used at otaheite and called tattowing but the men are more marked and the women less the women in general stain no part of their bodies but the lips though sometimes they are marked with small black patches on other parts the men on the contrary seem to add something every year to the ornaments of the last so that some of them who appeared to be of an advanced age were almost covered from head to foot besides the amoco they have marks impressed by a method unknown to us of a very extraordinary kind they are furrows of about a line deep and a line broad such as appear upon the bark of a tree which has been cut through after a years growth the edges of these furrows are afterward indented by the same method and being perfectly black they make a most frightful appearance the faces of the old men are almost covered with these marks those who are very young black only their lips like the women when they are somewhat older they have generally a black patch upon one cheek and over one eye and so proceed gradually that they may grow old and honorable together but though we could not but be disgusted with the horrid deformity which these stains and furrows produced in the human face divine we could not but admire the dexterity and art with which they were impressed    0 march the marks upon the face in general are spirals which are drawn with great nicety and even elegance those on one side exactly corresponding with those on the other the marks on the body somewhat resemble the foliage in old chased ornaments and the convolutions of fillagree work but in these they have such a luxuriance of fancy that of an hundred which at first sight appeared to be exactly the same no two were upon a close examination found to be alike we observed that the quantity and form of these marks were different in different parts of the coast and that as the principal seat of them at otaheite was the breech in new zealand it was sometimes the only part which was free and in general was less distinguished than any other  the skins of these people however are not only dyed but painted for as i have before observed they smear their bodies with red oker some rubbing it on dry and some applying it in large patches mixed with oil which is always wet and which the least touch will rub off so that the transgressions of such of our people as were guilty of ravishing a kiss from these blooming beauties were most legibly written upon their faces  the dress of a new zealander is certainly to a stranger at first sight the most uncouth that can be imagined it is made of the leaves of the flag which has been described among the vegetable productions of this country these leaves are split into three or four slips and the slips when they are dry interwoven with each other into a kind of stuff between netting and cloth with all the ends which are eight or nine inches long hanging out on the upper side like the shag or thrumb matts which we sometimes see lying in a passage of this cloth if cloth it may be called two pieces serve for a complete dress    0 march one of them is tied over their shoulders with a string and reaches as low as the knees to the end of this string is fastened a bodkin of bone which is easily passed through any two parts of this upper garment so as to tack them together the other piece is wrapped round the waist and reaches nearly to the ground the lower garment however is worn by the men only upon particular occasions but they wear a belt to which a string is fastened for a very singular use the inhabitants of the south sea islands slit up the prepuce so as to prevent it from covering the glans of the penis but these people on the contrary bring the prepuce over the glans and to prevent it from being drawn back by the contraction of the part they tie the string which hangs from their girdle round the end of it the glans indeed seemed to be the only part of their body which they were solicitous to conceal for they frequently threw off all their dress but the belt and string with the most careless indifference but showed manifest signs of confusion when to gratify our curiosity they were requested to untie the string and never consented but with the utmost reluctance and shame when they have only their upper garment on and sit upon their hams they bear some resemblance to a thatched house but this covering though it is ugly is well adapted to the use of those who frequently sleep in the open air without any other shelter from the rain  but besides this course shag or thatch they have two sorts of cloth which have an even surface and are very ingeniously made in the same manner with that manufactured by the inhabitants of south america some of which we procured at rio de janeiro one sort is as coarse as our coarsest canvas and somewhat resembles it in the manner of laying the threads but it is ten times as strong the other is formed by many threads lying very close one way    0 march and a few crossing them the other so as to bind them together but these are about half an inch asunder somewhat like the round pieces of cane matting which are sometimes placed under the dishes upon a table this is frequently striped and always had a pretty appearance for it is composed of the fibers of the same plant which are prepared so as to shine like silk it is made in a kind of frame of the size of the cloth generally about five feet long and four broad across which the long threads which lie close together or warp are strained and the cross threads or woof are worked in by hand which must be a very tedious operation  to both these kinds of cloth they work borders of different colors in stitches somewhat like carpeting or rather like those used in the samplars which girls work at school these borders are of various patterns and wrought with a neatness and even an elegance which considering they have no needle is surprising but the great pride of their dress consists in the fur of their dogs which they use with such economy that they cut it into stripes and sew them upon their cloth at a distance from each other which is a strong proof that dogs are not plenty among them these stripes are also of different colors and disposed so as to produce a pleasing effect we saw some dresses that were adorned with feathers instead of fur but these were not common and we saw one that was entirely covered with the red feathers of the parrot  the dress of the man who was killed when we first went ashore in poverty bay has been described already but we saw the same dress only once more during our stay upon the coast and that was in queen charlottes sound     0 march the women contrary to the custom of the sex in general seemed to affect dress rather less than the men their hair which as i have observed before is generally cropped short is never tied upon the top of the head when it is suffered to be long nor is it ever adorned with feathers their garments were made of the same materials and in the same form as those of the other sex but the lower one was always bound fast round them except when they went into the water to catch lobsters and then they took great care not to be seen by the men some of us happening one day to land upon a small island in tolaga bay we surprised several of them at this employment and the chaste diana with her nymphs could not have discovered more confusion and distress at the sight of actaeon than these women expressed upon our approach some of them hid themselves among the rocks and the rest crouched down in the sea till they had made themselves a girdle and apron of such weeds as they could find and when they came out even with this veil we could perceive that their modesty suffered much pain by our presence the girdle and apron which they wear in common have been mentioned before  both sexes bore their ears and by stretching them the holes become large enough to admit a finger at least in these holes they wear ornaments of various kinds cloth feathers bones of large birds and even sometimes a stick of wood and to these receptacles of finery they generally applied the nails which we gave them and every thing which it was possible they could contain the women sometimes thrust through them the down of the albatross which is as white as snow and which spreading before and behind the hole in a bunch almost as big as the fist makes a very singular and however strange it may be thought not a disagreeable appearance    0 march besides the ornaments that are thrust through the holes of the ears many others are suspended to them by strings such as chissels or bodkins made of green talc upon which they set a high value the nails and teeth of their deceased relations the teeth of dogs and every thing else that they can get which they think either curious or valuable the women also wear bracelets and anclets made of the bones of birds shells or any other substances which they can perforate and string upon a thread the men had sometimes hanging to a string which went round the neck a piece of green talc or whalebone somewhat in the shape of a tongue with the rude figure of a man carved upon it and upon this ornament they set a high value in one instance we saw the gristle that divides the nostrils and called by anatomists the septum nasi perforated and a feather thrust through the whole which projected on each side over the cheeks it is probable that this frightful singularity was intended as an ornament but of the many people we saw we never observed it in any other nor even a perforation that might occasionally serve for such a purpose  their houses are the most inartificially made of any thing among them being scarcely equal except in size houses to an english dogkennel they are seldom more than eighteen or twenty feet long eight or ten broad and five or six high from the pole that runs from one end to the other and forms the ridge to the ground the framing is of wood generally slender sticks and both walls and roof consist of dry grass and hay which it must be confessed is very tightly put together and some are also lined with the bark of trees so that in cold weather they must afford a very comfortable retreat the roof is sloping like those of our barns and the door is at one end just high enough to admit a man creeping upon his hands and knees near the door is a square hole    0 march which serves the double office of window and chimney for the fireplace is at that end nearly in the middle between the two sides in some conspicuous part and generally near the door a plank is fixed covered with carving after their manner this they value as we do a picture and in their estimation it is not an inferior ornament the sidewalls and roof project about two feet beyond the walls at each end so as to form a kind of porch in which there are benches for the accommodation of the family that part of the floor which is allotted for the fireplace is enclosed in a hollow square by partitions either of wood or stone and in the middle of it the fire is kindled the floor along the inside of the walls is thickly covered with straw and upon this the family sleep  furniture their furniture and implements consist of but few articles and one chest commonly contains them all except their provisionbaskets the gourds that hold their fresh water and the hammers that are used to beat their fernroot which generally stand without the door some rude tools their clothes arms and a few feathers to stick in their hair make the rest of their treasure  some of the better sort whose families are large have three or four houses enclosed within a courtyard the walls of which are constructed of poles and hay and are about ten or twelve feet high  when we were on shore in the district called tolaga we saw the ruins or rather the frame of a house for it had never been finished much superior in size to any that we saw elsewhere it was thirty feet in length about fifteen in breadth and twelve high the sides of it were adorned with many carved planks of a workmanship much superior to any other that we had met with in the country but for what purpose it was built or why it was deserted    0 march we could never learn  but these people though in their houses they are so well defended from the inclemency of the weather seem to be quite indifferent whether they have any shelter at all during their excursions in search of fern roots and fish sometimes setting up a small shade to windward and sometimes altogether neglecting even that precaution sleeping with their women and children under bushes with their weapons ranged round them in the manner that has already been described the party consisting of forty or fifty whom we saw at mercury bay in a district which the natives call opoorage never erected the least shelter while we staid there though it sometimes rained incessantly for four and twenty hours together  the articles of their food have been enumerated already food the principal which to them is what bread is to the inhabitants of europe is the roots of the fern which grows upon the hills and is nearly the same with what grows upon our high commons in england and is called indifferently fern bracken or brakes the birds which sometimes serve them for a feast are chiefly penguins and albatrosses with a few other species that have been occasionally mentioned in this narrative  having no vessel in which water can be boiled cookery their cookery consists wholly of baking and roasting they bake nearly in the same manner as the inhabitants of the south seas and to the account that has been already given of their roasting nothing need be added but that the long skewer or spit to which the flesh is fastened is placed stoping toward the sire by setting one stone against the bottom of it and supporting it near the middle with another by the moving of which to a greater or less distance from the end    0 march the degree of obliquity is increased or diminished at pleasure  to the northward as i have observed there are plantations of yams sweet potatoes and coccos but we saw no such to the southward the inhabitants therefore of that part of the country must subsist wholly upon fern root and fish except the scanty and accidental resource which they may find in sea fowl and dogs and that fern and fish are not to be procured at all seasons of the year even at the sea side and upon the neighboring hills is manifest from the stores of both that we saw laid up dry and the reluctance which some of them expressed at selling any part of them to us when we offered to purchase them at least the fish for sea stores and this particular seems to confirm my opinion that this country scarcely sustains the present number of its inhabitants who are urged to perpetual hostilities by hunger which naturally prompted them to eat the dead bodies of those who were slain in the contest  water is their universal and only liquor as far as we could discover and if they have really no means of intoxication they are in this particular happy beyond any other people that we have yet seen or heard of  as there is perhaps no source of disease either critical or chronic but intemperance and inactivity it cannot be thought strange that these people enjoy perfect and uninterrupted health in all our visits to their towns where young and old men and women crowded about us prompted by the same curiosity that carried us to look at them we never saw a single person who appeared to have any bodily complaint nor among the numbers that we have seen naked did we once perceive the slightest eruption upon the skin or any marks that an eruption had left behind at first indeed observing that some of them when they came off to us were marked in patches with a white flowery appearance upon different parts of their bodies    0 march we thought that they were leperous or highly scorbutic but upon examination we found that these marks were owing to their having been wetted by the sprey of the sea in their passage which when it was dried away left the salts behind it in a fine white powder  another proof of health which we have mentioned upon a former occasion is the facility with which the wounds healed that had left scars behind them and that we saw in a recent state when we saw the man who had been shot with a musket ball through the fleshy part of his arm his wound seemed to be so well digested and in so fair a way of being perfectly healed that if i had not known no application had been made to it i should certainly have enquired with a very interested curiosity after the vulnerary herbs and surgical art of the country  a farther proof that human nature is here untainted with disease is the great number of old men that we saw many of whom by the loss of their hair and teeth appeared to be very ancient yet none of them were decrepit and though not equal to the young in muscular strength were not a whit behind them in cheerfulness and vivacity  chap x of the canoes and navigation of the inhabitants of new zealand their tillage weapons and music government religion and language with some reasons against the existence of a southern continent    0 march canoes the ingenuity of these people appears in nothing more than in their canoes they are long and narrow and in shape very much resemble a new england whale boat the larger sort seem to be built chiefly for war and will carry from forty to eighty or an hundred armed men we measured one which lay ashore at tolaga she was sixtyeight feet and an half long five feet broad and three feet and an half deep the bottom was sharp with strait sides like a wedge and consisted of three lengths hollowed out to about two inches or an inch and an half thick and well fastened together with strong plaiting each side consisted of one entire plank sixtythree feet long ten or twelve inches broad and about an inch and quarter thick and these were fitted and lashed to the bottom part with great dexterity and strength a considerable number of thwarts were laid from gunwale to gunwale to which they were securely lashed on each side as a strengthening to the boat the ornament at the head projected five or six feet beyond the body and was about four feet and an half high the ornament at the stern was fixed upon that end as the sternpost of a ship is upon her keel and was about fourteen feet high two feet broad and an inch and an half thick they both consisted of boards of carved work    0 march of which the design was much better than the execution all their canoes except a few at opoorage or mercury bay which were of one piece and hollowed by fire are built after this plan and few are less than twenty feet long some of the smaller sort have outriggers and sometimes two of them are joined together but this is not common the carving upon the stern and head ornaments of the inferior boats which seem to be intended wholly for fishing consists of the figure of a man with a face as ugly as can be conceived and a monstrous tongue thrust out of the mouth with the white shells of seaears stuck in for the eyes but the canoes of the superior kind which seem to be their men of war are magnificently adorned with open work and covered with loose fringes of black feathers which had a most elegant appearance the gunwale boards were also frequently carved in a grotesque taste and adorned with tufts of white feathers placed upon a black ground of visible objects that are wholly new no verbal description can convey a just idea but in proportion as they resemble some that are already known to which the mind of the reader must be referred the carving of these people being of a singular kind and not in the likeness of any thing that is known on our side of the ocean either in the heaven above or in the earth beneath or in the waters that are under the earth i must refer wholly to the representations which will be found of it in plate xv  the paddles are small light and neatly made the blade is of an oval shape or rather of a shape resembling a large leaf pointed at the bottom broadest in the middle and gradually losing itself in the shaft the whole length being about six feet of which the shaft or loom including the handle is four    0 march and the blade two by the help of these oars they push on their boats with amazing velocity  in sailing they are not expert having no art of going otherwise than before the wind the sail is of netting or matt which is set up between two poles that are fixed upright upon each gunwale and serve both for masts and yards two ropes answered the purpose of sheets and were consequently fastened above to the top of each pole but clumsy and inconvenient as this apparatus is they make good way before the wind and are steered by two men who sit in the stern with each a paddle in his hand for that purpose  tools having said thus much of their workmanship i shall now give some account of their tools they have adzes axes and chissels which serve them also as augers for the boring of holes as they have no metal their adzes and axes are made of a hard black stone or of a green talc which is not only hard but tough and their chissels of human bone or small fragments of jaspar which they chip off from a block in sharp angular pieces like a gunflint their axes they value above all that they possess and never would part with one of them for any thing that we could give i once offered one of the best axes i had in the ship besides a number of other things for one of them but the owner would not sell it from which i conclude that good ones are scarce among them their small tools of jaspar which are used in finishing their nicest work they use till they are blunt and then as they have no means of sharpening them throw them away we had given the people at tolaga a piece of glass and in a short time they found means to drill a hole through it in order to hang it round the neck as an ornament by a thread and we imagine the tool must have been a piece of this jaspar how they bring their large tools first to an edge and sharpen the weapon which they call patoopatoo    0 march we could not certainly learn but probably it is by bruising the same substance to powder and with this grinding two pieces against each other  their nets particularly their seine nets which is of an enormous size have been mentioned already one of these seems to be the joint work of a whole town and i suppose it to be the joint property also the other net which is circular and extended by two or three hoops has been particularly described as well as the manner of baiting and using it their hooks are of bone or shell and in general are ill made to receive the fish when it is caught and to hold their other provisions they have baskets of various kinds and dimensions very neatly made of wicker work  they excel in tillage tillage as might naturally be expected where the person that sows is to eat the produce and where there is so little besides that can be eaten when we first came to tegadoo a district between poverty bay and east cape their crops were just covered and had not yet begun to sprout the mould was as smooth as in a garden and every root had its small hillock ranged in a regular quincunx by lines which with the pegs were still remaining in the field we had not an opportunity to see any of these husbandmen work but we saw what serves them at once for spade and plough this instrument is nothing more than a long narrow stake sharpened to an edge at one end with a short piece fastened transversely at a little distance above it for the convenience of pressing it down with the foot with this they turn up pieces of ground six or seven acres in extent though it is not more than three inches broad but as the soil is light and sandy it makes little resistance     0 march tillage weaving and the other arts of peace seem to be best known and most practiced in the northern part of this country for there is little appearance of any of them in the south but the arts of war flourish equally through the whole coast  weapons of weapons they have no great variety but such as they have are well fitted for destruction they have spears darts battleaxes and the patoopatoo the spear is fourteen or fifteen feet long pointed at both ends and sometimes headed with bone these are grasped by the middle so that the part behind balancing that before makes a push more difficult to be parried than that of a weapon which is held by the end the dart and other weapons have been sufficiently described already and it has also been remarked that these people have neither sling nor bow they throw the dart by hand and so they do stones but darts and stones are seldom used except in defending their forts their battles whether in boats or on shore are generally hand to hand and the slaughter must consequently be great as a second blow with any of their weapons is unnecessary if the first takes place their trust however seems to be principally placed in the patoopatoo which is fastened to their wrists by a strong strap lest it should be wrenched from them and which the principal people generally wear sticking in their girdles considering it as a military ornament and part of their dress like the poinard of the asiatic and the sword of the european they have no defensive armor but besides their weapons the chiefs carried a staff of distinction in the same manner as our officers do the spontoon this was generally the rib of a whale as white as snow with many ornaments of carved work dogs hair and feathers but sometimes it was a stick about six feet long adorned in the same manner and inlaid with a shell like motherofpearl    0 march those who bore this mark of distinction were generally old at least past the middle age and were also more marked with the amoco than the rest  one or more persons thus distinguished always appeared in each canoe when they came to attack us according to the size of it when they came within about a cables length of the ship they used to stop and the chiefs rising from their seat put on a dress which seemed appropriated to the occasion generally of dogs skin and holding out their decorated staff or a weapon directed the rest of the people what they should do when they were at too great a distance to reach us with a lance or a stone they presumed that we had no weapon with which we could reach them here then the defiance was given and the words were almost universally the same haromai haromai harre uta a patoopatoo oge come to us come on shore and we will kill you all with our patoopatoos while they were uttering these menaces they came gradually nearer and nearer till they were close alongside talking at intervals in a peaceable strain and answering any questions that we asked them and at intervals renewing their defiance and threats till being encouraged by our apparent timidity they began their warsong and dance as a prelude to an attack which always followed and was sometimes continued till it became absolutely necessary to repress them by firing some smallshot and sometimes ended after throwing a few stones on board as if content with having offered us an insult which we did not dare to revenge  the wardance consists of a great variety of violent motions and hideous contortions of the limbs during which the countenance also performs its part the tongue is frequently thrust out to an incredible length    0 march and the eyelids so forcibly drawn up that the white appears both above and below as well as on each side of the iris so as to form a circle round it nor is any thing neglected that can render the human shape frightful and deformed at the same time they brandish their spears shake their darts and cleave the air with their patoopatoos this horrid dance is always accompanied by a song it is wild indeed but not disagreeable and every strain ends in a loud and deep sigh which they utter in concert in the motions of the dance however horrid there is a strength firmness and agility which we could not but behold with admiration and in their song they keep time with such exactness that i have often heard above an hundred paddles struck against the sides of their boats at once so as to produce but a single sound at the divisions of their music  a song not altogether unlike this they sometimes sing without the dance and as a peaceable amusement they have also other songs which are sung by the women whose voices are remarkably mellow and soft and have a pleasing and tender effect the time is slow and the cadence mournful but it is conducted with more taste than could be expected among the poor ignorant savages of this half desolate country especially as it appeared to us who were none of us much acquainted with music as a science to be sung in parts it was at least sung by many voices at the same time  they have sonorous instruments but they can scarcely be called instruments of music one is the shell called the tritons trumpet with which they make a noise not unlike that which our boys sometimes make with a cows horn the other is a small wooden pipe resembling a childs ninepin only much smaller and in this there is no more music than in a peawhistle    0 march they seem sensible indeed that these instruments are not musical for we never heard an attempt to sing to them or to produce with them any measured tones that bore the least resemblance to a tune  to what has been already said of the practice of eating human flesh i shall only add that in almost every cove where we landed we found flesh bones of men near the places where fires had been made and that among the heads that were brought on board by the old man some seemed to have false eyes and ornaments in their ears as if alive that which mr banks bought was sold with great reluctance by the possessor the head was manifestly that of a young person about fourteen or fifteen years of age and by the contusions on one side appeared to have received many violent blows and indeed a part of the bone near the eye was wanting these appearances confirmed us in the opinion that the natives of this country give no quarter nor take any prisoners to be killed and eaten at a future time as is said to have been a practice among the indians of florida for if prisoners had been taken this poor young creature who cannot be supposed capable of making much resistance would probably have been one and we knew that he was killed with the rest for the fray had happened but a few days before  the towns or hippahs of these people which are all fortified have been sufficiently described already and from the bay of plenty to queen charlottes sound they seem to be the constant residence of the people but about poverty bay hawks bay tegadoo and tolaga we saw no hippahs but single houses scattered at a distance from each other yet upon the sides of the hills there were stages of a great length furnished with stones and darts probably as retreats for the people at the last extremity    0 march as upon these stages a fight may be carried on with much advantage against those below who may be reached with great effect by darts and stones which it is impossible for them to throw up with equal force and indeed the forts themselves seem to be no farther serviceable than by enabling the possessors to repress a sudden attack for as there is no supply of water within the lines it would be impossible to sustain a siege a considerable stock of fernroot and dry fish is indeed laid up in them but they may be reserved against seasons of scarcity and that such seasons there are our observations left us no room to doubt besides while an enemy should be prowling in the neighborhood it would be easy to snatch a supply of water from the side of the hill though it would be impossible to dig up fern root or catch fish  in this district however the people seemed to live in a state of conscious security and to avail themselves of their advantage their plantations were more numerous their canoes were more decorated and they had not only finer carving but finer clothes this part of the coast also was much the most populous and possibly their apparent peace and plenty might arise from their being united under one chief or king for the inhabitants of all this part of the country told us that they were the subjects of teratu when they pointed to the residence of this prince it was in a direction which we thought inland but which when we knew the country better we found to be the bay of plenty  government it is much to be regretted that we were obliged to leave this country without knowing any thing of teratu but his name as an indian monarch his territory is certainly extensive he was acknowledged from cape kidnappers to the northward and westward as far as the bay of plenty a length of coast upwards of eighty leagues    0 march and we do not yet know how much farther westward his dominions may extend possibly the fortified towns which we saw in the bay of plenty may be his barrier especially as at mercury bay he was not acknowledged nor indeed any other single chief for wherever we landed or spoke with the people upon that coast they told us that we were at but a small distance from their enemies  in the dominions of teratu we saw several subordinate chiefs to whom great respect was paid and by whom justice was probably administered for upon our complaint to one of them of a theft that had been committed on board the ship by a man that came with him he gave him several blows and kicks which the other received as the chastisement of authority against which no resistance was to be made and which he had no right to resent whether this authority was possessed by appointment or inheritance we could not learn but we observed that the chiefs as well here as in other parts were elderly men in other parts however we learnt that they possessed their authority by inheritance  the little societies which we found in the southern parts seemed to have several things in common particularly their fine clothes and fishing nets their fine clothes which possibly might be the spoils of war were kept in a small hut which was erected for that purpose in the middle of the town the nets we saw making in almost every house and the several parts being afterward collected were joined together less account seems to be made of the women here than in the south sea islands such at least was the opinion of tupia who complained of it as an indignity to the sex we observed that the two sexes eat together but how they divide their labor we do not certainly know    0 march i am inclined to believe that the men till the ground make nets catch birds and go out in their boats to fish and that the women dig up fern roots collect lobsters and other shell fish near the beach dress the victuals and weave cloth such at least were their employments when we had an opportunity of observing them which was but seldom for in general our appearance made a holiday wherever we went men women and children flocking round us either to gratify their curiosity or to purchase some of the valuable merchandise which we carried about with us consisting principally of nails paper and broken glass  religion of the religion of these people it cannot be supposed that we could learn much they acknowledge the influence of superior beings one of whom is supreme and the rest subordinate and gave nearly the same account of the origin of the world and the production of mankind as our friends in otaheite tupia however seemed to have a much more deep and extensive knowledge of these subjects than any of the people here and whenever he was disposed to instruct them which he sometimes did in a long discourse he was sure of a numerous audience who listened in profound silence with such reverence and attention that we could not but wish them a better teacher  what homage they pay to the deities they acknowledge we could not learn but we saw no place of public worship like the morals of the south sea islands yet we saw near a plantation of sweet potatoes a small area of a square figure surrounded with stones in the middle of which one of the sharpened stakes which they use as a spade was set up and upon it was hung a basket of fern roots upon enquiry the natives told us that it was an offering to the gods by which the owner hoped to render them propitious    0 march and obtain a plentiful crop  as to their manner of disposing of their dead dead we could form no certain opinion of it for the accounts that we received by no means agreed in the northern parts they told us that they buried them in the ground and in the southern that they threw them into the sea it is however certain that we saw no grave in the country and that they affected to conceal every thing relating to their dead with a kind of mysterious secrecy but whatever may be the sepulcher the living are themselves the monuments for we saw scarcely a single person of either sex whose body was not marked by the scars of wounds which they had inflicted upon themselves as a testimony of their regret for the loss of a relation or friend some of these wounds we saw in a state so recent that the blood was scarcely staunched which shows that death had been among them while we were upon the coast and makes it more extraordinary that no funeral ceremony should have fallen under our notice some of the scars were very large and deep and in many instances had greatly disfigured the face one monument indeed we observed of another kind the cross that was set up near queen charlottes sound  having now given the best account in my power of the customs and opinions of the inhabitants of new zealand with their boats nets furniture and dress i shall only remark that the similitude between these particulars here and in the south sea islands is a very strong proof that the inhabitants have the same origin and that the common ancestors of both were natives of the same country they have both a tradition that their ancestors at a very remote period of time came from another country and according to the tradition of both    0 march that the name of that country was heawije but the similitude of the language seems to put the matter altogether out of doubt i have already observed that tupia when he accosted the people here in the language of his own country was perfectly understood and i shall give a specimen of the similitude by a list of words in both languages according to the dialect of the northern and southern islands of which new zealand consists by which it will appear that the language of otaheite does not differ more from that of new zealand than the language of the two islands from each other  english new zealand otaheite northern southern a chief eareete eareete earee a man taata taata taata a woman whahine whahine ivahine the

you call this or that owy terra owy terra  by this specimen i think it appears to demonstration that the language of new zealand and otaheite is radically the same the language of the northern and southern parts of new zealand differs chiefly in the pronunciation as the same english word is pronounced gate in middlesex and geate in yorkshire and as the southern and northern words were not written down by the same person one might possibly use more letters to produce the same sound than the other    0 march   i must also observe that it is the genius of the language especially in the southern parts to put some article before a noun as we do the or a the articles used here were generally he or ko it is also common here to add the word oeia after another word as an iteration especially if it is an answer to a question as we say yes indeed to be sure really certainly this sometimes led our gentlemen into the formation of words of an enormous length judging by the ear only without being able to refer each sound into its signification an example will make this perfectly understood  in the bay of islands there is a remarkable one called by the natives matu aro one of our gentlemen having asked a native the name of it he answered with the particle kematuaro the gentleman hearing the sound imperfectly repeated his question and the indian repeating his answer added oeia which made the word kematuarooeia and thus it happened that in the log book i found matuaro transformed into cumettiwarroweia and the same transformation by the same means might happen to an english word suppose a native of new zealand at hackney church to enquire what village is this the answer would be it is hackney suppose the question to be repeated with an air of doubt and uncertainty the answer might be it is hackney indeed and the new zealander if he had the use of letters would probably record for the information of his countrymen that during his residence among us he had visited a village called ityshakneeindede the article used by the inhabitants of the south sea islands instead of he or ko is to or ta but the word oeia is common to both and when we began to learn the language it led us into many ridiculous mistakes  but supposing these islands and those in the south seas    0 march to have been peopled originally from the same country it will perhaps for ever remain a doubt what country that is we were however unanimously of opinion that the people did not come from america which lies to the eastward and except there should appear to be a continent to the southward in a moderate latitude it will follow that they came from the westward  thus far our navigation has certainly been unfavourable to the notion of a southern continent for it has swept away at least threefourths of the positions upon which it has been founded the principal navigators whose authority has been urged on this occasion are tasman juan fernandes hermit the commander of a dutch squadron quiros and roggewein and the track of the endeavor has demonstrated that the land seen by these persons and supposed to be part of a continent is not so it has also totally subverted the theoretical arguments which have been brought to prove that the existence of a southern continent is necessary to preserve an equilibrium between the two hemispheres for upon this principle what we have already proved to be water would render the southern hemisphere too light in our rout to the northward after doubling cape horn when we were in the latitude of  0 our longitude was   0 and in our return to the southward after leaving ulietea when we were again in latitude  0 our longitude was     the difference is    when we were in latitude  0 the difference of longitude between the two tracks was    which continued till we were as low as  0 but a single view of the chart will convey a better idea of this than the most minute description yet as upon a view of the chart it will appear that there is a large space extending quite to the tropics which neither we    0 march nor any other navigators to our knowledge have explored and as there will appear to be room enough for the cape of a southern continent to extend northward into a low southern latitude i shall give my reasons for believing there is no cape of any southern continent to the northward of  0 south  notwithstanding what has been laid down by some geographers in their maps and alleged by mr dalrymple with respect to quiros it is improbable in the highest degree that he saw to the southward of two islands which he discovered in latitude    or    and which i suppose may lie between the longitude of   0 and   0 w any signs of a continent much less any thing which in his opinion was a known or indubitable sign of such land for if he had he would certainly have sailed southward in search of it and if he had sought supposing the signs to have been indubitable he must have found the discovery of a southern continent was the ultimate object of quiross voyage and no man appears to have had it more at heart so that if he was in latitude    s and in longitude     w where mr dalrymple has placed the islands he discovered it may fairly be inferred that no part of a southern continent extends to that latitude  it will i think appear with equal evidence from the accounts of roggeweins voyage that between the longitudes of   0 and   0 w there is no main land to the northward of    s mr pingre in a treatise concerning the transit of venus which he went out to observe has inserted an extract of roggeweins voyage and a map of the south seas and for reasons which may be seen at large in his work supposes him after leaving easter island which he places in latitude    s longitude     w to have steered sw as high as    s and afterward wnw    0 march and if this was indeed his rout the proof that there is no main land to the northward of    s is irrefragable mr dalrymple indeed supposes his rout to have been different and that from easter isle he steered nw taking a course afterward very little different from that of la maire but i think it is highly improbable that a man who at his own request was sent to discover a southern continent should take a course in which la maire had already proved no continent could be found it must however be confessed that roggeweins track cannot certainly be ascertained because in the accounts that have been published of his voyage neither longitudes nor latitudes are mentioned as to myself i saw nothing that i thought a sign of land in my rout either to the northward southward or westward till a few days before i made the east coast of new zealand i did indeed frequently see large flocks of birds but they were generally such as are found at a very remote distance from any coast and it is also true that i frequently saw pieces of rockweed but i could not infer the vicinity of land from these because i have been informed upon indubitable authority that a considerable quantity of the beans called oxeyes which are known to grow no where but in the west indies are every year thrown up on the coast of ireland which is not less than twelve hundred leagues distant  thus have i given my reasons for thinking that there is no continent to the northward of latitude  0 s of what may lie farther to the southward than  0 i can give no opinion but i am so far from wishing to discourage any future attempt finally to determine a question which has long been an object of attention to many nations that now this voyage has reduced the only possible site of a continent in the southern hemisphere north of latitude  0 to so small a space    0 march i think it would be pity to leave that any longer unexamined especially as the voyage may turn to good account besides determining the principal question if no continent should be found by the discovery of new islands in the tropical regions of which there is probably a great number that no european vessel has ever

morning of the   th saturday    it was     0 this day we also saw some flying fish sunday    on the   th we saw an egg bird and a gannet and as these are birds that never go far from the land we continued to sound all night but had no ground with   0 fathom monday    at noon on the   th we were in latitude       s longitude  0  w at about two oclock the wind came about to the w s w upon which we tacked and stood to the n w soon after a small landbird perched upon the rigging but we had no ground with   0 fathom at eight we wore and stood to the southward till twelve at night and then wore and stood to the n w till four in the morning tuesday    when we again stood to the southward having a fresh gale at w s w with squalls and dark weather till nine when the weather became clear and there being little wind we had an opportunity to take several observations of the sun and moon the mean result of which gave  0    w longitude our latitude at noon was       s we had now a hard gale from the southward and a great sea from the same quarter which obliged us to run under our foresail and mizen all night during which we sounded every two hours but had no ground with   0 fathom  wednes    in the morning of the   th we saw two port egmont hens and a pintado bird which are certain signs of approaching land and indeed by our reckoning we could not be far from it for our longitude was now one degree to the westward of the eastside of van diemens land according to the longitude laid down by tasman    0 april wednes    whom we could not suppose to have erred much in so short a run as from this land to new zealand and by our latitude we could not be above fifty or fiftyfive leagues from the place whence he took his departure all this day we had frequent squalls and a great swell thursday    atone in the morning we brought to and sounded but had no ground with   0 fathom at six we saw land extending from n e to w at the distance of five or six leagues having eighty fathom water with a fine sandy bottom  we continued standing westward with the wind at s s w till eight when we made all the sail we could and bore away along the shore n e for the eastermost land in fight being at this time in latitude       s and longitude   0    w the southermost point of land in sight which bore from us w s i judged to lie in latitude    longitude       and gave it the name of point hicks because mr hicks the first lieutenant was the first who discovered it to the southward of this point no land was to be seen though it was very clear in that quarter and by our longitude compared with that of tasman not as it is laid down in the printed charts but in the extracts from tasmans journal published by rembrantse the body of van diemens land ought to have borne due south and indeed from the sudden falling of the sea after the wind abated i had reason to think it did yet as i did not see it and as i found this coast trend n e and s w or rather more to the eastward i cannot determine whether it joins to van diemens land or not  at noon we were in latitude     0 longitude   0   w the extremes of the land extended from n w to e n e and a remarkable point bore n  0 e at the distance of about four leagues    0 april thursday    this point rises in a round hillock very much resembling the ram head at the entrance of plymouth sound and therefore i called it by the same name the variation by an azimuth taken this morning was     e and what we had now seen of the land appeared low and level the sea shore was a white sand but the country within was green and woody about one oclock we saw three water spouts at once two were between us and the shore and the third at some distance upon our larboard quarter this phenomenon is so well known that it is not necessary to give a particular description of it here  at six oclock in the evening we shortened sail and brought to for the night having fiftysix fathom water and a fine sandy bottom the northermost land in sight then bore n by e e and a small island lying close to a point on the main bore w distant two leagues this point which i called cape how may be known by the trending of the coast which is north on the one side and south west on the other it may also be known by some round hills upon the main just within it  friday  0 we brought to for the night and at four in the morning made sail along shore to the northward at six the northermost land in sight bore n n w and we were at this time about four leagues from the shore at noon we were in latitude       s longitude  0     w and about three leagues distant from the shore the weather being clear gave us a good view of the country which has a very pleasing appearance it is of a moderate height diversified by hills and valleys ridges and plains interspersed with a few lawns of no great extent but in general covered with wood the ascent of the hills and ridges is gentle and the summits are not high we continued to sail along the shore to the northward with a southerly wind    0 april friday  0 and in the afternoon we saw smoke in several places by which we knew the country to be inhabited at six in the evening we shortened sail and sounded we found fortyfour fathom water with a clear sandy bottom and stood on under an easy sail till twelve when we brought to for the night and had ninety fathom water  at four in the morning we made sail again saturday    at the distance of about five leagues from the land and at six we were abreast of a high mountain lying near the shore which on account of its figure i called mount dromedary under this mountain the shore forms a point to which i gave the name of point dromedary and over it there is a peaked hillock at this time being in latitude       s longitude  0     w we found the variation to be  0    e  between ten and eleven mr green and i took several observations of the sun and moon the mean result of which gave  0     longitude w by an observation made the day before our longitude was   0   w from which  0 being subtracted there remains  0     the longitude of the ship this day at noon the mean of which with this days observation gives  0     by which i fix the longitude of this coast at noon our latitude was       s cape dromedary bore s  0 w at the distance of twelve leagues and an open bay in which were three or four small islands bore n w by w at the distance of five or six leagues this bay seemed to afford but little shelter from the sea winds and yet it is the only place where there appeared a probability of finding anchorage upon the whole coast we continued to steer along the shore n by e and n n e at the distance of about three leagues and saw smoke in many places near the beach    0 april saturday    at five in the evening we were abreast of a point of land which rose in a perpendicular cliff and which for that reason i called point upright our latitude was       s when this point bore from us due west distant about two leagues in this situation we had about thirtyone fathom water with a sandy bottom at six in the evening the wind falling we hauled off e n e and at this time the northermost land in sight bore n by e e at midnight being in seventy fathom water we brought to till four in the morning sunday    when we made sail in for the land but at daybreak found our situation nearly the same as it had been at five the evening before by which it was apparent that we had been driven about three leagues to the southward by a tide or current during the night after this we steered along the shore n n e with a gentle breeze at s w and were so near the land as to distinguish several of the natives upon the beach who appeared to be of a black or very dark color at noon our latitude by observation was       s and longitude  0    w cape dromedary bore s    w distant nineteen leagues a remarkable peaked hill which resembled a square dovehouse with a dome at the top and which for that reason i called the pigeon house bore n     0 w and a small low island which lay close under the shore bore n w distant about two or three leagues when i first discovered this island in the morning i was in hopes from its appearance that i should have found shelter for the ship behind it but when we came near it it did not promise security even for the landing of a boat i should however have attempted to send a boat on shore if the wind had not veered to that direction with a large hollow sea rolling in upon the land from the s e which indeed had been the case ever since we had been upon it the coast still continued to be of a moderate height forming alternately rocky points and sandy beaches but within    0 april sunday    between mount dromedary and the pigeon house we saw high mountains which except two are covered with wood these two lie inland behind the pigeon house and are remarkably flat at the top with steep rocky cliffs all round them as far as we could see the trees which almost every where clothe this country appear to be large and lofty this day the variation was found to be    0 e and for the two last days the latitude by observation was twelve or fourteen miles to the southward of the ships account which could have been the effect of nothing but a current setting in that direction about four in the afternoon being near five leagues from the land we tacked and stood off s e and e and the wind having veered in the night from e to n e and n we tacked about four in the morning and stood in monday    being then about nine or ten leagues from the shore at eight the wind began to die away and soon after it was calm at noon our latitude by observation was       and our distance from the land about six leagues cape dromedary bore s    w distant seventeen leagues and the pigeon house n  0 w in this situation we had seventyfour fathom water in the afternoon we had variable light airs and calms till six in the evening when a breeze sprung up at n by w at this time being about four or five leagues from the shore we had seventy fathom water the pigeon house bore n    w mount dromedary s  0 w and the northermost land in sight n    e  we stood to the north east till noon the next day tuesday    with a gentle breeze at n w and then we tacked and stood westward at this time our latitude by observation was     0s and longitude  0     w a point of land which i had discovered on st georges day and which therefore i called cape george bore w distant nineteen miles and the pigeon house    0 april tuesday    the latitude and longitude of which i found to be       s and  0    w s    w in the morning we had found the variation by amplitude to be    0 e and by several azimuths      e we had a fresh breeze at n w from noon till three it then came to the west when we tacked and stood to the northward at five in the evening being about five or six leagues from the shore with the pigeon house bearing w s w distant about nine leagues we had eightysix fathom water and at eight having thunder and lightning with heavy squalls we brought to in   0 fathom  wednes    at three in the morning we made sail again to the northward having the advantage of a fresh gale at s w at noon we were about three or four leagues from the shore and in latitude       s longitude  0     w in the course of this days run from the preceding noon which was fortyfive miles north east we saw smoke in several places near the beach about two leagues to the northward of cape george the shore seemed to form a bay which promised shelter from the north east winds but as the wind was with us it was not in my power to look into it without beating up which would have cost me more time than i was willing to spare the north point of this bay on account of its figure i named long nose its latitude is      and about eight leagues north of it there lies a point which from the color of the land about it i called red point its latitude is       and longitude  0    w to the north west of red point and a little way inland stands a round hill the top of which looks like the crown of a hat in the afternoon of this day we had a light breeze at n n w till five in the evening when it fell calm at this time we were between three and four leagues from the shore and had fortyeight fathom water the variation by azimuth was      e and the extremities of this land were from n e by n to s w by s before it was dark    0 april wednes    we saw smoke in several places along the shore and a fire two or three times afterward during the night we lay becalmed driving in before the sea till one in the morning thursday    when we got a breeze from the land with which we steered n e being then in thirtyeight fathom at noon it veered to n e by n and we were then in latitude     0 s longitude  0     w the land was distant about five leagues and extended from s    w to n e in this latitude there are some white cliffs which rise perpendicularly from the sea to a considerable height we stood off the shore till two oclock and then tacked and stood in till six when we were within four or five miles of it and at that distance had fifty fathom water the extremities of the land bore from s    w to n     0 e we now tacked and stood off till twelve then tacked and stood in again till four in the morning friday    when we made a trip off till daylight and during all this time we lost ground owing to the variableness of the winds we continued at the distance of between four and five miles from the shore till the afternoon when we came within two miles and i then hoisted out the pinnace and yawl to attempt a landing but the pinnace proved to be so leaky that i was obliged to hoist her in again at this time we saw several of the natives walking briskly along the shore four of whom carried a small canoe upon their shoulders we flattered ourselves that they were going to put her into the water and come off to the ship but finding ourselves disappointed i determined to go on shore in the yawl with as many as it would carry i embarked therefore with only mr banks dr solander tupia and four rowers we pulled for that part of the shore where the indians appeared near which four small canoes were lying at the waters edge the indians sat down upon the rocks    0 april friday    and seemed to wait for our landing but to our great regret when we came within about a quarter of a mile they ran away into the woods we determined however to go ashore and endeavor to procure an interview but in this we were again disappointed for we found so great a surf beating upon every part of the beach that landing with our little boat was altogether impracticable we were therefore obliged to be content with gazing at such objects as presented themselves from the water the canoes upon a near view seemed very much to resemble those of the smaller sort at new zealand we observed that among the trees on shore which were not very large there was no underwood and could distinguish that many of them were of the palm kind and some of them cabbage trees after many a wishful look we were obliged to return with our curiosity rather excited than satisfied and about five in the evening got on board the ship about this time it fell calm and our situation was by no means agreeable we were now not more than a mile and a half from the shore and within some breakers which lay to the southward but happily a light breeze came off the land and carried us out of danger with this breeze we stood to the northward saturday    and at daybreak we discovered a bay which seemed to be well sheltered from all winds and into which therefore i determined to go with the ship the pinnace being repaired i sent her with the master to sound the entrance while i kept turning up having the wind right out at noon the mouth of the bay bore n n w distant about a mile and seeing a smoke on the shore we directed our glasses to the spot and soon discovered ten people who upon our nearer approach left their fire and retired to a little eminence whence they could conveniently observe our motions soon after two canoes each having two men on board came to the shore just under the eminence    0 april saturday    and the men joined the rest on the top of it the pinnace which had been sent ahead to sound now approached the place upon which all the indians retired farther up the hill except one who hid himself among some rocks near the landingplace as the pinnace proceeded along the shore most of the people took the same route and kept abreast of her at a distance when she came back the master told us that in a cove a little within the harbor some of them had come down to the beach and invited him to land by many signs and words of which he knew not the meaning but that all of them were armed with long pikes and a wooden weapon shaped somewhat like a cimeter the indians who had not followed the boat seeing the ship approach used many threatening gestures and brandished their weapons particularly two who made a very singular appearance for their faces seemed to have been dusted with a white powder and their bodies painted with broad streaks of the same color which passing obliquely over their breasts and backs looked not unlike the crossbelts worn by our soldiers the same kind of streaks were also drawn round their legs and thighs like broad garters each of these men held in his hand the weapon that had been described to us as like a cimeter which appeared to be about two feet and a half long and they seemed to talk to each other with great earnestness  we continued to stand into the bay and early in the afternoon anchored under the south shore about two miles within the entrance in six fathom water the south point bearing s e and the north point east as we came in we saw on both points of the bay a few huts and several of the natives men women and children under the south head we saw four small canoes    0 april saturday    with each one man on board who were very busily employed in striking fish with a long pike or spear they ventured almost into the surf and were so intent upon what they were doing that although the ship passed within a quarter of a mile of them they scarcely turned their eyes toward her possibly being deafened by the surf and their attention wholly fixed upon their business or sport they neither saw nor heard her go past them  the place where the ship had anchored was abreast of a small village consisting of about six or eight houses and while we were preparing to hoist out the boat we saw an old woman followed by three children come out of the wood she was loaded with firewood and each of the children had also its little burden when she came to the houses three more children younger than the others came out to meet her she often looked at the ship but expressed neither fear nor surprise in a short time she kindled a fire and the four canoes came in from fishing the men landed and having hauled up their boars began to dress their dinner to all appearance wholly unconcerned about us though we were within half a mile of them we thought it remarkable that of all the people we had yet seen not one had the least appearance of clothing the old woman herself being destitute even of a figleaf  after dinner the boats were manned and we set out from the ship having tupia of our party we intended to land where we saw the people and began to hope that as they had so little regarded the ships coming into the bay they would as little regard our coming on shore in this however we were disappointed for as soon as we approached the rocks two of the men came down upon them to dispute our landing and the rest ran away each of the two champions was armed with a lance about ten feet long    0 april saturday    and a short stick which he seemed to handle as if it was a machine to assist him in managing or throwing the lance they called to us in a very loud tone and in a harsh dissonant language of which neither we nor tupia understood a single word they brandished their weapons and seemed resolved to defend their coast to the uttermost though they were but two and we were forty i could not but admire their courage and being very unwilling that hostilities should commence with such inequality of force between us i ordered the boat to lie upon her oars we then parlied by signs for about a quarter of an hour and to bespeak their good will i threw them nails beads and other trifles which they took up and seemed to be well pleased with i then made signs that i wanted water and by all the means that i could devise endeavored to convince them that we would do them no harm they now waved to us and i was willing to interpret it as an invitation but upon our putting the boat in they came again to oppose us one appeared to be a youth about nineteen or twenty and the other a man of middle age as i had now no other resource i fired a musket between them upon the report the youngest dropped a bundle of lances upon the rock but recollecting himself in an instant he snatched them up again with great haste a stone was then thrown at us upon which i ordered a musket to be fired with small shot which struck the eldest upon the legs and he immediately ran to one of the houses which was distant about an hundred yards i now hoped that our contest was over and we immediately landed but we had scarcely left the boat when he returned and we then perceived that he had left the rock only to fetch a shield or target for his defense as soon as he came up he threw a lance at us and his comrade another they fell where we stood thickest    0 april saturday    but happily hurt nobody a third musket with small shot was then fired at them upon which one of them threw another lance and both immediately ran away if we had pursued we might probably have taken one of them but mr banks suggesting that the lances might be poisoned i thought it not prudent to venture into the woods we repaired immediately to the huts in one of which we found the children who had hidden themselves behind a shield and some bark we peeped at them but left them in their retreat without their knowing that they had been discovered and we threw into the house when we went away some beads ribbons pieces of cloth and other presents which we hoped would procure us the good will of the inhabitants when they should return but the lances which we found lying about we took away with us to the number of about fifty they were from six to fifteen feet long and all of them had four prongs in the manner of a fishgig each of which was pointed with fishbone and very sharp we observed that they were smeared with a viscous substance of a green color which favored the opinion of their being poisoned though we afterward discovered that it was a mistake they appeared by the seaweed that we found sticking to them to have been used in striking fish upon examining the canoes that lay upon the beach we found them to be the worst we had ever seen they were between twelve and fourteen feet long and made of the bark of a tree in one piece which was drawn together and tied up at each end the middle being kept open by sticks which were placed across them from gunwale to gunwale as thwarts we then searched for fresh water but found none except in a small hole which had been dug in the sand  having reimbarked in our boat we deposited our lances on board the ship and then went over to the north point of the bay    0 april saturday    where we had seen several of the inhabitants when we were entering it but which we now found totally deserted here however we found fresh water which trickled down from the top of the rocks and stood in pools among the hollows at the bottom but it was situated so as not to be procured for our use without difficulty  in the morning therefore sunday    i sent a party of men to that part of the shore where we first landed with orders to dig holes in the sand where the water might gather but going ashore myself with the gentlemen soon afterward we found upon a more diligent search a small stream more than sufficient for our purpose  upon visiting the hut where we had seen the children we were greatly mortified to find that the beads and ribbons which we had left there the night before had not been moved from their places and that not an indian was to be seen  having sent some empty watercasks on shore and left a party of men to cut wood i went myself in the pinnace to sound and examine the bay during my excursion i saw several of the natives but they all fled at my approach in one of the places where i landed i found several small fires and fresh muscles broiling upon them here also i found some of the largest oystershells i had ever seen  as soon as the wooders and waterers came on board to dinner ten or twelve of the natives came down to the place and looked with great attention and curiosity at the casks but did not touch them they took away however the canoes which lay near the landingplace and again disappeared in the afternoon when our people were again ashore sixteen or eighteen indians all armed came boldly within about an hundred yards of them and then stopped two of them advanced somewhat nearer    0 april sunday    and mr hicks who commanded the party on shore with another advanced to meet them holding out presents to them as he approached and expressing kindness and amity by every sign he could think of but all without effect for before he could get up with them they retired and it would have answered no purpose to pursue in the evening i went with mr banks and dr solander to a sandy cove on the north side of the bay where in three or four hauls with the seine we took above three hundred weight of fish which was equally divided among the ships company  monday  0 the next morning before daybreak the indians came down to the houses that were abreast of the ship and were heard frequently to shout very loud as soon as it was light they were seen walking along the beach and soon after they retired to the woods where at the distance of about a mile from the shore they kindled several fires  our people went ashore as usual and with them mr banks and dr solander who in search of plants repaired to the woods our men who were employed in cutting grass being the farthest removed from the main body of the people a company of fourteen or fifteen indians advanced toward them having sticks in their hands which according to the report of the sergeant of the marines shone like a musket the grasscutters upon seeing them approach drew together and repaired to the main body the indians being encouraged by this appearance of a flight pursued them they stopped however when they were within about a furlong of them and after shouting several times went back into the woods in the evening they came again in the same manner stopped at the same distance shouted and retired i followed them myself alone and unarmed for a considerable way along the shore    0 april monday  0 but i could not prevail upon them to stop  this day mr green took the suns meridian altitude a little within the south entrance of the bay which gave the latitude    s the variation of the needle was      e  early the next morning the body of forby sutherland may tuesday   one of our seamen who died the evening before was buried near the wateringplace and from this incident i called the south point of this bay sutherland point this day we resolved to make an excursion into the country mr banks dr solander myself and seven others properly accoutred for the expedition set out and repaired first to the huts near the wateringplace whither some of the natives continued every day to resort and though the little presents which we had left there before had not yet been taken away we left others of somewhat more value consisting of cloth lookingglasses combs and beads and then went up into the country we found the soil to be either swamp or light sand and the face of the country finely diversified by wood and lawn the trees are tall strait and without underwood standing at such a distance from each other that the whole country at least where the swamps do not render it incapable of cultivation might be cultivated without cutting down one of them between the trees the ground is covered with grass of which there is great abundance growing in tufts about as big as can well be grasped in the hand which stand very close to each other we saw many houses of the inhabitants and places where they had slept upon the grass without any shelter but we saw only one of the people who the moment he discovered us ran away at all these places we left presents hoping that at length they might produce confidence and good will we had a transient and imperfect view of a quadruped about as big as a rabbit    0 may tuesday   mr bankss greyhound which was with us got sight of it and would probably have caught it but the moment he set off he lamed himself against a stump which lay concealed in the long grass we afterward saw the dung of an animal which fed upon grass and which we judged could not be less than a deer and the footsteps of another which was clawed like a dog and seemed to be about as big as a wolf we also tracked a small animal whose foot resembled that of a polcat or weasel the trees over our head abounded with birds of various kinds among which were many of exquisite beauty particularly loriquets and cockatoos which flew in flocks of several scores together we found some wood which had been felled by the natives with a blunt instrument and some that had been barked the trees were not of many species among others there was a large one which yielded a gum not unlike the sanguis draconis and in some of them steps had been cut at about three feet distance from each other for the convenience of climbing them  from this excursion we returned between three and four oclock and having dined on board we went ashore again at the waterringplace where a party of men were filling casks mr gore the second lieutenant had been sent out in the morning with a boat to dredge for oysters at the head of the bay when he had performed this service he went ashore and having taken a midshipman with him and sent the boat away set out to join the waterers by land in his way he fell in with a body of two and twenty indians who followed him and were often not more than twenty yards distant when mr gore perceived them so near he stopped and faced about upon which they stopped also and when he went on again continued their pursuit    0 may tuesday   they did not however attack him though they were all armed with lances and he and the midshipman got in safety to the wateringplace the indians who had slackened their pursuit when they came in sight of the main body of our people halted at about the distance of a quarter of a mile where they stood still mr monkhouse and two or three of the waterers took it in their head to march up to them but seeing the indians keep their ground till they came pretty near them they were seized with a sudden fear very common to the rash and foolhardy and made a hasty retreat this step which insured the danger that it was taken to avoid encouraged the indians and four of them running forward discharged their lances at the fugitives with such force that flying no less than forty yards they went beyond them as the indians did not pursue our people recovering their spirits stopped to collect the lances when they came up to the place where they lay upon which the indians in their turn began to retire just at this time i came up with mr banks dr solander and tupia and being desirous to convince the indians that we were neither afraid of them nor intended them any mischief we advanced toward them making signs of expostulation and entreaty but they could not be persuaded to wait till we could come up mr gore told us that he had seen some of them up the bay who had invited him by signs to come on shore which he certainly with great prudence declined  the morning of the next day was so rainy wednes   that we were all glad to stay on board in the afternoon however it cleared up and we made another excursion along the seacoast to the southward we went ashore and mr banks and dr solander gathered many plants but besides these we saw nothing worthy of notice at our first entering the woods    0 may wednes   we met with three of the natives who instantly ran away more of them were seen by some of the people but they all disappeared with great precipitation as soon as they found that they were discovered by the boldness of these people at our first landing and the terror that seized them at the sight of us afterward it appears that they were sufficiently intimidated by our firearms not that we had any reason to think the people much hurt by the smallshot which we were obliged to fire at them when they attacked us at our coming out of the boat but they had probably seen the effects of them from their lurking places upon the birds that we had shot tupia who was now become a good marksman frequently strayed from us to shoot parrots and he had told us that while he was thus employed he had once met with nine indians who as soon as they perceived he saw them ran from him in great confusion and terror  thursday   the next day twelve canoes in each of which was a single indian came toward the wateringplace and were within half a mile of it a considerable time they were employed in striking fish upon which like others that we had seen before they were so intent that they seemed to regard nothing else it happened however that a party of our people were out a shooting near the place and one of the men whose curiosity might at length perhaps be roused by the report of the fowlingpieces was observed by mr banks to haul up his canoe upon the beach and go toward the shooting party in something more than a quarter of an hour he returned launched his canoe and went off in her to his companions this incident makes it probable that the natives acquired a knowledge of the destructive power of our firearms when we knew nothing of the matter for this man was not seen by any of the party whose operations he had reconnoitred    0 may thursday     while mr banks was gathering plants near the wateringplace i went with dr solander and mr monkhouse to the head of the bay that i might examine that part of the country and make farther attempts to form some connection with the natives in our way we met with eleven or twelve small canoes with each a man in it probably the same that were afterward abreast of the shore who all made into shoal water upon our approach we met other indians on shore the first time we landed who instantly took to their canoes and paddled away we went up the country to some distance and found the face of it nearly the same with that which has been described already but the soil was much richer for instead of sand i found a deep black mould which i thought very fit for the production of grain of any kind in the woods we found a tree which bore fruit that in color and shape resembled a cherry the juice had an agreeable tartness though but little flavor we found also interspersed some of the finest meadows in the world some places however were rocky but these were comparatively few the stone is sandy and might be used with advantage for building when we returned to the boat we saw some smoke upon another part of the coast and went thither in hopes of meeting with the people but at our approach these also ran away we found six small canoes and six fires very near the beach with some muscles roasting upon them and a few oysters lying near by this we judged that there had been one man in each canoe who having picked up some shellfish were come ashore to eat it and that each had made his separate fire for that purpose we tasted of their cheer and left them in return some strings of beads and other things which we thought would please them    0 may thursday   at the foot of a tree in this place we found a small well of fresh water supplied by a spring and the day being now far spent we returned to the ship in the evening mr banks made a little excursion with his gun and found such a number of quails resembling those in england that he might have shot as many as he pleased but his object was variety and not number  friday   the next morning as the wind would not permit me to sail i sent out several parties into the country to try again whether some intercourse could not be established with the natives a midshipman who belonged to one of these parties having straggled a long way from his companions met with a very old man and woman and some little children they were sitting under a tree by the water side and neither party saw the other till they were close together the indians showed signs of fear but did not attempt to run away the man happened to have nothing to give them but a parrot that he had shot this he offered but they refused to accept it withdrawing themselves from his hand either through fear or aversion his stay with them was but short for he saw several canoes near the beach fishing and being alone he feared they might come ashore and attack him he said that these people were very dark colored but not black that the man and woman appeared to be very old being both greyheaded that the hair of the mans head was bushy and his beard long and rough that the womans hair was cropped short and both of them were stark naked mr monkhouse the surgeon and one of the men who were with another party near the wateringplace also stayed from their companions and as they were coming out of a thicket observed six indians standing together at the distance of about fifty yards one of them pronounced a word very loud which was supposed to be a signal    0 may friday   for a lance was immediately thrown at him out of the wood which very narrowly missed him when the indians saw that the weapon had not taken effect they ran away with the greatest precipitation but on turning about toward the place whence the lance had been thrown he saw a young indian whom he judged to be about nineteen or twenty years old come down from a tree and he also ran away with such speed as made it hopeless to follow him mr monkhouse was of opinion that he had been watched by these indians in his passage through the thicket and that the youth had been stationed in the tree to discharge the lance at him upon a signal as he should come by but however this be there could be no doubt but that he was the person who threw the lance  in the afternoon i went myself with a party over to the north shore and while some of our people were hauling the seine we made an excursion a few miles into the country proceeding afterward in the direction of the coast we found this place without wood and somewhat resembling our moors in england the surface of the ground however was covered with a thin brush of plants about as high as the knees the hills near the coast are low but others rise behind them increasing by a gradual ascent to a considerable distance with marshes and morasses between when we returned to the boat we found that our people had caught with the seine a great number of small fish which are well known in the west indies and which our sailors call leather jackets because their skin is remarkably thick i had sent the second lieutenant out in the yawl a striking and when we got back to the ship we found that he also had been very successful he had observed that the large stingrays of which there is great plenty in the bay    0 may friday   followed the flowing tide into very shallow water he therefore took the opportunity of flood and struck several in not more than two or three feet water one of them weighed no less than two hundred and forty pounds after his entrails were taken out  saturday   the next morning as the wind still continued northerly i sent out the yawl again and the people struck one still larger for when his entrails were taken out he weighed three hundred and thirtysix pounds  the great quantity of plants which mr banks and dr solander collected in this place induced me to give it the name of botany bay it is situated in the latitude of    s longitude  0     w it is capacious safe and convenient and may be known by the land on the seacoast which is nearly level and of a moderate height in general higher than it is farther inland with steep rocky cliffs next the sea which have the appearance of a long island lying close under the shore the harbor lies about the middle of this land and in approaching it from the southward is discovered before the ship comes abreast of it but from the northward it is not discovered so soon the entrance is a little more than a quarter of a mile broad and lies in wnw to sail into it the southern shore should be kept on board till the ship is within a small bare island which lies close under the north shore within this island the deepest water on that side is seven fathom shallowing to five a good way up at a considerable distance from the south shore there is a shoal reaching from the inner south point quite to the head of the harbor but over toward the north and north west shore there is a channel of twelve or fourteen feet at low water for three or four leagues up to a place where there is three or four fathom but here i found very little fresh water we anchored near the south shore    0 may saturday   about a mile within the entrance for the convenience of sailing with a southerly wind and because i thought it the best situation for watering but i afterward found a very fine stream on the north shore in the first sandy cove within the island before which a ship might lie almost landlocked and procure wood as well as water in great abundance wood indeed is every where plenty but i saw only two kinds which may be considered as timber these trees are as large or larger than the english oak and one of them has not a very different appearance this is the same that yields the reddish gum like sanguis draconis and the wood is heavy hard and darkcolored like lignum vitae the other grows tall and strait something like the pine and the wood of this which has some resemblance to the live oak of america is also hard and heavy there are a few shrubs and several kinds of the palm mangroves also grow in great plenty near the head of the bay the country in general is level low and woody as far as we could see the woods as i have before observed abound with birds of exquisite beauty particularly of the parrot kind we found also crows here exactly the same with those in england about the head of the harbor where there are large flats of sand and mud there is great plenty of waterfowl most of which were altogether unknown to us one of the most remarkable was black and white much larger than a swan and in shape somewhat resembling a pelican on these banks of sand and mud there are great quantities of oysters muscles cockles and other shellfish which seem to be the principal subsistence of the inhabitants who go into shoal water with their little canoes and pick them out with their hands we did not observe that they eat any of them raw nor do they always go on shore to dress them for they have frequently fires in their canoes for that purpose they do not however subsist wholly upon this food    0 may saturday   for they catch a variety of other fish some of which they strike with gigs and some they take with hook and line all the inhabitants that we saw were stark naked they did not appear to be numerous nor to live in societies but like other animals were scattered about along the coast and in the woods of their manner of life however we could know but little as we were never able to form the least connection with them after the first contest at our landing they would never come near enough to parley nor did they touch a single article of all that we had left at their huts and the places they frequented on purpose for them to take away  during my stay in this harbor i caused the english colors to be displayed on shore every day and the ships name and the date of the year to be inscribed upon one of the trees near the wateringplace  it is high water here at the full and change of the moon about eight oclock and the tide rises and falls perpendicularly between four and five feet  chap iv the range from botany bay to trinity bay

after coming to the southward we steered along the shore n n e and at noon our latitude by observation was     0 s at this time we were between two and three miles distant from the land and abreast of a bay or harbor in which there appeared to be good anchorage and which i called port jackson this harbor lies three leagues to the northward of botany bay the variation by several azimuths appeared to

twelve at night and at the distance of about five leagues had seventy fathom at the distance of six leagues we had eighty fathom which is the extent of the soundings for at the distance of ten leagues we had no ground with   0 fathom  thursday  0 the wind continuing northerly till the morning of the  0th we continued to stand in and off the shore with very little change of situation in other respects but a gale then springing up at s w we made the best of our way along the shore to the northward at sunrise our latitude was      s and the variation   e at nine in the forenoon we passed a

at the distance of about a mile a low rocky point which i called point stephens on the north side of which is an inlet which i called port stephens this inlet appeared to me from the mast head to be sheltered from all winds it lies in latitude     0 longitude  0     and at the entrance are three small islands two of which are high and on the main near the shore are some high round hills which at a distance appear like islands in passing this bay    0 may thursday  0 at the distance of two or three miles from the shore our soundings were from thirtythree to twentyseven fathom from which i conjectured that there must be a sufficient depth of water within it at a little distance within land we saw smoke in several places and at half an hour past five the northermost land in sight bore n

shore in the afternoon we saw smoke in several places at a little distance from the beach and one upon the top of a hill which was the first we had seen upon elevated ground since our arrival upon the coast at sunset we had twentythree fathom at the distance of a league and an half from the shore the northermost land then bore n    e and three hills remarkably large and high lying contiguous to each other and not far from the beach n n w as these hills bore some resemblance to each other we called them the three brothers they lie in latitude     0 and may be seen fourteen or sixteen leagues we steered n e by n all night having from twentyseven to sixtyseven fathom at the distance of between two and six leagues from the shore     0 may saturday    at daybreak we steered north for the northermost land in sight at noon we were four leagues from the shore and by observation in latitude       s which was fifteen miles to the southward of that given by the log our longitude  0     w in the afternoon we stood in for the land where we saw smoke in several places till six in the evening when being within three or four miles of it and in twentyfour fathom of water we stood off with a fresh breeze at n and n n w till midnight when we had     fathom at the distance of eight leagues from the land and then tacked sunday    at three in the morning the wind veered to the westward when

condsierable height and over the pitch of the point is a round hillock within it are two others much higher and larger and within them the land is very low our latitude was  0    s longitude  0     w this day the observed latitude was only five miles south of the log we saw smoke in several parts along the coast besides that seen upon smokey cape  in the afternoon the wind being at n e we stood off and on and at three or four miles distance from the shore had thirty fathom water the wind afterward coming cross off land we stood to the northward having from thirty to twentyone fathom at the distance of four or five miles from the shore  monday    at five in the morning the wind veered to the north and blew fresh attended with squalls at eight it began to thunder and rain and in about an hour it fell calm    0 may monday    which gave us an opportunity to sound and we had eightysix fathom at between four and five leagues from the shore soon after this we had a gale from the southward with which we steered n by w for the northermost land in sight at noon we were about four leagues from the shore and by observation in latitude  0    which was nine miles to the southward of our reckoning longitude  0     w some lands near the shore of a considerable height bore w  as we advanced to the northward from botany bay the land gradually increased in height so that in this latitude it may be called a hilly country between this latitude and the bay it exhibits a pleasing variety of ridges hills valleys and plains all clothed with wood of the same appearance with that which has been particularly described the land near the shore is in general low and sandy except the points which are rocky and over many of them are high hills which at their first rising out of the water have the appearance of islands in the afternoon we had some small rocky islands between us and the land the southermost of which lies in latitude  0  0 and the northermost in       and somewhat more than two leagues from the land about two miles without the northermost island we had thirtythree fathom water having the advantage of a moon we steered along the shore all night in the direction of n and n by e keeping at the distance of about three leagues from the land and having from twenty to twentyfive fathom water as soon as it was light having a fresh gale we made all the fail we could and at nine oclock in the morning tuesday    being about a league from the shore we discovered smoke in many places and having recourse to our glasses we saw about twenty of the natives who had each a large bundle upon his back    0 may tuesday    which we conjectured to be palm leaves for covering their houses we continued to observe them above an hour during which they walked upon the beach and up a path that led over a hill of a gentle ascent behind which we lost sight of them not one of them was observed to stop and look toward us but they trudged along to all appearance without the least emotion either of curiosity or surprise though it is impossible they should not have seen the ship by a casual glance as they walked along the shore and though she must with respect to every other object they had yet seen have been little less stupendous and unaccountable than a floating mountain with all its woods would have been to us at noon our latitude by observation was       s and longitude  0    w a high point of land which i named cape byron bore n w by w at the distance of three miles it lies in latitude        0 s longitude  0   0 w and may be known by a remarkable sharp peaked mountain which lies inland and bears from it n w by w from this point the land trends n    w inland it is high and hilly but low near the shore to the southward of the point it is also low and level we continued to steer along the shore with a fresh gale till sunset when we suddenly discovered breakers ahead directly in the ships course and also on our larboard bow at this time we were about five miles from the land and had twenty fathom water we hauled up east till eight when we had run eight miles and increased our depth of water to fortyfour fathom we then brought to with the ships head to the eastward and lay upon this tack till ten when having increased our sounding to seventyeight fathom we wore and lay with the ships head to the land till five in the morning wednes    when we made sail and at daylight were greatly surprised to find ourselves farther to the southward than we had been the evening before though the wind had been southerly    0 may wednes  0 and blown fresh all night we now saw the breakers again within us and passed them at the distance of one league they lie in latitude      s stretching off east two leagues from a point of land under which is a small island their situation may always be known by the peaked mountain which has been just mentioned and which bears from them s w by w for this reason i have named it mount warning it lies seven or eight leagues inland in latitude       s the land about it is high and hilly but it is of itself sufficiently conspicuous to be at once distinguished from every other object the point off which these shoals lie i have named point danger to the northward of this point the land is low and trends n w by n but it soon turns again more to the northward  at noon we were about two leagues from the land and by observation in latitude       s which was seventeen miles to the southward of the log our longitude was  0   0 w mount warning bore s    w distant fourteen leagues and the northermost land in sight bore n we pursued our course along the shore at the distance of about two leagues in the direction of n e till between four and five in the afternoon when we discovered breakers on our larboard bow our depth of water was thirtyseven fathom and at sunset the northermost land bore n by w the breakers n w by w distant four miles and the northermost land set at noon which formed a point and to which i gave the name of point lookout w distant five or six miles in the latitude of      on the north side of this point the shore forms a wide open bay which i called moretons bay in the bottom of which the land is so low that i could but just see it from the topmast head the breakers lie between three and four miles from point lookout and at this time we had a great sea from the southward    0 may wednes    which broke upon them very high we stood on n n e till eight oclock when having passed the breakers and deepened our water to fiftytwo fathom we brought to till midnight when made sail again to the n n e thursday    at four in the morning we had     fathom and when the day broke i perceived that during the night i had got much farther northward and from the shore than i expected from the course we steered for we were distant at least seven leagues i therefore hauled in n w by w with a fresh gale at s s w the land that was farthest to the north the night before now bore s s w distant six leagues and i gave it the name of cape moreton it being the north point of moretons bay its latitude is       and its longitude is  0     from cape moreton the land trends away west farther than can be seen for there is a small space where at this time no land is visible and some on board having also observed that the sea looked paler than usual were of opinion that the bottom of moretons bay opened into a river we had here thirtyfour fathom water and a fine sandy bottom this alone would have produced the change that had been observed in the color of the water and it was by no means necessary to suppose a river to account for the land at the bottom of the bay not being visible for supposing the land there to be as low as we knew it to be in a hundred other parts of the coast it would have been impossible to see it from the station of the ship however if any future navigator should be disposed to determine the question whether there is or is not a river in this place which the wind would not permit us to do the situation may always be found by three hills which lie to the northward of it in the latitude of       these hills lie but a little way inland and not far from each other they are remarkable for the singular form of their elevation which very much resembles a glasshouse    0 may thursday    and for which reason i called them the glass houses the northermost of the three is the highest and largest there are also several other peaked hills inland to the northward of these but they are not nearly so remarkable at noon our latitude was by observation       s which was ten miles to the northward of the log a circumstance which had never before happened upon this coast our longitude was  0     at this time we were between two and three leagues from the land and had twentyfour fathom water a low bluff point which was the south head of a sandy bay bore n    w distant three leagues and the northermost point of land in sight bore n e this day we saw smoke in several places and some at a considerable distance inland  in steering along the shore at the distance of two leagues our soundings were from twentyfour to thirtytwo fathom

knowing which way to steer  at two in the morning however friday  we made sail with the wind at s w and at daylight we saw the land extending as far as n e the point we had set the night before bore s w by w distant between three and four leagues it lies in latitude       longitude  0     w the land within it is of a moderate and equal height but the point itself is so unequal that it looks like two small islands lying under the land for which reason i gave it the name of double island point it may also be known by the white cliffs on the north side of it here the land trends to the n w and forms a large open bay the bottom of which is so low a flat that from the deck it could scarcely be seen    0 may friday    in crossing this bay our depth of water was from thirty to twentytwo fathom

coast which is of a moderate height is more barren than any we had seen and the soil more sandy with our glasses we could discover that the sands which lay in great patches of many acres were moveable and that some of them had not been long in the place they possessed for we saw in several parts trees half buried the tops of which were still green and in others the naked trunks of such as the sand had surrounded long enough to destroy in other places the woods appeared to be low and shrubby and we saw no signs of inhabitants two water snakes swam by the ship they were beautifully spotted and in every respect like land snakes except that their tails were broad and flat probably to serve them instead of fins in swimming in the morning of this day the variation was    0 e and in the evening      during the night we continued our course to the northward with a light breeze from the land being distant from it between two and three leagues and having from twentythree to twentyseven fathom with a fine sandy bottom  saturday    at noon on the   th we were about four miles from the land with only thirteen fathom our latitude was      and the northermost land in sight bore n    w distant eight miles at one oclock being still four miles distant from the shore but having seventeen fathom water we passed a black bluff head or point of land upon which a great number of the natives were assembled and which therefore i called indian head it lies in latitude      about four miles n by w of this head is another very like it from whence the land trends away somewhat more to the westward next to the sea it is low and sandy    0 may saturday    and behind it nothing was to be seen even from the masthead near indian head we saw more of the natives and upon the neighboring shore fires by night and smoke by day we kept to the northward all night at the distance of from four miles to four leagues from the shore and with a depth of water from seventeen to thirtyfour fathom at daybreak sunday  0 the northermost land bore from us w s w and seemed to end in a point from which we discovered a reef running out to the northward as far as we could see we had hauled our wind to the westward before it was light and continued the course till we saw the breakers upon our see bow we now edged away n w and n n w along the east side of the shoal from two to one mile distant having regular soundings from thirteen to seven fathom with a fine sandy bottom at noon our latitude by observation was  0    which was thirteen miles to the northward of the log we judged the extreme point of the shoal to bear from us about n w and the point from which it seemed to run out bore s w distant twenty miles this point i named sandy cape from two very large patches of white sand which lay upon it it is sufficiently high to be seen at the distance of twelve leagues in clear weather and lies in latitude       longitude  0     the land trends from it s w as far as can be seen we kept along the east side of the shoal till two in the afternoon when judging that there was a sufficient depth of water upon it to allow passage for the ship i sent the boat ahead to sound and upon her making the signal for more than five fathom we hauled our wind and stood over the tail of it in six fathom at this time we were in latitude       and sandy cape bore s e distant eight leagues but the direction of the shoal is nearest n n w and s s e    0 may sunday  0 it is remarkable that when on board the ship we had six fathom the boat which was scarcely a quarter of a mile to the southward had little more than five and that immediately after six fathom we had thirteen and then twenty as fast as the man could cast the lead from these circumstances i conjectured that the west side of the shoal was steep this shoal i called the break sea spit because we had now smooth water and to the southward of it we had always a high sea from the s e at six in the evening the land of sandy cape extended from s    e to s    e at the distance of eight leagues our depth of water was twentythree fathom with the same soundings we stood to the westward all night monday    at seven in the morning we saw from the masthead the land of sandy cape bearing s e e distant about thirteen leagues at nine we discovered land to the westward and soon after saw smoke in several places our depth of water was now decreased to seventeen fathom and by noon we had no more than thirteen though we were seven leagues from the land which extended from s by w to w n w our latitude at this time was      s for a few days past we had seen several of the sea birds called boobies not having met with any of them before last night a small flock of them passed the ship and went away to the n w and in the morning from about half an hour before sunrise to half an hour after flights of them were continually coming from the n n w and flying to the s s e nor was one of them seen to fly in any other direction we therefore conjectured that there was a lagoon river or inlet of shallow water in the bottom of the deep bay to the southward of us whither these birds resorted to feed in the day and that not far to the northward there were some islands to which they repaired in the night to this bay i gave the name of herveys bay in honor of captain hervey in the afternoon we stood in for the land    0 may monday    steering s w with a gentle breeze at s e till four oclock when being in latitude       about two leagues from the shore and having nine fathom water we bore away along the coast n w by w and at the same time could see land extending to the s s e about eight leagues near the sea the land is very low but within there are some lofty hills all thickly clothed with wood while we were running along the shore we shallowed our water from nine to seven fathom and at one time we had but six which determined us to anchor for the night  at six in the morning we weighed tuesday    with a gentle breeze from the southward and steered n w w edging in for the land till we got within two miles of it with water from seven to eleven fathom we then steered n n w as the land lay and at noon our latitude was       we continued in the same course at the same distance with from twelve fathom to seven till five in the evening when we were abreast of the south point of a large open bay in which i intended to anchor during this course we discovered with our glasses that the land was covered with palmnuttrees which we had not seen from the time of our leaving the islands within the tropic we also saw two men walking along the shore who did not condescend to take the least notice of us in the evening having hauled close upon a wind and made two or three trips we anchored about eight oclock in five fathom with a fine sandy bottom the south point of the bay bore e s distant two miles the north point n w n and about the same distance from the shore  early the next morning i went ashore wednes    with a party of men in order to examine the country accompanied by mr banks dr solander the other gentlemen and tupia the wind blew fresh    0 may wednes    and we found it so cold that being at some distance from the shore we took our cloaks as a necessary equipment for the voyage we landed a little within the south point of the bay where we found a channel leading into a large lagoon this channel i proceeded to examine and found three fathom water till i got about a mile up it where i met with a shoal upon which there was little more than one fathom but having passed over it i had three fathom again the entrance of this channel lies close to the south point of the bay being formed by the shore on the east and on the west by a large spit of sand it is about a quarter of a mile broad and lies in s by w in this place there is room for a few ships to lie in great security and a small stream of fresh water i would have rowed into the lagoon but was prevented by shallows we found several bogs and swamps of salt water upon which and by the sides of the lagoon grows the true mangrove such as is found in the west indies and the first of the kind that we had met with in the branches of these mangroves there were many nests of a remarkable kind of ant that was as green as grass when the branches were disturbed they came out in great numbers and punished the offender by a much sharper bite than ever we had felt from the same kind of animal before upon these mangroves also we saw small green caterpillars in great numbers their bodies were thick set with hairs and they were ranged upon the leaves side by side like a file of soldiers to the number of twenty or thirty together when we touched them we found that the hair on their bodies had the quality of a nettle and gave us a much more acute though less durable pain the country here is manifestly worse than about botany bay the soil is dry and sandy but the sides of the hills are covered with trees which grow separately without underwood we found here the tree that yields a gum like the sanguis draconis    0 may wednes    but it is somewhat different from the trees of the same kind which we had seen before for the leaves are longer and hang down like those of the weeping willow we found also much less gum upon them which is contrary to the established opinion that the hotter the climate the more gums exude upon a plant also which yielded a yellow gum there was less than upon the same kind of plant in botany bay among the shoals and sandbanks we saw many large birds some in particular of the same kind that we had seen in botany bay much bigger than swans which we judged to be pelicans but they were so shy that we could not get within gunshot of them upon the shore we saw a species of the bustard one of which we shot it was as large as a turkey and weighed seventeen pounds and an half we all agreed that this was the best bird we had eaten since we left england and in honor of it we called this inlet bustard bay it lies in latitude      longitude  0     the sea seemed to abound with fish but unhappily we tore our seine all to pieces at the first haul upon the mudbanks under the mangroves we found innumerable oysters of various kinds among others the hammeroyster and a large proportion of small pearloysters if in deeper water there is equal plenty of such oysters at their full growth a pearl fishery might certainly be established here to very great advantage  the people who were left on board the ship said that while we were in the woods about twenty of the natives came down to the beach abreast of her and having looked at her sometime went away but we that were ashore though we saw smoke in many places saw no people the smoke was at places too distant for us to get to them by land except one to which we repaired    0 may wednes    we found ten small fires still burning within a few paces of each other but the people were gone we saw near them several vessels of bark which we supposed to have contained water and some shells and fishbones the remains of a recent meal we saw also lying upon the ground several pieces of soft bark about the length and breadth of a man which we imagined might be their beds and on the windward side of the fires a small shade about a foot and a half high of the same substance the whole was in a thicket of close trees which afforded good shelter from the wind the place seemed to be much trodden and as we saw no house nor any remains of a house we were inclined to believe that as these people had no clothes they had no dwelling but spent their nights among the other commoners of nature in the open air and tupia himself with an air of superiority and compassion shook his head and said that they were taata enos poor wretches i measured the perpendicular height of the last tide and found it to be eight feet above low water mark and from the time of low water this day i found that it must be high water at the full and change of the moon at eight oclock  thursday    at four oclock in the morning we weighed and with a gentle breeze at south made sail out of the bay in standing out our soundings were from five to fifteen fathom and at daylight when we were in the greatest depth and abreast of the north head of the bay we discovered breakers stretching out from it nne between two and three miles with a rock at the outermost point of them just above water while we were passing these rocks at the distance of about half a mile we had from fifteen to twenty fathom and as soon as we had passed them we hauled along shore wnw for the farthest land we had in sight at noon our latitude by observation was       s    0 may thursday    the north part of bustard bay bore s    e distant ten miles and the northermost land in sight n  0 w the longitude was  0     and our distance from the nearest shore six miles with fourteen fathom water  till five in the afternoon it was calm but afterward we steered before the wind n w as the land lay till ten at night and then brought to having had all along fourteen and fifteen fathom at five in the morning we made sail friday    and at daylight the northermost point of the main bore n  0 w soon after we saw more land making like islands and bearing n w by n at nine we were abreast of the point at the distance of one mile with fourteen fathom water this point i found to lie directly under the tropic of capricorn and for that reason i called it cape capricorn its longitude is  0     w it is of a considerable height looks white and barren and may be known by some islands which lie to the n w of it and some small rocks at the distance of about a league s e on the west side of the cape there appeared to be a lagoon and on the two spits which formed the entrance we saw an incredible number of the large birds that resemble a pelican the northermost land now in sight bore from cape capricorn n    w and appeared to be an island but the main land trended w by n n which course we steered having from fifteen to six fathom and from six to nine with a hard sandy bottom at noon our latitude by observation was       s cape capricorn bore s  0 e distant two leagues and a small island n by e two miles in this situation we had nine fathom being about four miles from the main which next the sea is low and sandy except the points which are high and rocky the country inland is hilly but by no means of a pleasing aspect we continued to stand to the n w till four oclock in the afternoon when it fell calm    0 may friday    and we soon after anchored in twelve fathom having the main land and islands in a manner all round us and cape capricorn bearing s    e distant four leagues in the night we found the tide rise and fall near seven feet and the flood to set to the westward and the ebb to the eastward which is just contrary to what we found when we were at anchor to the eastward of bustard bay  saturday    at six in the morning we weighed with a gentle breeze at south and stood away to the n w between the outermost range of islands and the main leaving several small islands between the main and the ship which we passed at a very little distance our soundings being irregular from twelve to four fathom i sent a boat ahead to sound at noon we were about three miles from the main and about the same distance from the islands without us our latitude by observation was      s the main land here is high and mountainous the islands which lie off it are also most of them high and of a small circuit having an appearance rather of barrenness than fertility at this time we saw smoke in many places at a considerable distance inland and therefore conjectured that there might be a lagoon river or inlet running up the country the rather as we had passed two places which had the appearance of being such but our depth of water was too little to encourage me to venture where i should probably have less we had not stood to the northward above an hour before we suddenly fell into three fathom upon which i anchored and sent away the master to found the channel which lay to leeward of us between the northermost island and the main it appeared to be pretty broad but i suspected that it was shallow and so indeed it was found for the master reported at his return that in many places he had only two fathom and an half and where we lay at anchor we had only sixteen feet    0 may saturday    which was not two feet more than the ship drew while the master was sounding the channel mr banks tried to fish from the cabin windows with hook and line the water was too shallow for fish but the ground was almost covered with crabs which readily took the bait and sometimes held it so fast in their claws that they did not quit their hold till they were considerably above water these crabs were of two sorts and both of them such as we had not seen before one of them was adorned with the finest blue that can be imagined in every respect equal to the ultramarine with which all his claws and every joint was deeply tinged the under part of him was white and so exquisitely polished that in color and brightness it exactly resembled the white of old china the other was also marked with the ultramarine upon his joints and his toes but somewhat more sparingly and his back was marked with three brown spots which had a singular appearance the people who had been out with the boat to sound reported that upon an island where we had observed two fires they had seen several of the inhabitants who called to them and seemed very desirous that they should land in the evening the wind veered to e n e which gave us an opportunity to stretch three or four miles back by the way we came after which the wind shifted to the south and obliged us again to anchor in six fathom  at five in the morning sunday    i sent away the master to search for a passage between the islands while we got the ship under sail and as soon as it was light we followed the boat which made a signal that a passage had been found as soon as we got again into deep water we made sail to the northward as the land lay with soundings from nine fathom to fifteen and some small islands still without us at noon we were about two leagues distant from the main    0 may sunday    and by observation in latitude       s the northermost point of land in sight now bore n n w distant ten miles to this point i gave the name of cape manifold from the number of high hills which appeared over it it lies in latitude       s and distant about seventeen leagues from cape capricorn in the direction of n    w between these capes the shore forms a large bay which i called keppel bay and i also distinguished the islands by the name of keppels islands in this bay there is good anchorage but what refreshments it may afford i know not we caught no fish though we were at anchor but probably there is fresh water in several places as both the islands and the main are inhabited we saw smoke and fires upon the main and upon the islands we saw people at three in the afternoon we passed cape manifold from which the lands trends n n w the land of the cape is high rising in hills directly from the sea and may be known by three islands which lie off it one of them near the shore and the other two eight miles out at sea one of these islands is low and flat and the other high and round at six oclock in the evening we brought to when the northermost part of the main in sight bore n w and some islands which lie off it n    w our soundings after twelve oclock were from twenty to twentyfive fathom and in the night from thirty to thirtyfour  monday    at daybreak we made sail cape manifold bearing s by e distant eight leagues and the islands which i had set the night before were distant four miles in the same direction the farthest visible point of the main bore n    w at the distance of twentytwo miles but we could see several islands to the northward of this direction at nine oclock in the forenoon we were abreast of the point which i called cape townshend it lies in latitude          0 may monday    longitude  0     the land is high and level and rather naked than woody several islands lie to the northward of it at the distance of four or five miles out at sea three or four leagues to the s e the shore forms a bay in the bottom of which there appeared to be an inlet or harbor to the westward of the cape the land trends s w s and there forms a very large bay which turns to the eastward and probably communicates with the inlet and makes the land of the cape an island as soon as we got round this cape we hauled our wind to the westward in order to get within the islands which lie scattered in the bay in great numbers and extend out to sea as far as the eye could reach even from the masthead these islands vary both in height and circuit from each other so that although they are very numerous no two of them are alike we had not stood long upon a wind before we came into shoal water and were obliged to tack at once to avoid it having sent a boat ahead i bore away w by n many small islands rocks and shoals lying between us and the main and many of a larger extent without us our soundings till near noon were from fourteen to seventeen fathom when the boat made the signal for meeting with shoal water upon this we hauled close upon a wind to the eastward but suddenly fell into three fathom and a quarter we immediately dropped an anchor which brought the ship up with all her sails standing when the ship was brought up we had four fathom with a coarse sandy bottom and found a strong tide setting to the n w by w w at the rate of near three miles an hour by which we were so suddenly carried upon the shoal our latitude by observation was      s cape townshend bore e    s distant thirteen miles and the westermost part of the main in sight w n    0 may monday    at this time a great number of islands lay all round us  in the afternoon having sounded round the ship and found that there was water sufficient to carry her over the shoal we weighed and about three oclock made sail and stood to the westward as the land lay having sent a boat ahead to sound at six in the evening we anchored in ten fathom with a sandy bottom at about two miles distance from the main the westermost part of which bore w n w and a great number of islands lying a long way without us were still in sight  tuesday    at five oclock the next morning i sent away the master with two boats to sound the entrance of an inlet which bore from us west at about the distance of a league into which i intended to go with the ship that i might wait a few days till the moon should increase and in the mean time examine the country as soon as the ship could be got under sail the boats made the signal for anchorage upon which we stood in and anchored in five fathom water about a league within the entrance of the inlet which as i observed a tide to flow and ebb considerably i judged to be a river that ran up the country to a considerable distance in this place i had thoughts of laying the ship ashore and cleaning her bottom i therefore landed with the master in search of a convenient place for that purpose and was accompanied by mr banks and dr solander we found walking here exceedingly troublesome for the ground was covered with a kind of grass the seeds of which were very sharp and bearded backwards so that whenever they stuck into our clothes which indeed was at every step they worked forwards by means of the beard till they got at the flesh and at the same time we were surrounded by a cloud of musquitos which incessantly tormented us with their stings    0 may tuesday    we soon met with several places where the ship might conveniently be laid ashore but to our great disappointment we could find no fresh water we proceeded however up the country where we found gum trees like those that we had seen before and observed that here also the gum was in very small quantities upon the branches of these trees and some others we found ants nests made of clay as big as a bushel something like those described in sir hans sloans natural history of jamaica vol ii p     tab     but not so smooth the ants which inhabited these nests were small and their bodies white but upon another species of the tree we found a small black ant which perforated all the twigs and having worked out the pith occupied the pipe which had contained it yet the parts in which these insects had thus formed a lodgment and in which they swarmed in amazing numbers bore leaves and flowers and appeared to be in as flourishing a state as those that were sound we found also an incredible number of butterflies so that for the space of three or four acres the air was so crowded with them that millions were to be seen in every direction at the same time that every branch and twig was covered with others that were not upon the wing we found here also a small fish of a singular kind it was about the size of a minnow and had two very strong breast fins we found it in places that were quite dry where we supposed it might have been left by the tide but it did not seem to have become languid by the want of water for upon our approach it leaped away by the help of the breast fins as nimbly as a frog neither indeed did it seem to prefer water to land for when we found it in the water it frequently leaped out and pursued its way upon dry ground we also observed that when it was in places where small stones were standing above the surface of the water at a little distance from each other    0 may tuesday    it chose rather to leap from stone to stone than to pass through the water and we saw several of them pass entirely over puddles in this manner till they came to dry ground and then leap away  in the afternoon we renewed our search after fresh water but without success and therefore i determined to make my stay here but short however having observed from an eminence that the inlet penetrated a considerable way into the country i determined to trace it in the morning  wednes  0 at sunrise i went ashore and climbing a considerable hill i took a view of the coast and the islands that lie off it with their bearings having an azimuth compass with me for that purpose but i observed that the needle differed very considerably in its position even to thirty degrees in some places more in others less and once i found it differ from itself no less than two points in the distance of fourteen feet i took up some of the loose stones that lay upon the ground and applied them to the needle but they produced no effect and i therefore concluded that there was iron ore in the hills of which i had remarked other indications both here and in the neighboring parts after i had made my observations upon the hill i proceeded with dr solander up the inlet i set out with the first of the flood and long before high water i had advanced above eight leagues its breadth thus far was from two to five miles upon a s w by s direction but here it opened every way and formed a large lake which to the n w communicated with the sea and i not only saw the sea in this direction but found the tide of flood coming strongly in from that point i also observed an arm of this lake extending to the eastward and it is not improbable that it may communicate with the sea in the bottom of the bay    0 may wednes  0 which lies to the westward of cape townshend on the south side of the lake is a ridge of high hills which i was very desirous to climb but it being high water and the day far spent i was afraid of being bewildered among the shoals in the night especially as the weather was dark and rainy and therefore i made the best of my way to the ship in this excursion i saw only two people and they were at a distance they followed the boat along the shore a good way but the tide running strongly in my favor i could not prudently wait for them i saw however several fires in one direction and smoke in another but they also were at a distance while i was tracing the inlet with dr solander mr banks was endeavoring to penetrate into the country where several of the people who had leave to go ashore were also rambling about mr banks and his party found their course obstructed by a swamp covered with mangroves which however they resolved to pass the mud was almost knee deep yet they resolutely went on but before they got half way they repented of their undertaking the bottom was covered with branches of trees interwoven with each other sometimes they kept their footing upon them sometimes their feet slipped through and sometimes they were so entangled among them that they were forced to free themselves by groping in the mud and slime with their hands in about an hour however they crossed it and judged it might be about a quarter of a mile over after a short walk they came up to a place where there had been four small sires and near them some shells and bones of fish that had been roasted they found also heaps of grass laid together where four or five people appeared to have slept the second lieutenant mr gore who was at another place saw a little water lying in the bottom of a gully and near it the track of a large animal some bustards were also seen but none of them shot    0 may wednes  0 nor any other bird except a few of the beautiful loriquets which we had seen in botany bay mr gore and one of the midshipmen who were in different places said that they had heard the voices of indians near them but had seen none the country in general appeared sandy and barren and being destitute of fresh water it cannot be supposed to have any settled inhabitants the deep gullies which were worn by torrents from the hills prove that at certains seasons the rains here are very copious and heavy  the inlet in which the ship lay i called thirsty sound because it afforded us no fresh water it lies in latitude     0 s and longitude   0    w and may be known by a group of small islands lying under the shore from two to five leagues distant in the direction of n w and by another group of islands that lie right before it between three and four leagues out at sea over each of the points that form the entrance is a high round hill which on the n w is a peninsula that at high water is surrounded by the sea they are bold to both the shores and the distance between them is about two miles in this inlet is good anchorage in seven six five and four fathom and places very convenient for laying a ship down where at springtides the water does not rise less than sixteen or eighteen feet the tide flows at the full and change of the moon about eleven oclock i have already observed that here is no fresh water nor could we procure refreshment of any other kind we saw two turtles but we were not able to take either of them neither did we catch either fish or wildfowl except a few small landbirds we saw indeed the same sorts of waterfowl as in botany bay but they were so shy that we could not get a shot at them  as i had not therefore a single inducement to stay longer in this place thursday    i weighed anchor at six oclock in the morning of thursday the   st of may and put to sea    0 june thursday    we stood to the n w with a fresh breeze at s s e and kept without the group of islands that lie in shore and to the n w of thirsty sound as there appeared to be no safe passage between them and the main at the same time we had a number of islands without us extending as far as we could see during our run in this direction our depth of water was ten eight and nine fathom at noon the west point of thirsty sound which i have called pier head bore s    e distant five leagues the east point of the other inlet which communicates with the sound bore s by w distant two leagues the group of islands just mentioned lay between us and the point and the farthest part of the main in sight on the other side of the inlet bore n w our latitude by observation was       at half an hour after twelve the boat which was sounding ahead made the signal for shoal water and we immediately hauled our wind to the n e at this time we had seven fathom at the next cast five and at the next three upon which we instantly dropped an anchor that brought the ship up pier head the north west point of thirstysound bore s e distant six leagues being halfway between the islands which lie off the east point of the western inlet and three small islands which lie directly without them it was now the first of the flood which we found to set n w by w w and having sounded about the shoal upon which we had three fathom and found deep water all round it we got under sail and having hauled round the three islands that have been just mentioned came to an anchor under the ice of them in fifteen fathom water and the weather being dark hazy and rainy we remained there till seven oclock in the morning june friday   at this time we got again under fail and stood to the n w with a fresh breeze at s s e having the main land in sight and a number of islands all round us    0 june friday   some of which lay out at sea as far as the eye could reach the western inlet which in the chart is distinguished by the name of broad sound we had now all open at the entrance it is at least nine or ten leagues wide in it and before it lie several islands and probably shoals also for our soundings were very irregular varying suddenly from ten to four fathom at noon our latitude by observation was       s a point of land which forms the north west entrance into broad sound and which i have named cape palmerston lying in latitude     0 longitude   0    w bore w by n distant three leagues our latitude was       our longitude   0    between this cape and cape townshend lies the bay which i have called the bay of inlets we continued to stand to the n w and n w by n as the land lay under an easy sail having a boat ahead to sound at first the soundings were very irregular from nine to four fathom but afterward they were regular from nine to eleven at eight in the evening being about two leagues from the main land we anchored in eleven fathom with a sandy bottom and soon after we found the tide setting with a slow motion to the westward at one oclock it was slack or low water and at half an hour after two the ship tended to the eastward and rode so till six in the morning saturday   when the tide had risen eleven feet we now got under sail and stood away in the direction of the coast n n w from what we had observed of the tide during the night it is plain that the flood came from the n w whereas the preceding day and several days before it came from the s e nor was this the first or even second time that we had remarked the same thing at sunrise this morning we found the variation to be      e and in steering along the shore between the island and the main at the distance of about two leagues from the main and three or four from the island    0 june saturday   our soundings were regular from twelve to nine fathom but about eleven oclock in the forenoon we were again embarrassed with shoal water having at one time not more than three fathom yet we got clear without casting anchor at noon we were about two leagues from the main and four from the islands without us our latitude by observation was  0    and a high promontory which i named cape hillsborough bore w n distant seven miles the land here is diversified by mountains hills plains and valleys and seems to be well clothed with herbage and wood the islands which lie parallel to the coast and from five to eight or nine miles distant are of various height and extent scarcely any of them are more than five leagues in circumference and many are not four miles besides this chain of islands which lies at a distance from the coast there are others much less which lie under the land from which we saw smoke rising in different places we continued to steer along the shore at the distance of about two leagues with regular soundings from nine to ten fathom at sunset the farthest point of the main bore n    w and to the northward of this lay some high land which i took to be an island and of which the north west point bore    w but not being sure of a passage i came to an anchor about eight oclock in the evening in ten fathom water with a muddy bottom about ten we had a tide setting to the northward and at two it had fallen nine feet after this it began to rise and the flood came from the northward in the direction of the islands which lay out to sea a plain indication that there was no passage to the n w this however had not appeared at daybreak sunday   when we got under sail and stood to the n w at eight oclock in the morning we discovered low land quite across what we took for an opening which proved to be a bay about five or six leagues deep    0 june sunday   upon this we hauled our wind to the eastward round the north point of the bay which at this time bore from us n e by n distant four leagues from this point we found the land trend way n by w w and a straight or passage between it and a large island or islands lying parallel to it having the tide of ebb in our favor we stood for this passage and at noon were just within the entrance our latitude by observation was  0    s cape hillsborough bore s by e distant ten leagues and the north point of the bay s    w distant four miles this point which i named cape conway lies in latitude       s longitude        w and the bay which lies between this cape and cape hillsborough i called repulse bay the greatest depth of water which we found in it was thirteen fathom and the least eight in all parts there was safe anchorage and i believe that upon proper examination some good harbors would be found in it especially at the north side within cape conway for just within that cape there lie two or three small islands which alone would shelter that side of the bay from the southerly and south easterly winds that seem to prevail here as a trade among the many islands that lie upon this coast there is one more remarkable than the rest it is of a small circuit very high and peaked and lies e by s ten miles from cape conway at the south end of the passage in the afternoon we steered through this passage which we found to be from three to seven miles broad and eight or nine leagues in length n by w w s by e e it is formed by the main on the west and by the islands on the east one of which is at least five leagues in length our depth of water in running through was from twenty to five and twenty fathom with good anchorage every where and the whole passage may be considered as one safe harbor exclusive of the small bays and coves which abound on each side where ships might lie as in a basin    0 june sunday   the land both upon the main and islands is high and diversified by hill and valley wood and lawn with a green and pleasant appearance on one of the islands we discovered with our glasses two men and a woman and a canoe with an outrigger which appeared to be larger and of a construction very different from those of bark tied together at the ends which we had seen upon other parts of the coast we hoped therefore that the people here had made some farther advances beyond mere animal life than those that we had seen before at six oclock in the evening we were nearly the length of the north end of the passage the north westermost point of the main in sight bore n    w and the north end of the island n n e with an open sea between the two points as this passage was discovered on whitsunday i called it whitsundays passage and i called the islands that form it cumberland islands in honor of his royal highness the duke we kept under an easy sail with the lead going all night being at the distance of about three leagues from the shore and having from twentyone to twentythree fathom water ar daybreak monday   we were abreast of the point which had been the farthest in sight to the north west the evening before which i named cape gloucester it is a lofty promontory in latitude       s longitude        w and may be known by an island which lies out at sea n by w w at the distance of five or six leagues from it and which i called holborne isle there are also islands lying under the land between holborne isle and whitsundays passage on the west side of cape gloucester the land trends away s w and s s w and forms a deep bay the bottom of which i could but just see from the masthead it is very low and a continuation of the low land which we had seen at the bottom of repulse bay this bay i called edgcumbe bay but without staying to look into it    0 june monday   we continued our course to the westward for the farthest land we could see in that direction which bore w by n n and appeared very high at noon we were about three leagues from the shore by observation in latitude       s and cape gloucester bore s    e distant seven leagues and an half at six in the evening we were abreast of the westermost point just mentioned at about three miles distance and because it rises abruptly from the low lands which surround it i called it cape upstart it lies in latitude       s longitude        w fourteen leagues w n w from cape gloucester and is of a height sufficient to be seen at the distance of twelve leagues inland there are some high hills or mountains which like the cape afford but a barren prospect having passed this cape we continued standing to the w n w as the land lay under an easy sail having from sixteen to ten fathom tuesday   till two oclock in the morning when we fell into seven fathom upon which we hauled our wind to the northward judging ourselves to be very near land at daybreak we found our conjecture to be true being within little more than two leagues of it in this part of the coast the land being very low is nearer than it appears to be though it is diversified with here and there a hill at noon we were about four leagues from the land in fifteen fathom water and our latitude by observation was       s cape upstart bearing s     0 e distant twelve leagues about this time some very large columns of smoke were seen rising from the low lands at sunset the preceding night when we were close under cape upstart the variation was nearly   e and at sunrise this day it was no more than      i judged therefore that it had been influenced by iron ore or other magnetical matter contained under the surface of the earth  we continued to steer w n w as the land lay    0 june wednes   with twelve or fourteen fathom water till noon on the  th when our latitude by observation was if      s and we had the mouth of a bay all open extending from s e to s w s distant two leagues this bay which i named cleaveland bay appeared to be about five or six miles in extent every way the east point i named cape cleaveland and the west which had the appearance of an island magnetical isle as we perceived that the compass did not traverse well when we were near it they are both high and so is the main land within them the whole forming a surface the most rugged rocky and barren of any we had seen upon the coast it was not however without inhabitants for we saw smoke in several parts of the bottom of the bay the northermost land that was in fight at this time bore n w and it had the appearance of an island for we could not trace the main land farther than w by n we steered w n w keeping the main land on board the outermost part of which at sunset bore w by n but without it lay high land which we judged not to be part of it thursday   at daybreak we were abreast of the eastern part of this land which we found to be a group of islands lying about five leagues from the main at this time being between the two shores we advanced slowly to the n w till noon when our latitude by observation was       s and our distance from the main about five leagues the north west part of it bore from us n by w w the islands extending from n to e and the nearest being distant about two miles cape cleaveland bore s  0 e distant eighteen leagues our soundings in the course that we had sailed between this time and the preceding noon were from fourteen to eleven fathom  in the afternoon we saw several large columns of smoke upon the main we saw also some people and canoes and upon one of the islands what had the appearance of cocoa nuttrees    0 june thursday   as a few of these nuts would now have been very acceptable i sent lieutenant hicks ashore and with him went mr banks and dr solander to see what refreshment could be procured while i kept standing in for the island with the ship about seven oclock in the evening they returned with an account that what we had taken for cocoa nuttrees were a small kind of cabbage palm and that except about fourteen or fifteen plants they had met with nothing worth bringing away while they were ashore they saw none of the people but just as they had put off one of them came very near the beach and shouted with a loud voice it was so dark that they could not see him however they turned toward the shore but when he heard the boat putting back he ran away or hid himself for they could not get a glimpse of him and though they shouted he made no reply after the return of the boats we stood away n by w for the northermost land in fight of which we were abreast at three oclock in the morning friday   having passed all the islands three or four hours before this land on account of its figure i named point hillock it is of a considerable height and may be known by a round hillock or rock which joins to the point but appears to be detached from it between this cape and magnetical isle the shore forms a large bay which i called halifax bay before it lay the group of islands which has been just mentioned and some others at a less distance from the shore by these islands the bay is sheltered from all winds and it affords good anchorage the land near the beach in the bottom of the bay is low and woody but farther back it is one continued ridge of high land which appeared to be barren and rocky having passed point hillock we continued standing to the n n w as the land trended having the advantage of a light moon at six    0 june friday   we were abreast of a point of land which lies n by w w distant eleven miles from point hillock which i named cape sandwich between these two points the land is very high and the surface is craggy and barren cape sandwich may be known not only by the high craggy land over it but by a small island which lies east of it at the distance of a mile and some others that lie about two leagues to the northward from cape sandwich the land trends w and afterward n forming a fine large bay which i called rockingham bay where there appears to be good shelter and good anchorage but i did not stay to examine it i kept ranging along the shore to the northward for a cluster of small islands which lie off the northern point of the bay between the three outermost of these islands and those near the shore i found a channel of about a mile broad through which i passed and upon one of the nearest islands we saw with our glasses about thirty of the natives men women and children all standing together and looking with great attention at the ship the first instance of curiosity that we had seen among them they were all stark naked with short hair and of the same complexion with those that we had seen before at noon our latitude by observation was       and we were abreast of the north point of rockingham bay which bore from us w at the distance of about two miles this boundary of the bay is formed by an island of considerable height which in the chart is distinguished by the name of dunk isle and which lies so near the shore as not to be easily distinguished from it our longitude was        w cape sandwich bore s by e e distant nineteen miles and the northermost land in sight n w our depth of water for the last ten hours had not been more than sixteen nor less than seven fathom at sunset the northern extremity of the land bore n    w and we kept our course n by w along the coast    0 june friday   at the distance of between three and four leagues with an easy sail all night having from twelve to fifteen fathom water  saturday   at six oclock in the morning we were abreast of some small islands which we called franklands isles and which lie about two leagues distant from the main land the most distant point in sight to the northward bore n by w w and we thought it was part of the main but afterward found it to be an island of considerable height and about four miles in circuit between this island and a point on the main from which it is distant about two miles i passed with the ship at noon we were in the middle of the channel and by observation in the latitude of       s with twenty fathom water the point on the main of which we were now abreast i called cape grafton its latitude is       s and longitude       w and the land here as well as the whole coast for about twenty leagues to the southward is high has a rocky surface and is thinly covered with wood during the night we had seen several sires and about noon some people having hauled round cape grafton we found the land trend away n w by w and three miles to the westward of the cape we found a bay in which we anchored about two miles from the shore in four fathom water with an ouzey bottom the east point of the bay bore s    e the west point s    w and a low green woody island which lies in the offing n    e this island which lies n by e e distant three or four leagues from cape grafton is called in the chart green island  as soon as the ship was brought to an anchor i went ashore accompanied by mr banks and dr solander as my principal view was to procure some fresh water and as the bottom of the bay was low land covered with mangroves where it was not probable fresh water was to be found    0 june saturday   i went out toward the cape and found two small streams which however were rendered very difficult of access by the surf and rocks upon the shore i saw also as i came round the cape a small stream of water run over the beach in a sandy cove but i did not go in with the boat because i saw that it would not be easy to land when we got ashore we found the country every where rising into steep rocky hills and as no fresh water could conveniently be procured i was unwilling to lose time by going in search of lower land elsewhere we therefore made the best of our way back to the ship and about midnight we weighed and stood to the n w having but little wind with some showers of rain sunday  0 at four in the morning the breeze freshened at s by e and the weather became fair we continued steering n n w w as the land lay at about three leagues distance with ten twelve and fourteen fathom water at ten we hauled off north in order to get without a small low island which lay at about two leagues distance from the main and great part of which at this time it being high water was overflowed about three leagues to the north west of this island close under the main land is another island the land of which rises to a greater height and which at noon bore from us n    w distant seven or eight miles at this time our latitude was     0 s cape grafton bore s    e distant forty miles and the northermost point of land in sight n  0 w our depth of water was fifteen fathom between this point and cape grafton the shore forms a large but not a very deep bay which being discovered on trinity sunday i called trinity bay  chap v dangerous situation of the ship in her course from trinity bay to endeavor river    0 june sunday  0 hitherto we had safely navigated this dangerous coast where the sea in all parts conceals shoals that suddenly project from the shore and rocks that rise abruptly like a pyramid from the bottom for an extent of two and twenty degrees of latitude more than one thousand three hundred miles and therefore hitherto none of the names which distinguish the several parts of the country that we saw are memorials of distress but here we became acquainted with misfortune and we therefore called the point which we had just seen farthest to the northward cape tribulation  this cape lies in latitude      s and longitude        w we steered along the shore n by w at the distance of between three and four leagues having from fourteen to twelve and ten fathom water in the offing we saw two islands which lie in latitude    s and about six or seven leagues from the main at six in the evening the northermost land in sight bore n by w w and two low woody islands which some of us took to be rocks above water bore n w at this time we shortened sail and hauled off shore e n e and n e by e close upon a wind for it was my design to stretch off all night as well to avoid the danger we saw ahead as to see whether any islands lay in the offing especially as we were now near the latitude assigned to the islands which were discovered by quiros    0 june sunday  0 and which some geographers for what reason i know not have thought fit to join to this land we had the advantage of a fine breeze and a clear moonlight night and in standing off from six till near nine oclock we deepened our water from fourteen to twentyone fathom but while we were at supper it suddenly shoaled and we fell into twelve ten and eight fathom within the space of a few minutes i immediately ordered every body to their station and all was ready to put about and come to an anchor but meeting at the next cast of the lead with deep water again we concluded that we had gone over the tail of the shoals which we had seen at sunset and that all danger was past before ten we had twenty and one and twenty fathom and this depth continuing the gentlemen left the deck in great tranquillity and went to bed but a few minutes before eleven the water shallowed at once from twenty to seventeen fathom and before the lead could be cast again the ship struck and remained immovable except by the heaving of the surge that beat her against the craggs of the rock upon which she lay in a few moments every body was upon the deck with countenances which sufficiently expressed the horrors of our situation we had stood off the shore three hours and a half with a pleasant breeze and therefore knew that we could not be very near it and we had too much reason to conclude that we were upon a rock of coral which is more fatal than any other because the points of it are sharp and every part of the surface so rough as to grind away whatever is rubbed against it even with the gentlest motion in this situation all the sails were immediately taken in and the boats hoisted out to examine the depth of water round the ship we soon discovered that our fears had not aggravated our misfortune and that the vessel had been lifted over a ledge of the rock    0 june sunday  0 and lay in a hollow within it in some places there was from three to four fathom and in others not so many feet the ship lay with her head to the n e and at the distance of about thirty yards on the starboard side the water deepened to eight ten and twelve fathom as soon as the longboat was out we struck our yards and topmasts and carried out the stream anchor on the starboard bow got the coasting anchor and cable into the boat and were going to carry it out the same way but upon sounding a second time round the ship the water was found to be deepest astern the anchor therefore was carried out from the starboard quarter instead of the starboard bow that is from the stern instead of the head and having taken ground our utmost force was applied to the capstern hoping that if the anchor did not come home the ship would be got off but to our great misfortune and disappointment we could not move her during all this time she continued to beat with great violence against the rock so that it was with the utmost difficulty that we kept upon our legs and to complete the scene of distress we saw by the light of the moon the sheathing boards from the bottom of the vessel floating away all round her and at last her false keel so that every moment was making way for the sea to rush in which was to swallow us up we had now no chance but to lighten her and we had lost the opportunity of doing that to the greatest advantage for unhappily we went on shore just at high water and by this time it had considerably fallen so that after she should be lightened so as to draw as much less water as the water had sunk we should be but in the same situation as at first and the only alleviation of this circumstance was that as the tide ebbed the ship settled to the rocks and was not beaten against them with so much violence we had indeed some hope from the next tide    0 june sunday  0 but it was doubtful whether she would hold together so long especially as the rock kept grating her bottom under the starboard bow with such force as to be heard in the fore storeroom this however was no time to indulge conjecture nor was any effort remitted in despair of success that no time might be lost the water was immediately started in the hold and pumped up six of our guns being all we had upon the deck our iron and stone ballast casks hoop staves oil jars decayed stores and many other things that lay in the way of heavier materials were thrown overboard with the utmost expedition every one exerting himself with an alacrity almost approaching to cheerfulness without the least repining or discontent yet the men were so far impressed with a sense of their situation that not an oath was heard among them the habit of profaneness however strong being instantly subdued by the dread of incurring guilt when death seemed to be so near  while we were thus employed day broke upon us monday    and we saw the land at about eight leagues distance without any island in the intermediate space upon which if the ship should have gone to pieces we might have been set ashore by the boats and from which they might have taken us by different turns to the main the wind however gradually died away and early in the forenoon it was a dead calm if it had blown hard the ship must inevitably have been destroyed at eleven in the forenoon we expected high water and anchors were got out and every thing made ready for another effort to heave her off if she should float but to our inexpressible surprise and concern she did not float by a foot and a half though we had lightened her near fifty ton so much did the daytide fall short of that in the night we now proceeded to lighten her still more and threw overboard every thing that it was possible for us to spare    0 june monday    hitherto she had not admitted much water but as the tide fell it rushed in so fast that two pumps incessantly worked could scarcely keep her free at two oclock she lay heeling two or three streaks to starboard and the pinnace which lay under her bows touched the ground we had now no hope but from the tide at midnight and to prepare for it we carried out our two bower anchors one on the starboard quarter and the other right astern got the blocks and tackle which were to give us a purchase upon the cables in order and brought the falls or ends of them in abaft straining them tight that the next effort might operate upon the ship and by shortening the length of the cable between that and the anchors draw her off the ledge upon which she rested toward the deep water about five oclock in the afternoon we observed the tide begin to rise but we observed at the same time that the leak increased to a most alarming degree so that two more pumps were manned but unhappily only one of them would work three of the pumps however were kept going and at nine oclock the ship righted but the leak had gained upon us so considerably that it was imagined she must go to the bottom as soon as she ceased to be supported by the rock this was a dreadful circumstance so that we anticipated the floating of the ship not as an earnest of deliverance but as an event that would probably precipitate our destruction we well knew that our boats were not capable of carrying us all on shore and that when the dreadful crisis should arrive as all command and subordination would be at an end a contest for preference would probably ensue that would increase the horrors even of shipwreck and terminate in the destruction of us all by the hands of each other yet we knew that if any should be left on board to perish in the waves they would probably suffer less upon the whole than those who should get on shore    0 june monday    without any lasting or effectual defense against the natives in a country where even nets and firearms would scarcely furnish them with food and where if they should find the means of subsistence they must be condemned to languish out the remainder of life in a desolate wilderness without the possession or even hope of any domestic comfort and cut off from all commerce with mankind except the naked savages who prowled the desert and who perhaps were some of the most rude and uncivilized upon the earth  to those only who have waited in a state of such suspense death has approached in all his terrors and as the dreadful moment that was to determine our fate came on every one saw his own sensations pictured in the countenances of his companions however the capstan and windlace were manned with as many hands as could be spared from the pumps and the ship floating about twenty minutes after ten oclock the effort was made and she was heaved into deep water it was some comfort to find that she did not now admit more water than she had done upon the rock and though by the gaining of the leak upon the pumps there was no less than three feet nine inches water in the hold yet the men did not relinquish their labor and we held the water as it were at bay but having now endured excessive fatigue of body and agitation of mind for more than four and twenty hours and having but little hope of succeeding at last they began to flag none of them could work at the pump more than five or six minutes together and then being totally exhausted they threw themselves down upon the deck though a stream of water was running over it from the pumps between three and four inches deep when those who succeeded them had worked their spell and were exhausted in their turn they threw themselves down in the same manner and the others started up again    0 june monday    and renewed their labor thus relieving each other till an accident was very near putting an end to their efforts at once the planking which lines the inside of the ships bottom is called the cieling and between this and the outside planking there is a space of about eighteen inches the man who till this time had attended the well to take the depth of water had taken it only to the cieling and gave the measure accordingly but he being now relieved the person who came in his stead reckoned the depth to the outside planking by which it appeared in a few minutes to have gained upon the pumps eighteen inches the difference between the planking without and within upon this even the bravest was upon the point of giving up his labor with his hope and in a few minutes every thing would have been involved in all the confusion of despair but this accident however dreadful in its first consequences was eventually the cause of our preservation the mistake was soon detected and the sudden joy which every man felt upon finding his situation better than his fears had suggested operated like a charm and seemed to possess him with a strong belief that scarcely any real danger remained new confidence and new hope however founded inspired new vigor and though our state was the same as when the men first began to slacken in their labor through weariness and despondency they now renewed their efforts with such alacrity and spirit that before eight oclock in the morning the leak was so far from having gained upon the pumps that the pumps had gained considerably upon the leak every body now talked of getting the ship into some harbor as a thing not to be doubted and as hands could be spared from the pumps they were employed in getting up the anchors the stream anchor and best bower we had taken on board but it was found impossible to save the little bower and therefore it was cut away at a whole cable    0 june monday    we lost also the cable of the stream anchor among the rocks but in our situation these were trifles which scarcely attracted our notice our next business was to get up the foretopmast and foreyard and warp the ship to the southeast and at eleven having now a breeze from the sea we once more got under sail and stood for the land  it was however impossible long to continue the labor by which the pumps had been made to gain upon the leak and as the exact situation of it could not be discovered we had no hope of stopping it within in this situation mr monkhouse tuesday    one of my midshipmen came to me and proposed an expedient that he had once seen used on board a merchant ship which sprung a leak that admitted above four feet water an hour and which by this expedient was brought safely from virginia to london the master having such confidence in it that he took her out of harbor knowing her condition and did not think it worth while to wait till the leak could be otherwise stopped to this man therefore the care of the expedient which is called fothering the ship was immediately committed four or five of the people being appointed to assist him and he performed it in this manner he took a lower studding sail and having mixed together a large quantity of oakham and wool chopped pretty small he stitched it down in handfuls upon the sail as lightly as possible and over this he spread the dung of our sheep and other filth but horse dung if we had had it would have been better when the sail was thus prepared it was hauled under the ships bottom by ropes which kept it extended and when it came under the leak the suction which carried in the water carried in with it the oakham and wool from the surface of the sail which in other parts the water was not sufficiently agitated to wash off    0 june tuesday    by the success of this expedient our leak was so far reduced that instead of gaining upon three pumps it was easily kept under with one this was a new source of confidence and comfort the people could scarcely have expressed more joy if they had been already in port and their views were so far from being limited to running the ship ashore in some harbor either of an island or the main and building a vessel out of her materials to carry us to the east indies which had so lately been the utmost object of our hope that nothing was now thought of but ranging along the shore in search of a convenient place to repair the damage she had sustained and then prosecuting the voyage upon the same plan as if nothing had happened upon this occasion i must observe both in justice and gratitude to the ships company and the gentlemen on board that although in the midst of our distress every one seemed to have a just sense of his danger yet no passionate exclamations or frantic gestures were to be heard or seen every one appeared to have the perfect possession of his mind and every one exerted himself to the uttermost with a quiet and patient perseverance equally distant from the tumultuous violence of terror and the gloomy inactivity of despair  in the mean time having light airs at ese we got up the maintopmast and mainyard and kept edging in for the land till about six oclock in the evening when we came to an anchor in seventeen fathom water at the distance of seven leagues from the shore and one from the ledge of rocks upon which we had struck  this ledge or shoal lies in latitude       s and between six and seven leagues from the main it is not however the only shoal on this part of the coast especially to the northward and at this time we saw one to the southward    0 june tuesday    the tail of which we passed over when we had uneven soundings about two hours before we struck a part of this shoal is always above water and has the appearance of white sand a part also of that upon which we had lain is dry at low water and in that place consists of sand stones but all the rest of it is a coral rock  while we lay at anchor for the night we found that the ship made about fifteen inches water an hour from which no immediate danger was to be apprehended and at six oclock in the morning wednes    we weighed and stood to the n w still edging in for the land with a gentle breeze at s s e at nine we passed close without two small islands that lie in latitude       s and about four leagues from the main to reach these islands had in the height of our distress been the object of our hope or perhaps rather of our wishes and therefore i called them hope islands at noon we were about three leagues from the land and in latitude       s the northermost part of the main in sight bore n  0 w and hope islands extended from s  0 e to s  0 e in this situation we had twelve fathom water and several sandbanks without us at this time the leak had not increased but that we might be prepared for all events we got the sail ready for another fothering in the afternoon having a gentle breeze at s e by e i sent out the master with two boats as well to sound ahead of the ship as to look out for a harbor where we might repair our defects and put the ship in a proper trim at three oclock we saw an opening that had the appearance of an harbor and stood off and on while the boats examined it but they soon found that there was not depth of water in it sufficient for the ship when it was near sunset there being many shoals about us we anchored in four fathom    0 june wednes    at the distance of about two miles from the shore the land extending from n e to s by e e the pinnace was still out with one of the mates but at nine oclock she returned and reported that about two leagues to leeward she had discovered just such a harbor as we wanted in which there was a sufficient rise of water and every other convenience that could be desired either for laying the ship ashore or heaving her down  in consequence of this information i weighed at six oclock in the morning thursday    and having sent two boats ahead to lie upon the shoals that we saw in our way we ran down to the place but notwithstanding our precaution we were once in three fathom water as soon as these shoals were passed i sent the boats to lie in the channel that led to the harbor and by this time it began to blow it was happy far us that a place of refuge was at hand for we soon found that the ship would not work having twice missed stays our situation however though it might have been much worse was not without danger we were entangled among shoals and i had great reason to fear being driven to leeward before the boats could place themselves so as to prescribe our course i therefore anchored in four fathom about a mile from the shore and then made the signal for the boats to come on board when this was done i went myself and buoyed the channel which i found very narrow the harbor also i found smaller than i expected but most excellently adapted to our purpose and it is remarkable that in the whole course of our voyage we had seen no place which in our present circumstances could have afforded us the same relief at noon our latitude was       s during all the rest of this day and the whole night it blew too fresh for us to venture from our anchor and run into the harbor and for our farther security we got down the topgallant yards    0 june thursday    unbent the mainsail and some of the small sails got down the foretopgallant mast and the gibb boom and spritsail with a view to lighten the ship forwards as much as possible in order to come at her leak which we supposed to be somewhere in that part for in all the joy of our unexpected deliverance we had not forgot that at this time there was nothing but a lock of wool between us and destruction the gale continuing we kept our station all the   th friday    on the   th it was somewhat more moderate saturday  0 and about six oclock in the morning we hove the cable short with a design to get under sail but were obliged to desist and veer it out again it is remarkable that the sea breeze which blew fresh when we anchored continued to do so almost every day while we stayed here it was calm only while we were upon the rock except once and even the gale that afterward wafted us to the shore would then certainly have beaten us to pieces in the evening of the preceding day we had observed a fire near the beach over against us and as it would be necessary for us to stay sometime in this place we were not without hope of making an acquaintance with the people we saw more fires upon the hills today and with our glasses discovered four indians going along the shore who stopped and made two fires but for what purpose it was impossible we should guess  the scurvy now began to make its appearance among us with many formidable symptoms our poor indian tupia who had some time before complained that his gums were sore and swelled and who had taken plentifully of our lemon juice by the surgeons direction had now livid spots upon his legs and other indubitable testimonies that the disease had made a rapid progress notwithstanding all our remedies among which the bark had been liberally administered mr green    0 june saturday    our astronomer was also declining and these among other circumstances imbittered the delay which prevented our going ashore  sunday    in the morning of the   th though the wind was still fresh we ventured to weigh and push in for the harbor but in doing this we twice run the ship aground the first time she went off without any trouble but the second time she stuck fast we now got down the fore yard fore topmasts and booms and taking them overboard made a raft of them alongside of the ship the tide was happily rising and about one oclock in the afternoon she floated we soon warped her into the harbor and having moored her alongside of a steep beach to the south we got the anchors cables and all the hawsers on shore before night    chap vi transactions while the ship was refitting in endeavor river a description of the adjacent country its inhabitants and productions in the morning of monday the   th    0 june monday    a stage was made from the ship to the shore which was so bold that she floated at twenty feet distance two tents were also set up one for the sick and the other for stores and provisions which were landed in the course of the day we also landed all the empty water casks and part of the stores as soon as the tent for the sick was got ready for their reception they were sent ashore to the number of eight or nine and the boat was dispatchd to haul the seine in hopes of procuring some fish for the refreshment but she returned without success in the mean time i climbed one of the highest hills among those that overlooked the harbor which afforded by no means a comfortable prospect the low land near the river is wholly overrun with mangroves among which the salt water slows every tide and the high land appeared to be every where stoney and barren in the mean time mr banks had also taken a walk up the country and met with the frames of several old indian houses and places where they had dressed shellfish but they seemed not to have been frequented for some months tupia who had employed himself in angling and lived entirely upon what he caught recovered in a surprising degree but mr green still continued to be extremely ill     0 june tuesday    the next morning i got the four remaining guns out of the hold and mounted them upon the quarter deck i also got a spare anchor and anchorstock ashore and the remaining part of the stores and ballast that were in the hold set up the smiths forge and employed the armourer and his mate to make nails and other necessaries for the repair of the ship in the afternoon all the officers stores and the ground tier of water were got out so that nothing remained in the fore and main hold but the coals and a small quantity of stone ballast this day mr banks crossed the river to take a view of the country on the other side he found it consist principally of sandhills where he saw some indian houses which appeared to have been very lately inhabited in his walk he met with vast flocks of pigeons and crows of the pigeons which were exceedingly beautiful he shot several but the crows which were exactly like those in england were so shy that he could not get within reach of them  wednes  0 on the  0th we landed the powder and got out the stone ballast and wood which brought the ships draught of water to eight feet ten inches forward and thirteen feet abaft and this i thought with the difference that would be made by trimming the coals aft would be sufficient for i found that the water rose and fell perpendicularly eight feet at the springtides but as soon as the coals were trimmed from over the leak we could hear the water rush in a little abaft the foremast about three feet from the keel this determined me to clear the hold entirely this evening mr banks observed that in many parts of the inlet there were large quantities of pumice stones which lay at a considerable distance above high water mark whither they might have been carried either by the freshes or extraordinary high tides for there could be no doubt but that they came from the sea  the next morning we went early to work    0 june thursday    and by four oclock in the afternoon had got out all the coals cast the moorings loose and warped the ship a little higher up the harbor to a place which i thought most convenient for laying her ashore in order to stop the leak her draught of water forward was now seven feet nine inches and abaft thirteen feet six inches at eight oclock it being high water i hauled her bow close ashore but kept her stern afloat because i was afraid of neiping her it was however necessary to lay the whole of her as near the ground as possible  at two oclock in the morning of the   d the tide left her friday    and gave us an opportunity to examine the leak which we found to be at her floor heads a little before the starboard forechains in this place the rocks had made their way through four planks and even into the timbers three more planks were much damaged and the appearance of these breaches was very extraordinary there was not a splinter to be seen but all was as smooth as if the whole had been cut away by an instrument the timbers in this place were happily very close and if they had not it would have been absolutely impossible to have saved the ship but after all her preservation depended upon a circumstance still more remarkable in one of the holes which was big enough to have sunk us if we had had eight pumps instead of four and been able to keep them incessantly going was in great measure plugged up by a fragment of the rock which after having made the wound was left sticking in it so that the water which at first bad gained upon our pumps was what came in at the interstices between the stone and the edges of the hole that received it we found also several pieces of the fothering which had made their way between the timbers    0 june friday    and in a great measure stopped those parts of the leak which the stone had left open upon further examination we found that besides the leak considerable damage had been done to the bottom great part of the sheathing was gone from under the larboard bow a considerable part of the false keel was also wanting and these indeed we had seen swim away in fragments from the vessel while she lay beating against the rock the remainder of it was in so shattered a condition that it had better have been gone and the fore foot and main keel were also damaged but not so as to produce any immediate danger what damage she might have received abaft could not yet be exactly known but we had reason to think it was not much as but little water made its way into her bottom while the tide kept below the leak which has already been described by nine oclock in the morning the carpenters got to work upon her while the smiths were busy in making bolts and nails in the mean time some of the people were sent on the other side of the water to shoot pigeons for the sick who at their return reported that they had seen an animal as large as a greyhound of a slender make a mouse color and extremely swift they discovered also many indian houses and a fine stream of fresh water  saturday    the next morning i sent a boat to haul the seine but at noon it returned with only three fish and yet we saw them in plenty leaping about the harbor this day the carpenter finished the repairs that were necessary on the starboard side and at nine oclock in the evening we heeled the ship the other way and hauled her off about two feet for fear of neiping this day almost every body had seen the animal which the pigeonshooters had brought an account of the day before and one of the seamen who had been rambling in the woods told us at his return that he verily believed he had seen the devil    0 june saturday    we naturally enquired in what form he had appeared and his answer was in so singular a style that i shall set down his own words he was says john as large as a one gallon keg and very like it he had horns and wings yet he crept so slowly through the grass that if i had not been afeard i might have touched him this formidable apparition we afterward discovered to have been a batt and the batts here must be acknowledged to have a frightful appearance for they are nearly black and full as large as a partridge they have indeed no horns but the fancy of a man who thought he saw the devil might easily supply that defect  early on the   th sunday    the carpenters began to repair the sheathing under the larboard bow where we found two planks cut about half through and in the mean time i sent a party of men under the direction of mr gore in search of refreshments for the sick this party returned about noon with a few palm cabbages and a bunch or two of wild plantains the plantains were the smallest i had ever seen and the pulp though it was well tasted was full of small stones as i was walking this morning at a little distance from the ship i saw myself one of the animals which had been so often described it was of a light mouse color and in size and shape very much resembling a greyhound it had a long tail also which it carried like a greyhound and i should have taken it for a wild dog if instead of running it had not leapt like a hare or deer its legs were said to be very slender and the print of its foot to be like that of a goat but where i saw it the grass was so high that the legs were concealed and the ground was too hard to receive the track mr banks also had an imperfect view of this animal and was of opinion that its species was hitherto unknown     0 june sunday    after the ship was hauled ashore all the water that came into her of course went backwards so that although she was dry forward she had nine feet water abaft as in this part therefore her bottom could not be examined on the inside i took the advantage of the tide being out this evening to get the master and two of the men to go under her and examine her whole larboard side without they found the sheathing gone about the floor heads abreast of the mainmast and part of a plank a little damaged but all agreed that she had received no other material injury the loss of her sheathing alone was a great misfortune as the worm would now be let into her bottom which might expose us to great inconvenience and danger but as i knew no remedy for the mischief but heaving her down which would be a work of immense labor and long time if practicable at ail in our present situation i was obliged to be content the carpenters however continued to work under her bottom in the evening till they were prevented by the tide the morning tide did not ebb out far enough to permit them to work at all for we had only one tolerable high and low tide in four and twenty hours as indeed we had experienced when we lay upon the rock the position of the ship which threw the water in her abaft was very near depriving the world of all the knowledge which mr banks had endured so much labor and so many risks to procure for he had removed the curious collection of plants which he made during the whole voyage into the bread room which lies in the after part of the ship as a place of the greatest security and nobody having thought of the danger to which laying her head so much higher than the stern would expose them they were this day found under water most of them however were by indefatigable care and attention restored to a state of preservation    0 june but some were entirely spoilt and destroyed  the   th was employed in filling water and overhauling the rigging monday    and at low water the carpenters finished the repairs under the larboard bow and every other place which the tide would permit them to come at some casks were then lashed under her bows to facilitate her floating and at night when it was high water we endeavored to heave her off but without success for some of the casks that were lashed to her gave way  the morning of the   th was employed in getting more casks ready for the same purpose tuesday    and in the afternoon we lashed no less than eight and thirty under the ships bottom but to our great mortification these also proved ineffectual and we found ourselves reduced to the necessity of waiting till the next springtide  this day some of our gentlemen who had made an excursion into the woods brought home the leaves of a plant which was thought to be the same that in the west indies is called coccos but upon trial the roots proved too acrid to be eaten the leaves however were little inferior to spinnage in the place where these plants were gathered grew plenty of the cabbage traces which have occasionally been mentioned before a kind of wild plantain the fruit of which was so full of stones as scarcely to be eatable another fruit was also found about the size of a small golden pippin but flatter and of a deep purple color when first gathered from the tree it was very hard and disagreeable but after being kept a few days became soft and tasted very much like an indifferent damascene  the next morning we began to move some of the weight from the afterpart of the ship forward to ease her wednes    in the mean time the armourer continued to work at the forge the carpenter was busy in caulking the ship    0 june wednes    and the men employed in filling water and overhauling the rigging in the forenoon i went myself in the pinnace up the harbor and made several hauls with the seine but caught only between twenty and thirty fish which were given to the sick and convalescent  thursday    on the   th mr banks went with some of the seamen up the country to show them the plant which in the west indies is called indian kalc and which served us for greens tupia had much meliorated the root of the coccos by giving them a long dressing in his country oven but they were so small that we did not think them an object for the ship in their walk they found one tree which had been notched for the convenience of climbing it in the same manner with those we had seen in botany bay they saw also many nests of white ants which resemble those of the east indies the most pernicious insects in the world the nests were of a pyramidical figure from a few inches to six feet high and very much resembled the stones in england which are said to be monuments of the druids mr gore who was also this day four or five miles up the country reported that he had seen the footsteps of men and tracked animals of three or four different sorts but had not been fortunate enough to see either man or beast  friday    at two oclock in the morning of the   th i observed in conjunction with mr green an emersion of jupiters first satellite the time here was         which gave the longitude of this place         0 w its latitude is       s at break of day i sent the boat out again with the seine and in the afternoon it returned with as much fish as enabled me to give every man a pound and an half one of my midshipmen an american who was this day abroad with his gun reported that he had seen a wolf exactly like those which he had been used to see in his own country    0 june and that he had shot at it but did not kill it  the next morning saturday  0 encouraged by the success of the day before i sent the boat again to haul the seine and another party to gather greens i sent also some of the young gentlemen to take a plan of the harbor and went myself upon a hill which lies over the south point to take a view of the sea at this time it was low water and i saw with great concern innumerable sand banks and shoals lying all along the coast in every direction the innermost lay about three or four miles from the shore the outermost extended as far as i could see with my glass and many of them did but just rise above water there was some appearance of a passage to the northward and i had no hope of getting clear but in that direction for as the wind blows constantly from the se it would have been difficult if not impossible to return back to the southward  mr gore reported that he had this day seen two animals like dogs of a straw color that they ran like a hare and were about the same size in the afternoon the people returned from hauling the seine with still better success than before for i was now able to distribute two pounds and an half to each man the greens that had been gathered i ordered to be boiled among the peace and they made an excellent mess which with two copious supplies of fish afforded us unspeakable refreshment  the next day july the  st being sunday july sunday   every body had liberty to go ashore except one from each mess who were again sent out with the seine the seine was again equally successful and the people who went up the country gave an account of having seen several animals though none of them were to be caught they saw a fire also about a mile up the river    0 july sunday   and mr gore the second lieutenant picked up the husk of a cocoa nut which had been cast upon the beach and was full of barnacles this probably might come from some island to windward perhaps from the terra del espirito santo of quiros as we were now in the latitude where it is said to lie this day the thermometer in the shade rose to    which was higher than it had been on any day since we came upon this coast  monday   early the next morning i sent the master in the pinnace out of the harbor to sound about the shoals in the offing and look for a channel to the northward at this time we had a breeze from the land which continued till about nine oclock and was the first we had had since our coming into the river at low water we lashed some empty casks under the ships bows having some hope that as the tides were rising she would float the next high water we still continued to fish with great success and at high water we again attempted to heave the ship off but our utmost efforts were still ineffectual  tuesday   the next day at noon the master returned and reported that he had found a passage out to sea between the shoals and described its situation the shoals he said consisted of coral rocks many of which were dry at low water and upon one of which he had been ashore he found here some cockles of so enormous a size that one of them was more than two men could eat and a great variety of other shellfish of which he brought us a plentiful supply in the evening he had also landed in a bay about three leagues to the northward of our station where he disturbed some of the natives who were at supper they all fled with the greatest precipitation at his approach leaving some fresh sea eggs and a fire ready kindled behind them but there was neither house nor hovel near the place we observed    0 july tuesday   that although the shoals that lie just within sight of the coast abound with shellfish which may be easily caught at low water yet we saw no such shells about the fire places on shore this day an allegator was seen to swim about the ship for some time and at high water we made another effort to float her which happily succeeded we found however that by lying so long with her head aground and her stern afloat she had sprung a plank between decks abreast of the main chains so that it was become necessary to lay her ashore again  the next morning was employed in trimming her upon an even keel and in the afternoon having warped her over wednes   and waited for high water we laid her ashore on the sand bank on the south side of the river for the damage she had received already from the great descent of the ground made me afraid to lay her broadside to the shore in the same place from which we had just floated her i was now very desirous to make another trial to come at her bottom where the sheathing had been rubbed off but though she had scarcely four feet water under her when the tide was out yet that part was not dry  on the  th i got one of the carpenters crew thursday   a man in whom i could confide to go down again to the ships bottom and examine the place he reported that three streaks of the sheathing about eight feet long were wanting and that the main plank had been a little rubbed this account perfectly agreed with the report of the master and others who had been under her bottom before i had the comfort however to find the carpenter of opinion that this would be of little consequence and therefore the other damage being repaired she was again floated at high water and moored alongside the beach where the stores had been deposited    0 july thursday   we then went to work to take the stores on board and put her in a condition for the sea this day mr banks crossed to the other side of the harbor where as he walked along a sandy beach he found innumerable fruits and many of them such as no plants which he had discovered in this country produced among others were some cocoa nuts which tupia said had been opened by a kind of crab which from his description we judged to be the same that the dutch call beurs krabbe and which we had not seen in these seas all the vegetable substances which he found in this place were encrusted with marine productions and covered with barnacles a sure sign that they must have come far by sea and as the tradewind blows right upon the shore probably from terra del espirito santo which has been mentioned already  friday   the next morning mr banks with lieutenant gore and three men set out in a small boat up the river with a view to spend two or three days in an excursion to examine the country and kill some of the animals which had been so often seen at a distance  saturday   on the  th i sent the master again out to sound about the shoals the account which he had brought me of a channel being by no means satisfactory and we spent the remainder of this day and the morning of the next in fishing and other necessary occupations  sunday   about four oclock in the afternoon mr banks and his party returned and gave us an account of their expedition having proceeded about three leagues among swamps and mangroves they went up into the country which they found to differ but little from what they had seen before they pursued their course therefore up the river which at length was contracted into a narrow channel and was bounded not by swamps and mangroves but by steep banks    0 july sunday   that were covered with trees of a most beautiful verdure among which was that which in the west indies is called mohoe or the bark tree the hibiscus tiliaceus the land within was in general low and had a thick covering of long grass the soil seemed to be such as promised great fertility to any who should plant and improve it in the course of the day tupia saw an animal which by his description mr banks judged to be a wolf they also saw three other animals but could neither catch nor kill one of them and a kind of bat as large as a partridge but this also eluded all their diligence and skill at night they took up their lodging close to the banks of the river and made a fire but the musquitos swarmed about them in such numbers that their quarters were almost untenable they followed them into the smoke and almost into the fire which hot as the climate was they could better endure than the stings of these insects which were an intolerable torment the fire the flies and the want of a better bed than the ground rendered the night extremely uncomfortable so that they passed it not in sleep but in restless wishes for the return of day with the first dawn they set out in search of game and in a walk of many miles they saw four animals of the same kind two of which mr bankss greyhound fairly chaced but they threw him out at a great distance by leaping over the long thick grass which prevented his running this animal was observed not to run upon four legs but to bound or hop forward upon two like the jerbua or mus jaculus about noon they returned to the boat and again proceeded up the river which was soon contracted into a fresh water brook where however the tide rose to a considerable height as evening approached it became low water and it was then so shallow that they were obliged to get out of the boat and drag her along till they could find a place in which they might    0 july sunday   with some hope of rest pass the night such a place at length offered and while they were getting the things out of the boat they observed a smoke at the distance of about a furlong as they did not doubt but that some of the natives with whom they had so long and earnestly desired to become personally acquainted were about the fire three of the party went immediately toward it hoping that so small a number would not put them to flight when they came up to the place however they found it deserted and therefore they conjectured that before they had discovered the indians the indians had discovered them they found the fire still burning in the hollow of an old tree that was become touchwood and several branches of trees newly broken down with which children appeared to have been playing they observed also many footsteps upon the sand below high water mark which were certain indications that the indians had been recently upon the spot several houses were found at a little distance and some ovens dug in the ground in the same manner as those of otaheite in which victuals appeared to have been dressed since the morning and scattered about them lay some shells of a kind of clamm and some fragments of roots the refuse of the meal after regretting their disappointment they repaired to their quarters which was a broad sand bank under the shelter of a bush their beds were plantain leaves which they spread upon the sand and which were as soft as a mattress their cloaks served them for bedclothes and some bunches of grass for pillows with these accommodations they hoped to pass a better night than the last especially as to their great comfort not a musquito was to be seen here then they lay down and such is the force of habit they resigned themselves to sleep without once reflecting upon the probability and danger of being found by the indians in that situation if this appears strange    0 july sunday   let us for a moment reflect that every danger and every calamity after a time becomes familiar and loses its effect upon the mind if it were possible that a man should first be made acquainted with his mortality or even with the inevitable debility and infirmities of old age when his understanding had arrived at its full strength and life was endeared by the enjoyments of youth and vigor and health with what an agony of terror and distress would the intelligence be received yet being gradually acquainted with these mournful truths by insensible degrees we scarce know when they lose all their force and we think no more of the approach of old age and death than these wanderers of an unknown desert did of a less obvious and certain evil the approach of the native savages at a time when they must have fallen an easy prey to their malice or their fears and it is remarkable that the greater part of those who have been condemned to suffer a violent death have slept the night immediately preceding their execution though there is perhaps no instance of a person accused of a capital crime having slept the first night of his confinement thus is the evil of life in some degree a remedy for itself and though every man at twenty deprecates fourscore almost every man is as tenacious of life at fourscore as at twenty and if he does not suffer under any painful disorder loses as little of the comforts that remain by reflecting that he is upon the brink of the grave where the earth already crumbles under his feet as he did of the pleasures of his better days when his dissolution though certain was supposed to be at a distance  our travelers having slept without once awaking till the morning examined the river and finding the tide savoured their return and the country promised nothing worthy of a farther search    0 july sunday   they reimbarked in their boat and made the best of their way to the ship  soon after the arrival of this party the master also returned having been seven leagues out to sea and he was now of opinion that there was no getting out where before he thought there had been a passage his expedition however was by no means without its advantage for having been a second time upon the rock where he had seen the large cockles he met with a great number of turtle three of which he caught that together weighed seven hundred and ninetyone pounds though he had no better instrument than a boat hook  monday   the next morning therefore i sent him out again with proper instruments for taking them and mr banks went with him but the success did not at all answer our expectations for by the unaccountable conduct of the officer not a single turtle was taken nor could he be persuaded to return mr banks however went ashore upon the reef where he saw several of the large cockles and having collected many shells and marine productions he returned at eleven oclock at night in his own small boat the master still continuing with the large one upon the rock in the afternoon seven or eight of the natives had appeared on the south side of the river and two of them came down to the sandy point opposite to the ship but upon seeing me put off in a boat to speak with them they all ran away with the greatest precipitation  as the master continued absent with the boat all night i was forced to send the second lieutenant for him early the next morning in the yawl tuesday  0 and soon after four of the natives appeared upon the sandy point on the north side of the river having with them a small wooden canoe with outriggers they seemed for some time to be busily employed in striking fish    0 july tuesday  0 some of our people were for going over to them in a boat but this i would by no means permit repeated experience having convinced me that it was more likely to prevent than procure an interview i was determined to try what could be done by a contrary method and accordingly let them alone without appearing to take the least notice of them this succeeded so well that at length two of them came in the canoe within a musket shot of the ship and there talked a great deal in a very loud tone we understood nothing that they said and therefore could answer their harangue only by shouting and making all the signs of invitation and kindness that we could devise during this conference they came insensibly nearer and nearer holding up their lances not in a threatening manner but as if to intimate that if we offered them any injury they had weapons to revenge it when they were almost alongside of us we threw them some cloth nails beads paper and other trifles which they received without the least appearance of satisfaction at last one of the people happened to throw them a small fish at this they expressed the greatest joy imaginable and intimating by signs that they would fetch their companions immediately paddled away toward the shore in the mean time some of our people and among them tupia landed on the opposite side of the river the canoe with all the four indians very soon returned to the ship and came quite alongside without expressing any fear or distrust we distributed some more presents among them and soon after they left us and landed on the same side of the river where our people had gone ashore every man carried in his hand two lances and a stick which is used in throwing them and advanced to the place where tupia and the rest of our people were sitting    0 july tuesday  0 tupia soon prevailed upon them to lay down their arms and come forward without them he then made signs that they should sit down by him with which they complied and seemed to be under no apprehension or constraint several more of us then going ashore they expressed some jealousy lest we should get between them and their arms we took care however to show them that we had no such intention and having joined them we made them some more presents as a farther testimony of our good will and our desire to obtain theirs we continued together with the utmost cordiality till dinner time and then giving them to understand that we were going to eat we invited them by signs to go with us this however they declined and as soon as we left them they went away in their canoe one of these men was somewhat above the middle age the other three were young they were in general of the common stature but their limbs were remarkably small their skin was of the color of wood soot or what would be called a dark chocolate color their hair was black but not woolly it was short cropped in some lank and in others curled dampier says that the people whom he saw on the western coast of this country wanted two of their foreteeth but these had no such defect some part of their bodies had been painted red and the upper lip and breast of one of them was painted with streaks of white which he called carbanda their features were far from disagreeable their eyes were lively and their teeth even and white their voices were soft and tuneable and they repeated many words after us with great facility in the night mr gore and the master returned with the longboat and brought one turtle and a few shellfish the yawl had been left upon the shoal with six men to make a farther trial for turtle  the next morning    0 july wednes    we had another visit from four of the natives three of them had been with us before but the fourth was a stranger whose name as we learnt from his companions who introduced him was yaparico this gentleman was distinguished by an ornament of a very striking appearance it was the bone of a bird nearly as thick as a mans finger and five or six inches long which he had thrust into a hole made in the gristle that divides the nostrils of this we had seen one instance and only one in new zealand but upon examination we found that among all these people this part of the nose was perforated to receive an ornament of the same kind they had also holes in their ears though nothing was then hanging to them and had bracelets upon the upper part of their arms made of plaited hair so that like the inhabitants of terra del fuego they seem to be fond of ornament though they are absolutely without apparel and one of them to whom i had given part of an old shirt instead of throwing it over any part of his body tied it as a fillet round his head they brought with them a fish which they gave us as we supposed in return for the fish that we had given them the day before they seemed to be much pleased and in no haste to leave us but seeing some of our gentlemen examine their canoe with great curiosity and attention they were alarmed and jumping immediately into it paddled away without speaking a word  about two the next morning the yawl thursday    which had been left upon the shoal returned with three turtles and a large skeat as it seemed now probable that this fishery might be prosecuted with advantage i sent her out again after breakfast for a further supply soon after three indians ventured down to tupias tent and were so well pleased with their reception that one of them went with the canoe to fetch two others whom we had never seen    0 july thursday    when he returned he introduced the strangers by name a ceremony which upon such occasions was never omitted as they had received the fish that was thrown into their canoe when they first approached the ship with so much pleasure some fish was offered to them now and we were greatly surprised to see that it was received with the greatest indifference they made signs however to some of the people that they should dress it for them which was immediately done but after eating a little of it they threw the rest to mr bankss dog they staid with us all the forenoon but would never venture above twenty yards from their canoe we now perceived that the color of their skin was not so dark as it appeared what we had taken for their complexion being the effects of dirt and smoke in which we imagined they contrived to sleep notwithstanding the heat of the climate as the only means in their power to keep off the musquitos among other things that we had given them when we first saw them were some medals which we had hung round their necks by a riband and these ribands were so changed by smoke that we could not easily distinguish of what color they had been this incident led us more narrowly to examine the color of their skin while these people were with us we saw two others on the point of land that lay on the opposite side of the river at the distance of about two hundred yards and by our glasses discovered them to be a woman and a boy the woman like the rest being stark naked we observed that all of them were remarkably cleanlimbed and exceedingly active and nimble one of these strangers had a necklace of shells very prettily made and a bracelet upon his arm formed of several strings so as to resemble what in england is called gymp both of them had a piece of bark tied over the forehead and were disfigured by the bone in the nose    0 july thursday    we thought their language more harsh than that of the islanders in the south sea and they were continually repeating the word chercau which we imagined to be a term expressing admiration by the manner in which it was uttered they also cried out when they saw any thing new cher tut tut tut tut which probably had a similar signification their canoe was not above ten feet long and very narrow but it was fitted with an outrigger much like those of the islands though in every respect very much inferior when it was in shallow water they set it on with poles and when in deep they worked it with paddles about four feet long it contained just four people so that the people who visited us today went away at two turns their lances were like those that we had seen in botany bay except that they had but a single point which in some of them was the sting of the ray and barbed with two or three sharp bones of the same fish it was indeed a most terrible weapon and the instrument which they used in throwing it seemed to be formed with more art than any we had seen before about twelve oclock next day friday    the yawl returned with another turtle and a large stingray and in the evening was sent out again  the next morning two of the indians came on board saturday    but after a short stay went along the shore and applied themselves with great diligence to the striking of fish mr gore who went out this day with his gun had the good fortune to kill one of the animals which had been so much the subject of our speculation an idea of it will best be conceived by the cut plate xx without which the most accurate verbal description would answer very little purpose as it has not similitude enough to any animal already known to admit of illustration by reference in form it is most like the gerbua    0 july saturday    which it also resembles in its motion as has been observed already but it greatly differs in size the gerbua not being larger than a common rat and this animal when full grown being as big as a sheep this individual was a young one much under its full growth weighing only thirtyeight pounds the head neck and shoulders are very small in proportion to the other parts of the body the tail is nearly as long as the body thick near the rump and tapering toward the end the forelegs of this individual were only eight inches long and the hindlegs two and twenty its progress is by successive leaps or hops of a great length in an erect posture the forelegs are kept bent close to the breast and seemed to be of use only for digging the skin is covered with a short fur of a dark mouse or gray color excepting the head and ears which bear a slight resemblance to those of a hare this animal is called by the natives kanguroo  sunday    the next day our kanguroo was dressed for dinner and proved most excellent meat we might now indeed be said to fare sumptuously every day for we had turtle in great plenty and we all agreed that they were much better than any we had tasted in england which we imputed to their being eaten fresh from the sea before their natural fat had been wasted or their juices changed by a diet and situation so different from what the sea affords them as garbage and a tub most of those that we caught here were of the kind called green turtle and weighed from two to three hundred weight and when these were killed they were always found to be full of turtle grass which our naturalists took to be a kind of conserva two of them were loggerheads the flesh of which was much less delicious and in their stomachs nothing was to be found but shells  in the morning of the   th    0 july monday    while the people were employed as usual in getting the ship ready for the sea i climbed one of the hills on the north side of the river from which i had an extensive view of the inland country and found it agreeably diversified by hills valleys and large plains which in many places were richly covered with wood this evening we observed an emersion of jupiters first satellite which gave           of longitude the observation which was made on the   th of june gave         0 the mean is          the longitude of this place west of greenwich  on the   th tuesday    i sent the master and one of the mates in the pinnace to look for a channel to the northward and i went myself with mr banks and dr solander into the woods on the other side of the water tupia who had been thither by himself reported that he had seen three indians who had given him some roots about as thick as a mans finger in shape not much unlike a rhadish and of a very agreeable taste this induced us to go over hoping that we should be able to improve our acquaintance with the natives in a very little time we discovered four of them in a canoe who as soon as they saw us came ashore and though they were all strangers walked up to us without any signs of suspicion or fear two of these had necklaces of shells which we could not persuade them to part with for any thing we could give them we presented them however with some beads and after a short stay they departed we attempted to follow them hoping that they would conduct us to some place where we should find more of them and have an opportunity of seeing their women but they made us understand by signs that they did not desire our company     0 july wednes    at eight oclock the next morning we were visited by several of the natives who were now become quite familiar one of them at our desire threw his lance which was about eight feet long it flew with a swiftness and steadiness that surprised us and though it was never more than four feet from the ground it entered deeply into a tree at fifty paces distance after this they ventured on board where i left them to all appearance much entertained and went again with mr banks to take a view of the country but chiefly to indulge an anxious curiosity by looking round us upon the sea of which our wishes almost persuaded us we had formed an idea more disadvantageous than the truth after having walked about seven or eight miles along the shore to the northward we ascended a very high hill and were soon convinced that the danger of our situation was at least equal to our apprehensions for in whatever direction we turned our eyes we saw rocks and shoals without number and no passage out to sea but through the winding channels between them which could not be navigated without the last degree of difficulty and danger we returned therefore to the ship not in better spirits than when we left it we found several natives still on board and we were told that the turtles of which we had then no less than twelve upon the deck had fixed their attention more than any thing else in the ship  thursday    on the   th in the morning we were visited by ten of the natives the greater part from the other side of the river where we saw six or seven more most of them women and like all the rest of the people we had seen in this country they were stark naked our guests brought with them a greater number of lances than they had ever done before and having laid them up in a tree they set a man and a boy to watch them the rest then came on board    0 july thursday    and we soon perceived that they had determined to get one of our turtle which was probably as great a dainty to them as to us they first asked us by signs to give them one and being refused they expressed both by looks and gestures great disappointment and anger at this time we happened to have no victuals dressed but i offered one of them some biscuit which he snatched and threw overboard with great disdain one of them renewed his request to mr banks and upon a refusal stamped with his foot and pushed him from him in a transport of resentment and indignation having applied by turns to almost every person who appeared to have any command in the ship without success they suddenly seized two of the turtles and dragged them toward the side of the ship where their canoe lay our people soon forced them out of their hands and replaced them with the rest they would not however relinquish their enterprise but made several other attempts of the same kind in all which being equally disappointed they suddenly leaped into their canoe in a rage and began to paddle toward the shore at the same time i went into the boat with mr banks and five or six of the ships crew and we got ashore before them where many more of our people were already engaged in various employments as soon as they landed they seized their arms and before we were aware of their design they snatched a brand from under a pitch kettle which was boiling and making a circuit to the windward of the few things we had on shore they set fire to the grass in their way with surprising quickness and dexterity the grass which was five or six feet high and as dry as stubble burnt with amazing fury and the fire made a rapid progress toward a tent of mr bankss which had been set up for tupia when he was sick taking in its course a sow and pigs one of which it scorched to death    0 july thursday    mr banks leaped into a boat and fetched some people from on board just time enough to save his tent by hauling it down upon the beach but the smiths forge at least such part of it as would burn was consumed while this was doing the indians went to a place at some distance where several of our people were washing and where our nets among which was the seine and a great quantity of linen were laid out to dry here they again set fire to the grass entirely disregarding both threats and entreaties we were therefore obliged to discharge a musket loaded with small shot at one of them which drew blood at the distance of about forty yards and this putting them to flight we extinguished the fire at this place before it had made much progress but where the grass had been first kindled it spread into the woods to a great distance as the indians were still in sight i fired a musket charged with ball abreast of them among the mangroves to convince them that they were not yet out of our reach upon hearing the ball they quickened their pace and we soon lost sight of them we thought they would now give us no more trouble but soon after we heard their voices in the woods and perceived that they came nearer and nearer i set out therefore with mr banks and three or four more to meet them when our parties came in sight of each other they halted except one old man who came forward to meet us at length he stopped and having uttered some words which we were very sorry we could not understand he went back to his companions and the whole body slowly retreated we found means however to seize some of their darts and continued to follow them about a mile we then sat down upon some rocks from which we could observe their motions and they also sat down at about an hundred yards distance after a short time the old man again advanced toward us    0 july thursday    carrying in his hand a lance without a point he stopped several times at different distances and spoke we answered by beckoning and making such signs of amity as we could devise upon which the messenger of peace as we supposed him to be turned and spoke aloud to his companions who then set up their lances against a tree and advanced toward us in a friendly manner when they came up we returned the darts or lances that we had taken from them and we perceived with great satisfaction that this rendered the reconciliation complete we found in this party four persons whom we had never seen before who as usual were introduced to us by name but the man who had been wounded in the attempt to burn our nets and linen was not among them we knew however that he could not be dangerously hurt by the distance at which the shot reached him we made all of them presents of such trinkets as we had about us and they walked back with us toward the ship as we went along they told us by signs that they would not set fire to the grass any more and we distributed among them some musket balls and endeavored to make them understand their use and effect when they came abreast of the ship they sat down but could not be prevailed upon to come on board we therefore left them and in about two hours they went away soon after which we perceived the woods on fire at about two miles distance if this accident had happened a very little while sooner the consequence might have been dreadful for our powder had been aboard but a few days and the store tent with many valuable things which it contained had not been removed many hours we had no idea of the fury with which grass would burn in this hot climate nor consequently of the difficulty of extinguishing it but we determined that if it should ever again be necessary for us to pitch our tents in such a situation    0 july thursday    our first measure should be to clear the ground round us  in the afternoon we got every thing on board the ship new birthed her and let her swing with the tide and at night the master returned with the discouraging account that there was no passage for the ship to the northward  friday  0 the next morning at low water i went and sounded and buoyed the bar the ship being now ready for the sea we saw no indians this day but all the hills round us for many miles were on fire which at night made a most striking and beautiful appearance  saturday    the   st passed without our getting sight of any of the inhabitants and indeed without a single incident worth notice sunday    on the   d we killed a turtle for the days provision upon opening which we found a wooden harpoon or turtlepeg about as thick as a mans finger near fifteen inches long and bearded at the end such as we had seen among the natives sticking through both shoulders it appeared to have been struck a considerable time for the wound had perfectly healed up over the weapon  monday    early in the morning of the   d i sent some people into the country to gather a supply of the greens which have been before mentioned by the name of indian kale and one of them having straggled from the rest suddenly fell in with four indians three men and a boy whom he did not see till by turning short in the wood he found himself among them they had kindled a fire and were broiling a bird of some kind and part of a kanguroo the remainder of which and a cockatoo hung at a little distance upon a tree the man being unarmed was at first greatly terrified but he had the presence of mind not to run away judging very rightly    0 july monday    that he was most likely to incur danger by appearing to apprehend it on the contrary he went and sat down by them and with an air of cheerfulness and good humor offered them his knife the only thing he had about him which he thought would be acceptable to them they received it and having handed it from one to the other they gave it him again he then made an offer to leave them but this they seemed not disposed to permit still however he dissembled his fears and sat down again they considered him with great attention and curiosity particularly his clothes and then felt his hands and face and satisfied themselves that his body was of the same texture with their own they treated him with the greatest civility and having kept him about half an hour they made signs that he might depart he did not wait for a second dismission but when he left them not taking the direct way to the ship they came from their fire and directed him so that they well knew whence he came  in the mean time mr banks having made an excursion on the other side of the river to gather plants found the greatest part of the cloth that had been given to the indians lying in a heap together probably as useless lumber not worth carrying away and perhaps if he had sought further he might have found the other trinkets for they seemed to set very little value upon any thing we had except our turtle which was a commodity that we were least able to spare  the blowing weather which prevented our attempt to get out to sea still continuing tuesday    mr banks and dr solander went again out on the   th to see whether any new plant could be picked up they traversed the woods all day without success but as they were returning through a deep valley the sides of which    0 july tuesday    though almost as perpendicular as a wall were covered with trees and bushes they found lying upon the ground several marking nuts the anacardium orientale these put them upon a new scent and they made a most diligent search after the tree that bore them which perhaps no european botanist ever saw but to their great mortification they could not find it so that after spending much time and cutting down four or five trees they returned quite exhausted with fatigue to the ship  wednes    on the   th having made an excursion up the river i found a canoe belonging to our friends the indians whom we had not seen since the affair of the turtle they had left it tied to some mangroves about a mile distant from the ship and i could see by their fires that they were retired at least six miles directly inland  thursday    as mr banks was again gleaning the country for his natural history on the   th he had the good fortune to take an animal of the opossum tribe it was a female and with it he took two young ones it was found much to resemble the remarkable animal of the kind which mons de busson has described in his natural history by the name of phalanger but it was not the same mons busson supposes this tribe to be peculiar to america but in this he is certainly mistaken and probably as pallas has observed in his zoology the phalanger itself is a native of the east indies as the animal which was caught by mr banks resembled it in the extraordinary conformation of the feet in which it differs from animals of every other tribe  friday    on the   th mr gore shot a kanguroo which with the skin entrails and head weighed eightyfour pounds upon examination however we found that this animal was not at its full growth the innermost grinders not being yet formed we dressed it for dinner the next day    0 july saturday    but to our great disappointment we found it had a much worse flavor than that we had eaten before  the wind continued in the same quarter and with the same violence till five oclock in the morning of the   th sunday    when it fell calm soon after a light breeze sprung up from the land and it being about two hours ebb i sent a boat to see what water was upon the bar in the mean time we got the anchor up and made all ready to put to sea but when the boat came back the officer reported that there was only thirteen feet water upon the bar which was six inches less than the ship drew we were therefore obliged to come to and the sea breeze setting in again about eight oclock we gave up all hope of sailing that day  we had fresh gales at se with hazy weather and rain monday  0 tuesday    till two in the morning of the   st when the weather being something more moderate i had thoughts of trying to warp the ship out of the harbor but upon going out myself first in the boat i found it still blow too fresh for the attempt during all this time the pinnace and yawl continued to ply the net and hook with tolerable success sometimes taking a turtle and frequently bringing in from two to three hundred weight of fish  on the  st of august the carpenter examined the pumps august wednes   and to our great mortification found them all in a state of decay owing as he said to the saps having been left in the wood one of them was so rotten as when hoisted up to drop to pieces and the rest were little better so that our chief trust was now in the soundness of our vessel which happily did not admit more than one inch of water in an hour     0 august friday   saturday   at six oclock in the morning of friday the  d we made another unsuccessful attempt to warp the ship out of the harbor but at five oclock in the morning of the  th our efforts had a better effect and about seven we got once more under sail with a light air from the land which soon died away and was followed by the seabreezes from s e by s with which we stood off to sea e by n having the pinnace ahead which was ordered to keep sounding continually the yawl had been sent to the turtle bank to take up the net which had been left there but as the wind freshened we got out before her a little before noon we anchored in fifteen fathom water with a sandy bottom for i did not think it safe to run in among the shoals till i had well viewed them at low water from the masthead which might determine me which way to steer for as yet i was in doubt whether i should beat back to the southward round all the shoals or seek a passage to the eastward or the northward all which at present appeared to be equally difficult and dangerous when we were at anchor the harbor from which we sailed bore s  0 w distant about five leagues the northermost point of the main in sight which i named cape bedford and which lies in latitude       s longitude        w bore n  0 w distant three leagues and a half but to the n e of this cape we could see land which had the appearance of two high islands the turtle banks bore east distant one mile our latitude by observation was       s and our depth of water in standing off from the land was from three and an half to fifteen fathom  chart of part of the coast of new south wales from cape tribulation to endeavor straits by lieut j cook    0 explanation rocks some of which are dry at low water and others always covered supposed direction of such part of the coast and shoals as were not seen places where the ship anchored the figures denote the depth of water in fathoms     chap vii departure from endeavor river a particular description of the harbor there in which the ship was refitted the adjacent country and several islands near the coast the range from endeavor river to the northern extremity of the country and the dangers of that navigation to the harbor which we had now left    0 august saturday   i gave the name of endeavor river it is only a small bar harbor or creek which runs in a winding channel three or four leagues inland and at the head of which there is a small brook of fresh water there is not depth of water for shipping above a mile within the bar and at this distance only on the north side where the bank is so steep for near a quarter of a mile that a ship may lie afloat at low water so near the shore as to reach it with a stage and the situation is extremely convenient for heaving down but at low water the depth upon the bar is not more than nine or ten feet nor more than seventeen or eighteen at the height of the tide the difference between high and low water at spring tides being about nine feet at the new and full of the moon it is high water between nine and ten oclock it must also be remembered that this part of the coast is so barricaded with shoals as to make the harbor still more difficult of access the safest approach is from the southward keeping the main land close upon the board all the way its situation may always be found by the latitude which has been very accurately laid down    0 august saturday   over the south point is some high land but the north point is formed by a low sandy beach which extends about three miles to the northward where the land begins again to be high  the chief refreshment that we procured here was turtle but as they were not to be had without going five leagues out to sea and the weather was frequently tempestuous we did not abound with this dainty what we caught as well as the fish was always equally divided among us all by weight the meanest person on board having the same share as myself and i think every commander in such a voyage as this will find it his interest to follow the same rule in several parts of the sandy beaches and sand hills near the sea we found purslain and a kind of bean that grows upon a stalk which creeps along the ground the purslain we found very good when it was boiled and the beans are not to be despised for we found them of great service to our sick the best greens however that could be procured here were the tops of the coccos which have been mentioned already as known in the west indies by the name of indian kale these were in our opinion not much inferior to spinnage which in taste they somewhat resemble the roots indeed are not good but they might probably be meliorated by proper cultivation they are found here chiefly in boggy ground the few cabbage palms that we met with were in general small and yielded so little cabbage that they were not worth seeking  besides the kanguroo and the opossum that have been already mentioned and a kind of polecat there are wolves upon this part of the coast if we were not deceived by the tracks upon the ground and several species of serpents some of the serpents are venomous and some harmiless there are no tame animals here except dogs    0 august saturday   and of these we saw but two or three which frequently came about the tents to pick up the scraps and bones that happened to lie scattered near them there does not indeed seem to be many of any animal except the kanguroo we scarcely saw any other above once but this we met with almost every time we went into the woods of land fowls we saw crows kites hawks cockatoos of two sorts one white and the other black a very beautiful kind of loriquets some parrots pigeons of two or three sorts and several small birds not known in europe the water fowls are herns whistling ducks which perch and i believe roost upon trees wild geese curlieus and a few others but these do not abound the face of the country which has been occasionally mentioned before is agreeably diversified by hill and valley lawn and wood the soil of the hills is hard dry and stony yet it produces coarse grass besides wood the soil of the plains and valleys is in some places sand and in some clay in some also it is rocky and stony like the hills in general however it is well clothed and has at least the appearance of fertility the whole country both hill and valley wood and plain abounds with ant hills some of which are six or eight feet high and twice as much in circumference the trees here are not of many sorts the gum tree which we found on the southern part of the coast is the most common but here it is not so large on each side of the river through its whole course there are mangroves in great numbers which in some places extend a mile within the coast the country is in all parts well watered there being several fine rivulets at a small distance from each other but none in the place where we lay at least not during the time we were there which was the dry season we were however well supplied with water by springs which were not far off     0 august saturday   in the afternoon of the  th we had a gentle breeze at se and clear weather but as i did not intend to sail till the morning i sent all the boats to the reef to get what turtle and shell fish they could at low water i went up to the masthead and took a view of the shoals which made a very threatening appearance i could see several at a remote distance and part of many of them was above water the sea appeared most open to the north east of the turtle reef and i came to a resolution to stretch out that way close upon a wind because if we should find no passage we could always return the way we went in the evening the boats brought in a turtle a stingray and as many large cockles as came to about a pound and a half a man for in each of them there was not less than two pounds of meat in the night also we caught several sharks which though not a dainty were an acceptable increase of our fresh provision  sunday   in the morning i waited till half ebb before i weighed because at that time the shoals begin to appear but the wind then blew so hard that i was obliged to remain at anchor in the afternoon however the gale becoming more moderate we got under sail and stood out upon a wind n e by e leaving the turtle reef to windward and having the pinnace sounding ahead we had not kept this course long before we discovered shoals before us and upon both the bows and at half an hour after four having run about eight miles the pinnace made the signal for shoal water where we little expected it upon this we tacked and stood on and off while the pinnace stretched farther to the eastward and night approaching i came to an anchor in twenty fathom water with a muddy bottom endeavor river then bore s    w cape bedford w by n n distant five leagues the northermost land in sight which had the appearance of an island n and a shoal a small sandy part of which appeared above water    0 august sunday   bore n e distant between two and three miles in standing off from turtle reef to this place we had from fourteen to twenty fathom water but when the pinnace was about a mile farther to the e n e there was no more than four or five feet water with rocky ground and yet this did not appear to us in the ship in the morning of the  th we had a strong gale monday   so that instead of weighing we were obliged to veer away more cable and strike our topgallant yards at low water myself with several of the officers kept a lookout at the masthead to see if any passage could be discovered between the shoals but nothing was in view except breakers extending from the s round by the e as far as n w and out to sea beyond the reach of our sight these breakers however did not appear to be caused by one continued shoal but by several which lay detached from each other on that which lay farthest to the eastward the sea broke very high which made me think it was the outermost for upon many of these within the breakers were inconsiderable and from about half ebb to half flood they were not to be seen at all which makes sailing among them still more dangerous especially as the shoals here consist principally of coral rocks which are as steep as a wall upon some of them however and generally at the north end there are patches of sand which are covered only at high water and which are to be discerned at some distance being now convinced that there was no passage to sea but through the labyrinth formed by these shoals i was altogether at a loss which way to steer when the weather should permit us to get under sail it was the masters opinion that we should beat back the way we came but this would have been an endless labor as the wind blew strongly from that quarter almost without intermission on the other hand if no passage could be found to the northward    0 august we should be compelled to take that measure at last these anxious deliberations engaged us till eleven oclock at night when the ship drove and obliged us to veer away to a cable and one third which brought her up but in the morning tuesday   the gale increasing she drove again and we therefore let go the small bower and veered away to a whole cable upon it and two cables on the other anchors yet she still drove though not so fast we then got down topgallant masts and struck the yards and topmasts close down and at last had the satisfaction to find that she rode cape bedford now bore w s w distant three leagues and an half and in this situation we had shoals to the eastward extending from the s e by s to the n n w the nearest of which was about two miles distant wednes   thursday   friday  0 as the gale continued with little remission we rode till seven oclock in the morning of the  0th when it being more moderate we weighed and stood in for the land having at length determined to seek a passage along the shore to the northward still keeping the boat ahead during our run in we had from nineteen to twelve fathom after standing in about an hour we edged away for three small islands that lay n n e e three leagues from cape bedford which the master had visited while we were in port at nine oclock we were abreast of them and between them and the main between us and the main there was another low island which lies n n w four miles from the three islands and in this channel we had fourteen fathom water the northermost point of land in sight now bore n n w w distant about two leagues four or five leagues to the north of this head land we saw three islands near which lay some that were still smaller and we could see the shoals and reefs without us extending to the northward as far as these islands between these reefs and the head land we directed our course leaving to the eastward a small island    0 august friday  0 which lies n by e distant four miles from the three islands at noon we were got between the head land and the three islands from the head land we were distant two leagues and from the islands four our latitude by observation was       we now thought we saw a clear opening before us and hoped hat we were once more out of danger in this hope however we soon found ourselves disappointed and for that reason i called the head land cape flattery it lies in latitude       s longitude        w and is a lofty promontory making next the sea in two hills which have a third behind them with low sandy ground on each side it may however be still better known by the three islands out at sea the northermost and largest lies about five leagues from the cape in the direction of n n e from cape flattery the land trends away n w and n w by w we steered along the shore n w by w till one oclock for what we thought the open channel when the petty officer at the masthead cried out that he saw land ahead extending quite round to the islands that lay without us and a large reef between us and them upon this i ran up to the masthead myself from whence i very plainly saw the reef which was now so far to windward that we could not weather it but the land ahead which he had supposed to be the main appeared to me to be only a cluster of small islands as soon as i got down from the masthead the master and some others went up who all insisted that the land ahead was not islands but the main and to make their report still more alarming they said that they saw breakers all round us in this dilemma we hauled upon a wind in for the land and made the signal for the boat that was sounding ahead to come on board but as she was far to leeward we were obliged to edge away to take her up and soon after we came to an anchor under a point of the main    0 august friday  0 in somewhat less than five fathom and at about the distance of a mile from the shore cape flattery now bore s e distant three leagues and an half as soon as the ship was at anchor i went ashore upon the point which is high and afforded me a good view of the sea coast trending away n w by w eight or ten leagues which the weather not being very clear was as far as i could see nine or ten small low islands and some shoals appeared off the coast i saw also some large shoals between the main and the three high islands without which i was clearly of opinion there were more islands and not any part of the main except the point i was now upon which i called point lookout and cape flattery the main land to the northward of cape bedford is low and chequered with white sand and green bushes for ten or twelve miles inland beyond which it rises to a considerable height to the northward of point lookout the coast appeared to be shoal and flat for a considerable distance which did not encourage the hope that the channel we had hitherto found in with the land would continue upon this point which was narrow and consisted of the finest white sand we had ever seen we discovered the footsteps of people and we saw also smoke and fire at a distance up the country  in the evening i returned to the ship and resolved the next morning to visit one of the high islands in the offing from the top of which as they lay five leagues out to sea i hoped to discover more distinctly the situation of the shoals and the channel between them  saturday    in the morning therefore of the   th i set out in the pinnace accompanied by mr banks whose fortitude and curiosity made him a party in every expedition for the northermost and largest of the three islands and at the same time i sent the master in the yawl to leeward    0 august saturday    to found between the low islands and the main in my way i passed over a reef of coral rock and sand which lies about two leagues from the island and i left another to leeward which lies about three miles from it on the north part of the reef to the leeward there is a low sandy island with trees upon it and upon the reef which we passed over we saw several turtle we chased one or two but having little time to spare and the wind blowing fresh we did not take any  about one oclock we reached the island and immediately ascended the highest hill with a mixture of hope and fear proportioned to the importance of our business and the uncertainty of the event when i looked round i discovered a reef of rocks lying between two and three leagues without the islands and extending in a line n w and s e farther than i could see upon which the sea broke in a dreadful surf this however made me think that there were no shoals beyond them and i conceived hopes of getting without these as i perceived several breaks or openings in the reef and deep water between that and the islands i continued upon this hill till sunset but the weather was so hazy during the whole time that i came down much disappointed after reflecting upon what i had seen and comparing the intelligence i had gained with what i expected i determined to stay upon the island all night hoping that the morning might be clearer and afford me a more distinct and comprehensive view we therefore took up our lodging under the shelter of a bush which grew upon the beach and at three in the morning sunday    having sent the pinnace with one of the mates whom i had brought out with me to sound between the island and the reefs and examine what appeared to be a channel through them i climbed the hill a second time but to my great disappointment found the weather much more hazy than it had been the day before    0 august sunday    about noon the pinnace returned having been as far as the reef and found between fifteen and twentyeight fathom of water but it blew so hard that the mate did not dare to venture into one of the channels which he said appeared to him to be very narrow this however did not discourage me for i judged from his description of the place he had been at that he had seen it to disadvantage while i was busy in my survey mr banks was attentive to his favorite pursuit and picked up several plants which he had not before seen we found the island which is visible at twelve leagues distance to be about eight leagues in circumference and in general very rocky and barren on the north west side however there are some sandy bays and some low land which is covered with long thin grass and trees of the same kind with those upon the main this part also abounded with lizards of a very large size some of which we took we found also fresh water in two places one was a running stream but that was a little brackish where i tasted it which was close to the sea the other was a standing pool close behind the sandy beach and this was perfectly sweet and good notwithstanding the distance of this island from the main we saw to our great surprise that it was sometimes visited by the natives for we found seven or eight frames of their huts and vast heaps of shells the fish of which we supposed had been their food we observed that all these huts were built upon eminences and entirely exposed to the s e contrary to those which we had seen upon the main for they were all built either upon the side of a hill or under some bushes which afforded them shelter from the wind from these huts and their situation we concluded that at some seasons of the year the weather here is invariably calm and fine for the inhabitants have no boat which can navigate the sea to so great a distance    0 august sunday    in such weather as we had from the time of our first coming upon the coast as we saw no animals upon this place but lizards i called it lizard island the other two high islands which lie at the distance of four or five miles from it are comparatively small and near them lie three others smaller still and low with several shoals or reefs especially to the s e there is however a clear passage from cape flattery to these islands and even quite to the outward reefs leaving lizard island to the north west and the others to the south east  at two in the afternoon there being no hope of clear weather we set out from lizard island to return to the ship and in our way landed upon the low sandy island with trees upon it which we had remarked in our going out upon this island we saw an incredible number of birds chiefly seafowl we found also the nest of an eagle with young ones which we killed and the nest of some other bird we knew not what of a most enormous size it was built with sticks upon the ground and was no less than six and twenty feet in circumference and two feet eight inches high we found also that this place had been visited by the indians probably to eat turtle many of which we saw upon the island and a great number of their shells piled one upon another in different places  to this spot we gave the name of eagle island and after leaving it we steered s w directly for the ship founding all the way and we had never less than eight fathom nor more than fourteen the same depth of water that i had found between this and lizard island  when i got on board the master informed me that he had been down to the low islands between which and the main i had directed him to found that he judged them to lie about three leagues from the main    0 august sunday    that without them he found from ten to fourteen fathom and between them and the main seven but that a flat which ran two leagues out from the main made this channel narrow upon one of these low islands he slept and was ashore upon others and he reported that he saw every where piles of turtleshells and fins hanging upon the trees in many places with the flesh upon them so recent that the boats crew eat of them he saw also two spots clear of grass which appeared to have been lately dug up and from the shape and size of them he conjectured they were graves  after considering what i had seen myself and the report of the master i was of opinion that the passage to leeward would be dangerous and that by keeping in with the main we should run the risk of being locked in by the great reef and at last be compelled to return back in search of another passage by which or any other accident that should cause the same delay we should infallibly lose our passage to the east indies and endanger the ruin of the voyage as we had now but little more than three months provisions on board at short allowance  having stated this opinion and the facts and appearances upon which it was founded to the officers it was unanimously agreed that the best thing we could do would be to quit the coast altogether till we could approach it with less danger  monday    in tne morning therefore at break of day we got under sail and stood out n e for the north west end of lizard island leaving eagle island to windward and some other islands and shoals to the leeward and having the pinnace ahead to ascertain the depth of water in every part of our course in this channel we had from nine to fourteen fathom at noon    0 august monday    the north west end of lizard island bore e s e distant one mile our latitude by observation was       and our depth of water fourteen fathom we had a steady gale at s e and by two oclock we just fetched to windward of one of the channels or openings in the outer reef which i had seen from the island we now tacked and made a short trip to the s w while the master in the pinnace examined the channel he soon made the signal for the ship to follow and in a short time she got safe out as soon as we had got without the breakers we had no ground with one hundred and fifty fathom and found a large sea rolling in from the s e a certain sign that neither land nor shoals were near us in that direction  our change of situation was now visible in every countenance for it was most sensibly felt in every breast we had been little less than three months entangled among shoals and rocks that every moment threatened us with destruction frequently passing our nights at anchor within hearing of the surge that broke over them sometimes driving toward them even while our anchors were out and knowing that if by any accident to which an almost continual tempest exposed us they should not hold we must in a few minutes inevitably perish but now after having sailed no less than three hundred and sixty leagues without once having a man out of the chains heaving the lead even for a minute which perhaps never happened to any other vessel we found ourselves in an open sea with deep water and enjoyed a flow of spirits which was equally owing to our late dangers and our present security yet the very waves which by their swell convinced us that we had no rocks or shoals to fear convinced us also that we could not safely put the same confidence in our vessel as before she had struck for the blows she received from them so widened her leaks    0 august monday    that she admitted no less than nine inches water in an hour which considering the state of our pumps and the navigation that was still before us would have been a subject of more serious consideration to people whose danger had not so lately been so much more imminent  the passage or channel through which we passed into the open sea beyond the reef lies in latitude       s and may always be known by the three high islands within it which i have called the islands of direction because by these a stranger may find a safe passage through the reef quite to the main the channel lies from lizard island n e n distant three leagues and is about one third of a mile broad and not more in length lizard island which is as i have before observed the largest and the northermost of the three affords safe anchorage under the north west side fresh water and wood for fuel the low islands and shoals also which lie between it and the main abound with turtle and fish which may probably be caught in all seasons of the year except when the weather is very tempestuous so that all things considered there is not perhaps a better place for ships to refresh at upon the whole coast than this island and before i dismiss it i must observe that we found upon it as well as upon the beach in and about endeavor river bamboos cocoa nuts pumice stone and the seeds of plants which are not the produce of this country and which it is reasonable to suppose are brought from the eastward by the trade winds the islands which were discovered by quiros and called australia del espiritu santa lie in this parallel but how far to the eastward cannot now be ascertained in most charts they are placed in the same longitude with this country which as appears by the account of his voyage that has been published    0 august monday    he never saw for that places his discoveries no less than two and twenty degrees to the eastward of it  as soon as we were without the reef we brought to and having hoisted in the boats we stood off and on upon a wind all night for i was not willing to run to leeward till i had a whole day before me tuesday    in the morning at daybreak lizard island bore s    e distant ten leagues and we then made sail and stood away nnw w till nine oclock when we stood nw n having the advantage of a fresh gale at se at noon our latitude by observation was       s and at this time we had no land in sight at six in the evening we shortened sail and brought the ship to with her head to the ne and at six in the morning made sail and steered west wednes    in order to get within sight of the land that i might be sure not to overshoot the passage if a passage there was between this land and new guinea at noon our latitude by observation was      s longitude     w which was      w of lizard island at this time we had no land in sight but a little before one oclock we saw high land from the masthead bearing wsw at two we saw more land to the n w of that we had seen before it appeared in hills like islands but we judged it to be a continuation of the main land about three we discovered breakers between the land and the ship extending to the southward farther than we could see but to the north we thought we saw them terminate abreast of us what we took for the end of them in this direction however soon appeared to be only an opening in the reef for we presently saw them again extending northward beyond the reach of our sight upon this we hauled close upon a wind which was now at e s e and we had scarcely trimmed our sails before it came to e by n which was right upon the reef and consequently made our clearing it doubtful    0 august wednes    at sunset the northermost part of it that was in sight bore from us n by e and was two or three leagues distant this however being the best tack to clear it we kept standing to the northward with all the sail we could set till midnight when being afraid of standing too far in this direction we tacked and stood to the southward our run from sunset to this time being six leagues n and n by e when we had stood about two miles s s e it fell calm we had sounded several times during the night but had no bottom with one hundred and forty fathom neither had we any ground now with the same length of line yet about four in the morning thursday    we plainly heard the roaring of the surf and at break of day saw it foaming to a vast height at not more than a miles distance our distress now returned upon us with double force the waves which rolled in upon the reef carried us toward it very fast we could reach no ground with an anchor and had not a breath of wind for the sail in this dreadful situation no resource was left us but the boats and to aggravate our misfortune the pinnace was under repair the longboat and yawl however were put into the water and sent ahead to tow which by the help of our sweeps abaft got the ships head round to the northward which if it could not prevent our destruction might at least delay it but it was six oclock before this was effected and we were not then a hundred yards from the rock upon which the same billow which washed the side of the ship broke to a tremendous height the very next time it rose so that between us and destruction there was only a dreary valley no wider than the base of one wave and even now the sea under us was unfathomable at least no bottom was to be found with a hundred and twenty fathom during this scene of distress the carpenter had found means to patch up the pinnace so that she was hoisted out and sent ahead in aid of the other boats to tow    0 august thursday    but all our efforts would have been ineffectual if just at this crisis of our fate a light air of wind had not sprung up so light that at any other time we should not have observed it but which was enough to turn the scale in our favor and in conjunction with the assistance which was afforded us by the boats to give the ship a perceptible motion obliquely from the reef our hopes now revived but in less than ten minutes it was again a dead calm and the ship was again driven toward the breakers which were not now two hundred yards distant the same light breeze however returned before we had lost all the ground it had enabled us to gain and lasted about ten minutes more during this time we discovered a small opening in the reef at about the distance of a quarter of a mile i immediately sent one of the mates to examine it who reported that its breadth was not more than the length of the ship but that within it there was smooth water this discovery seemed to render our escape possible and that was all by pushing the ship through the opening which was immediately attempted it was uncertain indeed whether we could reach it but if we should succeed thus far we made no doubt of being able to get through in this however we were disappointed for having reached it by the joint assistance of our boats and the breeze we found that in the mean time it had become high water and to our great surprise we met the tide of ebb rushing out of it like a millstream we gained however some advantage though in a manner directly contrary to our expectations we found it impossible to go through the opening but the stream that prevented us carried us out about a quarter of a mile it was too narrow for us to keep in it longer yet this tide of ebb so much assisted the boats that by noon we had got an offing of near two miles    0 august thursday    we had however reason to despair of deliverance even if the breeze which had now died away should revive for we were still embayed in the reef and the tide of ebb being spent the tide of flood notwithstanding our utmost efforts again drove the ship into the bight about this time however we saw another opening near a mile to the westward which i immediately sent the first lieutenant mr hicks in the small boat to examine in the mean time we struggled hard with the flood sometimes gaining a little and sometimes losing but every man still did his duty with as much calmness and regularity as if no danger had been near about two oclock mr hicks returned with an account that the opening was narrow and dangerous but that it might be passed the possibility of passing it was sufficient encouragement to make the attempt for all danger was less imminent than that of our present situation a light breeze now sprung up at e n e with which by the help of our boats and the very tide of flood that without an opening would have been our destruction we entered it and were hurried through with amazing rapidity by a torrent that kept us from driving against either side of the channel which was not more than a quarter of a mile in breadth while we were shooting this gulf our soundings were from thirty to seven fathom very irregular and the ground at bottom very foul  as soon as we had got within the reef we anchored in nineteen fathom over a bottom of coral and shells and now such is the vicissitude of life we thought ourselves happy in having regained a situation which but two days before it was the utmost object of our hope to quit rocks and shoals are always dangerous to the mariner even where their situation has been ascertained they are more dangerous in seas which have never before been navigated and in this part of the globe they are more dangerous than in any other for here they are reefs of coral rock    0 august thursday    rising like a wall almost perpendicularly out of the unfathomable deep always overflowed at high water and at low water dry in many places and here the enormous waves of the vast southern ocean meeting with so abrupt a resistance break with inconceivable violence in a surf which no rocks or storms in the northern hemisphere can produce the danger of navigating unknown parts of this ocean was now greatly increased by our having a crazy ship and being short of provisions and every other necessary yet the distinction of a first discoverer made us cheerfully encounter every danger and submit to every inconvenience and we chose rather to incur the censure of imprudence and temerity which the idle and voluptuous so liberally bestow upon unsuccessful fortitude and perseverance than leave a country which we had discovered unexplored and give color to a charge of timidity and irresolution  having now congratulated ourselves upon getting within the reef notwithstanding we had so lately congratulated ourselves upon getting without it i resolved to keep the main land on board in my future route to the northward whatever the consequence might be for if we had now gone without the reef again it might have carried us so far from the coast as to prevent my being able to determine whether this country did or did not join to new guinea a question which i was determined to resolve from my first coming within sight of land however as i had experienced the disadvantage of having a boat under repair at a time when it was possible i might want to use her i determined to remain fast at anchor till the pinnace was perfectly refitted as i had no employment for the other boats i sent them out in the morning to the reef friday    to see what refreshments could be procured    0 august friday    and mr banks in his little boat accompanied by dr solander went with them in this situation i found the variation by amplitude and azimuth to be     e and at noon our latitude by observation was       s and our longitude        w the main land extended from n    w to s w by s and the nearest part of it was distant about nine leagues the opening through which we had passed i called providential channel and this bore e n e distant ten or twelve miles on the main land within us was a lofty promontory which i called cape weymouth on the north side of which is a bay which i called weymooth bay they lie in latitude       s longitude        w at four oclock in the afternoon the boats returned with two hundred and forty pound of the meat of shellfish chiefly of cockles some of which were as much as two men could move and contained twenty pounds of good meat mr banks also brought back many curious shells and mollusca besides many species of coral among which was that called the tubipora musica  saturday    at six oclock in the morning we got under sail and stood away to the nw having two boats ahead to direct us our soundings were very irregular varying five or six fathom every cast between ten and twentyseven a little before noon we passed a low sandy island which we left on our starboard side at the distance of two miles at noon our latitude was       and our distance from the main about four leagues it extended from s by w to n    w and some small islands from n  0 w to    w between us and the main were several shoals and some without us besides the main or outermost reef which we could see from the masthead stretching away to the n e at two in the afternoon as we were steering n w by n we saw a large shoal right ahead extending three or four points upon each bow    0 august saturday    upon this we hauled up n n e and n e by n to get round the north point of it which we reached by four and then edged away to the westward and ran between the north end of this shoal and another which lies two miles to the northward of it having a boat all the way ahead sounding our depth of water was still very irregular from twentytwo to eight fathom at half an hour after six we anchored in thirteen fathom the northermost of the small islands seen at noon bore w s distant three miles these islands are distinguished in the chart by the name of forbess islands and lie about five leagues from the main which here forms a high point that we called bolt head from which the land trends more westerly and is in that direction all low and sandy to the southward it is high and hilly even near the sea  at six in the morning we got again under sail sunday    and steered for an island which lay at a small distance from the main and at this time bore from us n  0 w distant about five leagues our course was soon interrupted by shoals however by the help of the boats and a good lookout from the top of the mast we got into a fair channel that led us down to the island between a very large shoal on our starboard side and several small ones toward the main in this channel we had from twenty to thirty fathom water between eleven and twelve oclock we hauled round the north east side of the island leaving it between us and the main from which it is distant about seven or eight miles this island is about a league in circuit and we saw upon it five of the natives two of whom had lances in their hands they came down upon a point and having looked a little while at the ship retired to the n w of it are several low islands and quays which lie not far from the main and to the northward and eastward are several other islands and shoals    0 august sunday    so that we were now encompassed on every side but having lately been exposed to much greater danger and rocks and shoals being grown familiar we looked at them comparatively with little concern the main land appeared to be low and barren interspersed with large patches of the very fine white sand which we had found upon lizard island and different parts of the main the boats had seen many turtle upon the shoals which they passed but it blew too hard for them to take any at noon our latitude by observation was    and our longitude        our depth of water was fourteen fathom and our course and distance reduced to a strait line was between this time and the preceding noon n    w thirty two miles  the main land within the islands that have been just mentioned forms a point which i called cape grenville it lies in latitude       longitude        and between it and bolt head is a bay which i called temple bay at the distance of nine leagues from cape grenville in the direction of e n lie some high islands which i called sir charles hardys isles and those which lie off the cape i called cockburns isles having lain by for the boats which had got out of their station till about one oclock we then took the yawl in tow and the pinnace having got ahead we filled and stood n by w for some small islands which lay in that direction such at least they were in appearance but upon approaching them we perceived that they were joined together by a large reef upon this we edged away n w and left them on our starboard hand we steered between them and the islands that lay off the main having a clear passage and from fifteen to twentythree fathom water at four oclock we discovered some low islands and rocks bearing w n w and stood directly for them    0 august sunday    at half an hour after six we anchored on the north east side of the northermost of them at one mile distance and in sixteen fathom these islands lie n w four leagues from cape grenville and from the number of birds that i saw upon them i called them bird isles a little before sunset we were in sight of the main land which appeared all very low and sandy extending as far to the northward as n w by n some shoals quays and low sandy isles stretching away to the n e  at six oclock in the morning we got again under sail monday  0 with a fresh breeze at e and stood away n n w for some low islands in that direction but were soon obliged to haul close upon a wind to weather a shoal which we discovered upon our larboard bow having at the same time others to the eastward by the time we had weathered this shoal to leeward we had brought the islands well upon our lee bow but seeing some shoals run off from them and some rocks on our starboard bow which we did not discover till we were very near them i was afraid to go to windward of the islands and therefore brought to and having made the signal for the pinnace which was ahead to come on board i sent her to leeward of the islands with orders to keep along the edge of the shoal which ran off from the south side of the southermost island sending the yawl at the same time to run over the shoal in search of turtle as soon as the pinnace had got to a proper distance we wore and stood after her as we ran to leeward of this island we took the yawl in tow she having seen only one small turtle and therefore made but little stay upon the shoal the island we found to be a small spot of sand with some trees upon it and we could discern many huts or habitations of the natives whom we supposed occasionally to visit these islands from the main    0 august monday  0 they being only five leagues distant to catch turtle when they come ashore to lay their eggs we continued to stand after the pinnace n n e and n by e for two other low islands having two shoals without us and one between us and the main at noon we were about four leagues from the main which we saw extending to the northward as far as n w by n all flat and sandy our latitude by observation was       s and our longitude        w our soundings were from fourteen to twentythree fathom but these as well as the shoals and islands which are too numerous to be particularly mentioned will be best seen upon the chart by one oclock we had run nearly the length of the southermost of the two islands in sight and finding that the going to windward of them would carry us too far from the main we bore up and ran to leeward where finding a fair open passage we steered n by w in a direction parallel to the main leaving a small island which lay between it and the ship and some low sandy isles and shoals without us of all which we lost sight by four oclock and saw no more before the sun went down at this time the farthest part of the land in sight bore n n w w and soon after we anchored in thirteen fathom upon soft ground at the distance of about five leagues from the land where we lay till daylight  tuesday    early in the morning we made sail again and steered n n w by compass for the northermost land in sight and at this time we observed the variation of the needle to be     e at eight oclock we discovered shoals ahead and on our larboard bow and saw that the northermost land which we had taken for the main was detached from it and that we might pass between them by running to leeward of the shoals on our larboard bow which were now near us we therefore wore and brought to sending away the pinnace and yawl to direct us    0 august tuesday    and then steered n w along the s w or inside of the shoals keeping a good lookout from the masthead and having another shoal on our larboard side we found however a good channel of a mile broad between them in which we had from ten to fourteen fathom at eleven oclock we were nearly the length of the land detached from the main and there appeared to be no obstruction in the passage between them yet having the longboat astern and rigged we sent her away to keep in shore upon our larboard bow and at the same time dispatched the pinnace astarboard precautions which i thought necessary as we had a strong flood that carried us an end very fast and it was near high water as soon as the boats were ahead we stood after them and by noon got through the passage our latitude by observation was then  0    and the nearest part of the main which we soon after found to be the northermost bore w   s distant between three or four miles we found the land which was detached from the main to be a single island extending from n to n    e distant between two and three miles at the same time we saw other islands at a considerable distance extending from n by w to w n w and behind them another chain of high land which we judged also to be islands there were still other islands extending as far as n    w which at this time we took for the main  the point of the main which forms the side of the channel through which we had passed opposite to the island is the northern promontory of the country and i called it york cape its longitude is        w the latitude of the north point is  0    and of the east point  0    s the land over the east point and to the southward of it is rather low and as far as the eye can reach very flat and of a barren appearance to the southward of the cape the shore forms a large open bay    0 august tuesday    which i called newcastle bay and in which are some small low islands and shoals the land adjacent is also very low flat and sandy the land of the northern part of the cape is more hilly the valleys seem to be well clothed with wood and the shore forms some small bays in which there appeared to be good anchorage close to the eastern point of the cape are three small islands from one of which a small ledge of rocks runs out into the sea there is also an island close to the northern point the island that forms the straight or channel through which we had passed lies about four miles without these which except two are very small the southermost is the largest and much higher than any part of the main land on the north west side of this island there appeared to be good anchorage and on shore valleys that promised both wood and water these islands are distinguished in the chart by the name of york isles to the southward and south east and even to the eastward and northward of them there are several other low islands rocks and shoals our depth of water in sailing between them and the main was twelve thirteen and fourteen fathom  we stood along the shore to the westward with a gentle breeze at s e by s and when we had advanced between three and four miles we discovered the land ahead which when we first saw it we took for the main to be islands detached from it by several channels upon this we sent away the boats with proper instructions to lead us through that channel which was next the main but soon after discovering rocks and shoals in this channel i made a signal for the boats to go through the next channel to the northward which lay between these islands leaving some of them between us and the main the ship followed    0 august tuesday    and had never less than five fathom water in the narrowest part of the channel where the distance from island to island was about one mile and an half  at four oclock in the afternoon we anchored being about a mile and a half or two miles within the entrance in six fathom and a half with clear ground the channel here had begun to widen and the islands on each side of us were distant about a mile the main land stretched away to the s w the farthest point in view bore s    w and the southermost point of the islands on the north west side of the passage bore s    w between these two points we could see no land so that we conceived hopes of having at last found a passage into the indian sea however that i might be able to determine with more certainty i resolved to land upon the island which lies at the south east point of the passage upon this island we had seen many of the inhabitants when we first came to an anchor and when i went into the boat with a party of men accompanied by mr banks and dr solander in order to go ashore we saw ten of them upon a hill nine of them were armed with such lances as we had been used to see and the tenth had a bow and a bundle of arrows which we had never seen in the possession of the natives of this country before we also observed that two of them had large ornaments of mother of pearl hanging round their necks three of these one of whom was the bowman placed themselves upon the beach abreast of us and we expected that they would have opposed our landing but when we came within about a muskets shot of the beach they walked leisurely away we immediately climbed the highest hill which was not more than three times as high as the masthead and the most barren of any we had seen    0 august tuesday    from this hill no land could be seen between the s w and w s w so that i had no doubt of finding a channel through the land to the north west of it consisted of a great number of islands of various extent and different heights ranged one behind another as far to the northward and westward as i could see which could not be less than thirteen leagues as i was now about to quit the eastern coast of new holland which i had coasted from latitude    to this place and which i am confident no european had ever seen before i once more hoisted english colors and though i had already taken possession of several particular parts i now took possession of the whole eastern coast from latitude    to this place latitude  0 s in right of his majesty king george the third by the name of new south wales with all the bays harbors rivers and islands situated upon it we then fired three vollies of small arms which were answered by the same number from the ship having performed this ceremony upon the island which we called possession island we reimbarked in our boat but a rapid ebb tide setting n e made our return to the vessel very difficult and tedious from the time of our last coming among the shoals we constantly found a moderate tide the flood setting to the n w and the ebb to the s e at this place it is high water at the full and change of the moon about one or two oclock and the water rises and falls perpendicularly about twelve feet we saw smoke rising in many places from the adjacent lands and islands as we had done upon every part of the coast after our last return to it through the reef  we continued at anchor all night and between seven and eight oclock in the morning wednes    we saw three or four of the natives upon the beach gathering shellfish we discovered by the help of our glasses that they were women and    0 august thursday    like all the other inhabitants of this country stark naked at low water which happened about ten oclock we got under sail and stood to the s w with a light breeze at e which afterward veered to n by e our depth of water was from six to ten fathom except in one place where we had but five at noon possession island bore n    e distant four leagues the western extremity of the main land in sight bore s    w distant between four and five leagues and appeared to be extremely low the south west point of the largest island on the north west side of the passage bore n    w distant eight miles and this point i called cape cornwall it lies in latitude  0    s longitude     w and some low lands that lie about the middle of the passage which i called walliss isles bore w by s s distant about two leagues our latitude by observation was  0    s we continued to advance with the tide of flood w n w having little wind and from eight to five fathom water at half an hour after one the pinnace which was ahead made the signal for shoal water upon which we tacked and sent away the yawl to sound also we then tacked again and stood after them in about two hours they both made the signal for shoal water and the tide being nearly at its greatest height i was afraid to stand on as running aground at that time might be fatal i therefore came to an anchor in somewhat less than seven fathom sandy ground walliss islands bore s by w w distant five or six miles the islands to the northward extended from s    e to n  0 e and a small island which was just in sight bore n w w here we found the flood tide set to the westward and the ebb to the eastward  after we had come to an anchor i sent away the master in the longboat to sound who upon his return in the evening    0 august thursday    reported that there was a bank stretching north and south upon which there were but three fathom and that beyond it there were seven about this time it fell calm and continued so till nine the next morning when we weighed with a light breeze at s s e and steered n w by w for the small island which was just in sight having first sent the boats ahead to sound the depth of water was eight seven six five and four fathom and three fathom upon the bank it being now the last quarter ebb at this time the northermost island in sight bore n   e cape cornwall e distant three leagues and walliss isles s   e distant three leagues this bank at least so much as we have sounded extends nearly n and s but to what distance i do not know its breadth is not more than half a mile at the utmost when we had got over the bank we deepened our water to six fathom three quarters and had the same depth all the way to the small island ahead which we reached by noon when it bore s distant about half a mile our depth of water was now five fathom and the northermost land in sight which is part of the same chain of islands that we had seen to the northward from the time of our first entering the straight bore n    e our latitude by observation was  0    s and our longitude        w in this situation no part of the main was in sight as we were now near the island and had but little wind mr banks and i landed upon it and found it except a few patches of wood to be a barren rock the haunt of birds which had frequented it in such numbers as to make the surface almost uniformly white with their dung of these birds the greater part seemed to be boobies and i therefore called the place booby island after a short stay we returned to the ship and in the mean time the wind had got to the s w it was but a gentle breeze yet it was accompanied by a swell from the same quarter which with other circumstances    0 august thursday    confirmed my opinion that we were got to the westward of carpentaria or the northern extremity of new holland and had now an open sea to the westward which gave me great satisfaction not only because the dangers and fatigues of the voyage were drawing to an end but because it would no longer be a doubt whether new holland and new guinea were two separate islands or different parts of the same  the north east entrance of this passage or straight lies in the latitude of  0    s and in the longitude of        w it is formed by the main or the northern extremity of new holland on the s e and by a congeries of islands which i called the prince of waless islands to the n w and it is probable that these islands extend quite to new guinea they differ very much both in height and circuit and many of them seemed to be well clothed with herbage and wood upon most if not all of them we saw smoke and therefore there can be no doubt of their being inhabited it is also probable that among them there are at least as good passages as that we came through perhaps better though better would not need to be desired if the access to it from the eastward were less dangerous that a less dangerous access may be discovered i think there is little reason to doubt and to find it little more seems to be necessary than to determine how far the principal or outer reef which bounds the shoals to the eastward extends toward the north which i would not have left to future navigators if i had been less harassed by danger and fatigue and had had a ship in better condition for the purpose  to this channel or passage i have given the name of the ship and called it endeavor streights its length from n e to s w is ten leagues and it is about five leagues broad    0 august thursday    except at the north east entrance where it is somewhat less than two miles being contracted by the islands which lie there that which i called possession island is of a moderate height and circuit and this we left between us and the main passing between it and two small round islands which lie about two miles to the n w of it the two small islands which i called walliss islands lie in the middle of the south west entrance and these we left to the southward our depth of water in the straight was from four to nine fathom with every where good anchorage except upon the bank which lies two leagues to the northward of walliss islands where at low water there are but three fathom for a more particular knowledge of this straight and of the situations of the several islands and shoals on the eastern coast of new wales i refer to the chart where they are delineated with all the accuracy that circumstances would admit yet with respect to the shoals i cannot pretend that one half of them are laid down nor can it be supposed possible that one half of them should be discovered in the course of a single navigation many islands also must have escaped my pencil especially between latitude  0 and    where we saw islands out at sea as far as an island could be distinguished it must not therefore be supposed by future navigators that where no shoal or island is laid down in my chart no shoal or island will be found in these seas it is enough that the situation of those that appear in the chart is faithfully ascertained and in general i have the greatest reason to hope that it will be found as free from error as any that has not been corrected by subsequent and successive observations the latitudes and longitudes of all or most of the principal head lands and bays may be confided in for we seldom failed of getting an observation once at least every day by which to correct the latitude of our reckoning    0 august thursday    and observations for settling the longitude were equally numerous no opportunity that was offered by the sun and moon being suffered to escape it would be injurious to the memory of mr green not to take this opportunity of attesting that he was indefatigable both in making observations and calculating upon them and that by his instructions and assistance many of the petty officers were enabled both to observe and calculate with great exactness this method of finding the longitude at sea may be put into universal practice and may always be depended upon within half a degree which is sufficient for all nautical purposes if therefore observing and calculating were considered as necessary qualifications for every sea officer the labors of the speculative theorist to solve this problem might be remitted without much injury to mankind neither will it be so difficult to acquire this qualification or put it in practice as may at first appear for with the assistance of the nautical almanac and astronomical ephemeris the calculations for finding the longitude will take up little more time than the calculation of an azimuth for finding the variation of the compass  chap viii departure from new south wales a particular description of the country its products and people a specimen of the language and some observations upon the currents and tides    0 august of this country its products and its people many particulars have already been related in the course of the narrative being so interwoven with the events as not to admit of a separation i shall now give a more full and circumstantial description of each in which if some things should happen to be repeated the greater part will be found new  new holland or as i have now called the eastern coast new south wales is of a larger extent than any other country in the known world that does not bear the name of a continent the length of coast along which we sailed reduced to a strait line is no less than twentyseven degrees of latitude amounting to near  000 miles so that its square surface must be much more than equal to all europe to the southward of    or    the land in general is low and level farther northward it is hilly but in no part can be called mountainous and the hills and mountains taken together make but a small part of the surface in comparison with the valleys and plains it is upon the whole rather barren than fertile yet the rising ground is chequered by woods and lawns and the plains and valleys are in many places covered with herbage the soil however is frequently sandy and many of the lawns or savannahs are rocky and barren    0 august especially to the northward where in the best spots vegetation was less vigorous than in the southern part of the country the trees were not so tall nor was the herbage so rich the grass in general is high but thin and the trees where they are largest are seldom less than forty feet asunder nor is the country inland as far as we could examine it better clothed than the sea coast the banks of the bays are covered with mangroves to the distance of a mile within the beach under which the soil is a rank mud that is always overflowed by a spring tide farther in the country we sometimes met with a bog upon which the grass was very thick and luxuriant and sometimes with a valley that was clothed with underwood the soil in some parts seemed to be capable of improvement but the far greater part is such as can admit of no cultivation the coast at least that part of it which lies to the northward of    s abounds with fine bays and harbors where vessels may lie in perfect security from all winds  if we may judge by the appearance of the country while we were there which was in the very height of the dry season it is well watered we sound innumerable small brooks and springs but no great rivers these brooks however probably become large in the rainy season thirsty sound was the only place where fresh water was not to be procured for the ship and even there one or two small pools were found in the woods though the face of the country was every where intersected by saltcreeks and mangrove land  of trees there is no great variety of those that could be called timber there are but two sorts the largest is the gum tree which grows all over the country and has been mentioned already    0 august it has narrow leaves not much unlike a willow and the gum or rather resin which it yields is of a deep red and resembles the sanguis draconis possibly it may be the same for this substance is known to be the produce of more than one plant it is mentioned by dampier and is perhaps the same that tasman found upon diemens land where he says he saw gum of the trees and gum lac of the ground the other timber tree is that which grows somewhat like our pines and has been particularly mentioned in the account of botany bay the wood of both these trees as i have before remarked is extremely hard and heavy besides these here are trees covered with a soft bark that is easily peeled off and is the same that in the east indies is used for the caulking of ships  we found here the palm of three different sorts the first which grows in great plenty to the southward has leaves that are plaited like a fan the cabbage of these is small but exquisitely sweet and the nuts which it bears in great abundance are very good food for hogs the second sort bore a much greater resemblance to the true cabbage tree of the west indies its leaves were large and pinnated like those of the cocoanut and these also produced a cabbage which though not so sweet as the other was much larger the third sort which like the second was found only in the northern parts was seldom more than ten feet high with small pinnated leaves resembling those of some kind of fern it bore no cabbage but a plentiful crop of nuts about the size of a large chestnut but rounder as we found the hulls of these scattered round the places where the indians had made their ires we took for granted that they were fit to eat those however who made the experiment paid dear for their knowledge of the contrary for they operated both as an emetic and cathartic with great violence still however    0 august we made no doubt but that they were eaten by the indians and judging that the constitution of the hogs might be as strong as theirs though our own had proved to be so much inferior we carried them to the stye the hogs eat them indeed and for some time we thought without suffering any inconvenience but in about a week they were so much disordered that two of them died and the rest were recovered with great difficulty it is probable however that the poisonous quality of these nuts may lie in the juice like that of the cassada of the west indies and that the pulp when dried may be not only wholesome but nutricious besides these species of the palm and mangroves there were several small trees and shrubs altogether unknown in europe particularly one which produced a very poor kind of fig another that bore what we called a plum which it resembled in color but not in shape being flat on the sides like a little cheese and a third that bore a kind of purple apple which after it had been kept a few days became eatable and tasted somewhat like a damascene  here is a great variety of plants to enrich the collection of a botanist but very few of them are of the aesculent kind a small plant with long narrow grassy leaves resembling that kind of bulrush which in england is called the catstail yields a resin of a bright yellow color exactly resembling gambouge except that it does not stain it has a sweet smell but its properties we had no opportunity to discover any more than those of many others with which the natives appear to be acquainted as they have distinguished them by names  i have already mentioned the root and leaves of a plant resembling the coccos of the west indies and a kind of bean    0 august to which may be added a sort of parsley and purselain and two kinds of yams one shaped like a rhadish and the other round and covered with stringy fibers both sorts are very small but sweet and we never could find the plants that produced them though we often saw the places where they had been newly dug up it is probable that the drought had destroyed the leaves and we could not like the indians discover them by the stalks  most of the fruits of this country such as they are have been mentioned already we found one in the southern part of the country resembling a cherry except that the stone was soft and another not unlike a pineapple in appearance but of a very disagreeable taste which is well known in the east indies and is called by the dutch pyn appel boomen  of the quadrupeds i have already mentioned the dog and particularly described the kanguroo and the animal of the opossum kind resembling the phalanger of buffon to which i can add only one more resembling a polecat which the natives call quoll the back is brown spotted with white and the belly white unmixed several of our people said they had seen wolves but perhaps if we had not seen tracts that favored the account we might have thought them little more worthy of credit than he who reported that he had seen the devil  of batts which hold a middle place between the beasts and the birds we saw many kinds particularly one which as i have observed already was larger than a partridge we were not fortunate enough to take one either alive or dead but it was supposed to be the same as buffon has described by the name of rouset or rouget  the sea and other waterfowl of this country are gulls    0 august shaggs soland geese or gannets of two sorts boobies noddies curlieus ducks pelicans of an enormous size and many others the landbirds are crows parrots paroquets cockatoos and other birds of the same kind of exquisite beauty pigeons doves quails bustards herons cranes hawks and eagles the pigeons flew in numerous flocks so that notwithstanding their extreme shyness our people frequently killed ten or twelve of them in a day these birds are very beautiful and crested very differently from any we had seen before  among other reptiles here are serpents of various kinds some noxious and some harmless scorpions centipieds and lizards the insects are but few the principal are the musquito and the ant of the ant there are several sorts some are as green as a leaf and live upon trees where they build their nests of various sizes between that of a mans head and his fist these nests are of a very curious structure they are formed by bending down several of the leaves each of which is as broad as a mans hand and gluing the points of them together so as to form a purse the viscus used for this purpose is an animal juice which nature has enabled them to elaborate their method of first bending down the leaves we had not an opportunity to observe but we saw thousands uniting all their strength to hold them in this position while other busy multitudes were employed within in applying the gluten that was to prevent their returning back to satisfy ourselves that the leaves were bent and held down by the effort of these diminutive artificers we disturbed them in their work and as soon as they were driven from their station the leaves on which they were employed sprung up with a force much greater than we could have thought them able to conquer by any combination of their strength    0 august but though we gratified our curiosity at their expense the injury did not go unrevenged for thousands immediately threw themselves upon us and gave us intolerable pain with their stings especially those which took possession of our necks and our hair from whence they were not easily driven the sting was scarcely less painful than that of a be but except it was repeated the pain did not last more than a minute  another sort are quite black and their operations and manner of life are not less extraordinary their habitations are the inside of the branches of a tree which they contrive to excavate by working out the pith almost to the extremity of the slenderest twig the tree at the same time flourishing as if it had no such inmate when we first found the tree we gathered some of the branches and were scarcely less astonished than we should have been to find that we had profaned a consecrated grove where every tree upon being wounded gave signs of life for we were instantly covered with legions of these animals swarming from every broken bough and inflicting their stings with incessant violence they are mentioned by rumphius in his herbarium amboinense vol ii p     but the tree in which he saw their dwelling is very different from that in which we found them  a third kind we found nested in the root of a plant which grows on the bark of trees in the manner of misletoe and which they had perforated for that use this root is commonly as big as a large turnip and sometimes much bigger when we cut it we found it intersected by innumerable winding passages all filled with these animals by which however the vegetation of the plant did not appear to have suffered any injury    0 august we never cut one of these roots that was not inhabited though some were not bigger than a hazlenut the animals themselves are very small not more than half as big as the common red ant in england they had stings but scarcely force enough to make them felt they had however a power of tormenting us in an equal if not a greater degree for the moment we handled the root they swarmed from innumerable holes and running about those parts of the body that were uncovered produced a titillation more intolerable than pain except it is increased to great violence rumphins has also given an account of this bulb and its inhabitants vol vi p   0 where he mentions another sort that are black  we found a fourth kind which are perfectly harmless and almost exactly resemble the whiteants of the east indies the architecture of these is still more curious than that of the others they have houses of two sorts one is suspended on the branches of trees and the other erected upon the ground those upon the trees are about three or four times as big as a mans head and are built of a brittle substance which seems to consist of small parts of vegetables kneaded together with a glutinous matter which their bodies probably supply upon breaking this crust innumerable cells swarming with inhabitants appear in a great variety of winding directions all communicating with each other and with several apertures that lead to other nests upon the same tree they have also one large avenue or covered way leading to the ground and carried on under it to the other nest or house that is constructed there this house is generally at the root of a tree but not of that upon which their other dwellings are constructed it is formed like an irregularly sided cone and sometimes is more than six feet high    0 august and nearly as much in diameter some are smaller and these are generally flat sided and very much resemble in figure the stones which are seen in many parts of england and supposed to be the remains of druidical antiquity the outside of these is of well tempered clay about two inches thick and within are the cells which have no opening outward but communicate only with the subterranean way to the houses on the tree and to the tree near which they are constructed where they ascend up the root and so up the trunk and branches under covered ways of the same kind as those by which they descended from their other dwellings to these structures on the ground they probably retire in the winter or rainy seasons as they are proof against any wet that can fall which those in the tree though generally constructed under some overhanging branch from the nature and thinness of their crust or wall cannot be  the sea in this country is much more liberal of food to the inhabitants than the land and though fish is not quite so plenty here as they generally are in higher latitudes yet we seldom hauled the seine without taking from fifty to two hundred weight they are of various sorts but except the mullet and some of the shellfish none of them are known in europe most of them are palatable and some are very delicious upon the shoals and reef there are incredible numbers of the finest green turtle in the world and oysters of various kinds particularly the rockoyster and the pearloyster the gigantic cockles have been mentioned already besides which there are seacrayfish or lobsters and crabs of these however we saw only the shells in the rivers and salt crecks there are aligators  the only person who has hitherto given any account of this country or its inhabitants is dampier and though he is    0 august in general a writer of credit yet in many particulars he is mistaken the people whom he saw were indeed inhabitants of a part of the coast very distant from that which we visited but we also saw inhabitants upon parts of the coast very distant from each other and there being a perfect uniformity in person and customs among them all it is reasonable to conclude that distance in another direction has not considerably broken it  the number of inhabitants in this country appears to be very small in proportion to its extent we never saw so many as thirty of them together but once and that was at botany bay when men women and children assembled upon a rock to see the ship pass by when they manifestly formed a resolution to engage us they never could muster above fourteen or fifteen fighting men and we never saw a number of their sheds or houses together that could accommodate a larger party it is true indeed that we saw only the seacoast on the eastern side and that between this and the western shore there is an immense tract of country wholly unexplored but there is great reason to believe that this immense tract is either wholly desolate or at least still more thinly inhabited than the parts we visited it is impossible that the inland country should subsist inhabitants at all seasons without cultivation it is extremely improbable that the inhabitants of the coast should be totally ignorant of arts of cultivation which were practiced inland and it is equally improbable that if they knew such arts there should be no traces of them among them it is certain that we did not see one foot of ground in a state of cultivation in the whole country and therefore it may well be concluded that where the sea does not contribute to feed the inhabitants    0 august the country is not inhabited  the only tribe with which we had any intercourse we found where the ship was careened it consisted of one and twenty persons twelve men seven women one boy and one girl the women we never saw but at a distance for when the men came over the river they were always left behind the men here and in other places were of a middle size and in general well made clean limbed and remarkably vigorous active and nimble their countenances were not altogether without expression and their voices were remarkably soft and effeminate  their skins were so uniformly covered with dirt that it was very difficult to ascertain their true color we made several attempts by wetting our fingers and rubbing it to remove the incrustations but with very little effect with the dirt they appear nearly as black as a negroe and according to our best discoveries the skin itself is of the color of wood soot or what is commonly called a chocolate color their features are far from being disagreeable their noses are not flat nor are their lips thick their teeth are white and even and their hair naturally long and black it is however universally cropped short in general it is strait but sometimes it has a slight curl we saw none that was not matted and filthy though without oil or grease and to our great astonishment free from lice their beards were of the same color with their hair and bushy and thick they are not however suffered to grow long a man whom we had seen one day with his beard somewhat longer than his companions we saw the next with it somewhat shorter and upon examination found the ends of the hairs burnt from this incident and our having never seen any sharp instrument among them    0 august we concluded that both the hair and the beard were kept short by singeing them  both sexes as i have already observed go stark naked and seem to have no more sense of indecency in discovering the whole body than we have in discovering our hands and face their principal ornament is the bone which they thrust through the cartilage that divides the nostrils from each other what perversion of taste could make them think this a decoration or what could prompt them before they had worn it or seen it worn to suffer the pain and inconvenience that must of necessity attend it is perhaps beyond the power of human sagacity to determine as this bone is as thick as a mans finger and between five and six inches long it reaches quite across the face and so effectually stops up both the nostrils that they are forced to keep their mouths wide open for breath and snuffle so when they attempt to speak that they are scarcely intelligible even to each other our seamen with some humor called it their spritsailyard and indeed it had so ludicrous an appearance that till we were used to it we found it difficult to refrain from laughter beside this nosejewel they had necklaces made of shells very neatly cut and strung together bracelets of small cord wound two or three times about the upper part of their arm and a string of plaited human hair about as thick as a thread of yarn tied round the waist besides these some of them had gorgets of shells hanging round the neck so as to reach cross the breast but though these people wear no clothes their bodies have a covering besides the dirt for they paint them both white and red the red is commonly laid on in broad patches upon the shoulders and breast and the white in stripes some narrow and some broad the narrow were drawn over the limbs and the broad over the body not without some degree of taste the white was also laid on in small patches upon the face    0 august and drawn in a circle round each eye the red seemed to be ochre but what the white was we could not discover it was close grained saponaceous to the touch and almost as heavy as white lead possibly it might be a kind of steatites but to our great regret we could not procure a bit of it to examine they have holes in their ears but we never saw any thing worn in them upon such ornaments as they had they set so great a value that they would never part with the least article for any thing we could offer which was the more extraordinary as our beads and ribbons were ornaments of the same kind but of a more regular form and more showy materials they had indeed no idea of traffic nor could we communicate any to them they received the things that we gave them but never appeared to understand our signs when we required a return the same indifference which prevented them from buying what we had prevented them also from attempting to steal if they had coveted more they would have been less honest for when we refused to give them a turtle they were enraged and attempted to take it by force and we had nothing else upon which they seemed to set the least value for as i have before observed many of the things that we had given them we found left negligently about in the woods like the playthings of children which please only while they are new upon their bodies we saw no marks of disease or sores but large scars in irregular lines which appeared to be the remains of wounds which they had inflicted upon themselves with some blunt instrument and which we understood by signs to have been memorials of grief for the dead  they appeared to have no fixed habitations for we saw nothing like a town or village in the whole country their houses if houses they may be called seem to be formed with less art and industry than any we had seen    0 august except the wretched hovels at terra del fuego and in some respects they are inferior even to them at botany bay where they were best they were just high enough for a man to sit upright in but not large enough for him to extend himself in his whole length in any direction they are built with pliable rods about as thick as a mans finger in the form of an oven by sticking the two ends into the ground and then covering them with palm leaves and broad pieces of bark the door is nothing but a large hole at one end opposite to which the fire is made as we perceived by the ashes under these houses or sheds they sleep coiled up with their heels to their head and in this position one of them will hold three or four persons as we advanced northward and the climate became warmer we found these sheds still more slight they were built like the others of twigs and covered with bark but none of them were more than four feet deep and one side was entirely open the close side was always opposed to the course of the prevailing wind and opposite to the open side was the fire probably more as a defense from the musquitos than the cold under these hovels it is probable that they thrust only their heads and the upper part of their bodies extending their feet toward the fire they were set up occasionally by a wandering hord in any place that would furnish them for a time with subsistence and left behind them when after it was exhausted they went away but in places where they remained only for a night or two they slept without any shelter except the bushes or grass which is here near two feet high we observed however that though the sleeping huts which we found upon the main were always turned from the prevailing wind those upon the islands were turned toward it which seems to be a proof that they have a mild season here during which the sea is calm    0 august and that the same weather which enables them to visit the islands makes the air welcome even while they sleep  the only furniture belonging to these houses that fell under our observation is a kind of oblong vessel made of bark by the simple contrivance of tying up the two ends with a withy which not being cut off serves for a handle these we imagined were used as buckets to fetch water from the spring which may be supposed sometimes to be at a considerable distance they have however a small bag about the size of a moderate cabbagenet which is made by laying threads loop within loop somewhat in the manner of knitting used by our ladies to make purses this bag the man carries loose upon his back by a small string which passes over his head it generally contains a lump or two of paint and resin some fishhooks and lines a shell or two out of which their hooks are made a few points of darts and their usual ornaments which includes the whole worldly treasure of the richest man among them  their fishhooks are very neatly made and some of them are exceedingly small for striking turtle they have a peg of wood which is about a foot long and very well bearded this fits into a socket at the end of a staff of light wood about as thick as a mans wrist and about seven or eight feet long to the staff is tied one end of a loose line about three or four fathom long the other end of which is fastened to the peg to strike the turtle the peg is fixed into the socket and when it has entered his body and is retained there by the barb the staff flies off and serves for a float to trace their victim in the water it assists also to tire him till they can overtake him with their canoes and haul him ashore one of these pegs as i have mentioned already we found buried in the body of a turtle which had healed up over it    0 august their lines are from the thickness of a half inch rope to the fineness of a hair and are made of some vegetable substance but what in particular we had no opportunity to learn  their food is chiefly fish though they sometimes contrive to kill the kanguroo and even birds of various kinds notwithstanding they are so shy that we found it difficult to get within reach of them with a fowlingpiece the only vegetable that can be considered as an article of food is the yam yet doubtless they eat the several fruits which have been mentioned among other productions of the country and indeed we saw the shells and hulls of several of them lying about the places where they had kindled their fire  they do not appear to eat any animal food raw but having no vessel in which water can be boiled they either broil it upon the coals or bake it in a hole by the help of hot stones in the same manner as is practiced by the inhabitants of the islands in the south seas  whether they are acquainted with any plant that has an intoxicating quality we do not know but we observed that several of them held leaves of some sort constantly in their mouths as an european does tobacco and an east indian betele we never saw the plant but when they took it from their mouths at our request possibly it might be a species of the betele but whatever it was it had no effect upon the teeth or the lips  as they have no nets they catch fish only by striking or with a hook and line except such as they find in the hollows of the rocks and shoals which are dry at half ebb  their manner of hunting we had no opportunity to see but we conjectured by the notches which they had every where cut in large trees in order to climb them    0 august that they took their station near the tops of them and there watched for such animals as might happen to pass near enough to be reached by their lances it is possible also that in this situation they might take birds when they came to roost  i have observed that when they went from our tents upon the banks of endeavor river we could trace them by the fires which they kindled in their way and we imagined that these fires were intended some way for the taking the kanguroo which we observed to be so much afraid of fire that our dogs could scarcely force it over places which had been newly burnt though the fire was extinguished  they produce fire with great facility and spread it in a wonderful manner to produce it they take two pieces of dry soft wood one is a stick about eight or nine inches long the other piece is flat the stick they shape into an obtuse point at one end and pressing it upon the other turn it nimbly by holding it between both their hands as we do a chocolate mill often shifting their hands up and then moving them down upon it to increase the pressure as much as possible by this method they get fire in less than two minutes and from the smallest spark they increase it with great speed and dexterity we have often seen one of them run along the shore to all appearance with nothing in his hand who stooping down for a moment at the distance of every fifty or a hundred yards left fire behind him as we could see first by the smoke and then by the flame among the drift wood and other litter which was scattered along the place we had the curiosity to examine one of these planters of fire when he set off and we saw him wrap up a small spark in dry grass which when he had run a little way having been fanned by the air that his motion produced began to blaze    0 august he then laid it down in a place convenient for his purpose enclosing a spark of it in another quantity of grass and so continued his course  there are perhaps few things in the history of mankind more extraordinary than the discovery and application of fire it will scarcely be disputed that the manner of producing it whether by collision or attrition was discovered by chance but its first effects would naturally strike those to whom it was a new object with consternation and terror it would appear to be an enemy to life and nature and to torment and destroy whatever was capable of being destroyed or tormented and therefore it seems not easy to conceive what should incline those who first saw it receive a transient existence from chance to reproduce it by design it is by no means probable that those who first saw fire approached it with the same caution as those who are familiar with its effects so as to be warmed only and not burnt and it is reasonable to think that the intolerable pain which at its first appearance it must produce upon ignorant curiosity would sow perpetual enmity between this element and mankind and that the same principle which incites them to crush a serpent would incite them to destroy fire and avoid all means by which it would be produced as soon as they were known these circumstances considered how men became sufficiently familiar with it to render it useful seems to be a problem very difficult to solve nor is it easy to account for the first application of it to culinary purposes as the eating both animal and vegetable food raw must have become a habit before there was fire to dress it and those who have considered the force of habit will readily believe that to men who had always eaten the flesh of animals raw it would be as disagreeable dressed as to those who have always eaten it dressed it would be raw it is remarkable that the inhabitants of terra del fuego produce fire from a spark by collision    0 august and that the happier natives of this country new zealand and otaheite produce it by the attrition of one combustible substance against another is there not then some reason to suppose that these different operations correspond with the manner in which chance produced fire in the neighborhood of the torrid and frigid zones among the rude inhabitants of a cold country neither any operation of art or occurrence of accident could be supposed so easily to produce fire by attrition as in a climate where every thing is hot dry and adust teeming with a latent fire which a slight degree of motion was sufficient to call forth in a cold country therefore it is natural to suppose that fire was produced by the accidental collision of two metallic substances and in a cold country for that reason the same expedient was used to produce it by design but in hot countries where two combustible substances easily kindle by attrition it is probable that the attrition of such substances first produced fire and here it was therefore natural for art to adopt the same operation with a view to produce the same effect it may indeed be true that fire is now produced in many cold countries by attrition and in many hot by a stroke but perhaps upon enquiry there may appear reason to conclude that this has arisen from the communication of one country with another and that with respect to the original production of fire in hot and cold countries the distinction is well founded  there may perhaps be some reason to suppose that men became gradually acquainted with the nature and effects of fire by its permanent existence in a volcano there being remains of volcanoes or vestiges of their effects in almost every part of the world by a volcano however no method of producing fire otherwise than by contact could be learnt the production and application of fire therefore    0 august still seem to afford abundant subject of speculation to the curious  the weapons of these people are spears or lances and these are of different kinds some that we saw upon the southern part of the coast had four prongs pointed with bone and barbed the points were also smeared with a hard resin which gave them a polish and made them enter deeper into what they struck to the northward the lance has but one point the shaft is made of cane or the stalk of a plant somewhat resembling a bulrush very strait and light and from eight to fourteen feet long consisting of several joints where the pieces are let into each other and bound together to this are fitted points of different kinds some are of hard heavy wood and some are the bones of fish we saw several that were pointed with the stings of the stingray the largest that they could procure and barbed with several that were smaller fastened on in a contrary direction the points of wood were also sometimes armed with sharp pieces of broken shells which were stuck in and at the junctures covered with resin the lances that are thus barbed are indeed dreadful weapons for when once they have taken place they can never be drawn back without tearing away the flesh or leaving the sharp ragged splinters of the bone or shell which forms the beard behind them in the wound these weapons are thrown with great force and dexterity if intended to wound at a short distance between ten and twenty yards simply with the hand but if at the distance of forty or fifty with an instrument which we called a throwing stick this is a plain smooth piece of a hard reddish wood very highly polished about two inches broad half an inch thick and three feet long with a small knob or hook at one end and a cross piece about three or four nches long at the other the knob at one end is received in a small dent or hollow    0 august which is made for that purpose in the shaft of the lance near the point but from which it easily slips upon being impelled forward when the lance is laid along upon this machine and secured in a proper position by the knob the person that is to throw it holds it over his shoulder and after shaking it delivers both the throwing stick and lance with all his force but the stick being stopped by the cross piece which comes against the shoulder with a sudden jerk the lance flies forward with incredible swiftness and with so good an aim that at the distance of fifty yards these indians were more sure of their mark than we could be with a single bullet besides these lances we saw no offensive weapon upon this coast except when we took our last view of it with our glasses and then we thought we saw a man with a bow and arrows in which it is possible we might be mistaken we saw however at botany bay a shield or target of an oblong shape about three feet long and eighteen inches broad which was made of the bark of a tree this was fetched out of a hut by one of the men that opposed our landing who when he ran away left it behind him and upon taking it up we found that it had been pierced through with a single pointed lance near the center these shields are certainly in frequent use among the people here for though this was the only one that we saw in their possession we frequently found trees from which they appeared manifestly to have been cut the marks being easily distinguished from those that were made by cutting buckets sometimes also we found the shields cut out but not yet taken off from the tree the edges of the bark only being a little raised by wedges so that these people appear to have discovered that the bark of a tree becomes thicker and stronger by being suffered to remain upon the trunk after it has been cut round  the canoes of new holland are as mean and rude as the houses    0 august those on the southern part of the coast are nothing more than a piece of bark about twelve feet long tied together at the ends and kept open in the middle by small bows of wood yet in a vessel of this construction we once saw three people in shallow water they are set forward by a pole and in deeper by paddles about eighteen inches long one of which the boatman holds in each hand mean as they are they have many conveniences they draw but little water and they are very light so that they go upon mud banks to pick up shell fish the most important use to which they can be applied better perhaps than vessels of any other construction we observed that in the middle of these canoes there was a heap of seaweed and upon that a small fire probably that the fish may be broiled and eaten the moment it is caught  the canoes that we saw when we advanced farther to the northward are not made of bark but of the trunk of a tree hollowed perhaps by fire they are about fourteen feet long and being very narrow are fitted with an outrigger to prevent their oversetting these are worked with paddles that are so large as to require both hands to manage one of them the outside is wholly unmarked by any tool but at each end the wood is left longer at the top than at the bottom so that there is a projection beyond the hollow part resembling the end of a plank the sides are tolerably thin but how the tree is felled and fashioned we had no opportunity to learn the only tools that we saw among them are an adze wretchedly made of stone some small pieces of the same substance in form of a wedge a wooden mallet and some shells and fragments of coral for polishing their throwing sticks and the points of their lances they use the leaves of a kind of wild fig tree which bites upon wood almost as keenly as the shavegrass of europe    0 august which is used by our joiners with such tools the making even such a canoe as i have described must be a most difficult and tedious labor to those who have been accustomed to the use of metal it appears altogether impracticable but there are few difficulties that will not yield to patient perseverance and he who does all he can will certainly produce effects that greatly exceed his apparent power  the utmost freight of these canoes is four people and if more at any time wanted to come over the river one of those who came first was obliged to go back for the rest from this circumstance we conjectured that the boat we saw when we were lying in endeavor river was the only one in the neighborhood we have however some reason to believe that the bark canoes are also used where the wooden ones are constructed for upon one of the small islands where the natives had been fishing for turtle we found one of the little paddles which had belonged to such a boat and would have been useless on board any other  by what means the inhabitants of this country are reduced to such a number as it can subsist is not perhaps very easy to guess whether like the inhabitants of new zealand they are destroyed by the hands of each other in contests for food whether they are swept off by accidental famine or whether there is any cause which prevents the increase of the species must be left for future adventurers to determine that they have wars appears by their weapons for supposing the lances to serve merely for the striking of fish the shield could be intended for nothing but a defense against men the only mark of hostility however which we saw among them was the perforation of the shield by a spear which has been just mentioned for none of them appeared to have been wounded by an enemy neither can we determine whether they are pusilanimous or brave    0 august the resolution with which two of them attempted to prevent our landing when we had two boats full of men in botany bay even after one of them was wounded with small shot gave us reason to conclude that they were not only naturally courageous but that they had acquired a familiarity with the dangers of hostility and were by habit as well as nature a daring and warlike people but their precipitate flight from every other place that we approached without even a menace while they were out of our reach was an indication of uncommon tameness and timidity such as those who had only been occasionally warriors must be supposed to have shaken off whatever might have been their natural disposition i have faithfully related facts the reader must judge of the people for himself  from the account that has been given of our commerce with them it cannot be supposed that we should know much of their language yet as this is an object of great curiosity especially to the learned and of great importance in their researches into the origin of the various nations that have been discovered we took some pains to bring away such a specimen of it as might in a certain degree answer the purpose and i shall now give an account how it was procured if we wanted to know the name of a stone we took a stone up into our hands and as well as we could intimated by signs that we wished they should name it the word that they pronounced upon the occasion we immediately wrote down this method though it was the best we could contrive might certainly lead us into many mistakes for if an indian was to take up a stone and ask us the name of it we might answer a pebble or a flint so when we took up a stone and asked an indian the name of it he might pronounce a word that distinguished the species and not the genus    0 august or that instead of signifying stone simply might signify a rough stone or a smooth stone however as much as possible to avoid mistakes of this kind several of us contrived at different times to get from them as many words as we could and having noted them down compared our lists those which were the same in all and which according to every ones account signified the same thing we ventured to record with a very few others which from the simplicity of the subject and the ease of expressing our question with plainness and precision by a sign have acquired equal authority

cocos yams maracotu expressions as we supposed of admiration which they continually used when they were in company with us cherr cherco yarcaw tut tut tut tut  i shall now quit this country with a few observations relative to the currents and tides upon the coast from latitude    and somewhat higher down to sandy cape in latitude       we constantly sound a current setting to the southward at the rate of about ten or fifteen miles a day being more or less according to our distance from the land for it always ran with more force in shore than in the offing but i could never satisfy myself whether the floodtide came from the southward the eastward or the northward i inclined to the opinion that it came from the southeast but the first time we anchored off the coast which was in latitude     0 about ten leagues to the south east of bustard bay i found it come from the north west on the contrary thirty leagues farther to the north west on the south side of keppel bay i found that it came from the east and at the northern part of that bay it came from the northward but with a much slower motion than it had come from the east on the east side of the bay of inlets it set strongly to the westward as far as the opening of broad sound but on the north side of that sound it came with a very slow motion from the north west and when we lay at anchor before  bay it came from the northward    0 august to account for its course in all this variety of directions we need only admit that the floodtide comes from the east or south east it is well known that where there are deep inlets and large creeks into low lands running up from the sea and not occasioned by rivers of fresh water there will always be a great indraught of the floodtide the direction of which will be determined by the position or direction of the coast which forms the entrance of such inlet whatever be its course at sea and where the tides are weak which upon this coast is generally the case a large inlet will if i may be allowed the expression attract the floodtide for many leagues  a view of the chart will at once illustrate this position to the northward of whitsundays passage there is no large inlet consequently the flood sets to the northward or north westward according to the direction of the coast and the ebb to the south or south eastward at least such is their course at a little distance from the land for very near it they will be influenced by small inlets i also observed that we had only one high tide in twentyfour hours which happened in the night the difference between the perpendicular rise of the water in the day and the night when there is a springtide is no less than three feet which where the tides are so inconsiderable as they are here is a great proportion of the whole difference between high and low water this irregularity of the tides which is worthy of notice we did not discover till we were run ashore and perhaps farther to the northward it is still greater after we got within the reef the second time we found the tides more considerable than we had ever done before except in the bay of inlets and possibly this may be owing to the water being more confined between the shoals here also the flood sets to the north west    0 august and continues in the same direction to the extremity of new wales from whence its direction is west and south west into the indian sea  chap ix the passage from new south wales to new guinea with an account of what happened upon landing there in the afternoon of thursday august the   d thursday    after leaving booby island we steered w n w with light airs from the s s w till five oclock when it fell calm and the tide of ebb soon after setting to the n e we came to an anchor in eight fathom water with a soft sandy bottom booby island bore s  0 e distant five miles and the prince of waless isles extended from n e by n to s    e between these there appeared to be a clear open passage extending from n    e to e by n  at half an hour after five in the morning of the   th friday    as we were purchasing the anchor the cable parted at about eight or ten fathom from the ring the ship then began to drive but i immediately dropped another anchor which brought her up before she got more than a cables length from the buoy the boats were then sent to sweep for the anchor but could not succeed at noon our latitude by observation was  0  0 s as i was resolved not to leave the anchor behind while there remained a possibility of recovering it i sent the boats again after dinner with a small line to discover where it lay this being happily effected we swept for it with a hawser and by the same hawser hove the ship up to it we proceeded to weigh it but just as we were about to ship it    0 august friday    the hawser slipped and we had all our labor to repeat by this time it was dark and we were obliged to suspend our operations till the morning  saturday    as soon as it was light we sweeped it again and heaved it to the bows by eight oclock we weighed the other anchor got under sail and with a fine breeze at e n e stood to the north west at noon our latitude by observation was  0    s longitude        w at this time we had no land in sight but about two miles to the southward of us lay a large shoal upon which the sea broke with great violence and part of which i believe is dry at low water it extends n w and s e and is about five leagues in circuit our depth of water from the time we weighed till now was nine fathom but it soon shallowed to seven fathom and at half an hour after one having run eleven miles between noon and that time the boat which was ahead made the signal for shoal water we immediately let go an anchor and brought the ship up with all the sails standing for the boat having just been relieved was at but a little distance upon looking out from the ship we saw shoal water almost all round us both wind and tide at the same time setting upon it the ship was in six fathom but upon sounding round her at the distance of half a cables length we found scarcely two this shoal reached from the east round by the north and west as far as the south west so that there was no way for us to get clear but that which we came this was another hairsbreadth escape for it was near high water and there run a short cockling sea which must very soon have bulged the ship if she had struck and if her direction had been half a cables length more either to the right or left she must have struck before the signal for the shoal was made the shoals which like these lie a fathom or two under water are the most dangerous of any for they do not discover themselves till the vessel is just upon them    0 august saturday    and then indeed the water looks brown as if it reflected a dark cloud between three and four oclock the tide of ebb began to make and i sent the master to sound to the southward and south westward and in the mean time as the ship tended i weighed anchor and with a little sail stood first to the southward and afterward edging away to the westward got once more out of danger at sunset we anchored in ten fathom with a sandy bottom having a fresh gale at e s e  at six in the morning we weighed again and stood west sunday    having as usual first sent a boat ahead to sound i had intended to steer n w till i had made the south coast of new guinea designing if possible to touch upon it but upon meeting with these shoals i altered my course in hopes of finding a clearer channel and deeper water in this i succeeded for by noon our depth of water was gradually increased to seventeen fathom our latitude was now by observation  0  0 s and our longitude   0    w no land was in sight we continued to steer west till sunset our depth of water being from twentyseven to twentythree fathom we then shortened sail and kept upon a wind all night four hours on one tack and four on another at daylight we made all the sail we could monday    and steered w n w till eight oclock and then n w at noon our latitude by observation was      s longitude     w variation    0 e we continued our n w course till sunset when we again shortened sail and hauled close upon a wind to the northward our depth of water was twentyone fathom at eight we tacked and stood to the southward till twelve then stood to the northward with little sail till daylight tuesday    our soundings were from twentyfive to seventeen fathom the water growing gradually shallow as we stood to the northward at this time we made sail and stood to the north    0 august tuesday    in order to make the land of new guinea from the time of making sail till noon the depth of water gradually decreased from seventeen to twelve fathom with a stoney and shelly bottom our latitude by observation was now      s which is in the same parallel as that in which the southern parts of new guinea are laid down in the charts but there are only two points so far to the south and i reckoned that we were a degree to the westward of them both and therefore did not see the land which trends more to the northward we found the sea here to be in many parts covered with a brown scum such as sailors generally call spawn when i first saw it i was alarmed fearing that we were among shoals but upon sounding we found the same depth of water as in other places this scum was examined both by mr banks and dr solander but they could not determine what it was it was formed of innumerable small particles not more than half a line in length each of which in the microscope appeared to consist of thirty or forty tubes and each tube was divided through its whole length by small partitions into many cells like the tubes of the conferva they were supposed to belong to the vegetable kingdom because upon burning them they produced no smell like that of an animal substance the same appearance had been observed upon the coast of brazil and new holland but never at any considerable distance from the shore in the evening a small bird hovered about the ship and at night settling among the rigging was taken it proved to be exactly the same bird which dampier has described and of which he has given a rude figure by the name of a noddy from new holland see his voyages vol iii p    tab of birds fig    we continued standing to the northward with a fresh gale at e by e and se till six in the evening    0 august tuesday    having very irregular soundings the depth changing at once from twentyfour fathom to seven at four we had seen the land from the masthead bearing nw by n it appeared to be very low and to stretch from wnw to nne distant four or five leagues we now hauled close upon a wind till seven then tacked and stood to the southward till twelve at which time we wore and stood to the northward till four in the morning then laid the head of the vessel off till daylight wednes    when we again saw the land and stood in nnw directly for it with a fresh gale at e by s our soundings during the night were very irregular from seven to five fathom suddenly changing from deep to shallow and from shallow to deep without in the least corresponding with our distance from the land at half an hour after six in the morning a small low island which lay at the distance of about a league from the main bore n by w distant five miles this island lies in latitude      s longitude        w and i find it laid down in the charts by the names of bartholomew and whermoysen we now steered nw by w wnw w by n w by s and sw by w as we found the land lie with from five to nine fathom and though we reckoned we were not more than four leagues from it yet it was so low and level that we could but just see it from the deck it appeared however to be well covered with wood and among other trees we thought we could distinguish the cocoanut we saw smoke in several places and therefore knew there were inhabitants at noon we were about three leagues from the land the westermost part of which that was in sight bore s    w our latitude by observation was      s and longitude        w the island of st bartholomew bore n    e distant  0 miles     0 august wednes    after steering sw by w six miles we had shoal water on our starboard bow which i sent the yawl to sound and at the same time hauled off upon a wind till four oclock and though during that time we had run six miles we had not deepened our water an inch i then edged away sw four miles more but finding it still shoal water i brought to and called the boats aboard at this time being between three and four leagues from the shore and the yawl having found only three fathom water in the place to which i had sent her to sound i hauled off close upon a wind and weathered the shoal about half a mile  between one and two oclock we passed a bay or inlet before which lies a small island that seems to shelter it from the southerly winds but i very much doubt whether there is sufficient depth of water behind it for shipping i could not attempt to determine the question because the se trade wind blows right into the bay and we had not as yet had any breeze from the land  we stretched off to sea till twelve oclock when we were about eleven leagues from the land and had deepened our water to twentynine fathom we now tacked and stood in till five in the morning thursday  0 when being in six fathom and an half we tacked and laid the head of the vessel off till daylight when we saw the land bearing nw by w at about the distance of four leagues we now made sail and steered first wsw then w by s but coming into five fathom and an half we hauled off s w till we deepened our water to eight fathom and then kept away w by s and w having nine fathom and the land just in sight from the deck we judged it to be about four leagues distant and it was still very low and woody great quantities of the brown scum continued to appear upon the water and the sailors having given up the notion of its being spawn    0 august thursday  0 found a new name for it and called it seasawdust at noon our latitude by observation was    0 s our longitude        w and saint bartholomews isle bore n    e distant seventyfour miles  as all this coast appears to have been very minutely examined by the dutch and as our track with the soundings will appear by the chart it is sufficient to say that we continued our course to the northward with very shallow water upon a bank of mud at such a distance from the shore as that it could scarcely be seen from the ship till the  d of september during this time we made many attempts to get near enough to go on shore but without success and having now lost six days of fair wind at a time when we knew the south east monsoon to be nearly at an end we began to be impatient of farther delay and determined to run the ship in as near to the shore as possible and then land with the pinnace while she kept plying off and on to examine the produce of the country and the disposition of the inhabitants for the two last days we had early in the morning a light breeze from the shore which was strongly impregnated with the fragrance of the trees shrubs and herbage that covered it the smell being something like that of gum benjamin on the  d of september at daybreak september monday   we saw the land extending from n by e to se at about four leagues distance and we then kept standing in for it with a fresh gale at ese and e by s till nine oclock when being within about three or four miles of it and in three fathom water we brought to the pinnace being hoisted out i set off from the ship with the boats crew accompanied by mr banks who also took his servants and dr solander being in all twelve persons well armed we rowed directly toward the shore    0 september monday   but the water was so shallow that we could not reach it by about two hundred yards we waded however the rest of the way having left two of the seamen to take care of the boat hitherto we had seen no signs of inhabitants at this place but as soon as we got ashore we discovered the prints of human feet which could not long have been impressed upon the sand as they were below high water mark we therefore concluded that the people were at no great distance and as a thick wood came down within a hundred yards of the water we thought it necessary to proceed with caution lest we should fall into an ambuscade and our retreat to the boat be cut off we walked along the skirts of the wood and at the distance of about two hundred yards from the place where we landed we came to a grove of cocoanut trees which stood upon the banks of a little brook of brackish water the trees were of a small growth but well hung with fruit and near them was a shed or hut which had been covered with their leaves though most of them were now fallen off about the hut lay a great number of the shells of the fruit some of which appeared to be just fresh from the tree we looked at the fruit very wishfully but not thinking it safe to climb we were obliged to leave it without tasting a single nut at a little distance from this place we found plantains and a breadfruit tree but it had nothing upon it and having now advanced about a quarter of a mile from the boat three indians rushed out of the wood with a hideous shout at about the distance of a hundred yards and as they ran toward us the foremost threw something out of his hand which slew on one side of him and burnt exactly like gunpowder but made no report the other two instantly threw their lances at us and as no time was now to be lost we discharged our pieces which were loaded with small shot    0 september monday   it is probable that they did not feel the shot for though they halted a moment they did not retreat and a third dart was thrown at us as we thought their farther approach might be prevented with less risk of life than it would cost to defend ourselves against their attack if they should come nearer we loaded our pieces with ball and fired a second time by this discharge it is probable that some of them were wounded yet we had the satisfaction to see that they all ran away with great agility as i was not disposed forcibly to invade this country either to gratify our appetites or our curiosity and perceived that nothing was to be done upon friendly terms we improved this interval in which the destruction of the natives was no longer necessary to our own defense and with all expedition returned toward our boat as we were advancing along the shore we perceived that the two men on board made signals that more indians were coming down and before we got into the water we saw several of them coming round a point at the distance of about five hundred yards it is probable that they had met with the three who first attacked us for as soon as they saw us they halted and seemed to wait till their main body should come up we entered the water and waded toward the boat and they remained at their station without giving us any interruption as soon as we were aboard we rowed abreast of them and their number then appeared to be between sixty and a hundred we now took a view of them at our leisure they made much the same appearance as the new hollanders being nearly of the same stature and having their hair short cropped like them also they were all stark naked but we thought the color of their skin was not quite so dark this however might perhaps be merely the effect of their not being quite so dirty all this while they were shouting defiance and letting off their fires by four or five at a time    0 september monday   what these fires were or for what purpose intended we could not imagine those who discharged them had in their hands a short piece of stick possibly a hollow cane which they swung sideways from them and we immediately saw fire and smoke exactly resembling those of a musket and of no longer duration this wonderful phenomenon was observed from the ship and the deception was so great that the people on board thought they had firearms and in the boat if we had not been so near as that we must have heard the report we should have thought they had been firing volleys after we had looked at them attentively some time without taking any notice of their flashing and vociferation we fired some muskets over their heads upon hearing the balls rattle among the trees they walked leisurely away and we returned to the ship upon examining the weapons they had thrown at us we found them to be light darts about four feet long very ill made of a reed or bamboo cane and pointed with hard wood in which there were many barbs they were discharged with great force for though we were at sixty yards distance they went beyond us but in what manner we could not exactly see possibly they might be shot with a bow but we saw no bows among them when we surveyed them from the boat and we were in general of opinion that they were thrown with a stick in the manner practiced by the new hollanders  this place lies in the latitude of      s and about sixtyfive leagues to the n e of port saint augustine or walche caep and is near what is called in the charts c de la colta de st bonaventura the land here like that in every other part of the coast is very low but covered with a luxuriance of wood and herbage that can scarcely be conceived we saw the cocoanut the breadfruit and the plantain tree    0 september monday   all flourishing in a state of the highest perfection though the cocoanuts were green and the breadfruit not in season besides most of the trees shrubs and plants that are common to the south sea islands new zealand and new holland  soon after our return to the ship we hoisted in the boat and made sail to the westward being resolved to spend no more time upon this coast to the great satisfaction of a very considerable majority of the ships company but i am sorry to say that i was strongly urged by some of the officers to send a party of men ashore and cut down the cocoanut trees for the sake of the fruit this i peremptorily refused as equally unjust and cruel the natives had attacked us merely for landing upon their coast when we attempted to take nothing away and it was therefore morally certain that they would have made a vigorous effort to defend their property if it had been invaded in which case many of them must have fallen a sacrifice to our attempt and perhaps also some of our own people i should have regretted the necessity of such a measure if i had been in want of the necessaries of life and certainly it would have been highly criminal when nothing was to be obtained but two or three hundred of green cocoanuts which would at most have procured us a mere transient gratification i might indeed have proceeded farther along the coast to the northward and westward in search of a place where the ship might have lain so near the shore as to cover the people with her guns when they landed but this would have obviated only part of the mischief and though it might have secured us it would probably in the very act have been fatal to the natives besides we had reason to think that before such a place would have been found    0 september monday   we should have been carried so far to the westward as to have been obliged to go to batavia on the north side of java which i did not think so safe a passage as to the south of java through the streights of sunday the ship also was so leaky that i doubted whether it would not be necessary to heave her down at batavia which was another reason for making the best of our way to that place especially as no discovery could be expected in seas which had already been navigated and where every coast had been laid down by the dutch geographers the spaniards indeed as well as the dutch seem to have circumnavigated all the islands in new guinea as almost every place that is distinguished in the chart has a name in both languages the charts with which i compared such part of this coast as i visited are bound up with a french work entitled histoire des navigationes aux terres australes which was published in      and i found them tolerably exact yet i know not by whom nor when they were taken and though new holland and new guinea are in them represented as two distinct countries the very history in which they are bound up leaves it in doubt i pretend however to no more merit in this part of the voyage than to have established the fact beyond all controversy  as the two countries lie very near each other and the intermediate space is full of islands it is reasonable to suppose that they were both peopled from one common stock yet no intercourse appears to have been kept up between them for if there had the cocoanuts breadfruit plantains and other fruits of new guinea which are equally necessary for the support of life would certainly have been transplanted to new holland where no traces of them are to be found the author of the histoire des navigationes aux terres australes in his account of la maires voyage    0 september monday   has given a vocabulary of the language that is spoken in an island near new britain and we find by comparing that vocabulary with the words which we learnt in new holland that the languages are not the same if therefore it should appear that the languages of new britain and new guinea are the same there will be reason to suppose that new britain and new guinea were peopled from a common stock but that the inhabitants of new holland had a different origin notwithstanding the proximity of the countries  chap x the passage from new guinea to the island of savu and the transactions there    0 september tuesday   we made sail from noon on monday the  d to

were in latitude      s longitude        w having been in soundings the whole time from ten to twenty fathom  thursday   at half an hour after one in the morning of the next day we passed a small island which bore from us n n w distant between three and four miles and at daylight we discovered another low island extending from nnw to nne distant about two or three leagues upon this island which did not appear to be very small i believe i should have landed to examine its produce if the wind had not blown too fresh to admit of it when we passed this island we had only ten fathom water with a rocky bottom and therefore i was afraid of running down to leeward lest i should meet with shoal water and foul ground these islands have no place in the charts except they are the arrou islands and if these they are laid down much too far from new guinea    0 september thursday   i found the south part of them to lie in latitude     s longitude     w  we continued to steer w s w at the rate of four miles and an half an hour till ten oclock at night when we had fortytwo fathom at eleven we had thirtyseven at twelve fortyfive at one in the morning fortynine and at three   0 after which we had no ground at daylight we made all the sail we could and at ten oclock saw land extending from n n w to w by n distant between five and six leagues at noon it bore from n to w and at about the same distance it appeared to be level and of a moderate height by our distance from new guinea it ought to have been part of the arrou islands but it lies a degree farther to the south than any of these islands are laid down in the charts and by the latitude should be timor laoet we sounded but had no ground with fifty fathom  as i was not able to satisfy myself from any chart what land it was that i saw to leeward and fearing that it might trend away more southerly the weather also being so hazy that we could not see far i steered s w and by four had lost sight of the island i was now sure that no part of it lay to the southward of      s and continued standing to the s w with an easy sail and a fresh breeze at s e by e and e s e we sounded every hour but had no bottom with   0 fathom  at daybreak in the morning friday   we steered w s w and afterward w by s which by noon brought us into the latitude of    0 s longitude        w and by our run from new guinea we ought to have been within sight of weasel isles which in the charts are laid down at the distance of twenty or twentyfive leagues from the coast of new holland we however saw nothing    0 september friday   and therefore they must have been placed erroneously nor can this be thought strange when it is considered that not only these islands but the coast which bounds this sea have been discovered and explored by different people and at different times and the charts upon which they are delineated put together by others perhaps at the distance of more than a century after the discoveries had been made not to mention that the discoverers themselves had not all the requisites for keeping an accurate journal of which those of the present age are possessed  saturday   we continued our course steering w till the evening of the  th when the variation of the compass by several azimuths was    w and by the amplitude   w at noon on the  th sunday   our latitude by observation was      s longitude       w for the last two days we had steered due w yet by observation we made sixteen miles southing six miles from noon on the  th to noon on the  th and ten miles from noon on the  th to noon on the  th by which it appeared that there was a current setting to the southward at sunset we found the variation to be   w and at the same time saw an appearance of very high land bearing n w  monday  0 in the morning of the  0th we saw clearly that what had appeared to be land the night before was timor at noon our latitude by observation was  0   s which was fifteen miles to the southward of that given by the log our longitude by observation was        w we steered n w in order to obtain a more distinct view of the land in sight till four oclock in the morning of the   th tuesday    when the wind came to the n w and w with which we stood to the southward till nine when we tacked and stood n w having the wind now at w s w at sunrise the land had appeared to extend from w n w to n e and at noon we could see it extend to the westward as far as w by s s but no farther to the eastward than n by e we were now well assured    0 september tuesday    that as the first land we had seen was timor the last island we had passed was timor laoet or laut laoet is a word in the language of malaca signifying sea and this island was named by the inhabitants of that country the south part of it lies in latitude      s longitude      0 w but in the charts the south point is laid down in various latitudes from    0 to    0 it is indeed possible that the land we saw might be some other island but the presumption to the contrary is very strong for if timor laut had lain where it is placed in the charts we must have seen it there we were now in latitude      s longitude by an observation of the sun and moon        w we were the day before in        the difference is    exactly the same that was given by the log this however is a degree of accuracy in observation that is seldom to be expected in the afternoon we stood in shore till eight in the evening when we tacked and stood off being at the distance of about three leagues from the land which at sunset extended from s w w to n e at this time we sounded and had no ground with   0 fathom at midnight having but little wind wednes    we tacked and stood in and at noon the next day our latitude by observation was      s this day we saw smoke on shore in several places and had seen many fires during the night the land appeared to be very high rising in gradual slopes one above another the hills were in general covered with thick woods but among them we could distinguish naked spots of a considerable extent which had the appearance of having been cleared by art at five oclock in the afternoon we were within a mile and a half of the shore in sixteen fathom water and abreast of a small inlet into the low land which lies in latitude     s and probably is the same that dampier entered with his boat    0 september wednes    for it did not seem to have sufficient depth of water for a ship the land here answered well to the description that he has given of it close to the beach it was covered with high spiry trees which he mentions as having the appearance of pines behind these there seemed to be salt water creeks and many mangroves interspersed however with cocoanut trees the flat land at the beach appeared in some places to extend inward two or three miles before the rise of the first hill in this part however we saw no appearance of plantations or houses but great fertility and from the number of fires we judged that the place must be well peopled  when we had approached within a mile and an half of the shore we tacked and stood off and the extremes of the coast then extended from n e by e to w by s s the south westerly extremity was a low point distant from us about three leagues while we were standing in for the shore we sounded several times but had no ground till we came within about two miles and a half and then we had five and twenty fathom with a soft bottom after we had tacked we stood off till midnight with the wind at s we then tacked and stood two hours to the westward when the wind veered to s w and w s w and we then stood to the southward again thursday    in the morning we found the variation to be    0 w by the amplitude and by the azimuth      at noon our latitude was by observation      s our longitude       w we were then about seven leagues distant from the land which extended from n    e to w s w w  with light land breezes from w by n for a few hours in a morning and sea breezes from s s w and s we advanced to the westward but slowly friday    at noon on the   th we were between six and seven leagues from the land which extended from n by e to s    w    0 september friday    we still saw smoke in many places by day and sire by night both upon the low land and the mountains beyond it we continued steering along the shore till the morning of the   th saturday    the land still appearing hilly but not so high as it had been the hills in general came quite down to the sea and where they did not we saw instead of flats and mangrove land immense groves of cocoanut trees reaching about a mile up from the beach there the plantations and houses commenced and appeared to be innumerable the houses were shaded by groves of the fan palm or borassus and the plantations which were enclosed by a fence reached almost to the tops of the highest hills we saw however neither people nor cattle though our glasses were continually employed at which we were not a little surprised  we continued our course with little variation till nine oclock in the morning of the   th sunday    when we saw the small island called rotte and at noon the island semau lying off the south end of timor bore n w  dampier who has given a large description of the island of timor says that it is seventy leagues long and sixteen broad and that it lies nearly n e and s w i found the east side of it to lie nearest n e by e and s w by w and the south end to lie in latitude  0    s longitude       w we ran about fortyfive leagues along the east side and found the navigation altogether free from danger the land which is bounded by the sea except near the south end is low for two or three miles within the beach and in general intersected by salt creeks behind the low land are mountains which rise one above another to a considerable height we steered w n w till two in the afternoon when being within a small distance of the north end of rotte we hauled up n n w in order to go between it and semau    0 september sunday    after steering three leagues upon this course we edged away n w and w and by six we were clear of all the islands at this time the south part of semau which lies in latitude  0    s bore n e distant four leagues and the island of rotte extended as far to the southward as s    w the north end of this island and the south end of timor lie n e and s w and are about three or four leagues distant from each other at the west end of the passage between rotte and semau are two small islands one of which lies near the rotte shore and the other off the south west point of semau there is a good channel between them about six miles broad through which we passed the isle of rotte has not so lofty and mountainous an appearance as timor though it is agreeably diversified by hill and valley on the north side there are many sandy beaches near which grew some trees of the fan palm but the far greater part was covered with a kind of brushy wood that was without leaves the appearance of semau was nearly the same with that of timor but not quite so high about ten oclock at night we observed a phenomenon in the heavens which in many particulars resembled the aurora borealis and in others was very different it consisted of a dull reddish light and reached about twenty degrees above the horizon its extent was very different at different times but it was never less than eight or ten points of the compass through and out of this passed rays of light of a brighter color which vanished and were renewed nearly in the same time as those of the aurora borealis but had no degree of the tremulous or vibratory motion which is observed in that phenomenon the body of it bore s s e from the ship and it continued without any diminution of its brightness till twelve oclock when we retired to sleep but how long afterward    0 september i cannot tell  being clear of all the islands monday    which are laid down in the maps we had on board between timor and java we steered a west course till six oclock the next morning when we unexpectedly saw an island bearing w s w and at first i thought we had made a new discovery we steered directly for it and by ten oclock were close in with the north side of it where we saw houses cocoanut trees and to our very agreeable surprise numerous flocks of sheep this was a temptation not to be resisted by people in our situation especially as many of us were in a bad state of health and many still repining at my not having touched at timor it was therefore soon determined to attempt a commerce with people who appeared to be so well able to supply our many necessities and remove at once the sickness and discontent that had got footing among us the pinnace was hoisted out and mr gore the second lieutenant sent to see if there was any convenient place to land taking with him some trifles as presents to the natives if any of them should appear while he was gone we saw from the ship two men on horseback who seemed to be riding upon the hills for their amusement and often stopped to look at the ship by this we knew that the place had been settled by europeans and hoped that the many disagreeable circumstances which always attend the first establishment of commerce with savages would be avoided in the mean time mr gore landed in a small sandy cove near some houses and was met by eight or ten of the natives who as well in their dress as their persons very much resembled the malays they were without arms except the knives which it is their custom to wear in their girdles and one of them had a jack ass with him they courteously invited him ashore and conversed with him by signs    0 september monday    but very little of the meaning of either party could be understood by the other in a short time he returned with this report and to our great mortification added that there was no anchorage for the ship i sent him however a second time with both money and goods that he might if possible purchase some refreshments at least for the sick and dr solander went in the boat with him in the mean time i kept standing on and off with the ship which at this time was within about a mile of the shore before the boat could land we saw two other horsemen one of whom was in a complete european dress consisting of a blue coat a white waistcoat and a laced hat these people when the boat came to the shore took little notice of her but sauntered about and seemed to look with great curiosity at the ship we saw however other horsemen and a great number of persons on foot gather round our people and to our great satisfaction perceived several cocoanuts carried into the boat from which we concluded that peace and commerce were established between us  after the boat had been ashore about an hour and a half she made the signal for having intelligence that there was a bay to leeward where we might anchor we stood away directly for it and the boat following soon came on board the lieutenant told us that he had seen some of the principal people who were dressed in fine linen and had chains of gold round their necks he said that he had not been able to trade because the owner of the cocoanuts was absent but that about two dozen had been sent to the boat as a present and that some linen had been accepted in return the people to give him the information that he wanted drew a map upon the sand in which they made a rude representation of a harbor to leeward and a town near it they also gave him to understand that sheep hogs fowls and fruit might there be procured in great plenty    0 september monday    some of them frequently pronounced the word portuguese and said something of larntuca upon the island of end from this circumstance we conjectured that there were portuguese somewhere upon the island and a portuguese who was in our boat attempted to converse with the indians in that language but soon found that they knew only a word or two of it by rote one of them however when they were giving our people to understand that there was a town near the harbor to which they had directed us intimated that as a token of going right we should see somewhat which he expressed by crossing his fingers and the portuguese instantly conceived that he meant to express a cross just as our people were putting off the horseman in the european dress came up but the officer not having his commission about him thought it best to decline a conference  at seven oclock in the evening we came to an anchor in the bay to which we had been directed at about the distance of a mile from the shore in thirtyeight fathom water with a clear sandy bottom the north point of the bay bore n  0 e distant two miles and an half and the south point or west end of the island bore s    w just as we got round the north point and entered the bay we discovered a large indian town or village upon which we stood on hoisting a jack on the fore topmast head soon after to our great surprise dutch colors were hoisted in the town and three guns fired we stood on however till we had soundings and then anchored  as soon as it was light in the morning tuesday    we saw the same colors hoisted upon the beach abreast of the ship supposing therefore that the dutch had a settlement here i sent lieutenant gore ashore to wait upon the governor or the chief person residing upon the spot    0 september tuesday    and acquaint him who we were and for what purpose we had touched upon the coast as soon as he came ashore he was received by a guard of between twenty and thirty indians armed with muskets who conducted him to the town where the colors had been hoisted the night before carrying with them those that had been hoisted upon the beach and marching without any military regularity as soon as he arrived he was introduced to the raja or king of the island and by a portuguese interpreter told him that the ship was a man of war belonging to the king of great britain and that she had many sick on board for whom he wanted to purchase such refreshments as the island afforded his majesty replied that he was willing to supply us with whatever we wanted but that being in alliance with the dutch east india company he was not at liberty to trade with any other people without having first procured their consent for which however he said he would immediately apply to a dutchman who belonged to the company and who was the only white man upon the island to this man who resided at some distance a letter was immediately dispatched acquainting him with our arrival and request in the mean time mr gore dispatched a messenger to me with an account of his situation and the state of the treaty in about three hours the dutch resident answered the letter that had been sent him in person he proved to be a native of saxony and his name is johan christopher lange and the same person whom we had seen on horseback in a european dress he behaved with great civility to mr gore and assured him that we were at liberty to purchase of the natives whatever we pleased after a short time he expressed a desire of coming on board so did the king also and several of his attendants mr gore intimated that he was ready to attend them but they desired that two of our people might be left ashore as hostages and in this also they were indulged    0 september tuesday      about two oclock they all came aboard the ship and our dinner being ready they accepted our invitation to partake of it i expected them immediately to sit down but the king seemed to hesitate and at last with some confusion said he did not imagine that we who were white men would suffer him who was of a different color to sit down in our company a compliment soon removed his scruples and we all sat down together with great cheerfulness and cordiality happily we were at no loss for interpreters both dr solander and mr sporing understanding dutch enough to keep up a conversation with mr lange and several of the seamen were able to converse with such of the natives as spoke portuguese our dinner happened to be mutton and the king expressed a desire of having an english sheep we had but one left however that was presented to him the facility with which this was procured encouraged him to ask for an english dog and mr banks politely gave up his greyhound mr lange then intimated that a spyingglass would be acceptable and one was immediately put into his hand our guests then told us that the island abounded with buffaloes sheep hogs and fowls plenty of which should be driven down to the beach the next day that we might purchase as many of them as we should think fit this put us all into high spirits and the liquor circulated rather faster than either the indians or the saxon could bear they intimated their desire to go away however before they were quite drunk and were received upon deck as they had been when they came aboard by the marines under arms the king expressed a curiosity to see them exercise in which he was gratified and they sired three rounds he looked at them with great attention and was much surprised at their regularity and expedition    0 september tuesday    especially in cocking their pieces the first time they did it he struck the side of the ship with a stick that he had in his hand and cried out with great vehemence that all the locks made but one click they were dismissed with many presents and when they went away saluted with nine guns mr banks and dr solander went ashore with them and as soon as they put off they gave us three cheers  our gentlemen when they came ashore walked up with them to the town which consists of many houses and some of them are large they are however nothing more than a thatched roof supported over a boarded floor by pillars about four feet high they produced some of their palmwine which was the fresh unfermented juice of the tree it had a sweet but not a disagreeable taste and hopes were conceived that it might contribute to recover our sick from the scurvy soon after it was dark mr banks and dr solander returned on board  wednes    in the morning of the   th i went ashore with mr banks and several of the officers and gentlemen to return the kings visit but my chief business was to procure some of the buffaloes sheep and fowls which we had been told should be driven down to the beach we were greatly mortified to find that no steps had been taken to fulfill this promise however we proceeded to the house of assembly which with two or three more had been erected by the dutch east india company and are distinguished from the rest by two pieces of wood resembling a pair of cows horns one of which is set up at each end of the ridge that terminates the roof and these were certainly what the indian intended to represent by crossing his fingers though our portuguese who was a good catholic construed the sign into a cross    0 september wednes    which had persuaded us that the settlement belonged to his countrymen in this place we met mr lange and the king whose name was a madocho lomi djara attended by many of the principal people we told them that we had in the boat goods of various kinds which we proposed to barter for such refreshments as they would give us in exchange and desired leave to bring them on shore which being granted they were brought ashore accordingly we then attempted to settle the price of the buffaloes sheep hogs and other commodities which we proposed to purchase and for which we were to pay in money but as soon as this was mentioned mr lange left us telling us that these preliminaries must be settled with the natives he said however that he had received a letter from the governor of concordia in timor the purport of which he would communicate to us when he returned  as the morning was now far advanced and we were very unwilling to return on board and eat salt provisions when so many delicacies surrounded us ashore we petitioned his majesty for liberty to purchase a small hog and some rice and to employ his subjects to dress them for us he answered very graciously that if we could eat victuals dressed by his subjects which he could scarcely suppose he would do himself the honor of entertaining us we expressed our gratitude and immediately sent on board for liquors  about five oclock dinner was ready it was served in six and thirty dishes or rather baskets containing alternately rice and pork and three bowls of earthen ware filled with the liquor in which the pork had been boiled these were ranged upon the floor and mats laid round them for us to sit upon we were then conducted by turns to a hole in the floor near which stood a man with water in a vessel made of the leaves of the fanpalm    0 september wednes    who assisted us in washing our hands when this was done we placed ourselves round the victuals and waited for the king as he did not come we enquired for him and were told that the custom of the country did not permit the person who gave the entertainment to sit down with his guests but that if we suspected the victuals to be poisoned he would come and taste it we immediately declared that we had no such suspicion and desired that none of the rituals of hospitality might be violated on our account the prime minister and mr lange were of our party and we made a most luxurious meal we thought the pork and rice excellent and the broth not to be despised but the spoons which were made of leaves were so small that few of us had patience to use them after dinner our wine passed briskly about and we again enquired for our royal host thinking that though the custom of his country would not allow him to eat with us he might at least share in the jollity of our bottle but he again excused himself saying that the master of a feast should never be drunk which there was no certain way to avoid but by not tasting the liquor we did not however drink our wine where we had eaten our victuals but as soon as we had dined made room for the seamen and servants who immediately took our places they could not dispatch all that we had left but the women who came to clear away the bowls and baskets obliged them to carry away with them what they had not eaten as wine generally warms and opens the heart we took an opportunity when we thought its influence began to be felt to revive the subject of the buffaloes and sheep of which we had not in all this time heard a syllable though they were to have been brought down early in the morning but our saxon dutchman with great phlegm began to communicate to us the contents of the letter which he pretended to have received from the governor of concordia he said    0 september wednes    that after acquainting him that a vessel had steered from thence toward the island where we were now ashore it required him if such ship should apply for provisions in distress to relieve her but not to suffer her to stay longer than was absolutely necessary nor to make any large presents to the inferior people or to leave any with those of superior rank to be afterward distributed among them but he was graciously pleased to add that we were at liberty to give beads and other trifles in exchange for petty civilities and palmwine  it was the general opinion that this letter was a fiction that the prohibitory orders were feigned with a view to get money from us for breaking them and that by precluding our liberality to the natives this man hoped more easily to turn it into another channel  in the evening we received intelligence from our tradingplace that no buffaloes or hogs had been brought down and only a few sheep which had been taken away before our people who had sent for money could procure it some fowls however had been bought and a large quantity of a kind of syrup made of the juice of the palm tree which though infinitely superior to molasses or treacle sold at a very low price we complained of our disappointment to mr lange who had now another subterfuge he said that if we had gone down to the beach ourselves we might have purchased what we pleased but that the natives were afraid to take money of our people lest it should be counterfeit we could not but feel some indignation against a man who had concealed this being true or alleged it being false i started up however and went immediately to the beach but no cattle or sheep were to be seen nor were any at hand to be produced    0 september wednes    while i was gone lange who knew well enough that i should succeed no better than my people told mr banks that the natives were displeased at our not having offered them gold for their stock and that if gold was not offered nothing would be bought mr banks did not think it worth his while to reply but soon after rose up and we all returned on board very much dissatisfied with the issue of our negociations during the course of the day the king had promised that some cattle and sheep should be brought down in the morning and had given a reason for our disappointment somewhat more plausible he said that the buffaloes were far up the country and that there had not been time to bring them down to the beach  thursday  0 the next morning we went ashore again dr solander went up to the town to speak to lange and i remained upon the beach to see what could be done in the purchase of provisions i found here an old indian who as he appeared to have some authority we had among ourselves called the prime minister to engage this man in our interest i presented him with a spyingglass but i saw nothing at market except one small buffalo i enquired the price of it and was told five guineas this was twice as much as it was worth however i offered three which i could perceive the man who treated with me thought a good price but he said that he must acquaint the king with what i had offered before he could take it a messenger was immediately dispatched to his majesty who soon returned and said that the buffalo would not be sold for any thing less than five guineas this price i absolutely refused to give and another messenger was sent away with an account of my refusal this messenger was longer absent than the other and while i was waiting for his return i saw to my great astonishment dr solander coming from the town    0 september thursday  0 followed by above a hundred men some armed with muskets and some with lances when i enquired the meaning of this hostile appearance the doctor told me that mr lange had interpreted to him a message from the king purporting that the people would not trade with us because we had refused to give them more than half the value of what they had to sell and that we should not be permitted to trade upon any terms longer than this day besides the officers who commanded the party there came with it a man who was born at timor of portuguese parents and who as we afterward discovered was a kind of colleague to the dutch factor by this man what they pretended to be the kings order was delivered to me of the same purport with that which dr solander had received from lange we were all clearly of opinion that this was a mere artifice of the factors to extort money from us for which we had been prepared by the account of a letter from concordia and while we were hesitating what step to take the portuguese that he might the sooner accomplish his purpose began to drive away the people who had brought down poultry and syrup and others that were now coming in with buffaloes and sheep at this time i glanced my eye upon the old man whom i had complimented in the morning with the spyingglass and i thought by his looks that he did not heartily approve of what was doing i therefore took him by the hand and presented him with an old broad sword this instantly turned the scale in our favor he received the sword with a transport of joy and flourishing it over the busy portuguese who crouched like a fox to a lion he made him and the officer who commanded the party sit down upon the ground behind him the people who whatever were the crafty pretenses of these iniquitous factors for a dutch company were eager to supply us with whatever we wanted    0 september thursday  0 and seemed also to be more desirous of goods than money instantly improved the advantage that had been procured them and the market was stocked almost in an instant to establish a trade for buffaloes however which i most wanted i found it necessary to give ten guineas for two one of which weighed no more than a hundred and sixty pounds but i bought seven more much cheaper and might afterward have purchased as many as i pleased almost upon my own terms for they were now driven down to the waterside in herds in the first two that i bought so dear lange had certainly a share and it was in hopes to obtain part of the price of others that he had pretended we must pay for them in gold the natives however sold what they afterward brought down much to their satisfaction without paying part of the price to him as a reward for exacting money from us most of the buffaloes that we bought after our friend the prime minister had procured us a fair market were sold for a musket apiece and at this price we might have bought as many as would have freighted our ship  the refreshments which we procured here consisted of nine buffaloes six sheep three hogs thirty dozen of fowls a few limes and some cocoanuts many dozen of eggs half of which however proved to be rotten a little garlic and several hundred gallons of palmsyrup  chap xi a particular description of the island of savu its produce and inhabitants with a specimen of their language this island is called by the natives savu    0 september the middle of it lies in about the latitude  0    s longitude      0 w and has in general been so little known that i never saw a map or chart in which it is clearly or accurately laid down i have seen a very old one in which it is called sou and confounded with sandel bosch rumphius mentions an island by the name of saow and he also says that it is the same which the dutch call sandel bosch but neither is this island nor timor nor rotte nor indeed any one of the islands that we have seen in these seas placed within a reasonable distance of its true situation it is about eight leagues long from east to west but what is its breadth i do not know as i saw only the north side the harbor in which we lay is called seba from the district in which it lies it is on the north west side of the island and well sheltered from the south west trade wind but it lies open to the north west we were told that there were two other bays where ships might anchor that the best called timo was on the south west side of the south east point of the third we learnt neither the name nor situation the seacoast in general is low but in the middle of the island there are hills of a considerable height we were upon the coast at the latter end of the dry season when there had been no rain for seven months and we were told that when the dry season continues so long    0 september there is no running stream of fresh water upon the whole island but only small springs which are at a considerable distance from the seaside yet nothing can be imagined so beautiful as the prospect of the country from the ship the level ground next to the seaside was covered with cocoanut trees and a kind of palm called arecas and beyond them the hills which rose in a gentle and regular ascent were richly clothed quite to the summit with plantations of the fanpalm forming an almost impenetrable grove how much even this prospect must be improved when every foot of ground between the trees is covered with verdure by maize and millet and indico can scarcely be conceived but by a powerful imagination not unacquainted with the stateliness and beauty of the trees that adorn this part of the earth the dry season commences in march or april and ends in october or november  the principal trees of this island are the fanpalm the cocoanut tamarind limes oranges and mangoes the other vegetable productions are maize guinea corn rice millet callevances and watermelons we saw also one sugarcane and a few kinds of european gardenstuff particularly cellery marjoram fennel and garlic for the supply of luxury it has betele areca tobacco cotton indico and a small quantity of cinnamon which seems to be planted here only for curiosity and indeed we doubted whether it was the genuine plant knowing that the dutch are very careful not to trust the spices out of their proper islands there are however several kinds of fruit besides those which have been already mentioned particularly the sweet sop which is well known to the west indians and a small oval fruit called the blimbi both of which grow upon trees the blimbi is about three or four inches long and in the middle about as thick as a mans finger    0 september tapering toward each end it is covered with a very thin skin of a light green color and in the inside are a few feeds disposed in the form of a star its flavor is a light clean pleasant acid but it cannot be eaten raw it is said to be excellent as a pickle and stewed it made a most agreeable sour sauce to our boiled dishes  the tame animals are buffaloes sheep goats hogs fowls pigeons horses asses dogs and cats and of all these there is great plenty the buffaloes differ very considerably from the horned cattle of europe in several particulars their ears are much larger their skins are almost without hair their horns are curved toward each other but together bend directly backwards and they have no dewlaps we saw several that were as big as a well grown european ox and there must be some much larger for mr banks saw a pair of horns which measured from tip to tip three feet nine inches and an half across their widest diameter four feet one inch and an half and in the whole sweep of their semicircle in front seven feet six inches and a half it must however be observed that a buffalo here of any given size does not weigh above half as much as an ox of the same size in england those that we guessed to weigh four hundred weight did not weigh more than two hundred and fifty the reason is that so late in the dry season the bones are very thinly covered with flesh there is not an ounce of fat in a whole carcass and the flanks are literally nothing but skin and bone the flesh however is well tasted and juicy and i suppose better than the flesh of an english ox would be if he was to starve in this sunburned country  the horses are from eleven to twelve hands high but though they are small they are spirited and nimble especially in pacing    0 september which is their common step the inhabitants generally ride them without a saddle and with no better bridle than a halter the sheep are of the kind which in england are called bengal sheep and differ from ours in many particulars they are covered with hair instead of wool their ears are very large and hang down under their horns and their noses are arched they are thought to have a general resemblance to a goat and for that reason are frequently called cabritos their flesh we thought the worst mutton we had ever eaten being as lean as that of the buffalos and without flavor the hogs however were some of the fattest we had ever seen though as we were told their principal food is the outside husks of rice and the palm syrup dissolved in water the fowls are chiefly of the game breed and large but the eggs are remarkably small  of the fish which the sea produces here we know but little turtles are sometimes found upon the coast and are by these people as well as all others considered as a dainty  the people are rather under than over the middling size the women especially are remarkably short and squat built their complexion is a dark brown and their hair universally black and lank we saw no difference in the color of rich and poor though in the south sea islands those that were exposed to the weather were almost as brown as the new hollanders and the better sort nearly as fair as the natives of europe the men are in general wellmade vigorous and active and have a greater variety in the make and disposition of their features than usual the countenances of the women on the contrary are all alike  the men fasten their hair up to the top of their heads with a comb the women tie it behind in a club which is very far from becoming    0 september both sexes eradicate the hair from under the arm and the men do the same by their beards for which purpose the better sort always carry a pair of silver pincers hanging by a string round their necks some however suffer a very little hair to remain upon their upper lips but this is always kept short  the dress of both sexes consists of cotton cloth which being died blue in the yarn and not uniformly of the same shade is in clouds or waves of that color and even in our eye had not an inelegant appearance this cloth they manufacture themselves and two pieces each about two yards long and a yard and a half wide make a dress one of them is worn round the middle and the other covers the upper part of the body the lower edge of the piece that goes round the middle the men draw pretty tight just below the fork the upper edge of it is left loose so as to form a kind of hollow belt which serves them as a pocket to carry their knives and other little implements which it is convenient to have about them the other piece of cloth is passed through this girdle behind and one end of it being brought over the left shoulder and the other over the right they fall down over the breast and are tucked into the girdle before so that by opening or closing the plaits they can cover more or less of their bodies as they please the arms legs and feet are always naked the difference between the dress of the two sexes consists principally in the manner of wearing the waistpiece for the women instead of drawing the lower edge tight and leaving the upper edge loose for a pocket draw the upper edge tight and let the lower edge fall as low as the knees so as to form a petticoat the bodypiece instead of being passed through the girdle is fastened under the arms and cross the breast with the utmost decency i have already observed that the men fasten the hair upon the top of the head    0 september and the women tie it in a club behind but there is another difference in the headdress by which the sexes are distinguished the women wear nothing as a succedaneum for a cap but the men constantly wrap something round their heads in the manner of a fillet it is small but generally of the finest materials that can be procured we saw some who applied silk handkerchiefs to this purpose and others that wore fine cotton or muslin in the manner of a small turban  these people bore their testimony that the love of finery is a universal passion for their ornaments were very numerous some of the better sort wore chains of gold round their necks but they were made of plaited wire and consequently were light and of little value others had rings which were so much worn that they seemed to have descended through many generations and one person had a silverheaded cane marked with a kind of cipher consisting of the roman letters v o c and therefore probably a present from the dutch east india company whose mark it is they have also ornaments made of beads which some wear round their necks as a solitaire and others as bracelets upon their wrists these are common to both sexes but the women have besides strings or girdles of beads which they wear round their waists and which serve to keep up their petticoat both sexes had their ears bored nor was there a single exception that fell under our notice yet we never saw an ornament in any of them we never indeed saw either man or woman in any thing but what appeared to be their ordinary dress except the king and his minister who in general wore a kind of nightgown of coarse chintz and one of whom once received us in a black robe which appeared to be made of what is called princes stuff we saw some boys about twelve or fourteen years old who had spiral circles of thick brass wire passed three or four times round their arms above the elbow    0 september and some men wore rings of ivory two inches in breadth and above an inch in thickness upon the same part of the arm these we were told were the sons of the rajas or chiefs who wore these cumbrous ornaments as badges of their high birth  almost all the men had their names traced upon their arms in indelible characters of a black color and the women had a square ornament of flourished lines impressed in the same manner just under the bend of the elbow we were struck with the similitude between these marks and those made by tattowing in the south sea islands and upon enquiring into its origin we learnt that it had been practiced by the natives long before any europeans came among them and that in the neighboring islands the inhabitants were marked with circles upon their necks and breasts the universality of this practice which prevails among savages in all parts of the world from the remotest limits of north america to the islands in the south seas and which probably differs but little from the method of staining the body that was in use among the ancient inhabitants of britain is a curious subject of speculation in the account which mr bossu has given of some indians who inhabit the banks of the akanza a river of north america which rises in new mexico and falls into the mississippi he relates the following incident the akanzas says he have adopted me and as a mark of my privilege have imprinted the figure of a roebuck upon my thigh which was done in this manner an indian having burnt some straw diluted the ashes with water and with this mixture drew the figure upon my skin he then retraced it by pricking the lines with needles so as at every puncture just to draw the blood and the blood mixing with the ashes of the straw forms a figure which can never be effaced see travels through louisiana vol i p  0    the houses of savu are all built upon the same plan and differ only in size being large in proportion to the rank and riches of the proprietor    0 september some are four hundred feet long and some are not more than twenty they are all raised upon posts or piles about four feet high one end of which is driven into the ground and upon the other end is laid a substantial floor of wood so that there is a vacant space of four feet between the floor of the house and the ground upon this floor are placed other posts or pillars that support a roof of sloping sides which meet in a ridge at the top like those of our barns the eaves of this roof which is thatched with palm leaves reach within two feet of the floor and overhang it as much the space within is generally divided lengthwise into three equal parts the middle part or center is enclosed by a partition of four sides reaching about six feet above the floor and one or two small rooms are also sometimes taken off from the sides the rest of the space under the roof is open so as freely to admit the air and the light the particular uses of these different apartments our short stay would not permit us to learn except that the close room in the center was appropriated to the women  the food of these people consists of every tame animal in the country of which the hog holds the first place in their estimation and the horse the second next to the horse is the buffalo next to the buffalo their poultry and they prefer dogs and cats to sheep and goats they are not fond of fish and i believe it is never eaten but by the poor people nor by them except when their duty or business requires them to be upon the beach and then every man is furnished with a light casting net which is girt round him and makes part of his dress and with this he takes any small fish which happen to come in his way  the aesculent vegetables and fruits have been mentioned already but the fanpalm requires more particular notice for at certain times it is a succedaneum for all other food both to man and beast a kind of wine called toddy    0 september is procured from this tree by cutting the buds which are to produce flowers soon after their appearance and tying under them small baskets made of the leaves which are so close as to hold liquids without leaking the juice which trickles into these vessels is collected by persons who climb the trees for that purpose morning and evening and is the common drink of every individual upon the island yet a much greater quantity is drawn off than is consumed in this use and of the surplus they make both a syrup and coarse sugar the liquor is called dua or duac and both the syrup and sugar gula the syrup is prepared by boiling the liquor down in pots of earthen ware till it is sufficiently inspissated it is not unlike treacle in appearance but is somewhat thicker and has a much more agreeable taste the sugar is of a reddish brown perhaps the same with the jugata sugar upon the continent of india and it was more agreeable to our palates than any cane sugar unrefined that we had ever tasted we were at first afraid that the syrup of which some of our people eat very great quantities would have brought on fluxes but its aperient quality was so very slight that what effect it produced was rather salutary than hurtful i have already observed that it is given with the husks of rice to the hogs and that they grow enormously fat without taking any other food we were told also that this syrup is used to fatten their dogs and their fowls and that the inhabitants themselves have subsisted upon this alone for several months when other crops have failed and animal food has been scarce the leaves of this tree are also put to various uses they thatch houses and make baskets cups umbrellas and tobaccopipes the fruit is least esteemed and as the blossoms are wounded for the tuac or toddy there is not much of it    0 september it is about as big as a large turnip and covered like the cocoanut with a fibrous coat under which are three kernels that must be eaten before they are ripe for afterward they become so hard that they cannot be chewed in their eatable state they taste not unlike a green cocoanut and like them probably they yield a nutriment that is watery and unsubstantial  the common method of dressing food here is by boiling and as firewood is very scarce and the inhabitants have no other fuel they make use of a contrivance to save it that is not wholly unknown in europe but is seldom practiced except in camps they dig a hollow under ground in a horizontal direction like a rabbit burrow about two yards long and opening into a hole at each end one of which is large and the other small by the large hole the fire is put in and the small one serves for a draught the earth over this burrow is perforated by circular holes which communicate with the cavity below and in these holes are set earthen pots generally about three to each fire which are large in the middle and taper toward the bottom so that the fire acts upon a large part of their surface each of these pots generally contains about eight or ten gallons and it is surprising to see with how small a quantity of sire they may be kept boiling a palm leaf or a dry stalk thrust in now and then is sufficient in this manner they boil all their victuals and make all their syrup and sugar it appears by fraziers account of his voyage to the south sea that the peruvian indians have a contrivance of the same kind and perhaps it might be adopted with advantage by the poor people even of this country where fuel is very dear  both sexes are enslaved by the hateful and pernicious habit of chewing beetle and areca which they contract even while they are children    0 september and practice incessantly from morning till night with these they always mix a kind of white lime made of coral stone and shells and frequently a small quantity of tobacco so that their mouths are disgustful in the highest degree both to the smell and the fight the tobacco taints their breath and the beetle and lime make the teeth not only as black as charcoal but as rotten too i have seen men between twenty and thirty whose fore teeth have been consumed almost down to the gums though no two of them were exactly of the same length or thickness but irregularly corroded like iron by rust this loss of teeth is i think by all who have written upon the subject imputed to the tough and stringy coat of the areca nut but i impute it wholly to the lime they are not loosened or broken or forced out as might be expected if they were injured by the continual chewing of hard and rough substances but they are gradually wasted like metals that are exposed to the action of powerful acids the stumps always adhering firmly to the socket in the jaw when there is no part of the tooth above the gums and possibly those who suppose that sugar has a bad effect upon the teeth of europeans may not be mistaken for it is well known that refined loaf sugar contains a considerable quantity of lime and he that doubts whether lime will destroy bone of any kind may easily ascertain the fact by experiment  if the people here are at any time without this odious mouthful they are smoking this operation they perform by rolling up a small quantity of tobacco and putting it into one end of a tube about six inches long and as thick as a goose quill which they make of a palm leaf as the quantity of tobacco in these pipes is very small the effect of it is increased especially among the women by swallowing the smoke     0 september when the natives of this island were first formed into a civil society is not certainly known but at present it is divided into five principalities or nigrees laai seba regeeua timo and massara each of which is governed by its respective raja or king the raja of seba the principality in which we were ashore seemed to have great authority without much external parade or show or much appearance of personal respect he was about five and thirty years of age and the fattest man we saw upon the whole island he appeared to be of a dull phlegmatic disposition and to be directed almost implicitly by the old man who upon my presenting him with a sword had procured us a fair market in spite of the craft and avarice of the dutch factors the name of this person was mannu djarme and it may reasonably be supposed that he was a man of uncommon integrity and abilities as notwithstanding his possession of power in the character of a favorite he was beloved by the whole principality if any difference arises among the people it is settled by the raja and his counselors without delay or appeal and as we were told with the most solemn deliberation and impartial justice  we were informed by mr lange that the chiefs who had successively presided over the five principalities of this island had lived for time immemorial in the strictest alliance and most cordial friendship with each other yet he said the people were of a warlike disposition and had always courageously defended themselves against foreign invaders we were told also that the island was able to raise upon very short notice   00 fighting men armed with muskets spears lances and targets of this force laai was said to furnish   00 seba  000 regeeua   00 timo  00 and massara  00 besides the arms that have been already mentioned each man is furnished with a large poleax resembling a woodbill except that it has a strait edge    0 september and is much heavier this in the hands of people who have courage to come to close quarters with an enemy must be a dreadful weapon and we were told that they were so dexterous with their lances that at the distance of sixty feet they would throw them with such exactness as to pierce a mans heart and such force as to go quite through his body  how far this account of the martial prowess of the inhabitants of savu may be true we cannot take upon us to determine but during our stay we saw no appearance of it we saw indeed in the townhouse or house of assembly about one hundred spears and targets which served to arm the people who were sent down to intimidate us at the trading place but they seemed to be the refuse of old armories no two being of the same make or length for some were six and some sixteen feet long we saw no lance among them and as to the muskets though they were clean on the outside they were eaten into holes by the rust within and the people themselves appeared to be so little acquainted with military discipline that they marched like a disorderly rabble every one having instead of his target a cock some tobacco or other merchandise of the like kind which he took that opportunity to bring down to sell and few or none of their cartridge boxes were furnished with either powder or ball though a piece of paper was thrust into the hole to save appearances we saw a few swivel guns and pateraros at the townhouse and a great gun before it but the swivels and pateraros lay out of their carriages and the great gun lay upon a heap of stones almost consumed with rust with the touchhole downwards possibly to conceal its size which might perhaps be little less than that of the bore     0 september we could not discover that among these people there was any rank of distinction between the raja and the landowners the landowners were respectable in proportion to their possessions the inferior ranks consist of manufacturers laboring poor and slaves the slaves like the peasants in some parts of europe are connected with the estate and both descend together but though the landowner can sell his slave he has no other power over his person not even to correct him without the privity and approbation of the raja some have five hundred of these slaves and some not half a dozen the common price of them is a fat hog when a great man goes out he is constantly attended by two or more of them one of them carries a sword or hanger the hilt of which is commonly of silver and adorned with large tassels of horse hair and another carries a bag which contains betel areca lime and tobacco in these attendants consists all their magnificence for the raja himself has no other mark of distinction  the chief object of pride among these people like that of a welchman is a long pedigree of respectable ancestors and indeed a veneration for antiquity seems to be carried farther here than in any other country even a house that has been well inhabited for many generations becomes almost sacred and few articles either of use or luxury bear so high a price as stones which having been long sat upon are become even and smooth those who can purchase such stones or are possessed of them by inheritance place them round their houses where they serve as seats for their dependants  every raja sets up in the principal town of his province or nigree a large stone which serves as a memorial of his reign in the principal town of seba where we lay there are thirteen such stones besides many fragments of others which had been set up in earlier times    0 september and are now mouldering away these monuments seem to prove that some kind of civil establishment here is of considerable antiquity the last thirteen reigns in england make something more than     years  many of these stones are so large that it is difficult to conceive by what means they were brought to their present station especially as it is the summit of a hill but the world is full of memorials of human strength in which the mechanical powers that have been since added by mathematical science seem to be surpassed and of such monuments there are not a few among the remains of barbarous antiquity in our own country besides those upon salisbury plain  these stones not only record the reigns of successive princes but serve for a purpose much more extraordinary and probably altogether peculiar to this country when a raja dies a general feast is proclaimed throughout his dominions and all his subjects assemble round these stones almost every living creature that can be caught is then killed and the feast lasts for a less or greater number of weeks or months as the kingdom happens to be more or less furnished with live stock at the time the stones serve for tables when this madness is over a fast must necessarily ensue and the whole kingdom is obliged to subsist upon syrup and water if it happens in the dry season when no vegetables can be procured till a new stock of animals can be raised from the few that have escaped by chance or been preserved by policy from the general massacre or can be procured from the neighboring kingdoms such however is the account that we received from mr lange     0 september we had no opportunity to examine any of their manufactures except that of their cloth which they spin weave and dye we did not indeed see them employed but many of the instruments which they use fell in our way we saw their machine for clearing cotton of its seeds which is made upon the same principles as those in europe but is so small that it might be taken for a model or a toy it consists of two cylinders like our round rulers somewhat less than an inch in diameter one of which being turned round by a plain winch turns the other by means of an endless worm and the whole machine is not more than fourteen inches long and seven high that which we saw had been much used and many pieces of cotton were hanging about it so that there is no reason to doubt its being a fair specimen of the rest we also once saw their apparatus for spinning it consisted of a bobbin on which was wound a small quantity of thread and a kind of distaff filled with cotton we conjectured therefore that they spin by hand as the women of europe did before the introduction of wheels and i am told that they have not yet found their way into some parts of it their loom seemed to be in one respect preferable to ours for the web was not stretched upon a frame but extended by a piece of wood at each end round one of which the cloth was rolled and round the other the threads the web was about half a yard broad and the length of the shuttle was equal to the breadth of the web so that probably their work goes on but slowly that they dyed this cloth we first guessed from its color and from the indigo which we saw in their plantations and our conjecture was afterward confirmed by mr langes account i have already observed that it is dyed in the yarn and we once law them dying what was said to be girdles for the women of a dirty red but with what drug we did not think it worth while to enquire  the religion of these people    0 september according to mr langes information is an absurd kind of paganism every man choosing his own god and determining for himself how he should be worshipped so that there are almost as many gods and modes of worship as people in their morals however they are said to be irreproachable even upon the principles of christianity no man is allowed more than one wife yet an illicit commerce between the sexes is in a manner unknown among them instances of theft are very rare and they are so far from revenging a supposed injury by murder that if any difference arises between them they will not so much as make it the subject of debate lest they should be provoked to resentment and ill will but immediately and implicity refer it to the determination of their king  they appeared to be a healthy and longlived people yet some of them were marked with the smallpox which mr lange told us had several times made its appearance among them and was treated with the same precautions as the plague as soon as a person was seized with the distemper he was removed to some solitary place very remote from any habitation where the disease was left to take its course and the patient supplied with daily food by reaching it to him at the end of a long pole  of their domestic economy we could learn but little in one instance however their delicacy and cleanliness are very remarkable many of us were ashore here three successive days from a very early hour in the morning till it was dark yet we never saw the least trace of an offering to cloacina nor could we so much as guess where they were made in a country so populous this is very difficult to be accounted for    0 september and perhaps there is no other country in the world where the secret is so effectually kept  the boats in use here are a kind of proa  this island was settled by the portuguese almost as soon as they first found their way into this part of the ocean but they were in a short time supplanted by the dutch the dutch however did not take possession of it but only sent sloops to trade with the natives probably for provisions to support the inhabitants of their spice islands who applying themselves wholly to the cultivation of that important article of trade and laying out all their ground in plantations can breed few animals possibly their supplies by this occasional traffic were precarious possibly they were jealous of being supplanted in their turn but however that be their east india company about ten years ago entered into a treaty with the rajas by which the company stipulated to furnish each of them with a certain quantity of silk fine linen cutlery ware arrack and other articles every year and the rajas engaged that neither they nor their subjects should trade with any person except the company without having first obtained their consent and that they would admit a resident on behalf of the company to reside upon the island and see that their part of the treaty was fulfilled they also engaged to supply annually a certain quantity of rice maize and calevances the maize and calevances are sent to timor in sloops which are kept there for that purpose each of which is navigated by ten indians and the rice is fetched away annually by a ship which brings the companys returns and anchors alternately in each of the three bays these returns are delivered to the rajas in the form of a present and the cask of arrack they and their principal people never cease to drink    0 september as long as a drop of it remains  in consequence of this treaty the dutch placed three persons upon the island mr lange his colleague the native of timor the son of an indian woman by a portuguese and one frederick craig the son of an indian woman by a dutchman lange visits each of the rajas once in two months when he makes the tour of the island attended by fifty slaves on horseback he exhorts these chiefs to plant if it appears that they have been remiss and observes where the crops are got in that he may order sloops to fetch it so that it passes immediately from the ground to the dutch storehouses at timor in these excursions he always carries with him some bottles of arrack which he finds of great use in opening the hearts of the rajas with whom he is to deal  during the ten years that he had resided upon this island he had never seen a european besides ourselves except at the arrival of the dutch ship which had sailed about two months before we arrived and he is now to be distinguished from the natives only by his color and his dress for he sits upon the ground chews his betele and in every respect has adopted their character and manners he has married an indian woman of the island of timor who keeps his house after the fashion of her country and he gave that as a reason for not inviting us to visit him saying that he could entertain us in no other manner than the indians had done and he spoke no language readily but that of the country  the office of mr frederic craig is to instruct the youth of the country in reading and writing and the principles of the christian religion the dutch having printed versions of the new testament a catechism and several other tracts in the language of this and the neighboring islands    0 september dr solander who was at his house saw the books and the copybooks also of his scholars many of whom wrote a very fair hand he boasted that there were no less than six hundred christians in the township of seba but what the dutch christianity of these indians may be it is not perhaps very easy to guess for there is not a church nor even a priest in the whole island  while we were at this place we made several enquiries concerning the neighboring islands and the intelligence which we received is to the following effect  a small island to the westward of savu the name of which we did not learn produces nothing of any consequence but arecanuts of which the dutch receive annually the freight of two sloops in return for presents that they make to the islanders  timor is the chief and the dutch residents on the other islands go thither once a year to pass their accounts the place is nearly in the same state as in dampiers time the dutch having there a fort and storehouses and by langes account we might there have been supplied with every necessary that we expected to procure at batavia salt provisions and arrack not excepted but the portuguese are still in possession of several towns on the north side of the island particularly laphao and sesial  about two years before our arrival a french ship was wrecked upon the east coast of timor and after she had lain some days upon the shoal a sudden gale broke her up at once and drowned the captain with the greatest part of the crew those who got ashore among whom was one of the lieutenants made the best of their way to concordia they were four days upon the road where they were obliged to leave part of their company through fatigue    0 september and the rest to the number of about eighty arrived at the town they were supplied with every necessary and sent back to the wreck with proper assistance for recovering what could be fished up they fortunately got up all their bullion which was in chests and several of their guns which were very large they then returned to the town but their companions who had been left upon the road were missing having as it was supposed been kept among the indians either by persuasion or force for they are very desirous of having europeans among them to instruct them in the art of war after a stay of more than two months at concordia their number was diminished nearly one half by sickness in consequence of the fatigue and hardship which they had suffered by the shipwreck and the survivors were sent in a small vessel to europe  rotte is in much the same situation as savu a dutch factor resides upon it to manage the natives and look after its produce which consists among other articles of sugar formerly it was made only by bruising the canes and boiling the juice to a syrup in the same manner as toddy but great improvements have lately been made in preparing this valuable commodity the three little islands called the solars are also under the influence of the dutch settlement at concordia they are flat and low but abound with provisions of every kind and the middlemost is said to have a good harbor for shipping end another little island to the westward of the solars is still in the hands of the portuguese who have a good town and harbor on the north east corner of it called larntuca they had formerly an harbor on the south side of it but that being much inferior to larntuca has for some time been altogether neglected     0 september the inhabitants of each of these little islands speak a language peculiar to themselves and it is an object of dutch policy to prevent as much as possible their learning the language of each other if they spoke a common language they would learn by a mutual intercourse with each other to plant such things as would be of more value to themselves than their present produce though of less advantage to the dutch but their languages being different they can communicate no such knowledge to each other and the dutch secure to themselves the benefit of supplying their several necessities upon their own terms which it is reasonable to suppose are not very moderate it is probably with a view to this advantage that the dutch never teach their own language to the natives of these islands and have been at the expense of translating the testament and catechisms into the different languages of each for in proportion as dutch had become the language of their religion it would have become the common language of them all  to this account of savu i shall only add a small specimen of its language by which it will appear to have some affinity with that of the south sea

authority alone therefore it must rest  chap xii the run from the island of savu to batavia and an account of the transactions there while the ship was refitting    0 september friday    in the morning of friday the   st of september    0 we got under sail and stood away to the westward along the north side of the island of savu and of the smaller that lies to the westward of it which at noon bore from us sse distant two leagues at four oclock in the afternoon we discovered a small low island bearing s s w distant three leagues which has no place in any chart now extant at least in

we found the variation of the needle to be      w as soon as we got clear of the islands we had constantly a swell from the southward which i imagined was not caused by a wind blowing from that

which was agreeable to the log and our longitude was        w we steered n w all day on the   th friday    in order to make the land of java and at noon on the   th    0 september saturday    sunday  0 our latitude by observation was      s longitude      0 w and in the morning of the  0th i took into my possession the logbook an journals at least all i could find of the officers petty officers and seamen and enjoined them secrecy with respect to where they had been  at seven in the evening being in the latitude of java head and not seeing any land i concluded that we were too far to the westward i therefore hauled up e n e having before steered n by e in the night we had thunder and lightning and about twelve oclock by the light of the flashes we saw the land bearing east i then tacked and stood to the s w till four oclock in the morning of the  st of october and at six java head or the west end of java october monday   bore s e by e distant five leagues soon after we saw princes island bearing e s and at ten the island of cracatoa bearing ne cracatoa is a remarkably highpeaked island and at noon it bore n  0 e distant seven leagues  i must now observe that during our run from savu i allowed twenty minutes a day for the westerly current which i concluded must run strong at this time especially off the coast of java and i found that this allowance was just equivalent to the effect of the current upon the ship  at four oclock in the morning of the  d tuesday   we fetched close in with the coast of java in fifteen fathom we then stood along the coast and early in the forenoon i sent the boat ashore to try if she could procure some fruit for tupia who was very ill and some grass for the buffaloes that were still alive in an hour or two she returned with four cocoanuts and a small bunch of plantains which had been purchased for a shilling and some herbage for the cattle which the indians not only gave us but assisted our people to cut the country looked like one continued wood    0 october tuesday   and had a very pleasant appearance  about eleven oclock we saw two dutch ships lying off anger point and i sent mr hicks on board of one of them to enquire news of our country from which we had been absent so long in the mean time it fell calm and about noon i anchored in eighteen fathom with a muddy bottom when mr hicks returned he reported that the ships were dutch east indiamen from batavia one of which was bound to ceylon and the other to the coast of malabar and that there was also a flyboat or packet which was said to be stationed here to carry letters from the dutch ships that came hither to batavia but which i rather think was appointed to examine all ships that pass the straight from these ships we heard with great pleasure that the swallow had been at batavia about two years before  at seven oclock a breeze sprung up at s s w with which having weighed we stood to the n e between thwartthewayisland and the cap sounding from eighteen to twentyeight fathom we had but little wind all night and having a strong current against us we got no further by eight in the morning than bantam point wednes   at this time the wind came to the n e and obliged us to anchor in two and twenty fathom at about the distance of two miles from the shore the point bore n e by e distant one league and here we found a strong current setting to the n w in the morning we had seen the dutch packet standing after us but when the wind shifted to the n e she bore away  at six oclock in the evening the wind having obliged us to continue at anchor one of the country boats came along side of us on board of which was the master of the packet he seemed to have two motives for his visit one to take an account of the ship and the other to sell us refreshments    0 october wednes   for in the boat were turtle fowls ducks parrots paroquets ricebirds monkies and other articles which they held at a very high price and brought to a bad market for our savu stock was not yet expended however i gave a spanish dollar for a small turtle which weighed about six and thirty pounds i gave also a dollar for ten large fowls and afterward bought fifteen more at the same price for a dollar we might also have bought two monkies or a whole cage of ricebirds the master of the sloop brought with him two books in one of which he desired that any of our officers would write down the name of the ship and its commander with that of the place from which she sailed and of the port to which she was bound with such other particulars relating to themselves as they might think proper for the information of any of our friends that should come after us and in the other he entered the names of the ship and the commander himself in order to transmit them to the governor and council of the indies we perceived that in the first book many ships particularly portuguese had made entries of the same kind with that for which it was presented to us mr hicks however having written the name of the ship only added from europe he took notice of this but said that he was satisfied with any thing we thought fit to write it being intended merely for the information of those who should enquire after us from motives of friendship  having made several attempts to sail with a wind that would not stem the current and as often come to an anchor a proa came alongside of us in the morning of the  th friday   in which was a dutch officer who sent me down a printed paper in english duplicates of which he had in other languages particularly in french and dutch    0 october friday   all regularly signed in the name of the governor and council of the indies by their secretary it contained nine questions very ill expressed in the following terms    to what nation the ship belongs and its name    if it comes from europe or any other place    from what place it lastly departed from    whereunto designed to go    what and how many ships of the dutch company by departure from the last shore there laid and their names    if one or more of these ships in company with this is departed for this or any other place    if during the voyage any particularities is happened or seen    if not any ships in sea or the streights of sunda have seen or hailed in and which    if any other news worth of attention at the place from whence the ship lastly departed or during the voyage is happened  batavia in the castle by order of the governor general and the counselors of india j brander bungl sec  of these questions i answered only the first and the fourth which when the officer saw he said answers to the rest were of no consequence yet he immediately added that he must send that very paper away to batavia and that it would be there the next day at noon i have particularly related this incident    0 october friday   because i have been credibly informed that it is but of late years that the dutch have taken upon them to examine ships that pass through this straight  at ten oclock the same morning we weighed with a light breeze at s w but did little more than stem the current and about two oclock anchored again under bantam point where we lay till nine a light breeze then springing up at se we weighed and stood to the eastward till ten oclock the next morning saturday   when the current obliged us again to anchor in twentytwo fathom pulababi bearing e by s s distant between three and four miles having alternately weighed and anchored several times till four in the afternoon of the  th we then stood to the eastward sunday   with a very faint breeze at n e and passed wapping island and the first island to the eastward of it when the wind dying away we were carried by the current between the first and second of the islands that lie to the eastward of wapping island were we were obliged to anchor in thirty fathom being very near a ledge of rocks that run out from one of the islands at two the next morning we weighed with the land wind at south monday   and stood out clear of the shoal but before noon were obliged to come to again in twentyeight fathom near a small island among those that are called the thousand islands which we did not find laid down in any chart pulo pare at this time bore e n e distance between six and seven miles  mr banks and dr solander went ashore upon the island which they found not to be more than five hundred yards long and one hundred broad yet there was a house upon it and a small plantation where among other things was the palma christi from which the castor oil is made in the west indies they made a small addition to their collection of plants and shot a bat whose wings when extended measured three feet from point to point    0 october monday   they shot also four plovers which exactly resembled the golden plover of england soon after they returned a small indian boat came alongside with two malays on board who brought three turtles some dried fish and a few pumpkins we bought the turtle which altogether weighed a hundred and fortysix pounds for a dollar and considering that we had lately paid the dutchman a dollar for one that weighed only six and thirty pounds we thought we had a good bargain the seller appeared equally satisfied and we then treated with him for his pumpkins for which he was very unwilling to take any money but a dollar we laid that a whole dollar was greatly too much to which he readily assented but desired that we would cut one and give him a part at last however a fine shining portuguese petacka tempted him and for that he sold us his whole stock of pumpkins being in number twentysix at parting he made signs that we should not tell at batavia that any boat had been aboard us  we were not able to weather pulo pare this day but getting the land wind at south about ten oclock at night we weighed and stood to the e s e all night at ten in the morning tuesday   we anchored again to wait for the sea breeze and at noon it sprung up at nne with which we stood in for batavia road where at four oclock in the afternoon we came to an anchor  we found here the harcourt indiaman from england two english private traders of that country thirteen sail of large dutch ships and a considerable number of small vessels a boat came immediately on board from a ship which had a broad pendant flying and the officer who commanded having enquired who we were and whence we came immediately returned with such answers as we thought fit to give him both he and his people were as pale as specter    0 october tuesday   a sad presage of our sufferings in so unhealthy a country but our people who except tupia were all rosy and plump seemed to think themselves so seasoned by various climates that nothing could hurt them in the mean time i sent a lieutenant ashore to acquaint the governor of our arrival and to make an excuse for our not saluting for as i could salute with only three guns except the swivels which i was of opinion would not be heard i thought it was better to let it alone as soon as the boat was dispatched the carpenter delivered me an account of the defects of the ship of which the following is a copy  the defects of his majestys bark endeavor lieutenant james cook commander  the ship very leaky as she makes from twelve to six inches water an hour occasioned by her main keel being wounded in many places and the scarfs of her stern being very open the false keel gone beyond the midships from forward and perhaps farther as i had no opportunity of seeing for the water when hauled ashore for repairing wounded on the larboard side under the main channel where i imagine the greatest leak is but could not come at it for the water one pump on the larboard side useless the others decayed within an inch and an half of the bore otherwise masts yards boats and hull in pretty good condition  as it was the universal opinion that the ship could not safely proceed to europe without an examination of her bottom i determined to apply for leave to heave her down at this place and as i understood that it would be necessary to make this application in writing i drew up a request and the next morning    0 october wednes  0 having got it translated into dutch we all went ashore  we repaired immediately to the house of mr leith the only englishman of any credit who is resident at this place he received us with great politeness and engaged us to dinner to this gentleman we applied for instructions how to provide ourselves with lodgings and necessaries while we should stay ashore and he told us that there was a hotel or kind of inn kept by the order of government where all merchants and strangers were obliged to reside paying half per cent upon the value of their goods for warehouse room which the master of the house was obliged to provide but that as we came in a kings ship we should be at liberty to live where we pleased upon asking the governors permission which would be granted of course he said that it would be cheaper for us to take a house in the town and bring our own servants ashore if we had any body upon whom we could depend to buy in our provisions but as this was not the case having no person among us who could speak the malay language our gentlemen determined to go to the hotel at the hotel therefore beds were immediately hired and word was sent that we should sleep there at night  at five oclock in the afternoon i was introduced to the governorgeneral who received me very courteously he told me that i should have every thing i wanted and that in the morning my request should be laid before the council which i was desired to attend  about nine oclock we had a dreadful storm of thunder lightning and rain during which the mainmast of one of the dutch east indiamen was split and carried away by the deck the maintopmast and topgallantmast were shivered all to pieces    0 october wednes  0 she had an iron spindle at the maintopgallantmasthead which probably directed the stroke this ship lay not more than the distance of two cables length from ours and in all probability we should have shared the same fate but for the electrical chain which we had but just got up and which conducted the lightning over the side of the ship but though we escaped the lightning the explosion shook us like an earthquake the chain at the same time appearing like a line of fire a sentinel was in the action of charging his piece and the shock forced the musket out of his hand and broke the rammer rod upon this occasion i cannot but earnestly recommend chains of the same kind to every ship whatever be her destination and i hope that the fate of the dutchman will be a warning to all who shall read this narrative against having an iron spindle at the masthead  the next morning i attended at the council chamger thursday    and was told that i should have every thing i wanted in the mean time the gentlemen ashore agreed with the keeper of the hotel for their lodging and board at the rate of two rixdollars or nine shillings sterling a day for each and as there were five of them and they would probably have many visitors from the ship he agreed to keep them a separate table upon condition that they should pay one rixdollar for the dinner of every stranger and another for his supper and bed if he should sleep ashore under this stipulation they were to be furnished with tea coffee punch pipes and tobacco for themselves and their friends as much as they could consume they were also to pay half a rupee or one shilling and three pence a day for each of their servants  they soon learnt that these rates were more than double the common charges of board and lodging in the town and their table    0 october thursday    though it had the appearance of magnificence was wretchedly served their dinner consisted of one course of fifteen dishes and their supper of one course of thirteen but nine or ten of them consisted of bad poultry variously dressed and often served up the second third and even the fourth time the same duck having appeared more than once roasted found his way again to the table as a fricasee and a fourth time in the form of forced meat it was not long however before they learnt that this treatment was only by way of essay and that it was the invariable custom of the house to supply all strangers at their first coming with such fare as could be procured for the least money and consequently would produce the most gain that if either through indolence or goodnature they were content it was continued for the benefit of the host but that if they complained it was gradually amended till they were satisfied which sometimes happened before they had the worth of their money after this discovery they remonstrated and their fare became better however after a few days mr banks hired a little house the next door on the left hand to the hotel for himself and his party for which he paid after the rate of ten rixdollars or two pounds five shillings sterling a month but here they were very far from having either the convenience or the privacy which they expected no person was permitted to sleep in this private house occasionally as a guest to the person who hired it under a penalty but amost every dutchman that went by ran in without any ceremony to ask what they sold there having been very seldom any private persons at batavia who had not something to sell every body here hires a carriage and mr banks hired two they are open chaises made to hold two people and driven by a man sitting on a coachbox for each of these he paid two rixdollars a day  as soon as he was settled in his new habitation    0 october thursday    he sent for tupia who till now had continued on board upon account of his illness which was of the bilious kind and for which he had obstinately refused to take any medicine he soon came ashore with his boy tayeto and though while he was on board and after he came into the boat he was exceedingly listless and dejected he no sooner entered the town than he seemed to be animated with a new soul the houses carriages streets people and a multiplicity of other objects all new which rushed upon him at once produced an effect like the sudden and secret power that is imagined of fascination tayeto expressed his wonder and delight with still less restraint and danced along the street in a kind of ecstasy examining every object with a restless and eager curiosity which was every moment excited and gratified one of the first things that tupia remarked was the various dresses of the passing multitude concerning which he made many enquiries and when he was told that in this place where people of many different nations were assembled every one wore the habit of his country he desired that he might conform to the custom and appear in that of otaheite south sea cloth was therefore sent for from the ship and he equipped himself with great expedition and dexterity the people who had seen otourou the indian who had been brought hither by m bougainville enquired whether tupia was not the same person from these enquiries we learnt who it was that we had supposed to be spaniards from the accounts that had been given of two ships by the islanders  in the mean time i procured an order to the superintendant of the island of ourust where the ship was to be repaired to receive her there and sent by one of the ships that sailed for holland an account of our arrival here to mr stephens the secretary to the admiralty     0 october thursday    the expenses that would be incurred by repairing and refitting the ship rendered it necessary for me to take up money in this place which i imagined might be done without difficulty but i found myself mistaken for after the most diligent enquiry i could not find any private person that had ability and inclination to advance the sum that i wanted in this difficulty i applied to the governor himself by a written request in consequence of which the shebander had orders to supply me with what money i should require out of the companys treasury  thursday    on the   th as soon as it was light having by several accidents and mistakes suffered a delay of many days i took up the anchor and ran down to ourust a few days afterward we went alongside of the wharf on coopers island which lies close to ourust in order to take out our stores  by this time having been here only nine days we began to feel the fatal effects of the climate and situation tupia after the flow of spirits which the novelties of the place produced upon his first landing sunk on a sudden and grew every day worse and worse tayeto was seized with an inflammation upon his lungs mr bankss two servants became very ill and himself and dr solander were attacked by fevers in a few days almost every person both on board and ashore was sick affected no doubt by the low swampy situation of the place and the numberless dirty canals which intersect the town in all directions on the   th i set up the tent for the reception of the ships company of whom there was but a small number able to do duty poor tupia of whose life we now began to despair and who till this time had continued ashore with mr banks desired to be removed to the ship where he said he should breathe a freer air than among the numerous houses which obstructed it ashore on board the ship however he could not go    0 october for she was unrigged and preparing to be laid down at the careening place but on the   th sunday    mr banks went with him to coopers island or as it is called here kuypor where she lay and as he seemed pleased with the spot a tent was there pitched for him at this place both the sea breeze and the land breeze blew directly over him and he expressed great satisfaction in his situation mr banks whose humanity kept him two days with this poor indian returned to the town on the  0th and the fits of his intermittent tuesday  0 which was now become a regular tertian were so violent as to deprive him of his senses while they lasted and leave him so weak that he was scarcely able to crawl down stairs at this time dr solanders disorder also increased and mr monkhouse the surgeon was confined to his bed  on the fifth of november november monday   after many delays in consequence of the dutch ships coming alongside the wharfs to load pepper the ship was laid down and the same day mr monkhouse our surgeon a sensible skilful man fell the first sacrifice to this fatal country a loss which was greatly aggravated by our situation dr solander was just able to attend his funeral but mr banks was confined to his bed our distress was now very great and the prospect before us discouraging in the highest degree our danger was not such as we could surmount by any efforts of our own courage skill and diligence were all equally ineffectual and death was every day making advances upon us where we could neither resist nor fly malay servants were hired to attend the sick but they had so little sense either of duty or humanity that they could not be kept within call and the patient was frequently obliged to get out of bed to seek them on the  th we lost our poor indian boy tayeto friday   and tupia was so much affected    0 november friday   that it was doubted whether he would survive till the next day  in the mean time the bottom of the ship being examined was found to be in a worse condition than we apprehended the false keel was all gone to within twenty feet of the stern post the main keel was considerably injured in many places a great quantity of the sheathing was torn off and several planks were much damaged two of them and the half of a third under the main channel near the keel were for the length of six feet so worn that they were not above an eighth part of an inch thick and here the worms had made their way quite into the timbers yet in this condition she had sailed many hundred leagues where navigation is as dangerous as in any part of the world how much misery did we escape by being ignorant that so considerable a part of the bottom of the vessel was thinner than the sole of a shoe and that every life on board depended upon so slight and fragile a barrier between us and the unfathomable ocean it seemed however that we had been preserved only to perish here mr banks and dr solander were so bad that the physician declared they had no chance for recovery but by removing into the country a house was therefore hired for them at the distance of about two miles from the town which belonged to the master of the hotel who engaged to furnish them with provisions and the use of slaves as they had already experienced their want of influence over slaves that had other masters and the unfeeling inattention of these fellows to the sick they bought each of them a mallay woman which removed both the causes of their being so ill served the women were their own property and the tenderness of the sex even here made them good nurses while these preparations were making they received an account of the death of tupia    0 november who sunk at once after the loss of the boy whom he loved with the tenderness of a parent  by the   th wednes    the bottom of the ship was thoroughly repaired and very much to my satisfaction it would indeed be injustice to the officers and workmen of this yard not to declare that in my opinion there is not a marine yard in the world where a ship can be laid down with more convenience safety and dispatch nor repaired with more diligence and skill at this place they heave down by two masts a method which we do not now practice it is however unquestionably more safe and expeditious to heave down with two masts than one and he must have a good share of bigotry to old customs and an equal want of common sense who will not allow this after seeing with what facility the dutch heave down their largest ships at this place  mr banks and dr solander recovered slowly at their country house which was not only open to the sea breeze but situated upon a running stream which greatly contributed to the circulation of the air but i was now taken ill myself mr sporing and a seaman who had attended mr banks were also seized with intermittents and indeed there was not more than ten of the whole ships company that were able to do duty  we proceeded however in rigging the ship and getting water and stores aboard the water we were obliged to procure from batavia at the rate of six shillings and eight pence a leager or one hundred and fifty gallons  about the   th the westerly monsoon set in monday    which generally blows here in the night from the s w and in the day from the n w or n for some nights before this we had very heavy rain with much thunder and in the night between the   th and   th    0 november monday    such rain as we had seldom seen for near four hours without intermission mr bankss house admitted the water in every part like a sieve and it ran through the lower rooms in a stream that would have turned a mill he was by this time sufficiently recovered to go out and upon his entering batavia the next morning he was much surprised to see the bedding every where hung out to dry  the wet season was now set in though we had some intervals of fair weather the frogs in the ditches which croak ten times louder than any frogs in europe gave notice of rain by an incessant noise that was almost intolerable and the gnats and musquitos which had been very troublesome even during the dry weather were now become innumerable swarming from every plash of water like bees from a hive they did not however much incommode us in the clay and the stings however troublesome at first never continued to itch above half an hour so that none of us felt in the day the effects of the wounds they had received in the night  december saturday   on the  th of december the ship being perfectly refitted and having taken in most of her water and stores and received her sick on board we ran up to batavia road and anchored in four fathom and an half of water  monday    from this time to the   th we were employed in getting on board the remainder of our water and provisions with some new pumps and in several other operations that were necessary to fit the ship for the sea all which would have been effected much sooner if sickness and death had not disabled or carried off a great number of our men  while we lay here the earl of elgin captain cook a ship belonging to the english east india company came to an anchor in the road she was bound from madrass to china    0 december monday    but having lost her passage put in here to wait for the next season the phoenix captain black an english country ship from bencoolen also came to an anchor at this place  in the afternoon of christmas eve the   th i took leave of the governor and several of the principal gentlemen of the place with whom i had formed connections and from whom i received every possible civility and assistance but in the mean time an accident happened which might have produced disagreeable consequences a seaman had run away from one of the dutch ships in the road and entered on board of mine the captain had applied to the governor to reclaim him as a subject of holland and an order for that purpose was procured this order was brought to me soon after i returned from my last visit and i said that if the man appeared to be a dutchman he should certainly be delivered up mr hicks commanded on board and i gave the dutch officer an order to him to deliver the man up under that condition i slept myself this night on shore and in the morning tuesday    the captain of the dutch commodore came and told me that he had carried my order on board but that the officer had refused to deliver up the man alleging not only that he was not a dutchman but that he was a subject of great britain born in ireland i replied that the officer had perfectly executed my orders and that if the man was an english subject it could not be expected that i should deliver him up the captain then said that he was just come from the governor to demand the man of me in his name as a subject of denmark alleging that he stood in the ships books as born at elsineur the claim of this man as a subject of holland being now given up i observed to the captain that there appeared to be some mistake in the generals message    0 december tuesday    for that he would certainly never demand a danish seaman from me who had committed no other crime than preferring the service of the english to that of the dutch i added however to convince him of my sincere desire to avoid disputes that if the man was a dane he should be delivered up as a courtesy though he could not be demanded as a right but that if i found he was an english subject i would keep him at all events upon these terms we parted and soon after i received a letter from mr hicks containing indubitable proof that the seaman in question was a subject of his britannic majesty this letter i immediately carried to the shebander with a request that it might be shown to the governor and that his excellency might at the same time be told i would not upon any terms part with the man this had the desired effect and i heard no more of the affair  in the evening i went on board accompanied by mr banks and the rest of the gentlemen who had constantly resided on shore and who though better were not yet perfectly recovered  wednes    at six in the morning of the   th we weighed and set sail with a light breeze at s w the elgin indiaman saluted us with three cheers and thirteen guns and the garrison with fourteen both which with the help of our swivels we returned and soon after the sea breeze set in at n by w which obliged us to anchor just without the ships in the road  at this time the number of sick on board amounted to forty and the rest of the ships company were in a very feeble condition every individual had been sick except the sailmaker an old man between seventy and eighty years of age and it is very remarkable that this old man    0 december wednes    during our stay at this place was constantly drunk every day we had buried seven the surgeon three seamen mr greens servant tupia and tayeto his boy all but tupia fell a sacrifice to the unwholesome stagnant putrid air of the country and he who from his birth had been used to subsist chiefly upon vegetable food particularly ripe fruit soon contracted all the disorders that are incident to a sea life and would probably have sunk under them before we could have completed our voyage if we had not been obliged to go to batavia to refit  chap xiii some account of batavia and the adjacent country with their fruits flowers and other productions    0 december batavia the capital of the dutch dominions in india and generally supposed to have no equal among all the possessions of the europeans in asia is situated on the north side of the island of java in a low fenny plain where several small rivers which take their rise in the mountains called blaeuwen berg about forty miles up the country empty themselves into the sea and where the coast forms a large bay called the bay of batavia at the distance of about eight leagues from the straight of sunda it lies in latitude    0 s and longitude  0   0 e from the meridian of greenwich as appears from astronomical observations made upon the spot by the reverend mr mohr who has built an elegant observatory which is as well furnished with instruments as most in europe  the dutch seem to have pitched upon this spot for the convenience of watercarriage and in that it is indeed a second holland and superior to every other place in the world there are very few streets that have not a canal of considerable breadth running through them or rather stagnating in them and continued for several miles in almost every direction beyond the town which is also intersected by five or six rivers some of which are navigable thirty or forty miles up the country as the houses are large and the streets wide it takes up a much greater extent in proportion to the number of houses it contains    0 december than any city in europe valentyn who wrote an account of it about the year      says that in his time there were within the walls      dutch houses and   00 chinese and without the walls  0   dutch and    0 chinese besides    arrack houses making in all    0 but this account appeared to us to be greatly exaggerated especially with respect to the number of houses within the walls  the streets are spacious and handsome and the banks of the canals are planted with rows of trees that make a very pleasing appearance but the trees concur with the canals to make the situation unwholesome the stagnant canals in the dry season exhale an intolerable stench and the trees impede the course of the air by which in some degree the putrid effluvia would be dissipated in the wet season the inconvenience is equal for then these reservoirs of corrupted water overflow their banks in the lower part of the town especially in the neighborhood of the hotel and fill the lower stories of the houses where they leave behind them an inconceivable quantity of slime and filth yet these canals are sometimes cleaned but the cleaning them is so managed as to become as great a nuisance as the foulness of the water for the black mud that is taken from the bottom is suffered to lie upon the banks that is in the middle of the street till it has acquired a sufficient degree of hardness to be made the lading of a boat and carried away as this mud consists chiefly of human ordure which is regularly thrown into the canals every morning there not being a necessaryhouse in the whole town it poisons the air while it is drying to a considerable extent even the running streams become nuisances in their turn by the nastiness or negligence of the people for every now and then a dead hog    0 december or a dead horse is stranded upon the shallow parts and it being the business of no particular person to remove the nuisance it is negligently left to time and accident while we were here a dead buffalo lay upon the shoal of a river that ran through one of the principal streets above a week and at last was carried away by a flood  the houses are in general well adapted to the climate they consist of one very large room or hall on the ground floor with a door at each end both which generally stand open at one end a room is taken off by a partition where the master of the house transacts his business and in the middle between each end there is a court which gives light to the hall and at the same time increases the draught of air from one corner of the hall the stairs go up to the floor above where also the rooms are spacious and airy in the alcove which is formed by the court the family dine and at other times it is occupied by the female slaves who are not allowed to sit down any where else  the public buildings are most of them old heavy and ungraceful but the new church is not inelegant it is built with a dome that is seen from a great distance at sea and though the outside has rather a heavy appearance the inside forms a very fine room it is furnished with an organ of a proper size being very large and is most magnificently illuminated by chandeliers  the town is enclosed by a stone wall of a moderate height but the whole of it is old and many parts are much out of repair this wall itself is surrounded by a river which in some places is fifty and in some a hundred yards wide the stream is rapid but the water is shallow the wall is also lined within by a canal which in different parts is of different breadths so that in passing either out or in through the gates it is necessary to cross two drawbridges    0 december and there is no access for idle people or strangers to walk upon the ramparts which seem to be but ill provided with guns  in the north east corner of the town stands the castle or citadel the walls of which are both higher and thicker than those of the town especially near the landingplace where there is depth of water only for boats which it completely commands with several large guns that make a very good appearance  within this castle are apartments for the governor general and all the council of india to which they are enjoined to repair in case of a siege here are also large storehouses where great quantities of the companys goods are kept especially those that are brought from europe and where almost all their writers transact their business in this place also are laid up a great number of cannon whether to mount upon the walls or furnish shipping we could not learn and the company is said to be well supplied with powder which is dispersed in various magazines that if some should be destroyed by lightning which in this place is very frequent the rest may escape  besides the fortifications of the town numerous forts are dispersed about the country to the distance of twenty or thirty miles these seem to have been intended merely to keep the natives in awe and indeed they are fit for nothing else for the same purpose a kind of houses each of which mounts about eight guns are placed in such situations as command the navigation of three or four canals and consequently the roads upon their banks some of these are in the town itself and it was from one of these that all the best houses belonging to the chinese were levelled with the ground in the chinese rebellion of    0 these defenses are scattered over all parts of java    0 december and the other islands of which the dutch have got possession in these seas of one of these singular forts or fortified houses we should have procured a drawing if our gentlemen had not been confined by sickness almost all the time they were upon the island  if the dutch fortifications here are not formidable in themselves they become so by their situation for they are among morasses where the roads which are nothing more than a bank thrown up between a canal and a ditch may easily be destroyed and consequently the approach of heavy artillery either totally prevented or greatly retarded for it would be exceedingly difficult if not impossible to transport them in boats as they all muster every night under the guns of the castle a situation from which it would be impossible for an enemy to take them besides in this country delay is death so that whatever retards an enemy will destroy him in less than a week we were sensible of the unhealthiness of the climate and in less than a month half the ships company were unable to do their duty we were told that of a hundred soldiers who arrive here from europe it was a rare thing for fifty to survive the first year that of those fifty half would then be in the hospital and not ten of the rest in perfect health possibly this account may be exaggerated but the pale and feeble wretches whom we saw crawling about with a musket which they were scarcely able to carry inclined us to believe that it was true every white inhabitant of the town indeed is a soldier the younger are constantly mustered and those who have served five years are liable to be called out when their assistance is thought to be necessary but as neither of them are ever exercised or do any kind of duty much cannot be expected from them the portuguese indeed are in general good marksmen    0 december because they employ themselves much in shooting wild hogs and deer neither the mardykers nor the chinese know the use of firearms but as they are said to be brave they might do much execution with their own weapons swords lances and daggers the mardykers are indians of all nations who are descended from free ancestors or have themselves been made free  but if it is difficult to attack batavia by land it is utterly impossible to attack it by sea for the water is so shallow that it will scarcely admit a longboat to come within cannon shot of the walls except in a narrow channel called the river that is walled on both sides by strong piers and runs about half a mile into the harbor at the other end it terminates under the fire of the strongest part of the castle and here its communication with the canals that intersect the town is cut off by a large wooden boom which is shut every night at six oclock and upon no pretense opened till the next morning the harbor of batavia is accounted the finest in india and to all appearance with good reason it is large enough to contain any number of ships and the ground is so good that one anchor will hold till the cable decays it never admits any sea that is troublesome and its only inconvenience is the shoal water between the road and the river when the sea breeze blows fresh it makes a cockling sea that is dangerous to boats our longboat once struck two or three times as she was attempting to come out and regained the rivers mouth with some difficulty a dutch boat laden with sails and rigging for one of the indiamen was entirely lost  round the harbor on the outside lie many islands which the dutch have taken possession of and apply to different uses to one of them called edam they transport all europeans who have been guilty of crimes that are not worthy of death    0 december some are sentenced to remain there ninetynine years some forty some twenty some less down to five in proportion to their offense and during their banishment they are employed as slaves in making ropes and other drudgery in another island called purmerent they have an hospital where people are said to recover much faster than at batavia in a third called kuyper they have warehouses belonging to the company chiefly for rice and other merchandise of small value and here the foreign ships that are to be laid down at ourust another of these islands which with kuyper has been mentioned before discharge their cargoes at wharfs which are very convenient for the purpose here the guns sails and other stores of the falmouth a man of war which was condemned at this place when she was returning from manilla were deposited and the ship herself remained in the harbor with only the warrant officers on board for many years remittances were regularly made them from home but no notice was ever taken of the many memorials they sent desiring to be recalled happily for them the dutch thought fit about six months before our arrival to sell the vessel and all her stores by public auction and send the officers home in their own ships at ourust they repair all their own shipping and keep a large quantity of naval stores  the country round batavia is for some miles a continued range of country houses and gardens many of the gardens are very large and by some strange fatality all are planted with trees almost as thick as they can stand so that the country derives no advantage from its being cleared of the wood that originally covered it except the fruit of that which has been planted in its room these impenetrable forests stand in a dead flat    0 december which extends some miles beyond them and is intersected in many directions by rivers and more still by canals which are navigable for small vessels nor is this the worst for the fence of every field and garden is a ditch and interspersed among the cultivated ground there are many filthy fens bogs and morasses as well fresh as salt  it is not strange that the inhabitants of such a country should be familiar with disease and death preventive medicines are taken almost as regularly as food and every body expects the returns of sickness as we do the seasons of the year we did not see a single face in batavia that indicated perfect health for there is not the least tint of color in the cheeks either of man or woman the women indeed are most delicately fair but with the appearance of disease there never can be perfect beauty people talk of death with as much indifference as they do in a camp and when an acquaintance is said to be dead the common reply is well he owed me nothing or i must get my money of his executors  to this description of the environs of batavia there are but two exceptions the governors country house is situated upon a rising ground but its ascent is so inconsiderable that it is known to be above the common level only by the canals being left behind and the appearance of a few bad hedges his excellency however who is a native of this place has with some trouble and expense contrived to enclose his own garden with a ditch such is the influence of habit both upon the taste and the understanding a famous market also called passar tanabank is held upon an eminence that rises perpendicularly about thirty feet above the plain and except these situations the ground for an extent of between thirty and forty miles round batavia    0 december is exactly parallel to the horizon at the distance of about forty miles inland there are hills of a considerable height where as we were informed the air is healthy and comparatively cool here the vegetables of europe flourish in great perfection particularly strawberries which can but ill bear heat and the inhabitants are vigorous and ruddy upon these hills some of the principal people have country houses which they visit once a year and one was begun for the governor upon the plan of blenheim the famous seat of the duke of marlborough in oxfordshire but it has never been finished to these hills also people are sent by the physicians for the recovery of their health and the effects of the air are said to be almost miraculous the patient grows well in a short time but constantly relapses soon after his return to batavia  but the same situation and circumstances which render batavia and the country round it unwholesome render it the best gardeners ground in the world the soil is fruitful beyond imagination and the conveniences and luxuries of life that it produces are almost without number  rice which is well known to be the corn of these countries and to serve the inhabitants instead of bread grows in great plenty and i must here observe that in the hilly parts of java and in many of the eastern islands a species of this grain is planted which in the western parts of india is entirely unknown it is called by the natives paddy gunning or mountain rice this contrary to the other sort which must be under water three parts in four of the time of its growth is planted upon the sides of hills where no water but rain can come it is however planted at the beginning of the rainy season and reaped in the beginning of the dry how far this kind of rice might be useful in our west indian islands where no bread corn is grown    0 december it may perhaps be worth while to enquire  indian corn or maize is also produced here which the inhabitants gather when young and toast in the ear here is also a great variety of kidney beans and lentiles which they call cadjang and which make a considerable part of the food of the common people besides millet yams both wet and dry sweet potatoes and european potatoes which are very good but not cultivated in great plenty in the gardens there are cabbages lettuces cucumbers rhadishes the white rhadishes of china which boil almost as well as a turnep carrots parsley celery pigeon peace the egg plant which broiled and eaten with pepper and salt is very delicious a kind of greens resembling spinach onions very small but excellent and asparagus besides some european plants of a strong smell particularly sage hysop and rue sugar is also produced here in immense quantities very great crops of the finest and largest canes that can be imagined are produced with very little care and yield a much larger proportion of sugar than the canes of the west indies white sugar is sold here at two pence halfpenny a pound and the molasses makes the arrack of which as of rum it is the chief ingredient a small quantity of rice and some cocoanut wine being added chiefly i suppose to give it flavor a small quantity of indigo is also produced here not as an article of trade but merely for home consumption  but the most abundant article of vegetable luxury here is the fruit of which there is no less than six and thirty different kinds and i shall give a very brief account of each    the pine apple bromelin ananas this fruit which is here called nanas grows very large and in such plenty that they may sometimes be bought at the first hand for a farthing a piece    0 december and at the common fruit shops we got three of them for two pence halfpenny they are very juicy and well flavoured but we all agreed that we had eaten as good from a hothouse in england they are however so luxuriant in their growth that most of them have two or three crowns and a great number of suckers from the bottom of the fruit of these mr banks once counted nine and they are so forward that very often while they still adhered to the parent plant they shot out their fruit which by the time the large one became ripe were of no inconsiderable size we several times saw three upon one apple and were told that a plant once produced a cluster of nine besides the principal this indeed was considered as so great a curiosity that it was preserved in sugar and sent to the prince of orange    sweet oranges these are very good but while we were here sold for six pence a piece    pumplemoeses which in the west indies are called shaddocks these were well flavoured but not juicy their want of juice however was an accidental effect of the season    lemons these were very scarce but the want of them was amply compensated by the plenty of limes    limes these were excellent and to be bought at about twelve pence a hundred we saw only two or three seville oranges which were almost all rind and there are many sorts both of oranges and lemons which i shall not particularly mention because they are neither esteemed by europeans nor the natives themselves    mangos this fruit during our stay was so infested with maggots which bred in the inside them that scarcely one in three was eatable and the best of them were much inferior to those of brazil they are generally compared by europeans to a melting peach which indeed    0 december they resemble in softness and sweetness but certainly fall much short in flavor the climate here we were told is too hot and damp for them but there are as many sorts of them as there are of apples in england and some are much superior to others one sort which is called mangha cowani has so strong a smell that a european can scarcely bear one in the room these however the natives are fond of the three sorts which are generally preferred are the mangha doodool the mangha santock and the mangha gure    bananes of these also there are innumerable sorts but three only are good the pissang mas the pissang radja and the pissang ambou all these have a pleasant vinous taste and the rest are useful in different ways some are fried in batter and others are boiled and eaten as bread there is one which deserves the particular notice of the botanist because contrary to the nature of its tribe it is full of seeds and is therefore called pissang batu or pissang bidjie it has however no excellence to recommend it to the taste but the malays use it as a remedy for the flux    grapes these are not in great perfection but they are very dear for we could not buy a moderate bunch for less than a shilling or eighteen pence    tamarinds these are in great plenty and very cheap the people however do not put them up in the manner practiced by the west indians but cure them with salt by which means they become a black mass so disagreeable to the sight and taste that few europeans choose to meddle with them   0 water melons these are in great plenty and very good     0 december    pumpkins these are beyond comparison the most useful fruit that can be carried to sea for they will keep without any care several months and with sugar and lemonjuice make a pie that can scarcely be distinguished from one made of the best apples and with pepper and salt they are a substitute for turnips not to be despised     papaws this fruit when it is ripe is full of seeds and almost without flavor but if when it is green it is pared and the core taken out it is better than the best turnep     guava this fruit is much commended by the inhabitants of our islands in the west indies who probably have a better sort than we met with here where the smell of them was so disagreeably strong that it made some of us sick those who tasted them said that the flavor was equally rank     sweet sop the annona squammosa of linnaeus this is also a west indian fruit it consists only of a mass of large kernels from which a small proportion of pulp may be sucked which is very sweet but has little flavor     custard apple the annona reticulata of linnaeus the quality of this fruit is well expressed by its english name which it acquired in the west indies for it is as like a custard and a good one too as can be imagined     the cashew apple this is seldom eaten on account of its astringency the nut that grows upon the top of it is well known in europe     the cocoanut this is also well known in europe there are several sorts but the best of those we found here is called calappi edjou and is easily known by the redness of the flesh between the skin and the shell     mangostan the garcinia mangostana of linnaeus    0 december this fruit which is peculiar to the east indies is about the size of the crab apple and of a deep redwine color on the top of it is the figure of five or six small triangles joined in a circle and at the bottom several hollow green leaves which are remains of the blossom when they are to be eaten the skin or rather flesh must be taken off under which are found six or seven white kernels placed in a circular order and the pulp with which these are inveloped is the fruit than which nothing can be more delicious it is a happy mixture of the tart and the sweet which is no less wholesome than pleasant and with the sweet orange this fruit is allowed in any quantity to those who are afflicted with fevers either of the putrid or inflammatory kind     the jamboo the eugenia mallaccensis of linnaeus this fruit is of a deep red color and an oval shape the largest which are always the best are not bigger than a small apple they are pleasant and cooling though they have not much flavor   0 the jambueyer a species of the eugenia of linnaeus of this fruit there are two sorts of a similar shape resembling a bell but differing in color one being red the other white they somewhat exceed a large cherry in size and in taste have neither flavor nor even sweetness containing nothing but a watery juice slightly acidulated yet their coolness recommends them in this hot country     jambueyer mauwar the eugenia jambos of linnaeus this is more grateful to the smell than the taste in taste it resembles the conserve of roses and in smell the fresh scent of those flowers     the pomgranate this is the same fruit that is known by the same name all over europe     0 december    durion a fruit that in shape resembles a small melon but the skin is covered with sharp conical spines whence its name for dure in the malay language signifies prickle when it is ripe it divides longitudinally into seven or eight compartments each of which contains six or seven nuts not quite so large as chestnuts which are covered with a substance that in color and consistence very much resembles thick cream this is the part that is eaten and the natives are fond of it to excess to europeans it is generally disagreeable at first for in taste it somewhat resembles a mixture of cream sugar and onions and in the smell the onions predominate     nanca this fruit which in some parts of india is called jack has like the durion a smell very disagreeable to strangers and somewhat resembling that of mellow apples mixed with garlic the flavor is not more adapted to the general taste in some countries that are favorable to it it is said to grow to an immense size rumphius relates that it is sometimes so large that a man cannot easily lift it and we were told by a malay that at madura it is sometimes so large as not to be carried but by the united efforts of two men at batavia however they never exceed the size of a large melon which in shape they very much resemble they are covered with angular prickles like the shootings of some chrystals which however are not hard enough to wound those who handle them     champada this differs from the nanca in little except size it not being so big     rambutan this is a fruit little known to europeans in appearance it very much resembles a chestnut with the husk on and like that is covered with small points which are soft and of a deep red color under this skin is the fruit and within the fruit a stone    0 december the eatable part therefore is small in quantity but its acid is perhaps more agreeable than any other in the whole vegetable kingdom     jambolan this in size and appearance is not unlike a damascene but in taste is still more astringent and therefore less agreeable     the boa bidarra or rhamnus jujuba of linnaeus this is a round yellow fruit about the size of a gooseberry its flavor is like that of an apple but it has the astringency of a crab     nam nam the cynometra cauliflora of linnaeus this fruit in shape somewhat resembles a kidney it is about three inches long and the outside is very rough it is seldom eaten raw but fried with batter it makes a good fritter   0    the catappa or terminalia catappa and the canare the canarium commune of linnaeus are both nuts with kernels somewhat resembling an almond but the difficulty of breaking the shell is so great that they are no where publicly sold those which we tasted were gathered for curiosity by mr banks from the tree upon which they grew     the madja or limonia of linnaeus contains under a hard brittle shell a lightly acid pulp which cannot be eaten without sugar and with it is not generally thought pleasant     suntul the trichilia of linnaeus this is the worst of all the fruits that i shall particularly mention in size and shape it resembles the madja and within a thick skin contains kernels like those of the mangostan the taste of which is both acid and astringent and so disagreeable that we were surprised to see it exposed upon the fruitstalls     0 december          the blimbing or averrhoa belimbi the blimbing besse or averrhoa carambola and the cherrema or averrhoa acida of linnaeus are three species of one genus and though they differ in shape are nearly of the same taste the blimbing besse is the sweetest the other two are so austerely acid that they cannot be used without dressing they make however excellent pickles and sour sauce     the salack or calamus rotang zalacca of linnaeus this is the fruit of a prickly bush it is about as big as a walnut and covered with scales like those of a lizard below the scales are two or three yellow kernels in flavor somewhat resembling a strawberry  besides these the island of java and particularly the country round batavia produces many kinds of fruit which were not in season during our stay we were also told that apples strawberries and many other fruits from europe had been planted up in the mountains and flourished there in great luxuriance we saw several fruits preserved in sugar that we did not see recent from the tree one of which is called kimkit and another boa atap and here are several others which are eaten only by the natives particularly the kellor the guilindina the moringa and the soccum the soccum is of the same kind with the breadfruit in the south sea islands but so much inferior that if it had not been for the similitude in the outward appearance both of the fruit and the tree we should not have referred it to that class these and some others do not merit to be particularly mentioned  the quantity of fruit that is consumed at batavia is incredible but that which is publicly exposed to sale is generally overripe a stranger however may get good fruit in a street called passar pissang which lies north from the great church and very near it    0 december this street is inhabited by none but chinese fruitsellers who are supplied from the gardens of gentlemen in the neighborhood of the town with such as is fresh and excellent in its kind for which however they must be paid more than four times the market price  the town in general is supplied from a considerable distance where great quantities of land are cultivated merely for the production of fruit the country people to whom these lands belong meet the people of the town at two great markets one on monday called passar sineen and the other on saturday called passar tanabank these fairs are held at places considerably distant from each other for the convenience of different districts neither of them however are more than five miles distant from batavia at these fairs the best fruit may be bought at the cheapest rate and the sight of them to a european is very entertaining the quantity of fruit is astonishing forty or fifty cart loads of the finest pine apples packed as carelessly as turnips in england are common and other fruit in the same profusion the days however on which these markets are held are ill contrived the time between saturday and monday is too short and that between monday and saturday too long great part of what is bought on monday is always much the worse for keeping before a new stock can be bought either by the retailer or consumer so that for several days in every week there is no good fruit in the hands of any people but the chinese in passar pissang  the inhabitants of this part of india practice a luxury which seems to be but little attended to in other countries they are continually burning aromatic woods and resins and scatter odours round them in a profusion of flowers possibly as an antidote to the noisome effluvia of their ditches and canals    0 december of sweet smelling flowers they have a great variety altogether unknown in europe the chief of which i shall briefly describe    the champacka or michelia champacca this grows upon a tree as large as an apple tree and consists of fifteen long narrow petala which give it the appearance of being double though in reality it is not so its color is yellow and much deeper than that of a jonquil to which it has some resemblance in smell    the cananga or uvaria cananga is a green flower not at all resembling the blossom of any tree or plant in europe it has indeed more the appearance of a bunch of leaves than a flower its scent is agreeable but altogether peculiar to itself    the mulatti or nyctanthes sambac this is well known in english hothouses by the name of arabian jessamine it grows here in the greatest profusion and its fragrance like that of all other indian flowers though exquisitely pleasing has not that overpowering strength which distinguishes some of the same sorts in europe      the combang caracnassi and combang tonquin percularia glabro these are small flowers of the dogsbane kind very much resembling each other in shape and smell highly fragrant but very different from every product of an english garden    the bonga tanjong or mimusops elengi of linnaeus this flower is shaped like a star of seven or eight rays and is about half an inch in diameter it is of a yellowish color and has an agreeable smell  besides these there is the sundal malam or polianthes tuberosa this flower being the same with our own tuberose can have no place among those that are unknown in europe    0 december but i mention it for its malay name which signifies intriguer of the night and is not inelegantly conceived the heat of this climate is so great that few flowers exhale their sweets in the day and this in particular from its total want of scent at that time and the modesty of its color which is white seems negligent of attracting admirers but as soon as night comes on it diffuses its fragrance and at once compels the attention and excites the complacency of all who approach it  these are all sold about the streets every evening at sunset either strung upon a thread in wreaths of about two feet long or made up into nosegays of different forms either of which may be purchased for about a halfpenny besides these there are in private gardens many other sweet flowers which are not produced in a sufficient quantity to be brought to market with a mixture of these flowers and the leaves of a plant called pandang cut into small pieces persons of both sexes fill their hair and their clothes and with the same mixture indulge a much higher luxury by strewing it on their beds so that the chamber in which they sleep breathes the richest and purest of all odours unallayed by the fumes which cannot but arise where the sleeper lies under two or three blankets and a quilt for the bed covering here is nothing more than a single piece of fine chintz  before i close my account of the vegetable productions of this part of india i must take some notice of the spices java originally produced none but pepper this is now sent from hence into europe to a great value but the quantity consumed here is very small the inhabitants use capsicum or as it is called in europe cayan pepper almost universally in its stead cloves and nutmegs having been monopolized by the dutch    0 december are become too dear to be plentifully used by the other inhabitants of this country who are very fond of them cloves although they are said originally to have been the produce of machian or bachian a small island far to the eastward and only fifteen miles to the northward of the line and to have been from thence disseminated by the dutch at their first coming into these parts over all the eastern islands are now confined to amboina and the small isles that lie in its neighborhood the dutch having by different treaties of peace between them and the conquered kings of all the other islands stipulated that they should have only a certain number of trees in their dominions and in future quarrels as a punishment for disobedience and rebellion lessened the quantity till at last they left them no claim to any nutmegs have in a manner been extirpated in all the islands except their first native soil banda which easily supplies every nation upon earth and would as easily supply every nation in another globe of the same dimensions if there was any such to which the industrious hollander could transport the commodity it is however certain that there are a few trees of this spice upon the coast of new guinea there may perhaps be both cloves and nutmegs upon other islands to the eastward for those neither the dutch nor any other european seem to think it worth while to examine  the principal tame quadrupeds of this country are horses cattle buffalos sheep goats and hogs the horses are small never exceeding in size what we call a stout galloway but they are nimble and spirited and are reported to have been found here when the europeans first came round the cape of good hope the horned cattle are said to be the same species as those in europe but they differ so much in appearance that we were inclined to doubt it they have indeed the palearia or dewlap    0 december which naturalists make the distinguishing characteristic of the european species but they certainly are found wild not only in java but several of the eastern islands the slesh of those that we eat at batavia had a finer grain than european beef but it was less juicy and miserably lean buffalos are plenty but the dutch never eat them nor will they drink their milk being prepossessed with a notion that both are unwholesome and tend to produce fevers though the natives and chinese eat both without any injury to their health the sheep are of the kind which have long ears that hang down and hair instead of wool the flesh of these is hard and tough and in every respect the worst mutton we ever saw we found here however a few cape sheep which are excellent but so dear that we gave five and forty shillings apiece for four of them the heaviest of which weighed only five and forty pounds the goats are not better than the sheep but the hogs especially the chinese breed are incomparable and so fat that the purchaser agrees for the lean separately the butcher who is always a chinese without the least scruple cuts off as much of the fat as he is desired and afterward sells it to his countrymen who melt it down and eat it instead of butter with their rice but notwithstanding the excellence of this pork the dutch are so strongly prejudiced in favor of every thing that comes from their native country that they eat only of the dutch breed which are here sold as much dearer than the chinese as the chinese are sold dearer than the dutch in europe  besides these animals which are tame they have dogs and cats and there are among the distant mountains some wild horses and cattle buffalos are not found wild in any part of java though they abound in macassar and several other eastern islands the neighborhood of batavia however is plentifully supplied with two kinds of deer    0 december and wild hogs which are sold at a reasonable price by the portuguese who shoot them and are very good food  among the mountains and in the desert parts of the island there are tigers it is said in great abundance and some rhinoceroses in these parts also there are monkies and there are a few of them even in the neighborhood of batavia  of fish here is an amazing plenty many sorts are excellent and all are very cheap except the few that are scarce it happens here as in other places that vanity gets the better even of appetite the cheap fish most of which is of the best kind is the food only of slaves and that which is dear only because it is scarce and very much inferior in every respect is placed upon the tables of the rich a sensible housekeeper once spoke to us freely upon the subject i know said he as well as you that i could purchase a better dish of fish for a shilling than what now costs me ten but if i should make so good a use of my money i should here be as much despised as you would be in europe if you were to cover your table with offals fit only for beggars or dogs  turtle is also found here but it is neither so sweet nor so fat as the west indian turtle even in london such as it is however we should consider it as a dainty but the dutch among other singularities do not eat it we saw some lizards or iguanas here of a very large size we were told that some were as thick as a mans thigh and mr banks shot one that was five feet long the flesh of this animal proved to be very good food  poultry is very good here and in great plenty fowls of a very large size ducks and geese are very cheap pigeons are dear and the price of turkies extravagant    0 december we sometimes found the flesh of these animals lean and dry but this was merely the effect of their being ill fed for those that we fed ourselves were as good as any of the same kind that we had tasted in europe and we sometimes thought them even better  wild fowl in general is scarce we once saw a wild duck in the fields but never any that were to be sold we frequently saw snipes of two kinds one of them exactly the same as that in europe and a kind of thrush was always to be had in great plenty of the portuguese who for i know not what reason seem to have monopolized the wild fowl and game of snipes it is remarkable that they are found in more parts of the world than any other bird being common almost all over europe asia africa and america  with respect to drink nature has not been quite so liberal to the inhabitants of java as to some whom she has placed in the less fruitful regions of the north the native javanese and most of the other indians who inhabit this island are indeed mahometans and therefore have no reason to regret the want of wine but as if the prohibition of their law respected only the manner of becoming drunk and not drunkenness itself they chew opium to the total subversion not only of their understanding but their health  the arrack that is made here is too well known to need a description besides which the palm yields a wine of the same kind with that which has already been described in the account of the island of savu it is procured from the same tree in the same manner and is sold in three states the first in which it is called tuac manise differs little from that in which it comes from the tree yet even this has received some preparation altogether unknown to us    0 december in consequence of which it will keep eight and forty hours though otherwise it would spoil in twelve in this state it has an agreeable sweetness and will not intoxicate in the other two states it has undergone a fermentation and received an infusion of certain herbs and roots by which it loses its sweetness and acquires a taste very austere and disagreeable in one of these states it is called tuac cras and in the other tuac cuning but the specific difference i do not know in both however it intoxicates very powerfully a liquor called tuac is also made from the cocoanut tree but this is used chiefly to put into the arrack for in that which is good it is an essential ingredient  chap xiv some account of the inhabitants of batavia and the adjacent country their manners customs and manner of life the town of batavia although    0 december as i have already observed it is the capital of die dutch dominions in india is so far from being peopled with dutchmen that not one fifth part even of the european inhabitants of the town and its environs are natives of holland or of dutch extraction the greater part

is the blackness a stain but a covering which may be washed off at pleasure and the teeth then appear as white as ivory which however is not an excellence in the estimation of the belles and beaus of these nations  these are the people among whom the practice that is called a mock or running a muck has prevailed for time immemorial it is well known that to run a muck in the original sense of the word is to get intoxicated with opium and then rush into the street with a drawn weapon and kill whoever comes in the way till the party is himself either killed or taken prisoner of this several instances happened while we were at batavia and one of the officers whose business it is among other things to apprehend such people told us that there was scarcely a week in which he or some of his brethren were not called upon to take one of them into custody in one of the instances that came to our knowledge the party had been severely injured by the perfidy of women and was mad with jealousy before he made himself drunk with opium and we were told that the indian who runs a muck is always first driven to desperation by some outrage and always first revenges himself upon those who have done him wrong we were also told that though these unhappy wretches afterward run into the street with a weapon in their hand frantic and foaming at the mouth yet they never kill any but those who attempt to apprehend them or those whom they suspect of such an intention and that whoever gives them way is safe they are generally slaves who indeed are most subject to insults and least able to obtain legal redress freemen however are sometimes provoked into this extravagance and one of the persons who run a muck while we were at batavia was free and in easy circumstances he was jealous of his own brother whom he first killed and afterward two others who attempted to oppose him he did not however come out of his house    0 december but endeavored to defend himself in it though the opium had so far deprived him of his senses that of three muskets which he attempted to use against the officers of justice not one was either loaded or primed if the officer takes one of these amocks or mohawks as they have been called by an easy corruption alive his reward is very considerable but if he kills them nothing is added to his usual pay yet such is the fury of their desperation that three out of four are of necessity destroyed in the attempt to secure them though the officers are provided with instruments like large tongs or pincers to lay hold of them without coming within the reach of their weapon those who happen to be taken alive are generally wounded but they are always broken alive upon the wheel and if the physician who is appointed to examine their wounds thinks them likely to be mortal the punishment is inflicted immediately and the place of execution is generally the spot where the first murder was committed  among these people there are many absurd practices and opinions which they derive from their pagan ancestors they believe that the devil whom they call satan is the cause of all sickness and adversity and for this reason when they are sick or in distress they consecrate meat money and other things to him as a propitiation if any one among them is restless and dreams for two or three nights successively he concludes that satan has taken that method of laying his commands upon him which if he neglects to fulfill he will certainly suffer sickness or death though they are not revealed with sufficient perspicuity to ascertain their meaning to interpret his dream therefore he taxes his wits to the uttermost and if by taking it literally or figuratively directly or by contraries he can put no explanation upon it that perfectly satisfies him    0 december he has recourse to the cawin or priest who assists him with a comment and illustrations and perfectly reveals the mysterious suggestions of the night it generally appears that the devil wants victuals or money which are always allotted him and being placed on a little plate of cocoanut leaves are hung upon the branch of a tree near the river so that it seems not to be the opinion of these people that in prowling the earth the devil walks through dry places mr banks once asked whether they thought satan spent the money or eat the victuals he was answered that as to the money it was considered rather as a mulct upon an offender than a gift to him who had enjoined it and that therefore if it was devoted by the dreamer it mattered not into whose hands it came and they supposed that it was generally the prize of some stranger who wandered that way but as to the meat they were clearly of opinion that although the devil did not eat the gross parts yet by bringing his mouth near it he sucked out all its savor without changing its position so that afterward it was as tasteless as water  but they have another superstitious opinion that is still more unaccountable they believe that women when they are delivered of children are frequently at the same time delivered of a young crocodile as a twin to the infant they believe that these creatures are received most carefully by the midwife and immediately carried down to the river and put into the water the family in which such a birth is supposed to have happened constantly put victuals into the river for their amphibious relation and especially the twin who as long as he lives goes down to the river at stated seasons to fulfill this fraternal duty for the neglect of which it is the universal opinion that he will be visited with sickness or death what could at first produce a notion so extravagant and absurd it is not easy to guess    0 december especially as it seems to be totally unconnected with any religious mystery and how a fact which never happened should be pretended to happen every day by those who cannot be deceived into a belief of it by appearances nor have any apparent interest in the fraud is a problem still more difficult to solve nothing however can be more certain than the firm belief of this strange absurdity among them for we had the concurrent testimony of every indian who was questioned about it in its favor it seems to have taken its rise in the islands of celebes and boutou where many of the inhabitants keep crocodiles in their families but however that be the opinion has spread over all the eastern islands even to timor and ceram and westward as far as java and sumatra where however young crocodiles are i believe never kept  these crocodile twins are called sudaras and i shall relate one of the innumerable stories that were told us in proof of their existence from ocular demonstration  a young female slave who was born and bred up among the english at bencoolen and had learnt a little of the language told mr banks that her father when he was dying acquainted her that he had a crocodile for his sudara and solemnly charged her to give him meat when he should be dead telling her in what part of the river he was to be found and by what name he was to be called up that in pursuance of her fathers instructions and command she went to the river and standing upon the bank called out radja pouti white king upon which a crocodile came to her out of the water and eat from her hand the provisions that she had brought him when she was desired to describe this paternal uncle who in so strange a shape had taken up his dwelling in the water she said that he was not like other crocodiles    0 december but much handsomer that his body was spotted and his nose red that he had bracelets of gold upon his feet and earrings of the same metal in his ears mr banks heard this tale of ridiculous falsehood patiently to the end and then dismissed the girl without reminding her that a crocodile with ears was as strange a monster as a dog with a cloven foot some time after this a servant whom mr banks had hired at batavia and who was the son of a dutchman by a javanese woman thought fit to acquaint his master that he had seen a crocodile of the same kind which had also been seen by many others both dutchmen and malays that being very young it was but two feet long and had bracelets of gold upon its feet there is no giving credit to these stories said mr banks for i was told the other day that a crocodile had earrings and you know that could not be true because crocodiles have no ears ah sir said the man these sudara oran are not like other crocodiles they have five toes upon each foot a large tongue that fills their mouth and ears also although they are indeed very small  how much of what these people related they believed cannot be known for there are no bounds to the credulity of ignorance and folly in the girls relation however there are some things in which she could not be deceived and therefore must have been guilty of wilful falsehood her father might perhaps give her a charge to feed a crocodile in consequence of his believing that it was his sudara but its coming to her out of the river when she called it by the name of white king and taking the food she had brought it must have been a fable of her own invention for this being false it was impossible that she should believe it to be true the girls story however as well as that of the man is a strong proof that they both firmly believed the existence of crocodiles that are sudaras to men    0 december and the girls fiction will be easily accounted for if we recollect that the earnest desire which every one feels to make others believe what he believes himself is a strong temptation to support it by unjustifiable evidence and the averring what is known to be false in order to produce in others the belief of what is thought to be true must upon the most charitable principles be imputed to many otherwise venerable characters through whose hands the doctrines of christianity passed for many ages in their way to us as the source of all the silly fables related of the romish saints many of them not less extravagant and absurd than this story of the white king and all of them the invention of the first relater  the bougis macassars and boetons are so firmly persuaded that they have relations of the crocodile species in the rivers of their own country that they perform a periodical ceremony in remembrance of them large parties of them go out in a boat furnished with great plenty of provisions and all kinds of music and row backwards and forwards in places where crocodiles and allegators are most common singing and weeping by turns each invoking his kindred till a crocodile appears when the music instantly stops and provisions betele and tobacco are thrown into the water by this civility to the species they hope to recommend themselves to their relations at home and that it will be accepted instead of offerings immediately to themselves which it is not in their power to pay  in the next rank to the indians stand the chinese who in this place are numerous but possess very little property many of them live within the walls and keep shops the fruitsellers of passar pissang have been mentioned already but others have a rich show of european and chinese goods the far greater part however live in a quarter by themselves    0 december without the walls called campang china many of them are carpenters joiners smiths tailors slipper makers dyers of cotton and embroiderers maintaining the character of industry that is universally given of them and some are scattered about the country where they cultivate gardens fow rice and sugar or keep cattle and buffaloes whose milk they bring daily to town  there is nothing clean or dirty honest or dishonest provided there is not too much danger of a halter that the chinese will not readily do for money but though they work with great diligence and patiently undergo any degree of labor yet no sooner have they laid down their tools than they begin to game either at cards or dice or some other play among the multitude that they have invented which are altogether unknown in europe to this they apply with such eagerness as scarcely to allow time for the necessary refreshments of food and sleep so that it as rare to see a chinese idle as it is to see a dutchman or an indian employed  in manners they are always civil or rather obsequious and in dress they are remarkably neat and clean to whatever rank of life they belong i shall not attempt a description either of their persons or habits for the better kind of china paper which is now common in england exhibits a perfect representation of both though perhaps with some slight exaggerations approaching toward the caricatura  in eating they are easily satisfied though the few that are rich have many savory dishes rice with a small proportion of flesh or fish is the food of the poor and they have greatly the advantage of the mohammedan indians whose religion forbids them to eat of many things which they could most easily procure the chinese on the contrary being under no restraint eat besides pork dogs cats frogs lizards    0 december serpents of many kinds and a great variety of sea animals which the other inhabitants of this country do not consider as food they eat also many vegetables which an european except he was perishing with hunger would never touch  the chinese have a singular superstition with regard to the burial of their dead for they will upon no occasion open the ground a second time where a body has been interred their burying grounds therefore in the neighborhood of batavia cover many hundred acres and the dutch grudging the waste of so much land will not sell any for this purpose but at the most exorbitant price the chinese however contrive to raise the purchase money and afford another instance of the folly and weakness of human nature in transferring a regard for the living to the dead and making that the object of solicitude and expense which cannot receive the least benefit from either under the influence of this universal prejudice they take an uncommon method to preserve the body entire and prevent the remains of it from being mixed with the earth that surrounds it they enclose it in a large thick coffin of wood not made of planks joined together but hollowed out of the solid timber like a canoe this being covered and let down into the grave is surrounded with a coat of their mortar called chinam about eight or ten inches thick which in a short time becomes as hard as a stone the relations of the deceased attend the funeral ceremony with a considerable number of women that are hired to weep it might reasonably be supposed that the hired appearance of sorrow could no more slatter the living than benefit the dead yet the appearance of sorrow is known to be hired among people much more reflective and enlightened than the chinese in batavia the law requires that every man should be buried according to his rank    0 december which is in no case dispensed with so that if the deceased has not left sufficient to pay his debts an officer takes an inventory of what was in his possession when he died and out of the produce buries him in the manner prescribed leaving only the overplus to his creditors thus in many instances are the living sacrificed to the dead and money that should discharge a debt or feed an orphan lavished in idle processions or deposited in the earth to rot  another numerous class among the inhabitants of this country is the slaves for by slaves the dutch portuguese and indians however different in their rank or situation are constantly attended they are purchased from sumatra malacca and almost all the eastern islands the natives of java very few of whom as i have before observed live in the neighborhood of batavia have an exemption from slavery under the sanction of very severe penal laws which i believe are seldom violated the price of these slaves is from ten to twenty pounds sterling but girls if they have beauty sometimes fetch a hundred they are a very lazy set of people but as they will do but little work they are content with a little victuals subsisting altogether upon boiled rice and a small quantity of the cheapest fish as they are natives of different countries they differ from each other extremely both in person and disposition the african negroes called here papua are the worst and consequently may be purchased for the least money they are all thieves and all ncorrigible next to these are the bougis and macassars both from the island of celebes these are lazy in the highest degree and though not so much addicted to theft as the negroes have a cruel and vindictive spirit which renders them extremely dangerous especially as to gratify their resentment they will make no scruple of sacrificing life    0 december the best slaves and consequently the dearest are procured from the island of bali the most beautiful women from nias a small island on the coast of sumatra but they are of a tender and delicate constitution and soon fall a sacrifice to the unwholesome air of batavia besides these there are malays and slaves of several other denominations whose particular characteristics i do not remember  these slaves are wholly in the power of their masters with respect to any punishment that does not take away life but if a slave dies in consequence of punishment though his death should not appear to have been intended the master is called to a severe account and he is generally condemned to suffer capitally for this reason the master seldom inflicts punishment upon the slave himself but applies to an officer called a marineu one of whom is stationed in every district the duty of the marineu is to quell riots and take offenders into custody but more particularly to apprehend runaway slaves and punish them for such crimes as the master supported by proper evidence lays to their charge the punishment however is not inflicted by the marineu in person but by slaves who are bred up to the business men are punished publicly before the door of their masters house but women within it the punishment is by stripes the number being proportioned to the offense and they are given with rods made of rattans which are split into slender twigs for the purpose and fetch blood at every stroke a common punishment costs the master a rixdollar and a severe one a ducatoon about six shillings and eight pence the master is also obliged to allow the slave three dubbeleheys equal to about seven pence halfpenny a week as an encouragement and to prevent his being under temptations to steal too strong to be resisted     0 december concerning the government of this place i can say but little we observed however a remarkable subordination among the people every man who is able to keep house has a certain specific rank acquired by the length of his services to the company the different ranks which are thus acquired are distinguished by the ornaments of the coaches and the dresses of the coachmen some are obliged to ride in plain coaches some are allowed to paint them in different manners and degrees and some to gild them the coachman also appears in clothes that are quite plain or more or less adorned with lace  the officer who presides here has the title of governor general of the indies and the dutch governors of all the other settlements are subordinate to him and obliged to repair to batavia that he may pass their accounts if they appear to have been criminal or even negligent he punishes them by delay and detains them during pleasure sometimes one year sometimes two years and sometimes three for they cannot quit the place till he gives them a dismission next to the governor are the members of the council called here edele heeren and by the corruption of the english idoleers these idoleers take upon them so much state that whoever meets them in a carriage is expected to rise up and bow then to drive on one side of the road and there stop till they are past the same homage is required also to their wives and even their children and it is commonly paid them by the inhabitants but some of our captains have thought so slavish a mark of respect beneath the dignity which they derived from the service of his britannic majesty and have refused to pay it yet if they were in a hired carriage nothing could deter the coachman from honoring the dutch grandee at their expense but the most peremptory menace of immediate death  justice is administered here by a body of lawyers    0 december who have ranks of distinction among themselves concerning their proceedings in questions of property i know nothing but their decisions in criminal cases seem to be severe with respect to the natives and lenient with respect to their own people in a criminal degree a christian always is indulged with an opportunity of escaping before he is brought to a trial whatever may have been his offense and if he is brought to a trial and convicted he is seldom punished with death while the poor indians on the contrary are hanged and broken upon the wheel and even impaled alive without mercy  the malays and chinese have judicial officers of their own under the denominations of captains and lieutenants who determine in civil cases subject to an appeal to the dutch court  the taxes paid by these people to the company are very considerable and that which is exacted of them for liberty to wear their hair is by no means the least they are paid monthly and to save the trouble and charge of collecting them a slag is hoisted upon the top of a house in the middle of the town when a payment is due and the chinese have experienced that it is their interest to repair thither with their money without delay  the money current here consists of ducats worth a hundred and thirtytwo stivers ducatoons eighty stivers imperial rixdollars sixty rupees of batavia thirty schellings six double cheys two stivers and a half and doits one fourth of a stiver spanish dollars when we were here were at five shillings and five pence and we were told that they were never lower than five shillings and four pence even at the companys warehouse    0 december for english guineas we could never get more than nineteen shillings upon an average for though the chinese would give twenty shillings for some of the brightest they would give no more than seventeen shillings for those that were much worn  it may perhaps be of some advantage to strangers to be told that there are two kinds of coin here of the same denomination milled and unmilled and that the milled is of most value a milled ducatoon is worth eighty stivers but an unmilled ducatoon is worth no more than seventytwo all accounts are kept in rixdollars and stivers which here at least are mere nominal coins like our pound sterling the rixdollar is equal to fortyeight stivers about four shillings and six pence english currency  chap xv the passage from batavia to the cape of good hope some account of princes island and its inhabitants and a comparative view of their language with the malay and javanese on thursday the   th of december at six oclock in the morning we weighed again and stood out to sea    0 december thursday    after much delay by contrary winds we weathered pulo pare on the   th and stood in for the main saturday    soon after we fetched a small island under the main in the midway between batavia and bantam called maneaters island the next day sunday  0 we weathered first wapping island and then pulo babi on the  st we stood over to the sumatra shore monday    and on the morning of new years day           january tuesday   we stood over for the java shore  we continued our course as the wind permitted us till three oclock in the afternoon of the  th saturday   when we anchored under the south east side of princes island in eighteen fathom in order to recruit our wood and water and procure refreshments for the sick many of whom were now become much worse than they were when we left batavia as soon as the ship was secured i went ashore accompanied by mr banks and dr solander and we were met upon the beach by some indians who carried us immediately to a man who they said was their king after we had exchanged a few compliments with his majesty we proceeded to business but in settling the price of turtle we could not agree      january saturday   this however did not discourage us as we made no doubt but that we should buy them at our own price in the morning as soon as we parted the indians dispersed and we proceeded along the shore in search of a wateringplace in this we were more successful we found water very conveniently situated and if a little care was taken in filling it we had reason to believe that it would prove good just as we were going off some indians who remained with a canoe upon the beach sold us three turtle but exacted a promise of us that we should not tell the king  sunday   the next morning while a party was employed in filling water we renewed our traffic for turtle at first the indians dropped their demands slowly but about noon they agreed to take the price that we offered so that before night we had turtle in plenty the three that we had purchased the evening before were in the mean time served to the ships company who till the day before had not once been served with salt provisions from the time of our arrival at savu which was now near four months in the evening mr banks went to pay his respects to the king at his palace in the middle of a rice field and though his majesty was busily employed in dressing his own supper he received the stranger very graciously  the next day the natives came down to the tradingplace with fowls fish monkies small deer and some vegetables but no turtle for they said that we had bought them all the day before the next day however more turtle appeared at market and some were brought down every day afterward during our stay though the whole together was not equal to the quantity that we bought the day after our arrival  on the   th      january friday    mr banks having learnt from the servant whom he had hired at batavia that the indians of this island had a town upon the shore at some distance to the westward he determined to see it with this view he set out in the morning accompanied by the second lieutenant and as he had some reason to think that his visit would not be agreeable to the inhabitants he told the people whom he met as he was advancing along the shore that he was in search of plants which indeed was also true in about two hours they arrived at a place where there were four or five houses and meeting with an old man they ventured to make some enquiries concerning the town he said that it was far distant but they were not to be discouraged in their enterprise and he seeing them proceed in their journey joined company and went on with them he attempted several times to lead them out of the way but without success and at length they came within fight of the houses the old man then entered cordially into their party and conducted them into the town the name of it is samadang it consists of about four hundred houses and is divided by a river of brackish water into two parts one of which is called the old town and the other the new as soon as they entered the old town they met several indians whom they had seen at the tradingplace and one of them undertook to carry them over to the new town at the rate of two pence a head when the bargain was made two very small canoes were produced in which they embarked the canoes being placed alongside of each other and held together a precaution which was absolutely necesssary to prevent their oversetting the navigation was at length safely performed though not without some difficulty and when they landed in the new town the people received them with great friendship and showed them the houses of their kings and principal people which are in this district      january friday    few of them however were open for at this time the people had taken up their residence in the ricegrounds to defend the crop against the birds and monkies by which it would otherwise have been destroyed when their curiosity was satisfied they hired a large sailing boat for two roupees four shillings which brought them back to the ship time enough to dine upon one of the small deer weighing only forty pounds which had been bought the day before and proved to be very good and savory meat  we went on shore in the evening to see how the people who were employed in wooding and watering went on and were informed that an ax had been stolen as the passing over this fault might encourage the commission of others of the same kind application was immediately made to the king who after some altercation promised that the ax should be restored in the morning saturday    and kept his word for it was brought to us by a man who pretended that the thief being afraid of a discovery had privately brought it and left it at his house in the night  we continued to purchase between two and three hundred weight of turtle in a day besides fowls and other necessaries and in the evening of the   th sunday    having nearly completed our wood and water mr banks went ashore to take leave of his majesty to whom he had made several trifling presents and at parting gave him two quires of paper which he graciously received they had much conversation in the course of which his majesty enquired why the english did not touch there as they had been used to do mr banks replied that he supposed it was because they found a deficiency of turtle of which there not being enough to supply one ship many could not be expected to supply this defect he advised his majesty to breed cattle buffaloes and sheep a measure which he did not seem much inclined to adopt      january   on the   th we made ready to sail monday    having on board a good stock of refreshments which we purchased of the natives consisting of turtle fowl fish two species of deer one as big as a sheep the other not larger than a rabbit with cocoanuts plantains limes and other vegetables the deer however served only for present use for we could seldom keep one of them alive more than four and twenty hours after it was on board on our part the trade was carried on chiefly with spanish dollars the natives seeming to set little value upon any thing else so that our people who had a general permission to trade parted with old shirts and other articles which they were obliged to substitute for money to great disadvantage in the morning of the   th we weighed tuesday    with a light breeze at ne and stood out to sea java head from which i took my departure lies in latitude      s longitude        w  princes island where we lay about ten days is in the malay language called pulo selan and in the language of the inhabitants pulo paneitan it is a small island situated in the western mouth of the straight of sunda it is woody and a very small part of it only has been cleared there is no remarkable hill upon it yet the english call the small eminence which is just over the landingplace the pike it was formerly much frequented by the india ships of many nations but especially those of england which of late have forsaken it as it is said because the water is bad and touch either at north island a small island that lies on the coast of sumatra without the east entrance of the straight or at new bay which lies only a few leagues from princes island at neither of which places any considerable quantity of other refreshments can be procured      january tuesday    princes island is upon the whole certainly more eligible than either of them and though the water is brackish if it is filled at the lower part of the brook yet higher up it will be found excellent  the first and second and perhaps the third ship that comes in the season may be tolerably supplied with turtle but those that come afterward must be content with small ones those that we bought were of the green kind and at an average cost us about a halfpenny or three farthings a pound we were much disappointed to find them neither fat nor well flavoured and we imputed it to their having been long kept in crawls or pens of brackish water without food the fowls are large and we bought a dozen of them for a spanish dollar which is about five pence a piece the small deer cost us two pence a piece and the larger of which two only were brought down a rupee many kinds of fish are to be had here which the natives sell by hand and we found them tolerably cheap cocoanuts we bought at the rate of a hundred for a dollar if they were picked and if they were taken promiscuously one hundred and thirty plantains we found in great plenty we procured also some pine apples water melons jaccas and pumpkins besides rice the greater part of which was of the mountain kind that grows in dry land yams and several other vegetables at a very reasonable rate  the inhabitants are javanese whose raja is subject to the sultan of bantam their customs are very similar to those of the indians about batavia but they seem to be more jealous of their women for we never saw any of them during all the time that we were there except one by chance in the woods as she was running away to hide herself they profess the mohammedan religion but i believe there is not a mosque in the whole island      january we were among them during the fast which the turks call ramadan which they seemed to keep with great rigor for not one of them would touch a morsel of victuals or even chew their betel till sunset  their food is nearly the same as that of the batavian indians except the addition of the nuts of the palm called cycas circinalis with which upon the coast of new holland some of our people were made sick and some of our hogs poisoned  upon observing these nuts to be part of their food we enquired by what means they deprived them of their deleterious quality and they told us that they first cut them into thin slices and dried them in the sun then steeped them in fresh water for three months and afterward pressing out the water dried them in the sun a second time but we learnt that after all they are eaten only in times of scarcity when they mix them with their rice to make it go farther  the houses of their town are built upon piles or pillars four or five feet above the ground upon these is laid a floor of bamboo canes which are placed at some distance from each other so as to leave a free passage for the air from below the walls also are of bamboo which are interwoven hurdlewise with small sticks that are fastened perpendicularly to the beams which form the frame of the building it has a sloping roof which is so well thatched with palm leaves that neither the sun nor the rain can find entrance the ground over which this building is created is an oblong square in the middle of one side is the door and in the middle between that and the end of the house toward the left hand is a window a partition runs out from each end toward the middle which if continued would divide the whole floor into two equal parts longitudinally but they do not meet in the middle      january so that an opening is left over against the door each end of the house therefore to the right and left of the door is divided into two rooms like stalls in a stable all open toward the passage from the door to the wall on the opposite side in that next the door to the left hand the children sleep that opposite to it on the right hand is allotted to strangers the master and his wife sleep in the inner room on the left hand and that opposite to it is the kitchen there is no difference between the houses of the poor and the rich but in the size except that the royal palace and the house of a man whose name is gundang the next in riches and influence to the king is walled with boards instead of being wattled with sticks and bamboo  as the people are obliged to abandon the town and live in the ricefields at certain seasons to secure their crops from the birds and the monkies they have occasional houses there for their accommodation they are exactly the same as the houses in the town except that they are smaller and are elevated eight or ten feet above the ground instead of four  the disposition of the people as far as we could discover it is good they dealt with us very honestly except like all other indians and the itinerant retailers of fish in london they asked sometimes twice and sometimes thrice as much for their commodities as they would take as what they brought to market belonged in different proportions to a considerable number of the natives and it would have been difficult to purchase it in separate lots they found out a very easy expedient with which every one was satisfied they put all that was bought of one kind as plantains or cocoanuts together and when we had agreed for the heap they divided the money that was paid for it among those of whose separate property it consisted      january in a proportion corresponding with their contributions sometimes indeed they changed our money giving us   0 doits amounting to five shillings for a spanish dollar and ninetysix amounting to two shillings for a bengal roupee  they all speak the malay language though they have a language of their own different both from the malay and the javanese their own language they call catta gunung the language of the mountains and they say that it is spoken upon the mountains of java whence their tribe originally migrated firs to new bay and then to their present station being driven from their first settlement by tigers which they found too numerous to subdue i have already observed that several languages are spoken by the native javanese in different parts of their island but when i say that the language of these people is different from the javanese i mean that it is different from the language which is spoken at samarang a place that is distant only one days journey from the residence of the emperor of java the following is a list of corresponding words in the languages of princes island java and malacca  english princes island javanese malay a man jalma oong lanang oran lacki lacki a

easily obtained from people whose language is utterly unknown and because they are more likely to be part of the original stamen of the language than any other as types of the first objects to which they would give names it is very remarkable that the malay the javanese and the princes island language have words which if not exactly similar to the corresponding words in the language of the islands in the south seas are manifestly derived from the same source as will appear from the following table  english south sea malay javanese princes island an eye matta mata moto mata to eat maa

science at least of these different people has a common root but the names of numbers in the island of madagascar are in some instances similar to all these which is a problem still more difficult to solve that the names of numbers in particular are in a manner common to all these countries will appear from the following comparative table which mr banks drew up with the assistance of a negro slave born at madagascar who was on board an english ship at batavia and sent to him to gratify his curiosity on this subject  english s sea islands malay javanese princes island madagascar one tahie satou

similitude between the language of the eastern indies and the islands of the south sea conjectures may be formed with respect to the peopling those countries which cannot easily be referred to madagascar the inhabitants of java and madagascar appear to be a different race the javanese is of an olive complexion and has long hair the native of madagascar is black and his head is not covered with hair but wool and yet perhaps this will not conclude against their having common ancestors so strongly as at first appears it does not seem less difficult to account for the personal difference between a native of england and france as an effect of mere local situation than for the difference between the natives of java and madagascar yet it has never been supposed that england and france were not peopled from common ancestors if two natives of england marry in their own country and afterward remove to our settlements in the west indies the children that are conceived and born there will have the complexion and cast of countenance that distinguish the creole if they return the children conceived and born afterward will have no such characteristics if it be said that the mothers mind being impressed with different external objects impresses corresponding features and complexion upon the child during her pregnancy it will be as difficult to refer the effect into this cause upon mere physical principles as into the other for it can no more be shown how a mere idea conceived in the mothers imagination can change the corporeal form of her infant than how its form can be changed by mere local situation we know that people within the small circle of great britain and ireland who are born at the distance of two or three hundred miles from each other will be distinguished by the scotch face the welsh face and the irish face      january may we not then reasonably suppose that there are in nature qualities which act powerfully as efficient causes and yet are not cognizable by any of the five modes of perception which we call senses a deaf man who sees the string of a harpsichord vibrate when a corresponding tone is produced by blowing into a flute at a distance will see an effect of which he can no more conceive the cause to exist in the blowing air into the flute than we can conceive the cause of the personal difference of the various inhabitants of the globe to exist in mere local situation nor can he any more form an idea of the cause itself in one case than we can in the other what happens to him then in consequence of having but four senses instead of five may with respect to many phenomenon of nature happen to us in consequence of having but five senses instead of six or any greater number  possibly however the learning of ancient egypt might run in two courses one through africa and the other through asia disseminating the same words in each especially terms of number which might thus become part of the language of people who never had any communication with each other  we now made the best of our way for the cape of good hope but the seeds of disease which we had received at batavia began to appear with the most threatening symptoms in dysenteries and slow fevers lest the water which we had taken in at princes island should have had any share in our sickness we purified it with lime and we washed all parts of the ship between decks with vinegar as a remedy against infection mr banks was among the sick and for some time there was no hope of his life we were very soon in a most deplorable situation the ship was nothing better than an hospital      january in which those that were able to go about were too few to attend the sick who were confined to their hammocks and we had almost every night a dead body to commit to the sea in the course of about six weeks we buried mr sporing a gentleman who was in mr bankss retinue mr parkinson his natural history painter mr green the astronomer the boatswain the carpenter and his mate mr monkhouse the midshipman who had fothered the ship after she had been stranded on the coast of new holland our old jolly sailmaker and his assistant the ships cook the corporal of the marines two of the carpenters crew a midshipman and nine seamen in all three and twenty persons besides the seven that we buried at batavia  chap xvi our arrival at the cape of good hope some remarks on the run from java head to that place a description of the cape and of saint helena with some account of the hottentots and the return of the ship to england on friday the   th of march      march friday    about ten oclock in the morning we anchored off the cape of good hope in seven fathom with an ouzey bottom the west point of the bay called the lions tail bore w n w and the castle s w distant about a mile and a half i immediately waited upon the governor who told me that i should have every thing the country afforded my first care was to provide a proper place ashore for the sick which were not a few and a house was soon found where it was agreed they should be lodged and boarded at the rate of two shillings a head per day  our run from java head to this place afforded very few subjects of remark that can be of use to future navigators such as occurred however i shall set down we had left java head eleven days before we got the general south east tradewind during which time we did not advance above   to the southward and   to the west having variable light airs interrupted by calms with sultry weather and an unwholesome air occasioned probably by the load of vapors which the eastern tradewind and westerly monsoons bring into these latitudes both which blow in these seas at the time of year when we happened to be there the easterly wind prevails as far as  0 or    s and the westerly as far as   or        march friday    in the intermediate space the winds are variable and the air i believe always unwholesome it certainly aggravated the diseases which we brought with us from batavia and particularly the flux which was not in the least degree checked by any medicine so that whoever was seized with it considered himself as a dead man but we had no sooner got into the tradewind than we began to feel its salutary effects we buried indeed several of our people afterward but they were such as had been taken on board in a state so low and feeble that there was scarcely a possibility of their recovery at first we suspected that this dreadful disorder might have been brought upon us by the water that we took on board at princes island or even by the turtle that we bought there but there is not the least reason to believe that this suspicion was well grounded for all the ships that came from batavia at the same season suffered in the same degree and some of them even more severely though none of them touched at princes island in their way  a few days after we left java we saw boobies about the ship for several nights successively and as these birds are known to roost every night on shore we thought them an indication that some island was not far distant perhaps it might be the island of selam which in different charts is very differently laid down both in name and situation  the variation of the compass off the west coast of java is about   w and so it continued without any sensible variation in the common track of ships to the longitude of     w latitude    s after which it increased apace so that in longitude     latitude   0 the variation was  0  0 w in seven degrees more of longitude and one of latitude it increased two degrees in the same space farther to the west      march friday    it increased five degrees in latitude    longitude     it was     0 in latitude    longitude     it was     0 and was then stationary for the space of about ten degrees farther to the west but in latitude    longitude     we observed it twice to be    w and this was its greatest variation for in latitude    longitude     it was    and continued gradually to decrease so that off cape anguillas it was     0 and in table bay  0  0 w  as to currents it did not appear that they were at all considerable till we came within a little distance of the meridian of madagascar for after we had made    of longitude from java head we found by observation that our error in longitude was only two degrees and it was the same when we had made only nineteen this error might be owing partly to a current setting to the westward partly to our not making proper allowances for the setting of the sea before which we run and perhaps to an error in the assumed longitude of java head if that longitude is erroneous the error must be imputed to the imperfection of the charts of which i made use in reducing the longitude from batavia to that place for there can be no doubt but that the longitude of batavia is well determined after we had passed the longitude of  0  the effects of the westerly currents began to be considerable for in three days our error in longitude was     the velocity of the current kept increasing as we proceeded to the westward in so much that for five days successively after we made the land we were driven to the s w or s w by w not less than twenty leagues a day and this continued till we were within sixty or seventy leagues of the cape where the current set sometimes one way and sometimes the other though inclining rather to the westward       march friday    after the boobies had left us we saw no more birds till we got nearly abreast of madagascar where in latitude    s we saw an albatross and after that time we saw them every day in great numbers with birds of several other sorts particularly one about as big as a duck of a very dark brown color with a yellowish bill these birds became more numerous as we approached the shore and as soon as we got into soundings we saw gannets which we continued to see as long as we were upon the bank which stretches off anguillas to the distance of forty leagues and extends along the shore to the eastward from cape false according to some charts one hundred and sixty leagues the real extent of this bank is not exactly known it is however useful as a direction to shipping when to haul in in order to make the land  while we lay here the houghton indiaman sailed for england who during her stay in india lost by sickness between thirty and forty men and when she left the cape had many in a helpless condition with the scurvy other ships suffered in the same proportion who had been little more than twelve months absent from england our sufferings therefore were comparatively light considering that we had been absent near three times as long  having lain here to recover the sick procure stores and perform several necessary operations upon the ship and rigging april saturday    till the   th of april i then got all the sick on board several of whom were still in a dangerous state and having taken leave of the governor sunday    i unmoored the next morning and got ready to sail  the cape of good hope has been so often described and is so well known in europe that i shall mention only a few particulars      april which in other relations are omitted or misrepresented  notwithstanding all that has been said to the contrary no country that we saw during the voyage makes a more forlorn appearance or is in reality a more sterile desert the land over the cape which constitutes the peninsula formed by table bay on the north and false bay on the south consists of high mountains altogether naked and desolate the land behind these to the east which may be considered as the isthmus is a plain of vast extent consisting almost wholly of a light kind of sea sand which produces nothing but heath and is utterly incapable of cultivation all the spots that will admit of improvement which together bear about the same proportion to the whole as one to one thousand are laid out in vineyards orchards and kitchen grounds and most of these little spots lie at a considerable distance from each other there is also the greatest reason to believe that in the interior parts of this country that which is capable of cultivation does not bear a greater proportion to that which is incorrigibly barren for the dutch told us that they had settlements eight and twenty days journey up the country a distance equal to at least nine hundred miles from which they bring provisions to the cape by land so that it seems reasonable to conclude that provisions are not to be had within a less compass while we were at the cape a farmer came thither from the country at the distance of fifteen days journey and brought his young children with him we were surprised at this and asked him if it would not have been better to have left them with his next neighbor neighbor said the man i have no neighbor within less than five days journey of me surely the country must be deplorably barren in which those who settle only to raise provisions for a market      april are dispersed at such distances from each other that the country is every where destitute of wood appears to demonstration for timber and planks are imported from batavia and fuel is almost as dear as food we saw no tree except in plantations near the town that was six feet high and the stems that were not thicker than a mans thumb had roots as thick as an arm or a leg such is the influence of the winds here to the disadvantage of vegetation setting the sterility of the soil out of the question  the only town which the dutch have built here is from its situation called cape town and consists of about a thousand houses neatly built of brick and in general whited on the outside they are however covered only with thatch for the violence of the south east winds would render any other roof inconvenient and dangerous the streets are broad and commodious all crossing each other at right angles in the principal street there is a canal on each side of which is planted a row of oaks that have flourished tolerably well and yield an agreeable shade there is a canal also in one other part of the town but the slope of the ground in the course of both is so great that they are furnished with floodgates or locks at intervals of little more than fifty yards  a much greater proportion of the inhabitants are dutch in this place than in batavia and as the town is supported principally by entertaining strangers and supplying them with necessaries every man to a certain degree imitates the manners and customs of the nation with which he is chiefly concerned the ladies however are so faithful to the mode of their country that not one of them will stir without a chaudpied or chausset which is carried by a servant that it may be ready to place under her feet whenever she shall sit down this practice is the more remarkable as very few of these chaussets have sire in them      april which indeed the climate renders unnecessary  the women in general are very handsome they have fine clear skins and a bloom of color that indicates a purity of constitution and high health they make the best wives in the world both as mistresses of a family and mothers and there is scarcely a house that does not swarm with children  the air is salutary in a high degree so that those who bring diseases hither from europe generally recover perfect health in a short time but the diseases that are brought from india are not so certainly cured  notwithstanding the natural sterility of the climate industry has supplied this place with all the necessaries and even the luxuries of life in the greatest profusion the beef and mutton are excellent though the cattle and sheep are natives of the country the cattle are lighter than ours more neatly made and have horns that spread to a much wider extent the sheep are clothed with a substance between wool and hair and have tails of an enormous size we saw some that weighed twelve pounds and were told that there were many much larger good butter is made of the milk of the cows but the cheese is very much inferior to our own here are goats but they are never eaten hogs and a variety of poultry hares are also found here exactly like those of europe antelopes of many kinds quails of two sorts and bustards which are well flavoured but not juicy the fields produce european wheat and barley and the gardens european vegetables and fruit of all kinds besides plantains guavas jambu and some other indian fruits but these are not in perfection the plantains in particular are very bad and the guavas no larger than gooseberries the vineyards also produce wine of various sorts but not equal to those of europe except the constantia      april which is made genuine only at one vineyard about ten miles distant from the town there is another vineyard near it where wine is made that is called by the same name but it is greatly inferior  the common method in which strangers live here is to lodge and board with some of the inhabitants many of whose houses are always open for their reception the rates are from five shillings to two shillings a day for which all necessaries are found coaches may be hired at four and twenty shillings a day and horses at six shillings but the country affords very little temptation to use them there are no public entertainments and those that are private to which strangers of the rank of gentlemen are always admitted were suspended while we were there by the breaking out of the measles  at the farther end of the high street the company have a garden which is about two thirds of an english mile long the whole is divided by walks that intersect each other at right angles and are planted with oaks that are clipped into wall hedges except in the center walk where they are suffered to grow to their full size and afford an agreeable shade which is the more welcome as except the plantations by the sides of the two canals there is not a single tree that would serve even for a shepherds bush within many miles of the town the greater part of this garden is kitchen ground but two small squares are allotted to botanical plants which did not appear to be so numerous by one half as they were when oldenland wrote his catalogue at the farther end of the garden is a menagerie in which there are many birds and beasts that are never seen in europe particularly a beast called by the hottentots coe do which is as large as a horse and has the fine spiral horns which are sometimes seen in private and public collections of curiosities      april   of the natives of this country we could learn but little except from report for there were none of their habitations where alone they retain their original customs within less than four days journey from the town those that we saw at the cape were all servants to dutch farmers whose cattle they take care of and are employed in other drudgery of the meanest kind these are in general of a slim make and rather lean than plump but remarkably strong nimble and active their size is nearly the same with that of europeans and we saw some that were six feet high their eyes are dull and without expression their skins are of the color of soot but that is in a great measure caused by the dirt which is so wrought into the grain that it cannot be distinguished from complexion for i believe they never wash any part of their bodies their hair curls strongly not like a negroes but falls in ringlets about seven or eight inches long their clothing consists of a skin generally that of a sheep thrown over their shoulders besides which the men wear a small pouch in the middle of the waist and the women a broad leather flap both which hang from a girdle or belt that is adorned with beads and small pieces of copper both men and women wear necklaces and sometimes bracelets of beads and the women wear rings of hard leather round their ancles to defend them from the thorns with which their country every where abounds some of them have a sandal made of wood or bark but the greater part of them are unshod  to a european their language appears to be scarcely articulate besides which it is distinguished by a very remarkable singularity at very frequent intervals while they are speaking      april they cluck with the tongue against the roof of the mouth these clucks do not appear to have any meaning but rather to divide what they say into sentences most of these hottentots speak dutch without any peculiarity of pronunciation  they are all modest even to sheepishness for it was not without the greatest difficulty that we could persuade any of them to dance or even to speak in their own language to each other in our presence we did however both see them dance and hear them sing their dances are by turns active and sluggish to excess sometimes consisting of quick and violent motions with strange distortions of the body and unnatural leaps backwards and forwards with the legs crossing each other and being sometimes so spiritless that the dancer only strikes the ground first with one foot and then with the other neither changing place nor moving any other part of his body the songs also are alternately to quick and slow movements in the same extremes as the dance  we made many enquiries concerning these people of the dutch and the following particulars are related upon the credit of their report  within the boundaries of the dutch settlements there are several nations of these people who very much differ from each other in their customs and manner of life all however are friendly and peaceable except one clan that is settled to the eastward which the dutch call bosch men and these live entirely by plunder or rather by theft for they never attack their neighbors openly but steal the cattle privately in the night they are armed however to defend themselves if they happen to be detected with lances or assagays and arrows which they know how to poison by various ways some with the juice of herbs and some with the venom of the serpent called cobra di capelo      april in the hands of these people a stone also is a very formidable weapon for they can throw it with such force and exactness as repeatedly to hit a dollar at the distance of a hundred paces as a defense against these freebooters the other indians train up bulls which they place round their towns in the night and which upon the approach of either man or beast will assemble and oppose them till they hear the voice of their masters encouraging them to fight or calling them off which they obey with the same docility as a dog  some nations have the art of melting and preparing copper which is found among them probably native and of this they make broad plates which they wear as ornaments upon their foreheads some of them also know how to harden bits of iron which they procure from the dutch and form into knives so as to give them a temper superior to that of any they can buy  the chiefs many of whom are possessors of very numerous herds of cattle are generally clad in the skins of lions tigers or zebras to which they add fringes and other ornaments in a very good taste both sexes frequently anoint the body with grease but never use any that is rancid or foetid if fresh can be had mutton suet and butter are generally used for this purpose butter is perferred which they make by shaking the milk in a bag made of the skin of some beast  we were told that the priest certainly gives the nuptial benediction by sprinkling the bride and bridegroom with his urine but the dutch universally declared that the women never wrapped the entrails of sheep round their legs as they have been said to do and afterward make them part of their food semicastration was also absolutely denied to be general      april but it was acknowledged that some among the particular nation which knew how to melt copper had suffered that operation who were said to be the best warriors and particularly to excel in the art of throwing stones  we were very desirous to determine the great question among natural historians whether the women of this country have or have not that fleshy flap or apron which has been called the sinus pudoris and what we learnt i shall relate many of the dutch and malays who said they had received favors from hottentots women positively denied its existence but a physician of the place declared that he had cured many hundreds of venereal complaints and never saw one without two fleshy or rather skinny appendages proceeding from the upper part of the labia in appearance somewhat resembling the teats of a cow but flat they hung down he said before the pudendum and were in different subjects of different lengths in some not more than half an inch in others three or four inches these he imagined to be what some writers have exaggerated into a flap or apron hanging down from the bottom of the abdomen of sufficient extent to render an artificial covering of the neighboring parts unnecessary  thus much for the country its productions and inhabitants the bay is large safe and commodious it lies open indeed to the north west winds but they seldom blow hard yet as they sometimes send in a great sea the ships moor n e and s w so as to have an open hawser with north west winds the south east winds blow frequently with great violence but as this direction is right out of the bay they are not dangerous near the town a wharf of wood is run out to a proper distance for the convenience of landing and shipping goods to this wharf water is conveyed in pipes from which several boats may fill water at the same time      april and several large boats or hoys are kept by the company to carry stores and provisions to and from the shipping in the harbor the bay is defended by a square fort situated close to the beach on the east side of the town and by several outworks and batteries extending along the shore as well on this side of the town as the other but they are so situated as to be cannonaded by shipping and are in a manner defenseless against an enemy of any force by land the garrison consists of eight hundred regular troops besides militia of the country in which is comprehended every man able to bear arms they have contrivances to alarm the whole country by signals in a very short time and the militia is then to repair immediately to the town  the french at mauritius are supplied from this place with salted beef biscuit flour and wine the provisions for which the french contracted this year were  00000 lb weight of salt beef  00000 lb of flour  00000 lb of biscuit and   00 leagers of wine  in the morning of the   th sunday    we weighed and stood out of the bay and at five in the evening anchored under penquin or robin island we lay here all night and as i could not sail in the morning for want of wind i sent a boat to the island for a few trifling articles which we had forgot to take in at the cape but as soon as the boat came near the shore the dutch hailed her and warned the people not to land at their peril bringing down at the same time six men armed with muskets who paraded upon the beach the officer who commanded the boat not thinking it worth while to risk the lives of the people on board for the sake of a few cabbages which were all we wanted returned to the ship at first we were at a loss to account for our repulse but we afterward recollected      april sunday    that to this island the dutch at the cape banish such criminals as are not thought worthy of death for a certain number of years proportioned to the offense and employ them as slaves in digging limestone which though scarce upon the continent is plenty here and that a danish ship which by sickness had lost great part of her crew and had been refused assistance at the cape came down to this island and sending her boat ashore secured the guard and took on board as many of the criminals as she thought proper to navigate her home we concluded therefore that the dutch to prevent the rescue of their criminals in time to come had given order to their people here to suffer no boat of any foreign nation to come ashore  thursday    on the   th at three oclock in the afternoon we weighed with a light breeze at s e and put to sea about an hour afterward we lost our master mr robert mollineux a young man of good parts but unhappily given up to intemperance which brought on disorders that put an end to his life  we proceeded in our voyage homeward without any remarkable incident monday    and in the morning of the   th we crossed our first meridian having circumnavigated the globe in the direction from east to west and consequently lost a day for which we made an allowance at batavia  may wednes   at daybreak on the  st of may we saw the island of st helena and at noon we anchored in the road before jamess fort  we staid here till the  th to refresh and mr banks improved the time in making the complete circuit of the island and visiting the most remarkable places upon it  it is situated as it were in the middle of the vast atlantic ocean      may wednes   being four hundred leagues distant from the coast of africa and six hundred from that of america it is the summit of an immense mountain rising out of the sea which at a little distance all round it is of an unfathomable depth and is no more than twelve leagues long and six broad  the seat of volcanoes has without exception been found to be the highest part of the countries in which they are found aetna and vesuvius have no land higher than themselves in their neighborhood hecla is the highest hill in iceland volcanoes are frequent in the highest part of the andes in south america and the pike of teneriffe is known to be the covering of subterraneous fire these are still burning but there are innumerable other mountains which bear evident marks of fire that is now extinct and has been so from the time of our earliest traditions among these is saint helena where the inequalities of the ground in its external surface are manifestly the effect of the sinking of the earth for the opposite ridges though separated always by deep and sometimes by broad valleys are exactly similar both in appearance and direction and that the sinking of the earth in these parts was caused by subterraneous fire is equally manifest from the stones for some of them especially those in the bottom of the valleys are burnt almost to a cinder in some there are small bubbles like those that are seen in glass which has been urged almost to fusion and some though at first sight they do not appear to have been exposed to the action of great heat will be found upon a closer inspection to contain small pieces of extraneous bodies particularly mundick which have yielded to the power of fire though it was not sufficient to alter the appearance of the stone which contained them       may wednes   it appeared as we approached it on the windward side like a rude heap of rocks bounded by precipices of amazing height and consisting of a kind of half friable stone which shows not the least sign of vegetation nor is it more promising upon a nearer view in sailing along the shore we came so near the huge cliffs that they seemed to overhang the ship and the tremendous effect of their giving way made us almost fear the event at length we opened a valley called chapel valley which resembles a large trench and in this valley we discovered the town the bottom of it is slightly covered with herbage but the sides are as naked as the cliffs that are next the sea such is the first appearance of the island in its present cultivated state and the first hills must be passed before the valleys look green or the country displays any other marks of fertility  the town stands just by the sea side and the far greater part of the houses are ill built the church which originally was a mean structure is in ruins and the markethouse is nearly in the same condition  the white inhabitants are all english who as they are not permitted by the east india company to whom the island belongs to carry on any trade or commerce on their own account subsist wholly by supplying such ships as touch at the place with refreshments which however they do not provide in proportion to the fertility of the soil and the temperament of the climate which would enable them by cultivation to produce all the fruits and vegetables both of europe and india this island indeed small as it is enjoys the different advantages of different climates for the cabbage trees which grow upon the highest ridges can by no art be cultivated upon the ridges next below where the redwood and gumwood both flourish which will not grow upon the ridges above      may wednes   and neither of the three are to be found in the valleys which in general are covered with european plants and the more common ones of india  here are a few horses but they are kept only for the saddle so that all labor is performed by slaves nor are they furnished with any of the various machines which art has invented to facilitate their task the ground is not every where too steep for a cart and where it is the wheelbarrow might be used with great advantage yet there is no wheelbarrow in the whole island every thing is conveyed from place to place by the slaves and they are not furnished even with the simple convenience of a porters knot but carry their burden upon their heads they are indeed very numerous and are brought from almost every part of the world but they appeared to be a miserable race worn out partly by excessive labor and partly by ill usage of which they frequently complained and i am sorry to say that instances of wanton cruelty are much more frequent among my countrymen here than among the dutch who are and perhaps not without reason generally reproached with want of humanity at batavia and the cape  among the native products of this island which are not numerous must be reckoned ebony though the trees are now nearly extinct and are not remembered to have been plenty pieces of the wood are frequently found in the valleys of a fine black color and a hardness almost equal to iron these pieces however are always so short and crooked that no use can be made of them whether the tree is the same with that which produces ebony upon the isle of bourbon or the islands adjacent is not known as the french have not yet published any account of it       may wednes   there are but few insects in this place but there is a species of snail found upon the tops of the highest ridges which probably has been there since the original creation of their kind at the beginning of the world it is indeed very difficult to conceive how any thing which was not deposited here at its creation or brought hither by the diligence of man could find its way to a place so severed from the rest of the world by seas of immense extent except the hypothesis that has been mentioned on another occasion be adopted and this rock be supposed to have been left behind when a large tract of country of which it was part subsided by some convulsion of nature and was swallowed up in the ocean  saturday   at one oclock in the afternoon of the  th of may we weighed and stood out of the road in company with the portland man of war and twelve sail of indiamen  we continued to sail in company with the fleet till the  0th in the morning friday  0 when perceiving that we sailed much heavier than any other ship and thinking it for that reason probable that the portland would get home before us i made the signal to speak with her upon which captain elliot himself came on board and i delivered to him a letter for the admiralty with a box containing the common log books of the ship and the journals of some of the officers we continued in company thursday    however till the   d in the morning and then there was not one of the ships in sight about one oclock in the afternoon died our first lieutenant mr hicks and in the evening we committed his body to the sea with the usual ceremonies the disease of which he died was a consumption and as he was not free from it when we sailed from england it may truly be said that he was dying during the whole voyage      may friday    though his decline was very gradual till we came to batavia the next day i gave mr charles clerk an order to act as lieutenant in his room a young man who was extremely well qualified for that station  our rigging and sails were now become so bad that something was giving way every day we continued our course however in safety till the  0th of june when land june monday  0 which proved to be the lizard was discovered by nicholas young the same boy that first saw new zealand tuesday    on the   th we run up the channel wednes    at six in the morning of the   th we passed beachy head at noon we were abreast of dover and about three came to an anchor in the downs and went ashore at deal  finis
