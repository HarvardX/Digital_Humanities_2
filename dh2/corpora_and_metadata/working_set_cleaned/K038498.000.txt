the ladys revenge or the rover reclaimed a comedy as it is acted at the theater royal in covent garden  interdum tamen and vocem comaedia tollit hor de art poet london printed for j brindley at the kingsarms new bondstreet bookbinder to her majesty and his royal highness the prince of wales and sold by a dodd without temple bar j roberts in warwick lane j wilford behind the chapter house st pauls churchyard and e nutt at the royal exchange mdccxxxiv  to his royal highness the prince sir the advantage which a nation reaps from an encouragement given by princes to letters in general cannot be unknown to your royal highness whose extensive knowledge in all parts of history would make it the highest piece of presumption in me to pretend to quote authorities to show what alterations the study or neglect of letters have caused in the same people  your royal highnesss goodness in being graciously pleased to accept the dedication of the following scenes shows not only how much your royal highness has at heart the advancement of learning in general but of that branch in particular whose end is to expose the vices and ridicule the follies of mankind  i could have wished this first attempt had been an offering more worthy of the high protection it receives from your royal highnesss name but comedy though not the noblest production of the mind is not the least unuseful and it is sufficient if there is a tendency toward doing good in any work to make that work appear deserving in your royal highnesss eye  this being the only merit i pretend to i beg leave as the most grateful heart always feels more than it can express to be allowed to return my most dutiful acknowledgments by an inward consciousness of that profound truth respect and gratitude with which i am  sir your royal highnesss most obliged most dutiful and most devoted humble servant w popple  preface to the reader the discontinuing the acting of a play that has been well received by the town in general at a time when it might have gone on makes it necessary to give some account of what has past since the first night of its representation and of the motives that made the author put a stop to its run  a report having been maliciously raised and industriously spread all over the town that the play was a party play and supported by the court and therefore to be opposed numbers of persons came into the house with an intent as the term is to damn it at all events  thus determined they took hold of every little slip that  aut incuria fudit aut humana parum cavit natura  and were very clamorous however the play having had a fair hearing went off with infinitely more applause than blame  the second night the particular things objected to being taken out the play was acted from beginning to end without one single mark of displeasure in the audience  the third night it went off in the same manner to the most numerous and splendid audience that could be seen  the fourth night a set of about eight or ten young fellows went to the bedford coffeehouse in the piazza and declared publicly that they came purposely to damn the play and would not leave the playhouse till they had compassed their ends the same declaration they repeated when in the house to some gentlemen that wero there friends but unknown to them to the author  accordingly mr ryan coming on to speak the prologue they began their uproar but were soon silenced and the prologue was heard with applause the play beginning they began again and were so loud that mr ryan acquainted them that as he could not imagine there was any thing in the play they could except against he was apprehensive he had the misfortune to displease them mr quin then came on and told them he found the house was divided and as the majority was for hearing the play he hoped those who were not would go out the house on that were unanimous and cried turn them out turn them out but they saved the audience the trouble of doing it and retired under the general hiss of every person then present after which the play went on without the least disturbance  the author having reflected that malice though it could do the play no hurt might affect mr rich by keeping persons from the house who have no great relish for noise chose rather to discontinue the further acting of the play and to refer himself to the judgment of every impartial reader to whom he freely commits it being determined as frankly to acknowledge any real fault found with it as to justify it if censured without reason  the author cannot conclude without declaring how much he thinks himself obliged to every actor for the care taken in the acting it and more particularly to those who having the principal parts to perform had an opportunity to exert themselves as they did in the most satisfactory manner  prologue by aaron hill esquire when loves taught dangers animate the stage your ears ye fair let the soft scenes engage let each bright listner mark the wiles we show and catch dumb caution from the pictured woe  guiltless of farce to night the meaning player courts not your laughter  but alarms your care man the deceiver veils his cruel art and skreens himself within the attempted heart there to ungenerous empire climbs ere long helped by the confidence he means to wrong  this to detect we act his falsehood over and the deluder known betrays no more such the best business of the comic muse love has a thousand lessons to infuse  not always lightness should ungrace the scene  to laugh at folly but indulges spleen coxcombs and fops in harmless error stray and trip undangerous out of passions way misers and sots less mirth than pity move and dullness brings an antidote for love  but there is a traitor armed in amorous mail born to attempt and fashioned to prevail disguised in softness  by deep arts endeared and always dangerous  because never feared him in our glass of life to night we show nor stoop the condescending scene too low hence if too grave for comedy we seem think us but suited to our serious theme   it is no light loss when charming woman falls on our defense the sexs merit calls  we who the pictures of a world impart neglect not what concerns its fairest part all danger to that sex thus frankly shown at the same time does honor to our own nor let neglect of laughter move the pit to dread in consequence a dearth of wit unmeaning mirth may live in empty noise but solid converse swells our softer joys  once in an age of tumbling dance and song suppose not two short hours of sense too long  not even the fashion change of taste denies often merry here  let us be sometimes  wise  epilogue by aaron hill esquire balked as i am  my hearts best hope miscarried tried cast and sentenced to be hanged  that is married ere i am turned off i think it but my duty to warn in my last speech fastfalling beauty first maidens let my sad example teach ye to put no trust in man  till he can reach ye for should you strive too near his strength so mighty that down you come at once  and then  good night to ye next o ye wives trust not in beautys merit but to your bodys influence add your spirit with your eyes lightning mix a tongue that thunders believe me  love so doublearmd works wonders  yet if nor charms nor eloquence can save ye  but your good man will break the faith he gave ye be you beforehand with him  that reproving will make him own there is guilt in too light loving and for you widows  youre too wise sor teaching but suffering malefactors must be preaching so take one word of council in your calling though youre too brave i know to fear a falling  from your old yoke set free admit no new one unless with some poor brisk young kind and true one  the conscious youth long mindful of your favor will make up all defects with good behavior  loath that his wants his gratitude should smother what he cannot bring you one way  comes another and now good people what i have more to say to ye should be a doleful tune and sigh and pray to ye  but doleful tunes of late are grown so common they move more sorrow than a dying woman and sighs and prayers are best when made in private as you all know who have good ends to drive at what shall i do then  shall i hang and tarry or bold in saving faith go on and marry it is both ways bad  but i have at once bethought me of a sweet lesson dear revenge has taught me  i will stay and see sir harry in his fetters nor be so rude to swing before my betters pass but his honeymoon of sunshine weather and he and i may then go hang together  epilogue sent by an unknown hand the third and fourth night spoken by mrs younger what odd conclusions senseless poets make halfwitted rogues so grossly to mistake grant that to lay the scruples of my betters twas right to marry off us tender creatures but why thus sent away from charming london where folks can thrive  after they have once been undone how many men raise fortunes by their fall compound their debts and get the devil and all and women too as some among you know often from their fall receive the rising blow buried alive with creatures underbred i must do filthy things to get my bread these hands that used to pat sir harrys cheek must milk a cow at least ten times a week these feet that hardly could the pavement bear never more shall be relieved by coach or chair this face no longer guarded by a fan the scorching sun and ovens blaze must tan i that till ten in bed each morning lay must feed my husbands lambs by break of day born for intrigue my talent i must bury employed between my kitchen and my dairy be dressed but once a week and if i should meet with some young foxhunter in a wood tom who knows all my tricks would spoil our game thrash me perhaps and call me  what i am the farm be hanged  a woman of my spirit confined to dirty work  i cannot bear it i will even stay here  my beauty or my wit may get a keeper lord or husband cit at worst i will be a courtend milliner a shop and

laetitia dont affect gravity it becomes you as ill    laet as it does you but this is an affair that requires a serious answer which i desire therefore you will give me what do you mean by your addresses to angelina do you really love her or is it mere gallantry   sir har before i give you a serious answer i must desire to know the reason of your asking   laet i will not tell him angelina has discovered her passion for him to me that would be unfair nor should i like to be served so myself aside  nay nothing but curiosity you seem of late contrary to your usual custom to be very particular to her among other ladies and i own i love her so that i could wish our friendship were cemented yet closer that is all   sir har well sister to deal frankly with you as much as i can love i love angelina she has youth beauty good sense and fortune but so have a thousand other women now whether these will always please in angelina as much as they do now or whether i shall not want to try if these perfections will not please more in other women  gad i cannot tell  i am of such a fluctuating temper i cannot answer for myself long  at present i own i see her with a lovers eye   laet well that is enough for me it is angelinas business to keep you constant when once she gets you   sir har i hope then youre satisfied and now sister give me leave in my turn to question you  but first

away o lud i hear him coming i will not stay one moment  exit enter heartly sir har my dearest heartly i am overjoyed to see you   hear i do assure you sir harry i thought the time long on many accounts but will you forgive me an abrupt question was not that your sister that left you as i came up i got a glimpse as she shot along and thought it was that dear figure whose resemblance still fresh in my memory during my retirement ever kept me company   sir har it was indeed but she was not well dressed enough she wanted a pin or a patch i suppose or some such important matter a foolish maxim in the sex ned always to appear to the best advantage before marriage it makes the difference but too sensible after when we see and feel the neglect   hear the reason of her going was however kind but tell me sir harry are you a little more reconciled to old england than you was when we last parted have our pretty countrywomen made any impression on your heart   sir har my heart ned was ever soft and will like wax as easily take as lose an impression but i am such a convert to my countrywomens charms that i think they want nothing but a little more gaiety and life to make them as much more agreeable as they are already more beautiful than those of other nations   hear this is something i am pleased to see you can do justice to your own country   sir har prythee dear ned for once lay aside thy partiality to thy own country look upon thyself as a foreigner that done observe our charming countrywomen at a visit or a play see how they sit with their hands rivetted to their fans and placed just in the center of their pretty persons motionless unless it be to display the furbelows of that little engine and as silent   hear you are the first that ever complained of that   sir har i would have em speak in every gesture give me a woman whose very air and manner speak and are a tacit confession that they have    hear have  what   sir har what why as much inclination as power to charm   hear and have you found none such how did sir peregrines lady prove i think i left you hot in that charitable pursuit i dont expect to find you so now   sir har why faith ned it would be odd if you did a beautiful woman is like a wellwrote book every leaf you turn over at first affords new pleasure but when youre forced to read it daily from one end to the other you will find but little inclination to begin again   hear youre witty sir but is this argument only to hold good for the men have not women the same plea for inconstancy   sir har ah friend that it was but so how happy should we be but there is a fatality in the way of loving of the two sexes that renders both miserable enjoyment lessens our passion and increases theirs   hear then you was successful and now like a restless tyrant despise your conquest and seek for new acquisitions   sir har successful ay that i was to tell you a secret long before honest sir peregrine took a bargain off my hands that began to puzzle me a little how to dispose of   hear how sir harry   sir har in few words then thus lady traffic then lucia bellfast old colonel bellfasts daughter was very pretty i very amorous our neighborhood gave me many opportunities of seeing her which i improved till at last i found myself tenderly beloved i caught the infection too and doated on her promised marriage which i intended to execute the saints in heaven and her maid were witnesses to my vows lucia thought the security good and delivered into my arms the loveliest person they had ever held with joy we often met and with reluctance parted cursing the day that came so soon and obliged me to disappear before any of the family was up but the trusty maid much about this time sir peregrine came down to lucias father fell in love with the daughter asked her of him and obtained her she would have declared our affair to avoid a match she hated and to have been mine as i had promised but having no great stomach to the match and finding she would not suffer in her reputation by the affair i advised her to accept the gentlemans offer in such a manner that she saw she must or be undone i own twas unkind  she did not see me for a long time after she was married and i believe never would had not her husbands affairs called him abroad   hear and so not content with forcing this fond creature to give her vows to a man she hated you forced her too to violate those very vows and    sir har hold ned not so fast i did all i could indeed but she was obstinate and never would it was in vain to allege former intimacies she wept and answered me with her husband her husband at ever word is it not odd ned a woman should be constant to a man she hates and refuse one she loves   hear it may seem so to you but people that think there is something beside passion that ought to be listened to may perhaps be of a different opinion but now you mention her husband pray what is become of him   sir har gone   hear gone what do you mean sir   sir har why gone  gone to heaven man   hear what dead   sir har ay sir  and the generous goodnaturd creature left his widow all he had if he had not it would have been a heavy tax on me   hear twas generous indeed i heard he was a worthy man   sir har yes faith too worthy to make a cuckold of   hear prythee be serious   sir har why then in few words  her husband sir peregrines private affairs obliged him to go to leghorn these very private affairs obliged him to leave that place soon after and make a short voyage short indeed it was for the ship and crew were all cast away on the coast of barbary near sallee like a prudent man he had made his will before he went and thus my lady traffic became a young and rich widow now ned you know a woman cannot hold out for ever against a man she loves her husbands death left her without any excuse and her own heart pleaded strongly for me then she hoped too to make me more than ever fond and like a fond fool marry her she took the wrong method  however our commerce which now i am very sorry for was renewed again again she trusted me and was again deceived   hear so soon cool   sir har i should be tired of an angel

another who is on the point of dropping into my arms young and pretty as an angel   hear but can this angel vary her form   sir har time enough for that yet she is a virgin o ned there is something so charming in the first struggles of a young and yielding heart  we quarrelled last night which i am confident will advance my affair more than the most favorable opportunity would   hear well sir you

soon alas thou sickenst the pleasing warmth decays possession thy proper food that which should nourish thee kills thee pauses and looks out impatiently not yet come what can stay him  what  the first fair face he meets and yet he knows that i expect him knows too that i am distracted when he outstays his time or disappoints me knocking without ha is not that he it is now cannot i forbear to tell him how impatient i have been though i know it will draw on some angry words  enter sir harry you would be sorry sir harry to come a moment before your time in a kind tone of voice   sir har so sits the wind thus  and you madam to lose an opportunity of making me some reproach   lady traf the reproach is rather kind than disobliging  another would be pleased to be so reproached soft   sir har perhaps so   lady traf perhaps so nay it is so fie fie can you be angry that i long to see you soft   sir har no madam  now shall i be persecuted with so much fondness that my temper will never bear it and i shall fly out aside   lady traf that i bear your absence with pain and that i wish to pass each moment of my life with you i know it is a foolish wish but i must make it though i know it should offend you and yet i am miserable when you are displeased   sir har why all this tenderness for me unhappy lucia would i could love thee as thou deserve aside   lady traf whence this silence you seem uneasy shall i not share your pain   sir har uneasy madam   lady traf why do you echo thus my words and with such cold formality uneasy madam have i no other name no softer appellation there was a time i had  then twas dearest lucia my life kind lucia  such words and such a tone of voice  an angel would have fallen  turns her head aside and holds her handkerchief to her eyes sir har she weeps  nay give not way to such a weakness you hurt yourself in what am i changed have i not still the same regard i ever had is there a person i esteem like you   lady traf regard esteem and is that all is there no love left angrily keep your regard and your esteem and give em to your friends softly your mistress ought to share your softer sentiments and i have quitted all to share those softer sentiments and would were it to do again  will you then rob me of the price of such a sacrifice and pay me with regard esteem   sir har you still misconstrue what i said can there be love without esteem without regard we differ but in words   lady traf and why not call it love is there any thing frightful in the word   sir har well call it love how weak you women are each idle fancy swells into a truth with you when some one pettish humor which you have is pleased to show itself let a man act with the most strict regard to all the ties of honor and conscience fails he but in one little trifling exterior mark of tenderness when perhaps he is of a temper not apt to be fond it is as if he had done nothing no regard is had for what he does the little he omits has only power to make impression on your minds it is such a weakness  one of your sense lucia should be above those little follies of your sex   lady traf had you not used me to those little follies of my sex as you call them to those trifling marks of tenderness i had never expected em nor felt the want of em now but when i think on what you once was    sir har there it is again if a man once fools away an idle hour in soft caresses and fond blandishments in the beginning of an amor or when the blood boils high he must be ever after toying ever sooling or there is no quiet for him and he must expect to be baited and reproached as i am   lady traf false and scandalous accusation made only to color your violated faith and breach of truth you accuse us only when you know yourselves are false because we love with greater truth and that our passions grow while yours decrease and lessen by possession you cry out with a saucy insolence and show of wisdom must we be for ever toying ever fooling as if those little marks of fondness and affection that lovers give and take were a disgrace to your superior natures and a weakness scarce tolerable in ours curse on your false dissembling arts you can employ those little marks of fondness and affection you can fool and toy away not hours but days and months when you would inspire us with a passion for you how well you act when you would seduce us you are more fond and foolish even than we or seem so the better to deceive us you fawn like spaniels and lick the foot that spurns you whilst we pleased with a show of tenderness that flatters our weakness suspect no guile receive you as welcome guests and cherish you with still increasing love   sir har proceed madam i hear you   lady traf your empire settled over us you show yourselves first you begin to languish and grow tired in our company you want diversion to relieve your minds as we love you with unfeigned affection and prefer your pleasures to our own we bear your absence in that view with satisfaction that point gained you go on farther a coolness succeeds our beauties fade in your eyes want edge for your palled appetites faintly you deny it and to excuse yourselves you tell us loves a passion that ought not to make the business but the amusement of life and should be never suffered to grow serious   sir har pray madam go on   lady traf our minds affected by such new and unknown doctrine we reproach you our reproaches armed with truth perplex and gaul you and at last beget aversion in you which once born never dies your aversion draws new reproaches from us and our reproaches strengthen your aversion till at last love long since fled pity forsakes you too you leave the miserable wretch you made so to sorrow and repentance to dearbought experience guilt and shame unable to conquer her passion and condemned never to have it repaid   sir har what a deal of truth she utters that so much sense and such experience should not be able to get the better of her passion aside well lucia is there any thing more i am attentive   lady traf no i have done perhaps i have said too much i know such plaindealing is odious to you and banishes you hence  i am more concerned at the cool blood with which he has heard me than at the heat he used to show aside  perhaps youre offended come you must forgive me it is much against my will but i am as full of weakness as of love and

no sooner will she have given up her last and dearest stake but she will give a loose to all those warm desires that yet lie smothered in her breast desire fed grows strong and violent no tie no restraint then warm  tender  fond  ha the thought transports me to see the first hard struggles twixt modesty and love to see her trembling with desire afraid to show it and yet showing it through all by heaven there is not a joy in life that equals such a scene but then the following scene to see her drowned in tears regretting what she has done hiding her eyes not daring to look up and conscious that she is not what she was yet charmed with what she is for love will conquer i will not think on it futurity must answer for itself the present time must be passed away the scene of life must shift

because my master does her the honor to take a little notice of her she thinks herself exalted a degree above one of her own rank  betters mrs betty why i dont know but methinks there is no such great difference between us i am valet to a very fine gentleman and inheritor of all his vices you waiting woman to a very fine lady and possessor in full of all her follies and affectations so that as our rank in life is equal and our qualifications pretty much the same i own i want eyes to see the wide difference you would put between us   bet the fellow says true a good genteel person but then he is a footman foh how rank that smells a girl that has once tasted of gentility can never sink down to the mottly tribe at least it ought to be the last stake she plays  well sir will you be pleased to tell your master i have something to communicate to him   tom communicate to him how eloquent an intrigue with a gentleman makes a chambermaid   bet you grow saucy friend   tom come come mrs betty for once hear truth however disagreeable it may sound what can you propose by being acquainted with a gentleman if you mean no harm it is playing with edged tools you may hurt yourself though but in play

with child return to service no youre above it you change masters till you have served all the town and your wages are infamy and diseases  nay mrs betty it is wholesome physic and if you take it may make you well again   bet i could cry for madness but i dont care i will never mend when i am told of my faults in so gross a manner   tom whereas if you give way to a passion with one of equal rank

to this charming state this envied period of servitude what dangers do we not run through if our masters or mistresses discover we are married warning is immediately given and we must provide for ourselves if they know nothing of it we find so many excuses to get out to see each other and stay so long when we are sent on errands that we are sure to be turned away and then farewell all hopes of this noble settlement we live in a garret breed like tame rabbits wear out the clothes we got in service and having no money to buy more stink in coarse rags and mutually curse each other to the melodious concert of half a dozen squaling brats about our ears   tom well mrs betty you may be as witty as you please but give me leave to tell you    bet i have not done yet i heard you out now hear me i will grant you a chambermaid loses her character the other way but if she has any beauty and wit to make the most of it it will go hard if she do not make it worth her while and money mr thomas you know hides a great many faults then the elegancies of life wipe away a spot in ones character or at least make one bear with it good clothes meat drink diversions to rise from a low state to an affluence of fortune and pleasure at least to her oh the joys not to be described one must feel it after all one can at last match with ones equal he will be glad to have us if we bring our welcome with us he will not be so nice as to refuse a handsome suit of clothes because it has been a little soiled and we may perhaps be enabled to carry on a genteeler profession than a chandlers shop   tom

women in the world young and handsome too that like me with all my faults   lady traf it is false they know you not you appear an angel to them while in fact you are a devil you show not your true self at first you would not then be able to deceive so many sighs some indeed even then you might deceive but you are more cunning than to trust to that you make your conquest sure then show yourself the humble fearful modest suppliant at last becomes a haughty and imperious tyrant not the least humor of this mighty monarch must be thwarted then his very caprices must be respected ill usage must be returned with cheerfulness nay we must not sigh nor weep though our hearts break should we or sigh or weep he flies he will not see us or if he condescends to see us it is not to look with pity on our weakness or our sufferings it is to behold em with a stony heart and barbarously urge us with unrelenting obstinacy that our passions growing too violent for our weak frames we sink beneath the killing weight   sir har why then do you love this cruel tyrant   lady traf why indeed oh give me patience the question well becomes you but it is the weakness of our nature i will tell you sir we cannot confine our thoughts to what we suffer with you that indeed might cure us but we let em loose and they bring back to our charmed senses former scenes of joy there there we fall our passions catch the alarm we wake from present misery by reflecting on past happiness our passions prompt us to believe that happiness may still return we credit what we wish the fond delusion charms us and we still love on   sir har but when you know it is in vain   lady traf i understand you sir i know it is in vain insulting man you might have spared me that knowledge  where is that pride that so becomes

never see you more   lady traf i care not   sir har yet be advised   lady traf never   sir har then hear me madam such usage as this had i ruined you a thousand times as you are pleased to call it i would not bear all friendly offices you may expect from me but no more love your fame and person i will protect from scandal and from violence farther madam though you should repent this indiscretion it is in vain henceforth to hope from me  exit lady traf ha gone i know he wants but an opportunity to break with me why let him take it i can never regain his love and to share him with another or see him kind to me out of compassion  death how contemptible that thought makes me revenge is yet within my power and i will push it as far as womans malice or disappointment can carry me  reads dear

as my own going  enter betty this creature here  hold she may be of service   bet i must dissemble though i hate the sight of her aside  mem i beg you would forgive the boldness of my intrusion but i hope the news i have to tell you will plead for my excuse   lady traf speak   bet your pardon madam if before i go on i take the liberty to suppose sir harry is something to you   lady traf proceed

bet have patience mem and you shall know the intimacy sir harrys sister has with my lady brought him first to our house as he is a very agreeable gentleman it was not long before i perceived my lady grew uneasy and restless averse to company which she used to like and in short never pleased but when she was talking of him or else in his company not to detain you longer he makes honorable love to her and i believe twill be a match now mem if sir harry is engaged to you it is base in him to pretend love to my lady and deceive you as i hate false men and could not bear to be deceived myself i came to acquaint you how wicked a man he is and give you a caution against his flattering tongue   lady traf ha twill be a match say you   bet yes mem  it works sweetly i will teach him to serve me so

could happen to me so far it is well i am secure of lady traffic if i can but work upon my own lady as well i may make em all quarrel and then i may perhaps get him to myself i am sure he likes my person and that is the best hold people may talk of sense and virtue and all that they may be good in a formal wife but in a mistress let her but have an agreeable temper and a pretty person  heyho i am melancholy all of a sudden would sir harry was here yet i ought not to wish that neither for one kind word from him would make this letter drop out of my hands and at once destroy my plot bless me he is here i will hide the letter though and stand aside puts it in her bosom perhaps i may discover something   enter sir harry sir har was ever man so justly punished how barbarous am i to that unfortunate creature who owes her ruin twice to me yet what can i do i can never marry her though she has my promise i ought then at least never to think of any else yet if i remain unfixd so strong are my passions i shall never conquer em and i may make more victims still angelina i think has charms enough to keep me to herself and till i am fixed i fear i shall still be unjust  it shall be so i will stop my ears against reflection till i have extricated myself   bet say you so i may perhaps involve you more  comes forward sir har is your lady at home child   bet my lady forsooth will nothing

discourse  nay the lord knows i am sure in the humor you are twas fifty to one any thing he said could please you   laet why by expressing his pleasure at the beautiful appearance the company made by remarking the variety of tastes that reigned in the choice of clothes and by drawing conclusions from the singularity of some dresses of the sense and understanding of their wearers the wretch did not say a word of me all the while and scarce looked at me but i was even with him   ang oh i dont question that but how pray   laet why in the midst of these wise remarks which he thought i took as much pleasure to hear as he did to make sir lively brainless came running from the other side of the room and desired me to look at a young lady that stood close by me madam said he would you believe it this young lady i met at the other end of the room and thought her one of the most beautiful creatures i ever saw but when she came and stood by you she appeared to me so eclipsed and dimmed that i came to see if it was the same person i did not know her again i vow to gad lord sir lively said i you have so pretty a way of laughing at one that one cannot be angry this drew a repartee from him and that another from me so that heartly i suppose finding our dialogue too long very civilly took his leave and i very civilly let him go ha ha    ang barbarous creature how could you use him so

cursed jade betty to enter into a plot against me as to my lady traffic her wrongs indeed might stir her to revenge i must go to her and try if i can calm her my promise of marriage to her and her knowledge of my affair with louisa both fairly stated in this damned letter would have done my business with angelina  is my lady traffic above   jen no sir she is just gone out   sir har gone out

sir lively you have lost   sir live i do confess it madam the bird was flown but well cage him yet however madam i hope what mrs darnwell said was sufficient to satisfy you in the main   laet angelina is it fair to engross sir lively thus   sir live i protest and vow madam i ask pardon but i thought ned there could entertain a lady for a quarter of an hour without tiring her i had something of consequence to tell this lady  i hope madam what i have already discovered merits some consideration to angel   ang but i must have stronger proofs sir lively   sir live you shall madam or may i be blasted by your frowns like a too forward tree by the wind   ang this fool will make me discover how much i despise him before i have made the use i intend of him if i dont render the discourse more general  mr heartly laetitia methinks for two persons that are always quarrelling in company you agree very well by yourselves   laet i protest my dear you are as full of malice as an old maid and bestow it as often on your friends  oh here is my brother   enter sir harry sir har i see no marks of lady trafficks having been here yet in angelinas looks aside  madam your servant   ang your servant sir harry   laet i believe my dear we are beholden to you for his company i never see him but here   ang you would give me an ill opinion of your brother laetitia   sir har he that gets her good word madam must have more complaisance for her humors than falls to the share of a brother if you madam but think favorably of me i shall not concern myself much how i stand in her whimsical judgment   hear you see madam what an opinion your brother has of you   laet i would advise you sir to take the model from him gravely   sir live if i judge right sir a sister can best tell   sir har but you do not judge right sir and never will that is more   sir live ah le brutal he is jealous i will plague him a little  sir harry madam is so taken up with his own thoughts that he has no taste for the conversation of the beau monde your men of sense are always the dullest animals in company take em from their books and their highspun notions which they do not understand themselves and you may fall asleep for want of conversation   sir har and let me tell you sir it is an advantage to sleep in some companies your bodys refreshed and your mind not tired   sir live politely said the ladies are obliged to you   ang believe me sir lively there are charms in a man of sense a woman thinks can never be too dearly purchased your sister and i sir harry though very good friends differ a little in our opinions at least she would be thought to differ with me   hear what was the subject of your dispute then ladies   laet a mere trifle sir a man   hear twas a happy trifle however   ang i did not expect less from so polite a man as mr heartly but we were disputing at least coming to it which would make the most agreeable companion for life a man of sense or a pretty fellow   sir live shrugging ah madam  how she eyed me she is taken nay i never doubted these parts aside   sir har well madam and how did you determine the point   sir live harkee sir harry dont press this matter farther for your own sake you may hear something you may not like   sir har pert coxcomb aside   ang why truly sir harry you came in before we determined any thing about it   sir har then madam we are not too late to hear it   sir live ay ay madam let us hear it pronounce  decide   ang why really sir lively my opinion is a man of sense can never make a bad husband unless he has a bad or foolish wife he may rob his wife of many tender moments and bestow them on underserving creatures if she has but prudence she will conquer   sir live gad i dont like that though aside   sir har a woman madam that thinks as you do brings too much happiness along with her not to prevent any mans seeking it elsewhere   ang that is more than i know sir   sir live oh i thought she would come about again aside a man of sense madam will expect so many things in a wife that it will be impossible for her to satisfy him now a pretty fellow madam is easier and has always something light and gay to entertain her with   ang very true sir lively yet if i loved him i think i could not have too much of his company if not too little   sir har how delicate her sentiments are and yet how tender   sir live i dont know what to make of this though  nay madam if you will not take what i say for granted i have done i never prove any thing i only assert if it hits right well if not it gives me an opportunity to pay a compliment to a ladys understanding by retracting what i assert and owning myself convinced by her superior sense   ang i am afraid sir lively the ladies are more obliged to their sex than sense when they bring you over but let us change this discourse we grow too serious   enter servant whispers sir lively sir live a servant at my house say you from my uncle   serve yes sir and he says he must see you immediately   sir live i come  exit serve ang we shall not lose you sir lively   sir live aside kind soul she cannot be a moment without me  no madam i will but just receive the old gentlemans commands and return swift as my own wishes  or yours  exit sir har this opportunity is lucky draw off my sister to hear   hear to laet madam you promised to show me the fine screen you bought for lady angelina this morning   laet that is true it is but in the next room come mr heartly follow me and i will show it you it is exceeding pretty   hear i dont doubt it madam if it be your taste   ang where are you gadding now   laet but into the next room  my brother will be glad of this opportunity aside  exit laet and hear ang if you stay there i will follow you  what do they mean by leaving me alone aside   sir har i dont know how to begin i never was at a loss before aside   ang what shall i say to him this silence is worse than any thing i can say i dont know what to talk of aside  methinks they stay  very long  sir harry   sir har confusd i can never think the time long madam that furnishes me with an opportunity of being alone with a woman whose conversation has equal charms with her person and whose person    ang s  ir   sir har i am dumb i never put the honorable question before and am as awkward at it aside  i say madam there is something so soft in the society of a woman of sense and beauty that a man blessed by fortune in other respects wants nothing but to pass his life with such a companion to be completely happy   ang you differ very much sir harry from the fine gentlemen of the age who seem not to think sense in a woman so essential to the married state   sir har experience madam is the mother of true judgment those fine gentlemen you mention are either too young to judge right or too much hurried by their passions which fortune enables em to indulge to excess to follow what is right   ang it must however give a thinking woman some pain to find even men of sense cannot value them as they ought till they are sated with pleasures and have lost their relish for them   sir har the education of our sex so different from that of yours gives us such early and unbounded liberties that a thinking woman must look with indulgence on our early failings especially since we are the principal sufferers in neglecting real happiness to follow the phantom   ang come come sir harry this apology ought not to pass for the sensible part of your sex who stray in full daylight   sir har then madam let me throw myself at your feet and acknowledge my faults give me leave to thank you for putting me in the right way and allow me to conduct my future steps by your better judgment   ang what does he mean  you rally me sir harry   sir har well may you think it so madam the looseness of my former life which i have wanted even discretion to hide may make you call in question my present more serious resolutions   ang i must not hear you sir harry going   sir har forgive me madam if i detain you against your will let me be still more plain talk to your sense and not your sex there never was any person how wild soever he may have been but in his more serious moments has formed some scheme of happiness for life how often though perhaps you will not believe it have i pleased myself that the time would come when i should arrive at that happy calm that fits one for such a life hitherto my joys however great have been imperfect reflection will be heard and lead soon or late to a right way of acting what i have been i would have every body forget as much as i myself shall avoid henceforth to be what i shall be depends not on myself the scheme of happiness i now propose    ang i must interrupt him or he will go too far aside  if that scheme be a virtuous one sir harry i wish you success in it with all my heart   sir har bare wishes however kind cannot complete my happiness   ang when wishes are all we have    sir har there madam i must contradict you   ang what is he going to say aside   sir har the scheme of happiness which i propose is founded on that tender friendship which the married state alone can entertain   ang how i tremble aside   sir har but a youth so inconsiderately spent as mine scarce gives me room to hope i shall be credited when i assure you i have long concealed a passion i scarce dare even now discover be not surpised at this confession madam however strange my conduct may appear it may perhaps hereafter be explained could i but flatter myself that i should find in you a judge inclined to hear me with a favorable ear   ang press me no further sir harry one can never think too much on that which must make ones future happiness or misery let it suffice for this time i can see your good qualities through the cloud of passions that overcast them   sir har then madam be you the sun whose genial warmth shall ripen them into virtues this is the crisis of my fate  enter betty whispers angelina i little thought i spoke so true damned jade this must be some message from my lady traffic aside   ang a lady say you desires to speak with me on something that concerns me nearly   sir har ay it is so the devil aside   ang what can this be something i dare say that relates to his youth too inconsiderately spent indeed pray heaven no body claims a right to him aside  conduct her to my closet i will come instantly   bet i shall be revenged now sir har frowns no matter for that  exit ang sir harry i must beg your pardon for a little while a particular reason obliges me to leave you for a moment in next room you will find mr heartly and your sister i shall not stay   sir har let me beg you would not leave me quite uncertain of my fate one word might make me the happiest of my sex give me but leave to hope   ang why should i hide my sentiments any longer i do love him and wish him mine aside  well sir i give you permission to believe as you wish   sir har kneeling kisses her hand on my knees let me thank you my heart is easy now i feel a flow of joy  oh angelina may i then hope to call you mine   ang i am sure my heart is easier than it was aside  well will you let me go now   sir har yes if you will return quickly   ang well well  exit sir har i think i have nothing to fear now  at length my bosom feels returning rest love pleads my cause in angelinas breast exit end of the fourth act act v enter heartly and laetitia laet mr heartly you have been taking a great deal of pains to convince me of a thing i never can believe   hear what is that pray madam   laet why sir that you are capable of being in love   hear that is very hard madam to be denied the privilege of feeling what the meanest of my sex feels is something tyrannical   laet the meanest of your sex profane creature can love harbor in mean breasts   hear love madam knows neither birth nor fortune where it finds a soul capable of receiving it it lodges and is as pleased to warm the meanest as the noblest breast   laet i dont know what love you talk of   hear the love i talk of madam is that passion that fills us with generous sentiments in behalf of the person we like and if the meanest artisan in proportion to his sense and understanding feels such sentiments he feels love in its greatest delicacy   laet you talk like an oracle sir i shall improve   hear may i flatter myself madam the improvement will be to my advantage it is but just since you are pleased to own it will come from me   laet sir you seem too interested in your wish to be capable of those generous sentiments you require in a lover   hear if to wish to possess a woman who to an agreeable person joins a superior understanding and temper framed to please and to be pleased be to be interested i own i am so and glory in it and if to these happy natural circumstances i add the consideration that she is sister to my friend nothing is wanting to complete the fullness of my joy but    laet but  but  what sir   hear i would read it in your eyes takes her hand she turns away but you withdraw em from me it is kindly done if armed with anger not to let me see em but unkind if    laet if  if  lord what are you going to say well say what you will i am not in a humor to contradict you there now read looks at him well  nay if youre so tedious   hear tedious o i could read for ever here my joys too great for words to give it vent   laet i have betrayed myself he sees too much aside  come mr heartly let us go to my brother and angelina what will they think of us   hear i believe madam they have thought as little of us as we of them going   enter sir harry sir har o sister o friend if you refuse me your assistance now my peace of mind is gone for ever   laet what do you mean brother i never saw you thus before you seem too concerned not to command our utmost speak   sir har heartly you remember the story i told you this morning you will explain it to my sister i have no time to lose now that lady is now with angelina revenge has pushed her to destroy my hopes in her whom i had just before brought to confess a regard for me i found a growing passion in every word and look  but fear shall never see it more she by this knows all my former foolish engagement and i know her virtue is too delicate ever to consent were there but the shadow of a promise extant against me   hear this is unfortunate indeed but i would advise you to join them immediately i will but prepare your sister and well follow you time enough perhaps to save you   sir har o friend i cannot stir my conscience weighs me down i can never face that injured guiltless woman not dare behold the aweful severity of angelinas looks my heart is torn betwixt conflicting resolutions virtue and passion move me with such equal force i can yield to neither and to live divided thus    hear come come you must go the presence of what we love often weakens the strongest argument against us   laet aside there is some truth in that come brother mr heartly advises well   hear nay i will be master now  forces him out another apartment of angelinas enter angelina and lady traffic lady traf you have heard my story madam   ang i have heard indeed too much aside   lady traf what can you expect from one so void of honor and of truth   ang what indeed   lady traf it is true i cannot force him to marry me but till i have disengaged him from his vow he cannot be anothers   ang oh no if what you say is true and there is but too much reason to believe it though i loved him better than ever woman yet loved i never would be his nor will i build my happiness on your misfortune   lady traf i thank you madam i expected no less from you  angelina walks about concerned  enter sir harry ha he is here be firm my heart and let me speak my wrongs though i should lose him quite and be for ever miserable   sir har it is she confusion i read my fate in angelinas looks   lady traf here madam he is be you my judge if he denies a word of what i say let me be still more wretched if possible than i am  sir  i cannot look at him and speak  yet i must  sir it is to you i speak answer me did you not rob me of my innocence under the solemn promise of marriage were not our vows exchanged and mutually plighted to each other did you not break these vows almost as soon as made and force me though my tears and faithful love to you spoke my reluctance to give myself to another did you not even tempt me to violate the very vows which you compelled me to make i was not quite so lost to virtue can you deny all this  no your silence justifies the charge   ang i see too plain it does i want no other proof  madam believe i feel your wrongs as if they were my own compassion is the glory of our sex and well becomes its softness  it is now too late sir harry to deny i had harbored some favorable sentiments of you but though i have a soul that can love know it can combat any sentiment which wrongs another or itself you see sir the reason of my conduct and cannot censure my justice   sir har i cannot indeed your sentence madam is just the wrongs i have done this lady whose only fault was loving me too tenderly merit the severest punishment you have it in your power and do inflict it i have made one miserable would there were but one it is just i should be so myself lucia you seem to be surpised to see me with so calm a look know that i am ashamed of my inhuman usage of you and will make any amends within my power you sought revenge you have it and i blame you not could love once fled return even that i would give for i have been a savage to you and wanted even humanity to pity you   lady traf these words sir harry at another time had made me the happiest of my sex but now they serve to make me the most miserable i see by sad experience i render both myself and you unhappy but i will tear this tyrant love from my fond bosom since it can meet with no return from yours   sir har let me but tell you what return you may expect   lady traf what would you tell me i know you cannot love me were it in your power i do believe you would i know you are human tender and goodnatured but wild desires and unruly passions tear up all that is generous in you and leave you to a considering mind an object of compassion even more than me   ang who could wrong such goodness aside   lady traf hear me sir harry it is perhaps for the last time i can never hate you hate you did i say  ah no i must for ever love you spite of myself it is equitable too i should thus wise providence will make my crime my punishment   sir har call it not so twas i deceived you you believed me lawfully yours and indulged a fondness that well became your youth and passion add not to your unhappy fate a crime you were not guilty of   lady traf no more of that for my own peace i will avoid seeing you more i give up all those flattering thoughts of happiness with which i fed my poor deluded heart a happiness that was so great it stifled all the cries of conscience and of honor my future care shall be to make my peace with heaven and lead a life if possible without misery   sir har how contemptible do i appear to her superior merit   lady traf i came hither with a design to revenge myself on you but i have since reflected i could not punish you without involving more than the guilty nay i find i cannot have the heart to punish you   ang generous creature aside   lady traf hear me whilst you continue free and disengaged i shall still think i have some right to you and perhaps indulge some fond wishes that will only make me miserable were you engaged the knowledge that you cannot be mine would strengthen my reason and free my future life from conflicts dangerous to my peace of mind   ang ha what is that aside   lady traf madam it is to you i now speak i told you of a promise of marriage from sir harry to me made in early youth as we were both too young to judge of happiness when that vow was made i here acquit him of his promise and withdraw my own he is now free   ang this is too much i will never be outdone in generosity   sir har lucia you have indeed revenged yourself this generous action will never be forgot nor ever be remembered but with pain  turns to ang ang hold sir true happiness must be without alloy i shall never think of this lady but i shall look upon myself as a bar to her peace of mind and though through excess of goodness which very goodness should confound you she can give up her happiness to procure that of the man by whom she is ruined i never can consent and never will your reason sir harry points the path you have to follow mine which i am to avoid   lady traf the sentiment madam is kind and generous but my misery or happiness must henceforward depend upon myself alone and i madam will never be his he is free  here sir harry is your letter i could almost wish i had never seen it but since i have let me beg you never to see that person more her passion is but young she yet may conquer it if you avoid seeing her   sir har i never will   ang take comfort madam there are but few that know this fatal secret believe me madam as delicate a sense of virtue as i have i do acquit you have patience you may yet be happy   lady traf i will be governed by you your leave madam at present to retire i am unfit to stay   ang yet more unfit to go make my house your home till you are more recovered betty conduct the lady out i will follow soon  exit lady traf with betty enter heartly and laetitia laet poor lady she well deserves a better fate  we have overheard all and now my

harkee she is a fine woman faith   sir har well and you saw her   ang how he questions him aside   sir live ay but such a sight i found her all in tears just recovered from a fainting fit i suppose her fathers letter with the news of her sudden happiness disordered her   sir har aside i fancy i could give a better reason for it   sir live but egad i never minded that i made my speech and twas a pretty one upon my honor   sir har i believe you sir  turns away sir live so cold perhaps sir you are some secret rival   sir har no faith sir and to prove that i have no pretension to her if this lady since you have told her she must not think of you were inclined to believe she has charms enough to reclaim me    ang i dont know whether i ought to venture it is a great risque when happiness lies at stake but come sir harry it is too late now to go back here is my hand if i have reason to repent i can blame none but myself   sir har i dare venture to assure you you will have none   hear must we be idle madam to laet   laet is there so much haste   hear madam i will wait your leisure  affecting gravity laet do you hear the creature well i will punish you i am resolved and consent at

thought they both go together   sir live if they dont ned it is no great matter if one comes first the other will soon follow poor rogues they cannot keep their hearts long from us when they have once made us masters of the key to them ha ha   enter betty bet i am impatient till i know what is done i will venture in  madam did your ladyship call   ang no   bet has your ladyship any more commands

are now engaged in a voyage for life it is for both our interests to make it agreeable and happy i shall do my endeavor to give you no uneasiness let us forget the past and look forward  when passion governs with despotick sway and its enchanting dictates we obey our spirits lifted up a while we sail and plough loves ocean with a prosperous gale till like a tempest vice at last appears and full on
