a true relation of the apparition of one mrs veal the next day after her death to one mrs bargrave at canterbury the  th of september   0   london printed for b bragg at the black raven in paternoster row   0   the preface this relation is matter of fact and attended with such circumstances as may induce any reasonable man to believe it it was sent by a gentleman a justice of peace at maidstone in kent and a very intelligent person to his friend in london as it is here worded which discourse is attested by a very sober and understanding gentlewoman a kinswoman of the said gentlemans who lives in canterbury within a few doors of the house in whi the within named mrs bargrave lives who believes his kinswoman to be of so discerning a spirit as not to be put upon by any fallacy and who possitively assured him that the whole matter as it is here related and laid down is what is really true and what she her self had in the same words as near as may be from mrs bargraves own mouth who she knows had no reason to invent and publish such a story nor any design to forge and tell a lie being a woman of much honesty and virtue and her whole life a course as it were of piety the use which we ought to make of it is to consider that there is a life to come after this and a just god who will retribute to every one according to the deeds done in the body and therefore to reflect upon our past course of life we have led in the world that our time is short and uncertain and that if we would escape the punishment of the ungodly and receive the reward of the righteous which is the laying hold of eternal life we ought for the time to come to turn to god by a speedy repentance ceasing to do evil and learning to do well to seek after god early if happily he may be found of us and lead such lives for the future as may be well pleasing in his sight  a relation of the apparition of mrs veal this thing is so rare in all its circumstances and on so good authority that my reading and conversation has not given me any thing like it it is fit to gratify the most ingenious and serious enquirer mrs bargrave is the person to whom mrs veal appeared after her death she is my intimate friend and i can avouch for her reputation for these last fifteen or sixteen years on my own knowledge and i can confirm the good character she had from her youth to the time of my acquaintance though since this relation she is calumniated by some people that are friends to the brother of mrs veal who appeared who think the relation of this appearance to be a reflection and endeavor what they can to blast mrs bargraves reputation and to laugh the story out of countenance but the circumstances thereof and the cheerful disposition of mrs bargrave notwithstanding the unheard of ill usage of a very wicked husband there is not the least sign of dejection in her face nor did i ever hear her let fall a desponding or murmuring expression nay not when actually under her husbands barbarity which i have been witness to and several other persons of undoubted reputation  now you must know that mrs veal was a maiden gentlewoman of about  0 years of age and for some years last past had been troubled with fits which were perceived coming on her by her going off from her discourse very abruptly to some impertinence she was maintained by an only brother and kept his house in dover she was a very pious woman and her brother a very sober man to all appearance but now he does all he can to null or quash the story mrs veal was intimately acquainted with mrs bargrave from her childhood mrs veals circumstances were then mean her father did not take care of his children as he ought so that they were exposed to hardships and mrs bargrave in those days had as unkind a father though she wanted for neither food nor clothing whilst mrs veal wanted for both so that it was in the power of mrs bargrave to be very much her friend in several instances which mightily endeared mrs veal insomuch that she would often say mrs bargrave you are not only the best but the only friend i have in the world and no circumstances of life shall ever dissolve my friendship they would often condole each others adverse fortune and read together drelincourt upon death and other good books and so like two christian friends they comforted each other under their sorrow  sometime after mr veals friends got him a place in the customhouse at dover which occasioned mrs veal by little and little to fall off from her intimacy with mrs bargrave though there was never any such thing as a quarrel but an indifferency came on by degrees till at last mrs bargrave had not seen her in two years and a half though above a twelve month of the time mrs bargrave had been absent from dover and this last half year has been in canterbury about two months of the time dwelling in a house of her own  in this house on the eighth of september last viz   0  she was sitting alone in the forenoon thinking over her unfortunate life and arguing her self into a due resignation to providence though her condition seemed hard and said she i have been provided for hitherto and doubt not but i shall be still and am well satisfied that my afflictions shall end when it is most fit for me and then took up her sewingwork which she had no sooner done but she hears a knocking at the door she went to see who it was there and this proved to be mrs veal her old friend who was in a riding habit at that moment of time the clock struck twelve at noon  madam says mrs bargrave i am surprised to see you you have been so long a stranger but told her she was glad to see her and offered to salute her which mrs veal complied with till their lips almost touched and then mrs veal drew her hand cross her own eyes and said i am not very well and so waved it she told mrs bargrave she was going a journey and had a great mind to see her first but says mrs bargrave how came you to take a journey alone i am amazed at it because i know you have so fond a brother o says mrs veal i gave my brother the slip and came away because i had so great a mind to see you before i took my journey so mrs bargrave went in with her into another room within the first and mrs veal sat her self down in an elbowchair in which mrs bargrave was sitting when she heard mrs veal knock then says mrs veal my dear friend i am come to renew our old friendship again and to beg your pardon for my breach of it and if you can forgive me you are one of the best of women o says mrs bargrave dont mention such a thing i have not had an uneasy thought about it i can easily forgive it what did you think of me says mrs veal says mrs bargrave i thought you were like the rest of the world and that prosperity had made you forget your self and me then mrs veal reminded mrs bargrave of the many friendly offices she did her in former days and much of the conversation they had with each other in the time of their adversity what books they read and what comfort in particular they received from drelincourts book of death which was the best she said on that subject was ever wrote she also mentioned dr sherlock and two dutch books which were translated wrote upon death and several others but drelincourt she said had the clearest notions of death and of the future state of any who have handled that subject then she asked mrs bargrave whether she had drelincourt she said yes says mrs veal fetch it and so mrs bargrave goes up stairs and brings it down says mrs veal dear mrs bargrave if the eyes of our faith were as open as the eyes of our body we should see numbers of angels about us for our guard the notions we have of heaven now are nothing like what it is as drelincourt says therefore be comforted under your afflictions and believe that the almighty has a particular regard to you and that your afflictions are marks of gods favor and when they have done the business they were sent for they shall be removed from you and believe me my dear friend believe what i say to you one minute of future happiness will infinitely reward you for all your sufferings for i can never believe and claps her hand upon her knee with a great deal of earnestness which indeed ran through all her discourse that ever god will suffer you to spend all your days in this afflicted state but be assured that your afflictions shall leave you or you them in a short time she spoke in that pathetical and heavenly manner that mrs bargrave wept several times she was so deeply affected with it then mrs veal mentioned dr hornecks ascetick at the end of which he gives an account of the lives of the primitive christians their pattern she recommended to our imitation and said their conversation was not like this of our age for now says she there is nothing but frothy vain discourse which is far different from theirs theirs was to edification and to build one another up in the faith so that they were not as we are nor are we as they are but said she we might do as they did there was a hearty friendship among them but where is it now to be found says mrs bargrave it is hard indeed to find a true friend in these days says mrs veal mr norris has a fine copy of verses called friendship in perfection which i wonderfully admire have you seen the book says mrs veal no says mrs bargrave but i have the verses of my own writing out have you says mrs veal then fetch them which she did from above stairs and offered them to mrs veal to read who refused and waved the thing saying holding down her head would make it ache and then desired mrs bargrave to read them to her which she did as they were admiring friendship mrs veal said dear mrs bargrave i shall love you for ever in the verses there is twice used the word elysium ah says mrs veal these poets have such names for heaven she would often draw her hand cross her own eyes and say mrs bargrave dont you think i am mightily impaired by my fits no says mrs bargrave i think you look as well as ever i knew you  after all this discourse which the apparition put in words much finer than mrs bargrave said she could pretend to and was much more than she can remember for it cannot be thought that an hour and three quarters conversation could all be retained though the main of it she thinks she does she said to mrs bargrave she would have her write a letter to her brother and tell him she would have him give rings to such and such and that there was a purse of gold in her cabinet and that she would have two broad pieces given to her cousin watson talking at this rate mrs bargrave thought that a fit was coming upon her and so placed her self in a chair just before her knees to keep her from falling to the ground if her fits should occasion it for the elbow chair she thought would keep her from falling on either side and to divert mrs veal as she thought she took hold of her gown sleeve several times and commended it mrs veal told her it was a scowerd silk and newly made up but for all this mrs veal persisted in her request and told mrs bargrave she must not deny her and she would have her tell her brother all their conversation when she had an opportunity dear mrs veal says mrs bargrave this seems so impertinent that i cannot tell how to comply with it and what a mortifying story will our conversation be to a young gentleman well says mrs veal i must not be denied why says mrs bargrave it is much better methinks to do it your self no says mrs veal though it seems impertinent to you now you will see more reason for it hereafter mrs bargrave then to satisfy her importunity was going to fetch a pen and ink but mrs veal said let it alone now and do it when i am gone but you must be sure to do it which was one of the last things she enjoined her at parting and so she promised her  then mrs veal asked for mrs bargraves daughter she said she was not at home but if you have a mind to see her says mrs bargrave i will send for her do says mrs veal on which she left her and went to a neighbors to send for her and by the time mrs bargrave was returning mrs veal was got without the door in the street in the face of the beastmarket on a saturday which is market day and stood ready to part as soon as mrs bargrave came to her she asked her why she was in such have she said she must be going though perhaps she might not go her journey till monday and told mrs bargrave she hoped she should see her again at her cousin watsons before she went whether she was a going then she said she would not take her leave of her and walked from mrs bargrave in her view till a turning interrupted the sight of her which was three quarters after one in the afternoon  mrs veal dyed the  th of september at    a clock at noon of her fits and had not above four hours senses before her death in which time she received the sacrament the next day after mrs veals appearing being sunday mrs bargrave was mightily indisposed with a cold and a sore throat that she could not go out that day but on monday morning she sends a person to captain watsons to know if mrs veal were there they wondered at mrs bargraves enquiry and sent her word that she was not there nor was expected at this answer mrs bargrave told the maid she had certainly mistook the name or made some blunder and though she was ill she put on her hood and went her self to captain watsons though she knew none of the family to see if mrs veal was there or not they said they wondered at her asking for that she had not been in town they were sure if she had she would have been there says mrs bargrave i am sure she was with me on saturday almost two hours they said it was impossible for they must have seen her if she had in comes captain watson while they were in dispute and said that mrs veal was certainly dead and her escocheons were making this strangely surprised mrs bargrave who went to the person immediately who had the care of them and found it true then she related the whole story to captain watsons family and what gown she had on and how striped and that mrs veal told her it was scowred then mrs watson cried out you have seen her indeed for none knew but mrs veal and my self that the gown was scowrd and mrs watson owned that she described the gown exactly for said she i helped her to make it up this mrs watson blazed all about the town and avouchd the demonstration of the truth of mrs bargraves seeing mrs veals apparition and captain watson carried two gentlemen immediately to mrs bargraves house to hear the relation from her own mouth and then it spread so fast that gentlemen and persons of quality the judicious and skeptical part of the world flockt in upon her which at last became such a task that she was forced to go out of the way for they were in general extremely satisfied of the truth of the thing and plainly saw that mrs bargrave was no hypochondriack for she always appears with such a cheerful air and pleasing mien that she has gained the favor and esteem of all the gentry and its thought a great favor if they can but get the relation from her own mouth i should have told you before that mrs veal told mrs bargrave that her sister and brother in law were just come down from london to see her says mrs bargrave how came you to order matters so strangely it could not be helped said mrs veal and her sister and brother did come to see her and entered the town of dover just as mrs veal was expiring mrs bargrave asked her whether she would not drink some tea says mrs veal i do not care if i do but i will warrant this mad fellow meaning mrs bargraves husband has broke all your trinckets but says mrs bargrave i will get something to drink in for all that but mrs veal waved it and said it is no matter let it alone and so it passed  all the time i sat with mrs bargrave which was some hours she recollected fresh sayings of mrs veal and one material thing more she told mrs bargrave that old mr breton allowed mrs veal ten pounds a year which was a secret and unknown to mrs bargrave till mrs veal told it her mrs bargrave never varies in her story which puzzles those who doubt of the truth or are unwilling to believe it a servant in a neighbors yard adjoining to mrs bargraves house heard her talking to some body an hour of the time mrs veal was with her mrs bargrave went out to her next neighbors the very moment she parted with mrs veal and told what ravishing conversation she had with an old friend and told the whole of it drelincourts book of death is since this happened bought up strangely and it is to be observed that notwithstanding all this trouble and fatigue mrs bargrave has undergone upon this account she never took the value of a farthing nor suffered her daughter to take any thing of any body and therefore can have no interest in telling the story  but mr veal does what he can to stifle the matter and said he would see mrs bargrave but yet it is certain matter fact that he has been at captain watsons since the death of his sister and yet never went near mrs bargrave and some of his friends report her to be a great liar and that she knew of mr bretons ten pounds a year but the person who pretends to say so has the reputation of a notorious liar among persons which i know to be of undoubted repute now mr veal is more a gentleman than to say she lies but says a bad husband has crazed her but she needs only to present her self and it will effectually confute that pretense mr veal says he asked his sister on her death bed whether she had a mind to dispose of any thing and she said no now what the things which mrs veals apparition would have disposed of were so trifling and nothing of justice aimed at in their disposal that the design of it appears to me to be only in order to make mrs bargrave so to demonstrate the truth of her appearance as to satisfy the world of the reality thereof as to what she had seen and heard and to secure her reputation among the reasonable and understanding part of mankind and then again mr veal owns that there was a purse of gold but it was not found in her cabinet but in a combbox this looks improbable for that mrs watson owned that mrs veal was so very careful of the key of her cabinet that she would trust no body with it and if so no doubt she would not trust her gold out of it and mrs veals often drawing her hand over her eyes and asking mrs bargrave whether her fits had not impaired her looks to me as if she did it on purpose to remind mrs bargrave of her fits to prepare her not to think it strange that she should put her upon writing to her brother to dispose of rings and gold which looked so much like a dying persons bequest and it took accordingly with mrs bargrave as the effect of her fits coming upon her and was one of the many instances of her wonderful love to her and care of her that she should nor be affrighted which indeed appears in her whole management particularly in her coming to her in the day time waving the salutation and when she was alone and then the manner of her parting to prevent a second attempt to salute her  now why mr veal should think this relation a reflection as it is plain he does by his endeavoring to stifle it i cannot imagine because the generality believe her to be a good spirit her discourse was so heavenly her two great errands were to comfort mrs bargrave in her affliction and to ask her forgiveness for her breach of friendship and with a pious discourse to encourage her so that after all to suppose that mrs bargrave could hatch such an invention as this from fridaynoon till saturdaynoon supposing that she knew of mrs veals death the very first moment without jumbling circumstances and without any interest too she must be more witty fortunate and wicked too than any indifferent person i dare say will allow i asked mrs bargrave several times if she was sure she felt the gown she answered modestly if my senses be to be relied on i am sure of it i asked her if she heard a sound when she clapped her hand upon her knee she said she did not remember she did and she said she appeared to be as much a substance as i did who talked with her and i may said she be as soon persuaded that your apparition is talking to me now as that i did not really see her for i was under no manner of fear i received her as a friend and parted with her as such i would not says she give one farthing to make any one believe it i have no interest in it nothing but trouble is entailed upon me for a long time for ought that i know and had it not come to light by accident it would never have been made public but now she says she will make her own private use of it and keep her self out of the way as much as she can and so she has done since she says she had a gentleman who came thirty miles to her to hear the relation and that she had told it to a room full of people at a time several particular gentlemen have had the story from mrs bargraves own mouth  this thing has very much affected me and i am as well satisfied as i am of the best grounded matter of fact and why should we dispute matter of fact because we cannot solve things of which we can have no certain or demonstrative notions seems strange to me mrs bargravess authority and sincerity alone would have been undoubted in any other case  finis advertisement drelincourtss book of the consolations against the fears of death has been four times printed already in english of which many thousands have been sold and not without great applause and its bearing so great a character in this relation the impression is near sold off
