the battle of ramillia or the power of union a poem  in five books  by mr dennis  london printed for ben bragg at the raven in paternoster row   0   to the right honorable charles lord halifax my lord this poem which was writ with a design to show the prevalence and power of union could to no person be more properly addressed than your lordship who have ever since you have appeared in the world been so great a promoter of union  in those great offices of the highest trust in which your lordship has been employed at the same time both by the prince and the people you have always made profession of those public and noble principles which alone are capable of uniting the prince and the people  and while in the late reign the commons of england hearkened to your lordships advice in parliament they were united in their inclinations and their designs to the great people whom they represented the nerves of war were duly supplied and that war was carried on vigorously the greatness of france was sappd by degrees and insensibly undermined and prepared to receive a terrible shock from the first blow it should meet with but as soon as your lordships enemies began to prevail in those illustrious assemblies a spirit of parcimony ill understood and worse timed crept in amongst them and forced the best and most discerning of kings to make a fatal peace which has endangered the liberties of all europe and the power and traffic of this kingdom and has cost this nation so many thousands of lives and so many millions of money and which makes us even at present contented in order to the ending this just and necessary war to furnish those supplies in the very midst of scarcity which we then grumbling withheld in the height of the greatest affluence  my lord the late king who was so true and so just a judge of men was so very well convinced of your lordships services both to the crown and the people that he took care by two just and two grateful acts that is by calling you up to the house of peers and making you auditor of the exchequer that your country should never want your service in parliament nor the crown your abilities in the great employments of the state  the extraordinary regard which so great a king always expressed for your lordships extraordinary merit provoked your enemies to endeavor to fix on you the odious name of favorite as they have since attempted to fasten it on some of your illustrious friends but with how much malice or how much ignorance have both attempts been made for a favorite is the princes mere creature whose only merit is his sovereigns favor and such an object of the princes favor is always that of the peoples scorn and hatred and often exposes the very sovereign to the same contempt and hatred sovereign princes are obliged by their duty to god themselves and their people to show most regard for those who do most for the good of the people whom they govern and when they perform that duty even kings are justly honored the more for the merits of their subjects how happy is the nation where the ministers of kings become the darlings of the people how happy was england during the time of your administration when your lordship was united both to the king and the people when the people declared aloud by their representatives in parliament that you had deserved the honors by which the king distinguished you how happy are we now when the queen employs the most extraordinary persons in the highest employments whose praises are celebrated by the august assemblies of parliament and ecchoed by every part of the kingdom since never princes were more universally esteemed by the people of england than the late king and the present queen it is an infallible sign that the same people approve of their chosen ministers  your lordship who in the late reign was constantly employed in uniting the king and the people or the people and their representatives has been justly thought in this to be the fittest person to maintain union between the two sovereign princes in whom england is most concerned with how sensible a pleasure do all who have the honor to know your lordship consider the people of hanover surveying you with a venerable awe as a person employed in affairs of the highest trust and the highest consequence by the two greatest princes that ever ruled the bravest people of europe the late king made choice of your lordship to stand in the breach which faction had made in the ramparts of liberty the queen has chosen you not only to resist but to attack faction and to drive it from its last retrenchment by settling and securing an entire correspondence between her majesty and her presumptive heir and the queen could not possibly repose a greater trust in your lordship than by employing you in an affair the success of which was of so dear concern to her majesty as the securing both the court of hanover and her own subjects of her hearty intentions in relation to the act of settlement when that court beheld in your lordship so glorious an example of the british greatness how were they exalted to think what a people they were one day to govern though may that be late they began to think some of their future subjects equal to foreign princes and your lordship was entertained with the same honors which are paid to them  the great things which your lordship has done for uniting the prince and the successor the prince and the people and the people among one another and for resisting the force and artifices of the common enemy ought in gratitude to unite the inclinations of all english men to your lordship to whom we have all so great obligations that we cannot so much as pay or receive the very least sum without reflecting on our engagements to the late king and to you to the late king whose image we see upon every single piece and to your lordship who placed it there when in the midst of the public indigence an indigence like that of tantalus that plagued us in the midst of plenty when the miser rolling in full bags might then first be truly said to be literally poor your lordship by a political and noble alchymy transmuted pewter and sordid brass to silver and fine gold and by an action so great and so beneficent secured real property to those at home who had but the shadow of it before and revived and restored the expiring credit of the nation abroad since my lord treasurer by his admirable management of the nerves of war is so justly said to have had so great a share in the glorious successes of the late campaigns your lordship sure must have no small one since without what you have done there could be no management  these my lord are the public reasons for addressing the following poem to your lordship there is a private one and that is that when a man contracts so great a debt as to make him insolvent the least thing that he can do is to acknowledge what he can never pay thus bankrupts when they can make no other return send their creditors an epistle i have lately had very great obligations to your lordship you have been pleased to take some care of my fortune at a time when i most wanted it and had least reason to expect it from you since several things hindered my giving that constant attendance on you which persons of quality so scrupulously exact from those of inferior rank and with which when your lordship is generously pleased to dispense you plainly declare that your noble notions of liberty are not embraced by you as they are by many either out of pride or on the account of interest but by a principle of exalted reason and goodness and humanity this is the first opportunity which i have had since i received your favors of paying my acknowledgments to you in so public a manner which i desire your lordship to accept with your usual goodness but how false or how bounded is human virtue and how few are grateful without a design of engaging their benefactors or others to heap more benefits on them by showing that they can be sensible of them this very address to your lordship is not without an intention of engaging you whose judgment in these matters is acknowledged by all the world to defend as far as your conscience will give you leave one of the boldest poems that has been writ for several years but i who konw the vast business in which you are engaged am presuming enough to apprehend rather your not reading than your not liking  i am my lord your lordships most humble most faithful and most obliged servant john dennis  the preface though the attempt which i have made in the following poem is very bold yet i would not have the reader believe it rash i think my self obliged then to satisfy him without any delay that it is by no means designed to be a just epick poem i know too little of the nature of that poem and too much of my own infirmity ever to attempt to write one but though this can by no means pass for a just epick poem yet is it something of the epick kind and bears the same proportion to a just poem that a short and a faint essay does to a full and a perfect treatise  that which threw me into this way of writing was the very subject of the poem the duke of marlborough has laid such high obligations upon his country that nothing can be said too much of him nor done too much for him and this obliged me to endeavor to do something more bold and more great than any thing that i had endeavored to do formerly  but no poem that is not religious can be great without extravagance or bold without rashness which has been formerly proved but there were but two ways of writing a religious poem upon this occasion the one was to do it by way of hymn and the other was to introduce machines the former being anticipated in the poem which i wrote on the battle of bleinem there remained only the latter  but here i easily foresee that the following objection will be made and that is that since what the duke of marlborough has done is in its self so great and so wonderful what occasion was there to endeavor to adorn it by fiction to which i answer that because what the duke of marlborough has done is in its self so wonderful that it appears incredible and truth it self has the resemblance of fable and of fiction for that very reason i was encouraged to embellish it with the ornaments of poetry this is the defense that boileau has made for himself in his fourth epistle for introducing machines into his description of the passage of the rhine and if the apology stands good for him as it has always past hitherto it is still better for me for my machines are christian whereas his are pagan and consequently can raise no great emotion in the minds of the readers because they are incredible according to one of his own verses  l esprit nest point emu de ce quil ne croit pas if any one objects that what i make my machines say and act will no more be believed than what boileau attributes to the god of the rhine to that i answer that though things did not actually pass before and in the battle of ramillies as they are related here yet he who believes the christian religion and a particular providence and reflects upon a hundred passages in the old and new testament must allow that there past something not altogether unlike it we see it is the opinion of the duke himself that the hand of god was in it that heaven which leaves most events to common causes was immediately concerned in this now can any thing be more reasonable for one who believes that heaven was immediately concerned on one side than to believe that hell which our religion tells us is always for opposing the great designs of heaven was immediately concerned on the other thus the design of this poem is built and the machines are introduced upon what happened to the duke in the battle and what he himself wrote to one of our ministers of state after it  thus i have given an account of the design of this poem how well that design is executed i must leave to the reader as i have consulted my friends who are famed for their judgment in things of this nature as to what relates to the first four books and have had them by me long enough to form some judgment of them my self i know the fort and the foible of them for the fifth i have neither had it by me long enough to make any judgment of it my self nor have i had time enough to consult my friends about it and therefore if there is any thing amiss in it i must leave it to the indulgence of the candid reader i only desire him to take notice that having formerly described with all the application of which i was capable a battle gained by the same general i was obliged to take a very different method in this poem i have only this to add that i have not said so much as i thought to have done of the important consequnces of the battle of ramellies because i have some thoughts of writing a pindarick poem upon that great action of quintus flaminius which restored liberty to the grecian cities between which illustrious roman and the duke of marlborough a very just parallel may be drawn  the battle of ramillia or the power of union lib i of belgian provinces by unions power delivered in ramillias plain i sing i sing the triumph of that wondrous field which raised the fame of pious annas reign above the glory of great henrys days and equaled marlbro to heroic chiefs in natures youth and happier climates born o thou whose wisdom and resistless power has brought to light this wondrous birth of celestial guardian of this sacred isle genius of warlike britain who awhile have left eternal glory and the sway of some triumphant hierarchy of heaven to shelter and protect these happy realms thou who with blissful charity inspired infusest charity through every heart and every soul subjected to thy sway teaching thy much loud britons to subdue the rage of france and hell by love divine o dart such rays of that seraphick flame into my breast that all my ravished soul may with immortal charity be fired with sacred love of britains godlike sons that raised to heaven by that celestial fire it may attain a song of wondrous height may take a flight above the anonian hill and may proclaim thy wisdom and thy power and their heroic deeds in such a strain as no fictitious muse can ere inspire now was the sun in taurus mounted high and darting down his genial rays from heaven directly to the bosom of the earth called forth each plant and every tender flower from out their wintry secret warm retreats and restored nature and renewed the world when the confederate troops called out by fate and by their great commanders awful voice were from their wintry warlike stations drawn tappear near tongeren in fierce array full of that conquering spirit they appeared which drove the vanquished french over blenheims field and in their eyes a penetrating view might easily discern their triumphs past and their amazing victory to come all nature seem transported at that sight for tyranny oppression discord fraud injustice violence and barbarous rage are all about to be expelled the earth and in their room simplicity and truth justice security and gentle ease and peace and spotless innocence shall reign therefore all nature smiled upon that sight and gods and men and earth and heaven rejoiced but hells black tyrant soon took fierce alarms which to infernal torments added stings and to infernal fury fiercer flames and doubled the damnation in his breast upon the steerage of his dusky wings up through the ocean of the air he sails in the midway he stopped between the moons resplendent globe and earths refulgent ball at his great palace there by magic hung and thither a tremendous council calls of friends who now were roaming round the earth in order to subject it to his sway up strait upon the wing the spirits sprung at the tartarean trumpets thundering call and high above the atmosphere they flew the world was in convulsions at the flight earth trembled sighed the air the ocean groaned frequent and full thaccurst assembly grew direful appearances amazing forms which barely seen had power to look despair and death into the hearts of wretched men and wither in one moment all their strength as soon as the infernal crew were sat up from his throne thoutragious tyrant rose his wrathful forehead to a frown he rould that darkened all the sky in fixing plagues inexprimable terrors through the souls of his tartarean ministers that now with sable wings their flaming eyes they veiled and they who had thobdurate hearts of fiends they who to all hells horrors were inured they who eternal torments could endure they could not bear their raging tyrants wrath but shook like men who frightful fiends behold collected in himself a while he stood but when the horrid silence had prepared thaccurst assembly for his dreadful voice thus from his breast his rage in thunder broke are ye assembled then at my dread call by hell i thought ye durst to have disobeyed so light so despicable in your ears has been of late the tempest of my voice but ye not only are assembled here but what is stranger with those cruel looks and that relentless air with which when last i met you here you vainly made your boast you would subdue the world to my fell sway would constitute me universal king and pull the thunderer from his noisie throne yes yes ye have the looks and meens of fiends but o dire shame to hell to me to all your deeds are so unworthy the great name so poor so mean so almost dully good that one would swear ye were grown friends to men and servants to my rival of the sky can ye be they who made your threatening vaunts that ever yon planet turned about the sun with that he pointed to resplendent earth as toward the east her magnitude she rolled it a subjected province should become like these bright tracts of all surrounding air to our black empire of the boundless deep can it be you who promised to orerturn the kingdom there established by heavens king who there bears sway wherever reason rules whose empire is where ever law commands for reason is his secret whispering voice and law his proud command promulgd to all can it be you who promised to extend my empire over all yon spotty globe an empire ruled by men instead of laws where human passion sways and human will passion infused by us and will by us suggested and insensibly inspired have ye performed what vauntingly ye swore no though your interest and your glory both demanded it for know aerial gods where humane passion reigns and human will there we not only reign but are adored of this be sure religion come from heaven will never support an empire raised by hell nor can the dreadful empire raised by us where tyrant man instead of law controuls endure religion that from heaven descends cast but your eyes wherever we command and man our proxy reigns instead of law there men adore some vegetable power or their old crazy priest they make their god or madly to fanatic prophets fall there they bow down to stocks and sensele stones that is to us and our delusions bow and tremble at the gods they could create why have ye then round earth supinely roamd regardless of the grand concern of hell or are your old seducing arts forgot or know ye not my interests or your own cast but your eyes upon her silver globe as through the vast abyss of sky she rouls see that peculiar people chose by heaven to propagate its empire upon earth which they it seems call liberty call law see how with hearts too large to be confined within the eternal fences of the main they pass the limits of the boundless deep and every where my rivals rule extend survey earths shining ball with sharpest ken what portion of her planet can ye find but where the glory of the british name or of her councils or her arms resounds look what even now the britons boldly act in rough germania in hesperian land in celtiberian and in belgian fields mark yon assembled squadrons near the dyle behold the conquering spirit in their eyes hell ye have suffered it to rise so high it is irresistible by human powers unless by our auxiliar bands sustained see yonder their accursed commander comes and yonder conquest towering over him flies whose well known voice the goddess strait obey as at his masters call the falcon stoops and his august appearance is the lure that brings her swiftly rushing from the skies if once he joins those squadrons we are lost his high appearance when they once behold hell can show naught so dreadful and so dire as can dismay the greatness of their souls ye hosts of terrors ye remember well that when our fierce auxiliar bands sustained our dear allies in blenheims deathless field the britons though to every human power invincible were forced to yield to ours but when great marlborough came impetu on and rallied them with that heroic air with which he fires the warlike squadro souls ye stygian gods what miracles we saw how they who trembled but the moment past before the king of terrors awful view now fought like gods above the reach of fate his godlike presence in a moment raised their sinking spirits and dispelled their fears his voice his sole appearance made them bold with what resistless fury they pressed on drove you with matchless bravery on our friends though i looked on and though i menaced high but all my clamor was in thunder drowned till french and fiends together vanished all and howling sunk through danubes ghastful yawn down to our empire of the nether deep ye know ye stygian gods and often have read within the adamantine book of fate that more amazing wonders are reserved to be performed by marlboroughs conquering arm unless with all our power we interpose lewis by me and destiny designed textend my empire and exalt my name above all names that are adored on earth lewis the great the wise the second hope  hell the man the monarch after my own heart who never yet transgrest my dread commands but makes them his employment all the day and meditation all the watchful night he the great image of my self express presumptuous fraudulent revengeful prou implacable inexorable false even greatly and heroically false who watchful as a roaring lion roams with jaws expanded to devour his prey and makes religion his pretense for fraud for cruelty for dire revenge for murder and every noble every slagrant vice o way to banish virtue from the world o great invention envied even by me his genius now from marlboroughs genius shrinks and unless we support him he must fall and can we then forsake the immortal man ah no such merit claims that at his need to guard him from our fierce insulting foes we raise the noble arrierban of hell if lewis falls our empire with him sinks we meet a second more opprobrious fall for even from earth for even from dust we fall o shameful fall for us who aspired to heaven for us who made divinity our aim then law and reason will victorious reign then liberty eternal will become then odious virtue will possess the earth and every glorious vice be driven to hell exert your selves ye furies then and act deeds worthy the antagonists of heaven can ye forget what utterly forget what once we acted and what once we were ah no ye never can for in your breasts some spirits unextinguishd yet remain some of those godlike spirits that inspired our angel minds in that eternal field when girt with adamant and glorious flames against the empire of great heaven we fought i must confess we lost the immortal day but yet we fought ye stygian gods we fought with spirit equal to the vast design fate gave our enemy the field but ours ours was the triumph and the glory ours of great aspiring unexampled minds who dared against the omnipotent to war can ye remember this can ye reflect that ye for angels were an equal match and yield at last to man to woman yield for it is a woman o ye powers destroys this mighty champion of our cause and us for she directs she animates she fires those who over earth the rule of heaven extend it is she who out of pure despite to me contemns a boundless arbitrary reign and thinks it lovelier empire fairer fame upon my rival poorly to depend poorly to wear a crown that law may rule and to make reason and the almighty reign than be her self a sovereign goddess owned and by the kingdoms of the earth adored had ye the spirit with which once ye flamed there needed not this long and powerful speech the godlike cause in which ye stand engaged the cause of empire and eternal fame would move alone your adamantine hearts and urge you to great acts though i were mute behold yon world that fluctuates in the void know that is the victors recompense decreed now see your female adversary there see her a suppliant earnest humble meek behold her prostrate abject on her knees and trembling at that monarch of the sky whom so magnanimously we defy no ye can never see this and not disdain that she should make that floating world a heaven which we so greatly strive to make a hell thus he blasphemed aloud and while he spoke the assembly all the several movements felt the various passions that their direful king who knew so well their hearts designed tinspire now pleased now sad now trembling now enraged with envy wracked or burning with disdain or with desire of fierce revenge inflamed when he had done unanimous they rent the troubled ether with a stormy shout and to the heaven of heavens defiance hurled when suddenly a burst of thunder broke from the empyrean and the avenging bolt through thousands drives and thousands lightning blasts then as a flock of imerous fowl takes wing and seeks the inmost covert of the grove on hearing of the fowlers fatal gun that had of old their tender pinions galled so on the wing the infernal angels sprung upon the empyrean thunders roar and sought the midmost regions of the air and the black hemisphere and realms of night but soon their impious daring they resumed and up once more to the pure ether slew among the rest there was a fantom dire of all that fell from heaven the fiercest fiend the fiercest and most cruel fiend that fell discord the daughter of dire lucifer begot when his prodigious lust ran high on pride when with her hottest flames she burned gigantick was her stature and her looks like demogorgons ere at which hell shakes her native country was the heaven of heavens but heaven as soon as born disclaimed the fiend with lightnings and with thunders drove her out for happiness still fles the raving fiend and peace and joy with her can never dwell as from her birth she was expelled from heaven so by her cruel fathers dire decree she banished was from all the bounds of hell as one who might elsewhere far better serve the growing empire of her dreadful sire but at her parting half her serpent brood she left behind and to the very heart her own inexorable father stung that with the torment ever since he roars thus banished from high heaven and driven from hell she among miserable mortals dwells a false and most inhospitable guest who all her warmest friends torments the most though banished from her fathers realms below yet not one fiend of all the infernal host endeavors to extend with so much zeal the spreading empire of hells horrid sway to others or her self no rest sh allows alternately afflicted with thextreams of burning fury and tormenting fear and sharp remorse with all her deadliest stings armed all the fears and furies of her soul to this infernal council she was called and when the whirlwind of applause was over up rose the subtle and the cruel fiend as rising her gorgonian head she shook with all its snakes that from their livid eyes shot hells blue fire and from their baleful mouths darted a thousand forky poisnous tongues a thousand hisses at the assembly threw each frighted spectre gave a fearful start as a poor swain that underneath his feet spies a fell adder bloated with his rage and lifting up his angry crest on high springs back while to his heart his blood retire and none but lucifer himself had power to cast one look npon the raging fiend and he himself grew stupid at the sight like old laoeoons dismal statue looked that seems not fashioned by the sculptors art but shows a wretch with horror stupid grown and petrified with woe and with despair and as the hideous hag began to scream thaccurst assembly gave a second start thaccurst assembly gave a dreadful yell with equal fright shall all the infernal host and equal horror hear at the last day the sounding clangour of the eternal trump which universal nature shall untune and the bad angels roaring drive to hell then bar the gates with adamantine bolts which then shall to eternity be closed such was her air unutterably dire and such her hideous voice and thus she spoke have we the patience then of stupid saints ye gods to hear all this without reply nay our insulting tyrant to applaud for his unjust and barbarous reproach but this though spoke to all is meant to me for without me not all the host of hell has power tenlarge its dreadful monarchs sway am i of want of knowledge then accused or want of diligence textend thy power o burning indignation o disdain o slander worthy of dire lucifer and dare thou thus accuse me falsely here upon this throne of thy imperial power encompassed with ten thousand spirits round by mighty angels served and even by me from whence is all this pomp this power derived this emulation of the thunderers state before i knew thee what were thou in heaven a servile ministrel bred to cringe and fawn and flatter thy proud arbitrary lord but i an emperor made thee of a slave of a base flatterer a blasphemer bold the rival and the antagonist of him whom thou so slavishly obeydst before millions of angels to thy side i drew i gave them spirit to assert thy cause against thy thundering rival and his slaves in that eternal day which though we lost we triumphed in defeat o matchless fame for we dissolved his universal sway an empire by our overthrow we gained and thou a poor precarious lord before becamst the independent king of hell i founded thy dominion upon earth i propagate in humane hearts thy sway for where i dwell not thou can never reign no there dull union dwells there lazy peace and reason and thy hated rivals law have i not lewis now for fifty years inspired possessing all his mighty soul i fired that soul to all those vast designs that made it worthy thee and worthy me his sanguinary orders i inspired and then performed them with this bloody hand and all the european world laid bare twas i embrud his fierce dragooning slaves in fathers and in brothers guiltless blood a sea of guiltless blood this hand has spilt thy rivals images by millions i in rancour to the original defaced that thou might triumph over the vanquished world and lewis might thy great vicegerent reign if now he flies before victorious anne can i with justice be condemned or blamed think thou it is to the woman that i yield no it is to him from whom thou fledst amain with this assembly here of potent gods and all the great the united host of hell it is to that wisdom and that power divine which day and night on that victorious queen as on the conquering hierarchies attends is it my fault if that religious queen by every action and by every voice inspires her britons with celestial love if by thy rival she is taught temploy great souls by him and destiny designed and by profoundest depths of reason fit tunite her subjects first and then mankind am i to be condemned if while abroad great marlborough in indissoluble bonds the thwarting interests of the nations joins at home godolphin temperates the rage of factions which for mastery contend and makes confusion which is weakness yield to order which is strength as he above the rage of warring atoms reconciled or causing them tengage with moderate strife yet strife where that prevails which most agrees with those eternal laws that rule the whole mingled the elements and made the world i freely own that those our mortal foes grow more pernicious to us every hour they are come tassociate now with williams friends william whose name we fiends with horror hear even with his firmest faithfullest friends they advise who never shrunk from his detested side though with a thousand dangers compast round by homebred traitors and by foreign foes thaudacious men who insolently dared to set up liberty and pull down us when france and hell reigned paramount on earth when they had naught but ruin to expect from such a cursed desperate attempt with these they now consult in these confide and these victorious anne delights temploy to spain she mordant and ravigni sends and montague himself to german plains is hurried in extreme despite to me where his wise councils and his powerful voice threaten my very being to destroy and menace all this dreadful host in me therefore unless we make one last effort one great attempt that is worthy of my rage britain farewell and tyranny adieu adieu the reign of hells despotick sway britain unanimous as well as free will soon enfranchise and unite the world but not the powrfullest fiend of all that fell from heaven of all that own thy boundless sway dares make that horrible attempt but i and now even now i form the glorious plan as the confederates by uniting thrive success continuing will cement them more but their felicity to come depends upon yon squadrons in the belgian plains should they thadverse event of battle feel all that great anne has done tunite mankind i can with ease in one campaign overthrow yon squadrons i have viewed and have reviewed with all the inquisition of my eyes i viewed them and i sighed to find their heads and hearts united by great marlboroughs care which makes them the just terror of us all but here by hell and all hells powers i swear hear it ye gods who rule the unbounded air hear it ye horrors of thabiss profound ye black attendants on eternal night hear it ye deities assembled here in council to maintain hells horrid sway and thou whom all these dreadful powers obey whose frown makes gods above and god below and all the frighted universe except the steadfast empyraean tremble hear hear me great lucifer while by thy self thy dire inviolable self i swear that i with spirit great as the design great as the glorious cause and worthy me i that audacious general will destroy i those victorious squadrons will overthrow and still in spite of earth in spite of heaven discord and lucifer and hell shall reign she said and not expecting a reply down toward the earth she wheeled her airy flight and lucifer dismissed the infernal powers the end of the first book the battle of ramillia or the power of union lib ii now in the midmost region of the air descending discord meets the beldame night as westward she her sable chariot drives old night the fury places by her side and her black shaggy mantle or her throws as discord sat by the dark grizly hag discord more hideous seemed and night more foul as they were hurried by their coal black steeds and the soft chariot slid through midnight air a motley equipage before behind and on each side the journeying furies flew for there flew treason with her looks askew and subornation clad in dismal black and stygian envy of a livid hue and yellow jealousy with eyes suffusd and faithless fraud in part colored robe and murder pale distained with sanguine dye and ugly slander speckled like a toad with livid spots upon a saffron hue over her arms her belly and her thighs but serpentine her head and deadly eyes and from her mouth she hurled her forky tongue and hideous was her hiss and mortal was her sting then lame adultery and incest blind and sly hypocrisy with holy leer came lagging in the rear with reverend gown and darting many a sowr grimace he flew and sighed profoundly with inverted eyes and banged his stomacher with sounding strokes but all affected was and all was false for nervous were his limbs and bold his brow his dimpled cheek was of vermilion dye his chin a fabric with two stories built his wanton eye balls sparkled as they rolled his pampered side was with a sevenfold shield defended of impenetrable brawn his paunch was prominent above the rest and like a goodly promontory hung the silver moon above thhorizon peeped and frighted at the monstrous scene retired the conscious stars withdrew their sickning fires and nature that abhorred the dismal sight redoubled all the terrors of the dark as over campanias viney downs they flew the sentinels of nature took the alarm the watchful dogs in every village bayd and hungry wolves forsook their prey to howl and the winged prophets of nocturnal sky the fatal raven croakd the ghastful scriechowl screamd when to the glittering palace they approached where lewis in a restless slumber lay upon thuneasy down from the black carr discord alights the golden turrets shook the doors flew open with a hollow groan and the fiend entered where the tyrant lay then throws off her immense gigantick form and the gorgonian terrors of her front and maintenon appears in shape and air and she who a fallen angel was before is a decayed affected beauty now when she the royal curtains drew she saw the tyrant tossing on the restless plume haughty and stern and thoughtful even in sleep revolving mighty mischiefs in his mind his forehead furrowed by an angry frown and on his clouded brow sat cruel care and now and then he gave a fearful start and from his heart drew many a guilty groan even discord gazed with pleasure at that sight and the fiend smiled that never smiled before and can thou sleep in this malignant hour said she when every stars against thee leagued how fallen how changed from that transcendant state in which the gazing world admired thee once when thou were grown the terror even of kings and dreadful scourge of the worlds potent lords when thou the earth so rapidly laidst waste that victory came panting in thy rear and wanted wings tortake thy impetuous march when emulous of the meridian sun thy glory blazed and thou had hope to shine sole monarch of the desolated earth as he sole tyrant of the desert sky yet in those happy in those glorious days no profound sleep could ever lull thy soul and rarely rarely slumber closed thy eyes but all the day and all the live long night care kept thee watching to inflame the world and to divide and to destroy mankind now by victorious marlborough brought low here thou lie buried in inglorious ease while with unwearied vigilance he wakes and even this now the vollied thunder grasps that is about to part with hideous roar and all thy trembling provinces amaze strike forty thousand of thy veterans dead strike even thee dead their arbitrary lord and with thy person kill thy very fame unless this moment thou preventst the blow what fatal hour is lost in soft repose has adverse fortune cooled thy towering pride or has age quenched thy noble lust of soul and that aspiring flame that raised thy thoughts to affectation even of godhead once can he who aimed erewhile at nothing less than reigning king of kings and lord of lords can he a rival bear in empire now and art thou to a poor despondence grown of lording it or all this western world yet have thou reason to despond indeed unless thou art eternally intent to disunite whom thou pretendst torthrow the few gigantick hunters of mankind who universal empire here acquired all of them vast advantages enjoyed which heaven and nature have denied to thee cyrus great caesar and the son of jove young hammon led their conquering troops themselves were themselves brave sometimes to rashness brave and the undaunted squadrons which they led when they were conquerors were always free and could a more exalted virtue boast than those who yielded to their conquering arms but here thou list supinely at thy ease and buried in opprobrious sloth pretendst to do thy work by journey men of war yes by thy baffled mareschals thou pretendst day laborers who for thy glory drudge to conquer heroes fighting for their own fierce warlike people thou pretendst torcome by the inhabitants of soft anjou or squadrons in delicious touraine bred and by dejected and desponding slaves freeborn magnanimous nations to orthrow but freemen never were vanquished yet by slaves nor warlike nations by a wanton crew if in thy great designs thou would succeed divide those foes and fight them with themselves then by each others arms enslave them all and what thou want in personal command or valor or the hardness of thy troops supply by fraud and old notorious arts but take occasion by the forelock still and let no minute pass no moment slip that may be employed to disunite their force and by dividing to confound their power such an important moment is this now in which thou lie dissolved in fatal sleep the reins of empire yielding up to chance and dead and stupid to the charms of fame but though thou slumberst know i always wake and day and night over thy dear interest brood to cherish it like tender birds their young and now am come thou dearest of mankind dearer than pleasure to me dear as pride dear as the godlike pleasure of revenge am come to rouse thee from thy inglorious ease and my own empire to advance in thine true said the tyrant who had all this while been shaking off the downey bands of sleep if that a strong desire to rule the world inspires and agitates my highborn soul it is but to lay it at thy lovelier feet and that the ruler of the land and main may be a happier slave and worthier thee and let the boundless liberty you take which had been death to any one but thee declare the boundless power thy wondrous charms have given thee over even my ambitious soul but why do thou who have the power to pierce the intimatst recesses of my heart who rulst it with as arbitary sway as i my self would all the world control so cruelly upbraid me without cause can thou believe i poorly have given over my great design of universal sway can thou believe i lie extended here out of a low inglorious indolence or mean despondence of success which ne can seize a towering fiery soul like mine no never shall my soul abatement feel of its high passion for eternal fame but as i thee adore with fiercer flame than all that in my warmest youth i felt even for the brightest of thy charming sex for montespan or lovely la fontange or tender la valiere so age it self does but augment my noble lust of fame it is my first principle of life by which i speak and move and act and think and am and lewis when that fails must be no more o could i but the weaknesses suppress of this frail flesh and conquer the desire and need of nutriment and soft repose as i thinfirmities have overcome of my great mind extinguishing remorse driving compassion out and stifling shame then without interval the glorious cares of empire should employ my aspiring soul under which now sometimes my nature sinks and i by sordid elements are forced to feed the thinking parts expiring flame and seek new life within the arms of death but soon i shake off his dull chains and then at once to life and glory i return whether twas partial destiny or chance that gave victorious marlborough the day in a dire hour at bleinems fatal field o fatal field to all my aspiring thoughts i will forget that ever thou have been and think of universal sway again yet to the terror of my wondering foes i still recovered that amazing blow renewed the fainting courage of troops my loss recruited and retrieved my power me can thou then of indolence accuse or of despondence or abated fire me whose unwearied care has since oppressed the dilatory germans on the rhine oppressed them on veronas wondering stream and obliged fortune in her own despite against her worthless favorites to declare o i had laid a scheme which would have sunk and utterly confounded all my foes if fate in tempests had not interposed upon the adige and the rhine i fought only with men and there i found success in spain i was constrained to yield to heaven for twas the loud artillery of heaven that from me snatched the celtiberian tower and baffled my whole providence at once but whence can this transporting fury spring or what makes this the great deciding hour to whom the fury eagerly replied by that disastrous disappointment spain the pride for which contending nations fight depends upon this very fatal hour which here thou squanderst in inglorious ease spain is in utmost danger to be lost unless thou rousing wilt prevent the blow and spain in danger will deject our friends and give more daring spirit to our foes and bind them in indissoluble bonds consider how they all prepare tunite england and scotland stretch their sinewey arms both eager in a strict embrace to meet and for the future like two sisters live by their great mothers wisdoms reconciled in england too by wise godolphins care faction has lost its ferment and grows mild the very tygress faction is grown tame the listless germans whom thy wondrous arts so nobly have divided and brought low some lucid intervals of concord find and public spirit and will surely leave their shameful quarrels and opprobrious sloth if spain should from thy baffled arms be torn that loss will calm the fierce hungarians rage and spirit jealous venice to declare against thinvader of fair italy if spain the golden prize of battles lost no stratagem nor violence nor art can thy exhausted treasury supply and then thy numerous armies vanish all and leave thee to the scorn of thy proud foes even thy own slaves and that is the blow of fate even thy own vile obsequious slaves will rise and take rebellious arms against their king then from the pyrenaeans to the rhine adieu thy conquests and perhaps thy crown but naught assure thy self can spain retrieve but a surprising and stupendous blow struck suddenly upon the belgian dyle a sudden and surprising blow struck there while this the great campaign of fate begins will give thee sure occasion to detach part of thy conquering troops to philips aid to push thy advantage on thastonishd rhine thy friend the lost elector to restore and penetrate to inmost austrias clime which then in vain shall wait great marlboroughs aid that will constrain the empire to recall the new supplies to illustrious eugene sent and give thee time to finish savoys fate that fatal blow will once again divide confederated powers will venice awe exasperate the fierce pannonian mars amaze the germans and the dutch confound prevent that union now designed between the english and the caledonian states and in both realms rekindle factious rage rouse up thy sleeping arbitrary friends ferment them still with more fanatic rage that our declining empire will sustain and will advance through all the christian world and wipe away the stains of bleinems shameful day to whom the grizly tyrant thus replied o why have thou once more so rashly roused the serpent slumbring in my wounded breast which when awake still gnaws my mangled head and greedily devours my vital blood o bleinem bane to my aspiring thoughts at whose idea all come tumbling from their height bleinem the hag that in the dead of night my fancy rides and drives soft sleep away the very tyrant of my ambitious soul blast to my hopes of universal sway which wither ail and die when thou appearst and only by forgetting thee revive twas there by such a rash presumptuous fight as what thou now provokst me to repeat that forty thousand of my conquering troops that always conquered till that cursed hour were like ripe corn in autumn mowed in heaps those heaps in ranks extended on the plain too plenteous harvest of that bloody field which broke the hearts and spirits of the rest and interrupted all my vast designs made all my friends despond my foes insult and laid my weakness open to the world for as my greatness and my awful power lay in opinion more than real strength the opinion which the nations had conceived fortune was grown immutable as fate and always would attend my conquering arms that fatal days calamities event undeceived all the christian world at once and made me grow the very scorn of those to whom i was most terrible before me would thou have repeat the dangerous risk of battle when thou have thy self observed that to subdue i must divide my foes and then enslave them by each others arms that warlike nations never were vanquished yet by softer ones nor free born souls by slaves know thou not then that to divide my foes i must remain not only without fight but without war o gods for that blessed hour one short lived truce would more advance my fame and spread my empire than ten victories he said and thus the subtle fiend replied true if fallacious truce thou could obtain i before victory would truce advise but since thy foes have been so often betrayed and mocked all hope of faithless peace in vain therefore the mischief ill success has done must be by sudden victory repaired nor needst thou run a dangerous risk to overcome what lost the fatal day at blenheims field what but presumption grown from long success which ausd thee to abandon thy old arts and vainly to rely on fancied power because aetheral victory had often perched on thy waving streamers when thy troops by odds of numbers overwhelmed their foes by long success grown insolently vain thou fondly thought torecome on equal terms unknowing of the troops thou were tengage and wondrous merit of their matchless chief hence the disaster of that fatal day but when to your old methods you returned with them success and victory returned for the prevented germans you surpised upon the adige and thastonishd rhine and both their armies easily orethrew both by superior numbers overwhelmed and in their leaders absence both oppressed ruin thallies upon the belgian plains oppressed by the same odds before their chiefs arrive before their various powers are joined then with success return to thy old arts and by division break their potent league thy orders strait to the bavarian send thy numerous belgian garrisons to drain and swell thy troops assembling on the dyle then as a torrent to a deluge swelled disdains its banks and makes its roaring way with dreadful devastation so may they scorning their lines overflow thadjacent plains while desolation marks their hideous course and the surpised confederate forces leave the same eternal monument of power which at morat the famed burgundians left but rouse lay hold upon this fatal hour think that the very next may be too late this hour great marlborough for his camp sets forth whom thou must still industriously avoid avoiding marlborough lewis may be great thou have already felt his nervous arm whose towering genius all the genii dares of thy weak marshals which before it cowr he the great qualities alone enjoys of all thy chiefs who are and who have been great condes spirit and his wondrous fire joined with that presence of commanding soul that keeps entirely master of it self and master of the furious god of war when with dire looks and with a dreadful roar he foams and all the god runs mad with rage great marlborough has luxemburghs dispatch his subtle turns and his sagacious views the wisdom and sedateness of turenne his dauntless valor with his thought profound and vast capacity and all that skill so admirable in the art of death which fixed thinconstancy of fortunes will and made her dote on wisdoms charms divine rouse thy self then beware that fatal man issue thy dread commands this moment out and let the great deciding blow be given ever destiny and marlborough arrive the fury said the tyrant gave consent to the bavarian strait his orders sends his numerous belgian garrisons to drain and swell his troops assembling on the dyle which to the army through the dreary shades thence to the various towns the impetuous demon bore the end of the second book the battle of ramillia or the power of union lib iii aurora had not painted yet the world with various dies restoring every hue that night had with her miscreant hand expunged nor were thattendants on the night retired the starry host of heaven and host of hell and still the wakeful dog took soft repose and still the prouling wolf persud his prey no shepherds pipe was on the mountains heard nor hunters bugle in the ecchoing vales when the shrill trumpet roused up drowsy mars deaths bugle in the chase of humane blood the beasts of nature to their dens retired and the whole forest trembled at the sound the beasts of nature feared alas in vain though fate a solemn hunting had prepared for man the huntsman was and man the prey before the dawn throughout the belgian plains the garrisons their tyrants voice obey forth from their several fortresses they march from oudenard courtray dendermond and liere from brussels louvain mechlin antwerp ghent belgia that lately cast to heaven her eyes for help her eyes for chains her arms restrained belgia the mother of a hundred towns now beautiful and rich and great and gay once more with secret pride her sons surveys and once more boasts of her immortal race that joyous lift their towry fronts on high as when kind nature by the help of art and secret influence of indulgent heaven throws off a long and dangerous disease once more she to her self delightful grows and once more beauty and long absent grace and strength and joy unspeakable return so the disburthend belgian towns rejoiced  which the squadrons march by several ways to reach the camp by false bavaria formed and there like torrents in the ocean join now a more potent numerous host they seemed than that with which the son of jove the east or mightier julius overcame the west confiding in their numbers they grow fierce haughty presumptuous insolently vain and their dilated hearts distend with pride their lines disdaining with a roar they pass and the mad torrent toward ramillia rowls they the confederate troops resolve tattack before their various nations all are joined before victorious marlborough arrives now with a chosen few rides villeroy and falfe bavaria to survey thallies with hideous air and with gigantick stalk before them the infernal goddess strides approached victorious malborough she finds arrived and curses the provoking sight she finds that from his presence all the troops assume immortal spirit and an air so dreadful that it makes even furies shake even her the fiercest fiend of all the damned now discord to the gallick camp returned the false bavarians shape and air assumes and thus she anxious villeroy accosts have thou observed how yon confederate troops inferior in their numbers far to ours yet carry conquest in their flaming eyes and yet their veteran and their boldest troops have often fled before the gallick power whence now this spirit this superior fire from liberty the marshall strait replys it is from the bravery of the english troops who with immortal liberty inspired and with the love of glory all inflamed infect the nations with their noble fire as man was formed to lord it over beasts freemen were preordaind to vanquish slaves and this the event had shown in williams reig had but his honest mind suspected thee to whom the fury instantly replied it is true the english merit all our praise a nation fierce magnanimous and free valiant from freedom from their clima brave who in their fierce attacks with fury made and in their firmness to sustain the efforts of their outrageous and their pressing foes equal the warlikst nations of the world but in their rallying rage surpass them all your gallick troops with fury know tassault but never yet endured the fierce attacks of their bold foes when obstinately urged our germans with much constancy sustain but when our squadrons once are broke they are lost the english rally still with greater rage than they at first attack thastonishd foe while with their eager shouts the welkin rings as a fierce bull who furiously contends for the fair she that has his heart subdued and for the empire of the flowery meads recedes from his proud rival to return with more impetuous shock more dreadful rage while with his clash the ecchoing vale resounds so when the britons from the field retreat they rally with no less amazing fire but the great changes of the world below are brought about by heaven and not by man for it is a jealous god who rules the sky jealous of glory and in love with praise and when the wonders of his might he shows and brings to pass astonishing events events which all the under world amaze it is not by strength of nations that he works for that would look mere human might to all but by select celestial spirits sent for that design from his own heaven and formed of finer clay and in a nobler mould than are the vulgar race of mortal men and animated with diviner fire that when to all thastonishd world they appear with more than human qualities endued thastonishd world may be constrained to own and they themselves confess that what they do is by thimmediate hand of heaven performed the noblest nations have derived their fame and all their greatness from the godlike few and when these fail them they are lost undone and grow the scorn of their insulting foes or are quite swallowed in thabyss of time marshall reflect on ancient days and say what wondrous acts did persians ere perform before or after their great cyrus reigned say was not macedon ere philip swayed obscure unworthy of the voice of fame and when victorious alexander died did not its spirit and its matchless fame and empire with the godlike man expire the romans owed the glories of their state and vast extent of empire to a few as by their noblest writers is confessed as far as now fair englands glory flies what had it done before great edward reigned except but his and conquering henrys days where was its glory till eliza came and by her wisdom and heroic mind sustained the freedom of the laboring world with hers even englands life and soul expired and then its neighbors meanly it betrayed or turned upon it self its own inglorious arms till at the last the godlike william came he came and their declining spirits raised he gave them their religion and their anne she freedom and the might of malbrough gave as william was betrayed undone by me marshall by us great malborough too must fall on which depends to morrows fatal day for from his presence yon audacious troops derive the dauntless spirit in their eyes from which they flash intolerable fire even thou thy self for i remarked it well thou were agreeably surpised and raised when his august appearance thou beheldst worthy the grandeur of the immortal mind commanding as the form of the first man while his great makers image he retained and empire sat upon his lordly brow the worlds imperial ruler and his own before celestial reason had been taught her subject passion poorly to obey and the degenerating mind debased the majesty and empire of the mien when ere his troops behold that noble form all his great actions all his high exploits present themselves before their wondering minds gelderland conquered with its warlike towns and liege and limbourgh as by magic rise and to their view present their stately towers dire schellenbourgs impenetrable fort carried against the choice of all our powers and bleinems everlasting day appears and stunns with rapture their astonished minds the trumpet with its clangour tears their ears and then they charge and once again they fight their battles over and triumph once again and then the world wants force to oppose their power whom to defeat we malborough must destroy for firmly yon audacious troops believe it is not from fortune these successes flow but from the wisdom of their wondrous chief his vast capacity his flaming zeal his restless labor and perpetual thought his dreadless spirit and his just designs indeed so just have been his great designs so exquisite his conduct so profound not one false step in four renowned campaigns so bright his humble modesty has shone in still consulting his illustrious friends his counselors so few so justly chose his secrets kept from the most piercing eyes his constancy in executing all that has so well consulted been so firm his spirit as a captain so sublime and as a soldier so invincible that marshall to remove him we must hire the fiercest and most desperate of thy men for my bavarians will that task refuse or twenty thousand of yon bravest troops will less obstruct our great success than he had thou beheld at bleinems dreadful field in the distress of the stupendous day this matchless man at once a prudent chief and a most daring combatant supply with his own valor every pressed brigade each brave battalion of his fainting host for wheresoever death and danger flew tappall his squadrons with their ghastly glare there malborough on the wings of thunder flew till he brought conquest back and won the day till fate he with majestic mien dispensed and seemed the dreadful delegate of jove had thou seen this at bleinems dreadful field marshall thou would of victory despair or else conclude this fatal man must die but could thou with a sharp sagacious eye survey the wonders of his matchless mind what apprehension then would pierce thy breast then what astonishment would strike thy mind for o the jarring talents which appear uniting all their factions in his soul the heat the cold the liveliness the weight the gravity thastonishing dispatch the providence the intrepidity the fire and the sedateness of his soul and the revenging thunder of his might discharged without a tempest on his breast or a black lowering cloud upon his brow tempests without he raises and he calms but his great mind immovable remains and these great qualities by turns he shows not as his fancy humor passion call but guided all by wisdoms sacred law as he who made this all the seasons guides and alters hot and dry and moist and cold by what the changing universe requires is it possible we can a moment doubt if we this dangerous general shall destroy who having these repugnant talents joined confederated in his mighty soul talents which none besides of human kind enjoys appears designed by allwise heaven who naught creates in vain to perform deeds surpassing all the rest of mortal race who the great qualities of twenty chiefs possessing still atchieves the exploits of more whose passion for his own accursed cause so flaming is so deadly is his hate and so invincible to us and ours that not content to act in his own sphere and every hour new wonders to perform he does the duty with unwearied pains of foreign generals which with all their thought and all the godlike greatness of their souls they were unable to perform themselves wherever the allies appear in arms their brave battalians malbroughs influence feel with him their noblest actions they concert he furnishes their bravest chiefs with troops and with unhopd for treasure he supplies yet while to others he gives power to act his own unwearied vigilence is such his care his labor his eternal thought as if all others had refused to act as if thinimitable man were left with atlantean shoulders to sustain the more than mortal burden of the war indeed whatever has been greatly done in germany or in the belgian plains has under his auspicious power been done for he observing with judicious thought that through a tedious war your gallick powers by the division of thallies prevailed or owed their conquests to my secret arts or by their numbers gained their great success that they the field eternally declined unless by vast advantages sustained as conscious of the weakness of their cause the weakness of their boldest veteran troops and falseness of imaginary power which two set battles fought on equal terms would soon demonstrate to the christian world that even in fight they close engagement shunned till they had tamed their most intrepid foes by odds of numbers wearied and oppressed he this remarking with sagacious thought his conduct in each point to theirs opposed and changed the form and fortune of the war by his eternal vigilance his troops are still too numerous to be flanked by ours and while he meditates his great exploits his secret his impenetrable heart defended stands from treasons piercing eye that caution from great williams fate he drew then he the fatal hour of combat seeks and finds with penetrating thought or makes either halfway he bald occasion meets or like a hunter he persues her flight till she at bay her clustring forelock turns then in the dreadful field assails your powers nor suffers you with fury to assault for which you by the christian world are famed nor wages then a cool and distant war but presses on you with redoubled might and in upon your firmest squadrons breaks till with his horse their shattered ranks he tears nor made by nature nor by climate formed the thunder of such fury to sustain and chiefly which has rendered him to us a dangerous and a formidable foe that no divisions fraudulently sown among thallies might hurt the general cause there is but one who breaths thaetherial air and even that one is malboroughs second self so careful to augment or to maintain among the various potentates abroad that union which with a celestial voice great anna to her britains recommends he obviates growing feuds dissensions grown he reconciles the interests he adjusts and he concerts of each confederate power and in one general interest mingles all as streams from east and west and north and south are mixed in oceans vast abyss and lost he nations and their kings with thoughts inspires above all little selfish low designs and fills them with a public glorious fire in all these things the wondrous mans concerned which so destructive are to us and ours with so much zeal with such assiduous thought with such unwearied pains no length of time nor any distance of remotest place nor the intemperance of heat and cold nor pleasures specious and alluring bait the god like man alas no pleasure knows but what the ruler of yon heaven pursues to do great good and glory to acquire no nor the base ingratitude of those whom day and night he watches to preserve nor ought that earth nor ought that hell invents naught but the stroke of destiny alone is able to obstruct his generous course is able to retard his noble speed in the carrier of everlasting fame but with himself he high designs revolves or those who execute those high designs with that familiar greatness he receives which makes him the delight of all the good and the felicity of all the brave as from these wondrous talents in him joined all that astonishing success proceeds which is become the darling theme of fame the theme on which the eternal talker doats so by that high success is malbrough grown the joy of all the happy nations round the hope and consolation of the rest the confident of the most jealous states the great example of earths demygods and the just wonder of the christian world but with the squadrons who his voice obey so sacred his authority is grown so is he honored loved almost adored by the brave soldier his adopted care whom with a pious fathers tenderest love he guards from danger and from want he shields that when nor interests loud and powerful voice nor smarting shame nor their dear countreys love nor love of glory longer can prevail upon their fainting spirits to sustain the fierce attacks of our assaulting bands his mien his great appearance fires their souls his potent voice the squadrons new creates gives them new life new spirit and new hope nay certainty of conquest and of fame but mareshal for some time i have observed surprise and joy and wonder in thy eyes to whom transported villeroy replys it is true with joy and wonder i have heard thy generous praise of such a deadly foe for when so many english have been found who have with basest calumnies repaid his mighty benefits as great and strong as ever hero on his country laid that thou should do the glorious hero right thou who by force of his victorious arm art fallen from such a height o whither fallen fallen from thy empire from thy glory fallen from those which thou enjoydst and from the hope of those at which thy vast ambition aimed that thou should do the wondrous hero right that thou should draw the lovely features like and place the noble piece in its true light shows something so magnanimously great as all the generous english would extol and godlike malborough himself admire to whom the fury in bavarias form the praise i merit not i must refuse it is not a generous frailty in my mind but great revenge the attribute of gods that makes me just to malboroughs hateful name small generositys required to praise a merit which by all the worlds extolled and which in spite of slanders cankring bite will be the eternal ornament of fame if keen detraction could have hurt his name or person i detraction would have used for it is with bitterest gall that i extol the hero whom to crush i must commend since calumnies have been essayed in vain and slanders of the blackest hue been tried at once his fame and person to destroy and against both have signified no more than morning mists against the julian sun his rising glory has dispelled them all it is time to try what truth may effect at last and on her own loud champion turn her arms this hero i in just proportions drew that thou may be convinced by the rich draught the way tattack thallies with wished success is this pernicious general to destroy that whole brigades less dangerous are than he that while yon troops his noble form inspires they will impenetrable still remain and fate will follow him as it does jove if then our interests precious in our eyes if victory has charms for our great minds if glory if the vast thinspiring cause for which great lewis steels our nervous arms which is the empire of the universe can thaw our blood our drooping spirits raise we must the boldest of your men suborn this formidable hero to destroy or else expect a second bleinem here thou will in shameful bonds once more be led as thou by conquering eugene were before or grow the object of the peoples scorn and the parisian rabbles headstrong rage and i shall from my government be chased as from bavaria i before was driven the fury said and villeroy turned pale and looked with eyes unwilling to consent yet fearful to deny which when the fiend observed she with imperious tone rejoined think it is thy absolute thy awful lord it is lewis who commands thee to obey can thou assist an arbitrary king to make his boundless will his only law and then examine if that will be just know thou not that it is criminal in slaves taffect more virtue than their tyrants show she said when with prevailing shades the night came on and villeroys confusion hid under whose pitchy mantle both concealed to execute their dire design retired the end of the third book lib iv while discord by great malbroughs fate contrives textend the empire of hells dreadful sway the worlds almighty ruler with that eye that sees through all thinfinitude of space that sees through all thinfinitude of time from the empyrean views the raving fiend and to the son the eternal father speaks and while he speaks the angels drop their lyres and all their melting hallelujahs cease the heavens with all their jocund orbs are still are hushed attentive to the voice divine to which their sounds are discord all the globes that roll through space immense a moment rest a moment their eternal course suspend and tremble while their great creator speaks behold he to the filial godhead says with how much fury our outrageous foe proceeds his impious viceroy to maintain against our servant and vicegerent anne how against malbroughs life he discord arms and she the fiercest of the french suborns tassault him in to morrows wrathful field let us against the raging fiend oppose one of our angels burning most with zeal and most with blissful charity inspired let him descend and with celestial might resist the malice of infernal rage and betwixt malborough interpose and fate that he may conquer and that we may reign and all the nations join in bonds of love and quiet to the weary world return he said the angelick bands resume their lyres and their transporting symphonies renew thharmonious spheres renew their wondrous dance with hallelujahs heaven again resounds immortal transport runs through every mind immortal pleasure brightens every face in circles the angelick bands embrace and rush into each others arms with joy which tongues of angels never can express and never can the heart of man conceive and every circle in seraphick song the god of union sings the god of peace next to the deity there stood an orb of glorious seraphim a wondrous orb who had the wings the brightness and the power of mighty seraphim but human forms of all the bright inhabitants of heaven none burned with blissful charity like them or copied the eternal son like them like him in human shape they appeared in heaven like him they once had bodies of frail flesh and sojourned here in mortal limbs below and long with death and dangers here they shone and mortal misery and mortal care the nations to unite in bonds of peace and vindicate the warring saints below from the abhorred usurping reign of hell from foul idolatry and lawless power and pread messiahs righteous kingdom here of sacred liberty and sacred law and of religion undefiled and pure and here when they had suffered much and long and bore what none but godlike minds could bear the immortal spirits broke their mortal bands and swift ascended to the heaven of heavens triumphant there in human likeness sat that human likeness which on earth they graced near to the son of man in bliss enthroned and some resemblance of his glory bore as of his sufferings they before had born to this refulgent and this wondrous orb the filial godhead thus himself addres ye host of seraphim who once were men who bore the misery of mortal life like me and bore the cruel pains of death tunite mankind among themselves in love and spread my fathers kingdom over earth which of ye freely will descend to save the british hero from impending fate him who in charity the nations binds and pious annas conquering host commands that we may triumph and that we may reign him lucifer and discord raging fiends contrive with hellish fury to destroy forth from the spirits of that shining orb a glorious spirit shoots on gorgeous wings wings with bright purple and with gold arrayed and down before the sovereign throne he lights of all thangelick sanctities of heaven none filled the empyrean with the fame of what he acted and he suffered here like him no angel of all heaven like him breathed forth immortal love to mortal men a crown of radiant beams adorned his head and winged his shoulders were and winged his feet lightning serene flew darting from his eyes and lightning round his radiant temples played and in his face there much resemblance shone of him who once this happy island swayed who moved by charity for wretched men that he the laboring nations might preserve came flying on the wings of all the winds and rescued sinking britain from her fate his face much likeness of his earthly bloom but a more heightened beauteous likeness bore for now instead of misery and care and fatal disappointment fatal woe and all the frailties that on dust attend upon his countenance perpetual youth celestial vigor and celestial bloom and immortality appeared and joy eternal inexpressible divine on his first motion thempyrean heaven with tuneful shouts of acclamation rung thharmonious thunder of extatick joy when every angel clapped his golden wings and every angel struck his wondrous lyre and sung his praise in high seraphick song who could vouchsafe to leave eternal joys and could to earth the seat of woe descend where he had born what never mortal bore to rescue malbrough his adopted care it is like thy self like thy own fervent zeal thou good and faithful servant said the son with speed then to the rolling earth descend and thereupon to morrows wrathful day the day for vengeance preordaind by us defend thy malborough in ramillias plain and he the christian world will there defend but ere the sun dispells the shades of night present thy self in vision to his eyes and with celestial hope his soul inspire of present conquest and of future fame on earth and of eternal glory here tell him of provinces by unions power delivered in ramillias fatal plain lay his own danger too before his eyes but hide the event of that that his great soul and dreadless virtue may be fully tried and may to earth and heaven more glorious shine with joy descend to honor thy descent on it a wondrous birth of fate attends a wondrous change in europe shall be wrought ten thousand terrors shall attend thy flight and vengeance to amaze the impious world the time by high foreknowledge preordaind at last is come when satan shall no more nor his vicegerent tyrants plague the earth but lewis was permitted to attain to such uncommon height of lawless power as pelgia italy and spain to add to former countries impiously obtained to grasp the indies in his threatening hand and in his thought the empire of the earth that vengeance sent from us might pierce him more by his surpizing unexpected fall and the example strike the impious world with greater terror and our hand appear when he who has been fifty rolling years raising the fabric of his power to heaven shall find it in a moment dashed to hell by the revenging thunder of our might when all the turbant tyrants of the east from bosphorus to farthest indies climb shall hear their western brothers fall shall hear and tremble at his ruins hideous sound when men turned atheists by his long success shall be confounded and turn pale and shake and own there is a being farabove and an amazing providence beyond what their weak minds have power to comprehend then impious war shall vex the earth no more but love divine shall human hearts unite and peace shall to the wearied world return he ended and the angel bowing low toward earth precipitates his glorious flight while th empyrean thunder loudly roars thangelick lyres and dulcimers and lutes and solemn organs change their melting strains and with fierce warlike symphony resound and when the instruments divine repose again the thunder bellows through the sky to that the instruments again respond and thrice the thunder thrice the wrathful lyres alternate dreadful sounds throughout the sky tremendous signal of revenge divine of vengeance to be executed now the terrors of the almighty take thalarm and after the descending angel fly as through the atmosphere he wheels his flight and cleaves with his eternal plumes the air of golden light he draws a glorious trail he gilds the paler moons resplendent beams he gilds the silver clouds with golden dye and all th illustrious horrors of the night the infernal spirits from his passage fly and all the winged ill omens of the air and care and pain and sorrow and despair fly from his sacred presence far away before him peace tranquillity and joy immortal pleasures march before behind thamazing terrors of the almighty march as near to judoignes fatal plain he flew like a descending star direct he shoots into the tent where mighty malbrough lay and in a dream fought great ramillias field but even in sleep his passions he controuls with independent and with lordly sway his very dream was regular serene no fear nor rage disturbed his godlike mind whom thangel now descended thus salutes hail champion of the sacred cause of heaven hail ornament of earth hail dread of hell illustrious soul called out by me and fate to turn the fortune of the western world from the bright realms of everlasting joy with pleasure i am sent to visit thee o worthy successor to me in arms o care of heaven o delegate of fate how have i been sollicitous beyond what is allowed to blissful minds above for anna for britannia and for thee and yet when i ascended up to heaven i neither her nor thee entirely left for at my parting i left friends below  o men with whom even angels may consult and on the firmness of their faithful zeal and on their vast capacity depend for all my friends are annas friends and thine and will unchangeably respect my choice but hell and hells dire missionaries here with rage implacable thy life pursue for bleinem in their minds has fixed deep wounds wounds which no length of days can cure but time exulcerates and festers and gangrenes from bleinems mortal day worse days they expect no less than ruin of their empire here therefore to morrow all their mortal darts will levelled be at thy illustrious head and imminent the danger is and great but danger will but raise the noble fire of thy exalted soul intent on things above this grovelling and this worthless world and if thou fallst like sampson thou will fall and bitterly thy foes lament thy fate whatever for thy person heaven ordains yet heaven its champion never will permit to leave the world inglorious unrevenged a wondrous victory attends thy arms great in it self and in its sequel vast whose ecchoing sound through all the west shall run transporting the glad nations all around who often shall doubt and often suspend their joy and often imagine all an empty dream the conqueror himself shall cry amazed it is not our work alas we did it not the hand of god the hand of god is here for thee so great shall be thy high renown that fame shall think no music like thy name around the circling globe it shall be spread and to the worlds last ages shall endure heroes of ancient times thou shall eclipse and the most lofty most aspiring man shall want the assurance in his secret prayers to ask such high felicity and fame as heaven has freely granted thee yet this that seems so great so glorious to thee now would look how low how vile to thy great mind if i could set before thy astonished eyes thexcess of glory and thexcess of bliss that is prepared for thy aspiring soul when thou arrivst at everlasting day o could embodied mind but comprehend the glories of the intellectual world or i the blissful secret were allowd but fate forbids to mortals to reveal o i could lay a scene before thy eyes which would distract thee with transporting joy fire the rich blood in thy illustrious veins make every nerve with fierce convulsions start blast all thy spirits and thy life destroy thou could not taste thextatick bliss and live as one who has lived thirty tedious years and ever since his wretched birth been dark his visual orbs with cloudy films orecast and in the dungeon of the body dwelt in utter ignorance of natures works and wonders of this vast material world and has no notion ere conceived of light or colors or the verdant flowery earth or the stupendous prospect of the sky if then he finds some artist whose nice hand couches the cataracts and clears his eyes and all at once a flood of glorious light and this bright temple of the universe the crystal firmament the blazing sun all thamazing glories of the heavens all the great makers high magnificence come rushing through his eyes upon his soul he cannot bear thastonishing delight but starts exclaims and stamps and raves and dies so the vast glories of the upper world if they were set before embodied mind would oppress nature and extinguish life for all the beauties of the world that is seen as glorious as they look to human eyes are little are contemptible to them like glimmering starlight to the blaze of day for thee let this suffize the share of bliss and glory that is prepared for thee above is such as shall distinguish thee from most for since the glory of the just in heaven is equal to their charity on earth what must be thine who labourst to unite who labourst to felicitate a world i say not this to fortify thy mind against the fear of death thou have no fear for thou have been familiar with him long been often dauntless with him face to face and calmly looked upon his gorgon eye as finding nothing there taffright a soul that conscious is of glory bliss and life unbounded all as vast eternity even i not more intrepid was on earth than thou nor am not more undaunted now but this is said that on this dreadful day thou may do deeds that may excel even thine and surpass him who all the world transcends thou shall have millions of immortal minds glorious spectators of thy immortal acts and towering over thee still thou shall behold bright victory and me he said and now the stormy drum awaked the powers of war and now the angel disappears from sight and his bright shape dissolves into the morn the end of the fourth book lib v full of the glorious vision malborough wakes for when the angel vanished from his eyes he shot half heaven into the heroes mind his mind was with immortal hope inspired celestial confidence celestial fire a flame that in his noble breast aspired to things above the greatness of this world and joy which human hearts can never conceive unspeakable transporting yet serene wisdoms serene companion and her friend prophetic of felicity and fame awaked he rises from his bed in haste and after him in have the sun arose impatient to behold his wondrous deeds gazing he sees the grandeur of his mien exalted with a dreadful majesty and all the honors heightened of his eyes and all thheroick virtues of his mind all but his great contempt of death increased for that was sovereign in his soul before and while the sun above thhorizon rose ten thousand brighter glories from the skies descended to behold or to assist in the contention of the eternal day for the immortal day was to decide no trifling small affairs no mean dispute the limits of small kingdoms or the bounds of poor provincial tributary lords but the contention of the eternal day was to decide in great ramillias field if god should reign over his own works below or hell usurp them with tyrannick sway and now the dreadful trumpet sounds to arms when distant clangours are like echoes heard thangelick trumpet of celestial fame which to immortal deeds excites their souls and now they march tattack thembatteld foe and now in terrible array appear awaiting their commanders awful voice like tempests lowering in the heavens they look that blackning all the sky in silence stand before thoutragious wrack of heaven begins like the virgilian god of winds their chief who musters sounding storms and rules their rage with pleasure he their martial eyes surveys and finds them with heroic rage inspired he finds they want no speech to raise their souls to mightiest deeds for in their eyes he sees they have already gained the glorious day up to the heavens his eyes the hero casts and there the angel with his flaming sword and victory with eagles wings he spies towering along the vast ethereal space and now a glorious flame from heaven descends and agitates and shakes his mighty soul and this is the first hour that ere he found its movements difficult to be restrained with ardor strait he gives the fatal word and now the trumpet sounds the dreadful charge and like the last eternal trump it sounds for now at hand the end of time appears and the expiring worlds last ghastful hour for hideous is the face of nature now the heavens are all on fire the welkin burns earth trembles and the air tormented groans the warring elements earth air and fire are raging in stupendous motion all and earth with air confounded and with fire and bursts of horrid thunder rend the heavens and seem to be expiring natures groans but no swift motion no impetuous rage of missive earth or of exploded air or of expanded fire can equal half thoutragious motions of undaunted minds divinely swift in tenements of clay while to thattack thembattelld squadrons move and clashing with amazing fury join on one side thangel and bright victory on the other discord with the infernal powers and all the auxiliaries of heaven and hell their mighty movements for a while suspend the motions of frail mortals to behold who transports of immortal fury show above the weak condition of poor dust above the frail concerns of wretched men while wondering they behold with all their eyes the whole confederate and the gallick powers raging and working like divided seas which adverse storms against each other drive while joves artillery rattling over them flies all their admiring eyes are chiefly bent on malboroughs every motion every look next him argyle drew all their wondering eyes argyle the young the beautiful the brave fit for deep counsels even in early bloom of thought profound without experience wise without the ruinous expense of years in counsel all sedateness and all thought but in the bloody field all rage all fire champion of union in the bloody field where still the godlike youth made war for peace in cabinets he union too advised and in grave senates constantly he strove the jarring nations to unite in love with dreadful majesty great malborough marched and like the fancied god of war he looked when he flies thundering over the plains of thrace and terrors march before his iron carr and sounding devastation comes behind argyle was like the fancied god of love when he contracts his brow and bends his bow and drawing his inevitable shafts wounds deeply human breasts tunite their hearts without their furious britons both appear and foreign squadrons to the charge they lead but germans danes and dutch turn britons all when britons genius in its godlike chiefs shines out and fires them to immortal deeds and leads them to the charge unknowing to retire o would some angel give me force to paint the dreadful stalk of discords sounding march between conflicting hosts before her marched ten thousand terrors natives all of hell commanded by their grizly monarch death each stride entrenched the earth on which she strode the air was tempested the ether frowned mean while the snaky horrors of her head were wrapped in pitchy clouds from which her eyes red lightning dart and thunder was her voice as sternly she the field of death surveys and finds that fate in every other part was doubtful but where mighty malbrough shined there victory there destiny declared she gives a monstrous yell that frighting shakes the utmost fortresses of belgian land the mountains tremble at the horrid din the vales rebellow to the monstrous roar when thus the terrors and their grizly king the fury in a frightful tone accosts have ye then found an overmatch at last are ye contented basely to submit to the efforts of yon confederate powers over which till malbrough at their head appeared ye always have prevailed nay now prevail over squadrons which remote from him engage but see he comes this thunderbolt of war look how against the storm he headlong drives by all that is impious upon us he drives nay now he is in the midst of us he is here he unconcerned and only we amazed is it then possible that one frail man can thus resist the force of all your powers and drive you frighted back upon your friends and can ye poorly bear thextream affront ye host of terrors and thou grizly death if ye are terrors armed with deadly stings if thou art death my cruel offspring death and not an empty bugbear to scare boys oh fly oh seize dispatch thaudacious wretch oh pierce him stab him in the vital st part ha how aghast with stupid eyes thou starst to see this briton amidst all thy powers serene and with a dauntless brow appear thou fool with all this calm and dreadless brow this is no god but a mere mortal man as subject to thy arm as the vile slave muster thy terrors then in dire array and scare this hitherto undaunted brave then then be ready with thy fatal dart let me alone to give thee certain aim and so dispatching one we conquer all but who though master of an angels force an angels genius and an angels voice of song celestial eloquence divine can worthily describe in dreadful style the fearful march of the infernal powers who now prepare tattack great malbroughs life grim death his meager skeleton expands into a form immense then musters all his terrors in astonishing array and charges them tappear to mortal eyes his terrors put on their most hideous forms forms which with horror nature sees and shakes and from its outworks trembling life retreats and to the heart its citadel retires in phalanx then the hero they assail the godlike hero views them and reviews considers them disdains them and repells but into madness starts the generous steed at the dire sight he flies he bounds he foams flashes of lightning from his eye balls fly and from his nostrils curling clouds of smoke then shrieking on his hindmost feet he springs then groans and floundring with his rider falls the gaul and the bavarian rend the sky discord returns the roar of vast applause and death and all the infernal powers rejoice but through thallies a mortal murmur runs and all their spirits with their hero fallen and victory has charms for them no more the heavnly spirits are themselves concerned and for a moment wonder what this means and doubt least they mistook the voice of fate the ruffians now whom discord had suborned present a hundred fusees at his life at once an hundred fiery globes discharge but a strong unseen hand diverts them all grim death bestrides him with a giant stride and scowls upon him with a walleyd glare then lifting brandishes his fatal dart yet wants the power to strike but looks askew and cannot bear the heroes dauntless eye when discord cries aloud o strike my son is not our dreadful adversary fallen yes from the pinnacle of glory fallen fallen in a moment to the abjectest state o foolish sentence judgment falsely past for hear the angel in thaethereal space o greatest thou he cries of mortal men who art as dauntless in the arms of death as we whom heaven has placed above his reach serene as when thou orecamst at bleinems field then conquest saw thee humble and serene death finds thee firm and undejected now o greatest thou he cries of mortal men courage surpassing human godlike state which nothing can depress and nothing raise never was mortal more severly tried but now it is past and perfect art thou found and worthy found to free the laboring world for since within the very arms of death thou have the high security enjoyed of blissful beings who can die no more thou shall their high felicity enjoy for thy unshaken mind can bear it all what angels dictate and what angels do whose words and acts are swifter than our thoughts in moments mortals cannot speak in hours down he comes shooting on his golden wings and on the spot in all his glory lights where in the arms of death his malbrough lay the hero quickened by the approach of heaven springs from thembrace of death and on his feet as swift as are the wings of lightning bounds the heavenly spirits in thaetherial space and all the empyrean shouts for joy when he who while he sojourned here on earth first his command to godlike malbro gave sent down from heaven now gives it him once more the troops are wild with ecstasy of joy to see their general from the bonds of death to conpuest and eternal glory rise death from immortal splendor roaring flies and yelling discord flies from love divine now the brave squadrons to his aid arrive and now another fiery steed present and with their cries the eager hero urge to lead them on to everlasting fame the hero mounts the squadrons rend the skies mounting with him to heaven their spirits soar the hero mounts but discord while he mounts and death outrageous to be thus repulsed level a canon at his sacred head but from his sacred head the pondrous ball diverted bringfield who remounts him kills and consecrates him to eternal fame who dies for such a chief in such a cause through the confederate troops the angel now the spirit of celestial union spreads and he who while he sojourned here on earth first bound the nations in the bonds of love is sent from heaven that union to confirm and to augment in great ramillias field malbrough remounted feels the joys of heaven the wisdom and the force of gods he feels and now he leads the shouting squadrons on daring as if they were immortal all with hearts and souls unanimous they advance united as they were one nation all one family relations all and friends one interest have they all one noble cause with fury inexpressible they advance and greatly each resolves to die for all the french who brave resistance made till now now can their fierce attacks no longer bear they can no longer bear their very eyes and fatal meens but fainting all recoil and death and discord with their hellborn host headlong upon their gallick friends are diven the routed gauls divide disband disperse they fly the angel waves his flaming sword at which expected signal on the wing thamazing terrors of the almighty stoop and persecute and plague their broken rear make some precipitate their shameful flight while others basely beg for wretched life and others trembling faint and sink and die thus discord and the gaul were forced to yield to malbrough and to unions sacred power the end errata page    line   for retire read retires p    l   for head r hear p    l   for calamities r calamitous p    l   after mocked a comma ibid for in vain
