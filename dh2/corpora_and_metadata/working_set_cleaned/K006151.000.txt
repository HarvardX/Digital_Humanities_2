odes by mr gray author of an elegy in a country churchyard  phonanta synetoisi  pindar olymp ii dublin printed for g faulkner in essexstreet and j rudd at the apollo in damestreet mdcclvii  ode i   awake aeolian lyre awake and give to rapture all thy trembling strings from helicons harmonious springs a thousand rills their mazy progress take the laughing flowers that round them blow drink life and fragrance as they flow now the rich stream of music winds along deep majestic smooth and strong through verdant vales and ceres golden reign now rolling down the steep amain headlong impetuous see it pour the rocks and nodding groves rebellow to the roar i   oh sovereign of the willing soul parent of sweet and solemnbreathing airs enchanting shell the sullen cares and frantic passions hear thy soft control on thracias hills the lord of war has curbed the fury of his car and dropped his thirsty lance at thy command perching on the sceptred hand of jove thy magic lulls the feathered king with ruffled plumes and flagging wing quenched in dark clouds of slumber lie the terror of his beak and lightenings of his eye i   thee the voice the dance obey tempered to thy warbled lay over idalias velvetgreen the rosycrowned loves are seen on cythereas day with antic sports and blueeyd pleasures frisking light in frolic measures now pursuing now retreating now in circling troops they meet to brisk notes in cadence beating glance their manytwinkling feet slow melting strains their queens approach declare wherever she turns the graces homage pay with arms sublime that float upon the air in gliding state she wins her easy way over her warm cheek and rising bosom move the bloom of young desire and purple light of love ii   mans feeble race what ills await labor and penury the racks of pain disease and sorrows weeping train and death sad refuge from the storms of fate the fond complaint my song disprove and justify the laws of jove say has he given in vain the heavenly muse night and all her sickly dews her specter wan and birds of boding cry he gives to range the dreary sky till down the eastern cliffs afar hyperions march they spy and glittering shafts of war ii   in climes beyond the solar road where shaggy forms over icebuilt mountains roam the muse has broke the twilightgloom to cheer the shivering natives dull abode and often beneath the odorous shade of chilis boundless forests laid she deigns to hear the savage youth repeat in loose numbers wildly sweet their feathercinctured chiefs and dusky loves her track wherever the goddess roves glory pursue and generous shame the unconquerable mind and freedoms holy flame ii   woods that wave over delphis steep isles that crown the egaean deep fields that cool ilissus laves or where maeanders amber waves in lingering labrinths creep how do your tuneful echos lanquish mute but to the voice of anguish where each old poetic mountain inspiration breathed around every shade and hallowed fountain murmured deep a solemn sound till the sad nine in greeces evil hour left their parnassus for the latian plains alike they scorn the pomp of tyrantpower and coward vice that revels in her chains when latium had her lofty spirit lost they sought oh albion next thy seaencircled coast iii   far from the sun and summergale in thy green lap was natures darling laid what time where lucid avon strayed to him the mighty mother did unveil her awful face the dauntless child stretched forth his little arms and smiled this pencil take she said whose colors clear richly paint the vernal year thine too these golden keys immortal boy this can unlock the gates of joy of horror that and thrilling fears or open the sacred source of sympathetic tears iii   nor second he that rode sublime upon the seraphwings of ecstasy the secrets of the abyss to spy he passed the flaming bounds of place and time the living throne the saphireblaze where angels tremble while they gaze he saw but blasted with excess of light closed his eyes in endless night behold where drydens less presumptuous car wide over the fields of glory bear two coursers of ethereal race with necks in thunder clothed and longresounding pace iii   hark his hands the lyre explore brighteyed fancy hovering over scatters from her pictured urn thoughts that breath and words that burn but ah it is heard no more  oh lyre divine what daring spirit wakes thee now though he inherit nor the pride nor ample pinion that the theban eagle bear sailing with supreme dominion thro the azure deep of air yet often before his infant eyes would run such forms as glitter in the muses ray with orient hues unborrowd of the sun yet shall he mount and keep his distant way beyond the limits of a vulgar fate beneath the good how far  but far above the great the following ode is founded on a tradition current in wales that edward the first when he completed the conquest of that country ordered all the bards that fell into his hands to be put to death  ode ii i   ruin seize thee ruthless king confusion on thy banners wait tho fanned by conquests crimson wing they mock the air with idle state helm nor hauberks twisted mail nor even thy virtues tyrant shall avail to save thy secret soul from nightly fears from cambrias curse from cambrias tears such were the sounds that over the crested pride of the first edward scattered wild dismay as down the steep of snowdons shaggy side he wound with toilsome march his long array stout gloucester stood aghast in speechless trance to arms cried mortimer and couched his quivering lance i   on a rock whose haughty brow frowns over old conways foaming flood robed in the sable garb of woe with haggard eyes the poet stood loose his beard and hoary hair streamed like a meteor to the troubled air and with a masters hand and prophets fire struck the deep sorrows of his lyre hark how each giantoak and desert cave sighs to the torrents aweful voice beneath oer thee oh king their hundred arms they wave revenge on thee in hoarser murmurs breath vocal no more since cambrias fatal day to highborn hoels harp or soft llewellyns lay i   cold is cadwallos tongue that hushed the stormy main brave urien sleeps upon his craggy bed mountains ye mourn in vain modred whose magic song made huge plinlimmon bow his cloudtopd head on dreary arvons shore they lie smeard with gore and ghastly pale far far aloof the affrighted ravens sail the famished eagle screams and passes by dear lost companions of my tuneful art dear as the light that visits these sad eyes dear as the ruddy drops that warm my heart ye died amidst your dying countrys cries  no more i weep they do not sleep on yonder cliffs a griesly band i see them sit they linger yet avengers of their native land with me in dreadful harmony they join and weave with bloody hands the tissue of thy line ii   weave the warp and weave the woof the winding sheet of edwards race give ample room and verge enough the characters of hell to trace mark the year and mark the night when severn shall reeccho with affright the shrieks of death through berkleys roofs that ring shrieks of an agonizing king shewolf of france with unrelenting fangs that tearst the bowels of thy mangled mate from thee be born who over thy country hangs the scourge of heaven what terrors round him wait amazement in his van with flight combined and sorrows faded form and solitude behind ii   mighty victor mighty lord low on his funeral couch he lies no pitying heart no eye afford a tear to grace his obsequies is the sable warrior fled thy son is gone he rests among the dead the swarm that in thy noontide beam were born gone to salute the rising morn fair laughs the morn and soft the zephyr blows while proudly riding over the azure realm in gallant trim the gilded vessel goes youth on the prow and pleasure at the helm regardless of the sweeping whirlwinds sway that hushed in grim repose expects his eveningprey ii    richard the second as we are told by archbishop scroop thomas of walsingham and all the older writers was starved to death the story of his assassination by sir piers of exon is of much later date fill high the sparkling bowl the rich repast prepare reft of a crown he yet may share the feast close by the regal chair fell thirst and famine scowl a baleful smile upon their baffled guest heard ye the din of battle bray lance to lance and horse to horse long years of havoc urge their destined course and through the kindred squadrons mow their way ye towers of julius londons lasting shame with many a foul and midnight murder fed revere his consorts faith his fathers fame and spare the meek usurpers holy head above below the rose of snow twined with her blushing foe we spread the bristled boar in infantgore wallows beneath the thorny shade now brothers bending over the accursed loom stamp we our vengeance deep and ratify his doom iii   edward lo to sudden fate weave we the woof the thread is spun  eleanor of castile died a few years after the conquest of wales the heroic proof she gave of her affection for her lord is well known the monuments of his regret and sorrow sor the loss of her are still to be seen in several parts of england half of thy heart we consecrate the web is wove the work is done stay oh stay nor thus forlorn leave me unblessed unpitied here to mourn in yon bright track that fires the western skies they melt they vanish from my eyes but oh what solemn scenes on snowdons height descending slow their glittering skirts unroll visions of glory spare my aching sight ye unborn ages crowd not on my soul no more our longlost arthur we bewail allhail accession of the line of tudor  ye genuine kings britannias issue hail iii   girt with many a baron bold sublime their starry fronts they rear and gorgeous dames and statesmen old in bearded majesty appear in the midst a form divine her eye proclaims her of the britonline her lyonport her awecommanding face attemperd sweet to virgingrace what strings symphonious tremble in the air what strains of vocal transport round her play hear from the grave great taliessin taliessin chief of the bards flourished in the vith century his works are still preserved and his memory held in high veneration among his countrymen  hear they breath a soul to animate thy clay bright rapture calls and soaring as she sings waves in the eye of heaven her manycolourd wings iii   the verse adorn again fierce war and faithful love and truth severe by fairy fiction dressed in buskined measures move pale grief and pleasing pain with horror tyrant of the throbbing breast a voice as of the cherubchoir gales from blooming eden bear and distant warblings lessen on my ear that lost in long futurity expire fond impious man think thou yon sanguine cloud raisd by thy breath has quenched the orb of day tomorrow he repairs the golden flood and warms the nations with redoubled ray enough for me with joy i see the different doom our fates assign be thine despair and sceptred
