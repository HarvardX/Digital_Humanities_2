an epistle to dr shebbeare to which is added an ode to sir fletcher norton in imitation of horace ode viii book iv  by malcolm macgreggor of knightsbridge esquire author of the heroic epistle to sir wm chambers etc  london printed for j almon opposite burlingtonhouse piccadilly  mdcclxxvii  price one shilling and sixpence  advertisement though i look upon this poem in point of elevation of diction and sublimity of sentiment to be as highly heroical as my epistle to sir william chambers yet i have not thought proper to add that epithet to it on the title page i am willing to wish that first production of my muse may preserve the distinction which it now possesses of being called the heroic epistle par excellence besides this consideration the different ranks of the two persons to whom these two works are addressed require a difference to be made in this matter and it would be unpardonable in me not to discriminate between a comptroller of his majestys works and the hackney scribbler of a newspaper between a placeman and a pensioner a knight of the polar star and a broken apothecary  an epistle to dr shebbeare o for a thousand tongues and every tongue like johnsons armed with words of six feet long in multitudinous vociferation to panegyricize this glorious nation whose liberty results from her taxation ver   words of six feet long sesquipedalia verba hor    o for that passive pensionary spirit that by its prostitution proves its merit that rests on right divine all regal claims and gives to george whater it gave to james then should my tory numbers old shebbeare tickle the tattered fragment of thy ear then all that once was virtuous wise or brave that quelled a tyrant that abhorred a slave then sydneys russels patriot fame should fall besmeared with mire like black dalrymples gall then like thy prose should my felonious verse tear each immortal plume from nassaus hearse that modern monarchs in that plumage gay might stare and strut the peacocks of a day but i like ansty feel myself unfit to run with hollow speed two heats of wit ver    tickle the tattered fragment churchill in alluding to this capital anecdote in our doctors life says in his poem called the author  the whole intent  of that parade was fame not punishment  intimating that his ears received no detriment in the pillory my line intimates that they did however if my intimation be false it is easily refuted the doctor has only to expose his ears again to the public and the real fact will be flagrant    he at first starting won both fame and money the betts ran high on bladuds cicerone since distancd quite like a galled jade he winces and lashes unknown priests and praises wellknown princes so i when first i tuned the heroic lay gained pownalls praise as well as almons pay in me the nation placed its tuneful hope its second churchill or at least its pope proudly i pricked along sir williams squire bade kings recite my strains and queens admire chaste maids of honor praised my stout endeavor sir thomas swore the fellow was damned clever ver    bladuds cicerone anglice bath guide  ver    lashes unknown priests without a note posterity will never understand this line two or three years ago this gentleman found himself libelled in a newspaper and on suspecting a certain clergyman to be the author he wrote a first canto of a poem called the priest dissected in which he prepared all chirurgical matters previous to the operation in the mean time the parson proved an alibi and saved his bacon to this first and unique canto the author prefixed a something in which he exculpated himself from being the author of the heroic epistle which it seems had been laid to his charge during the time the clan of macgreggors continued without a name and which as the world well knows was the only reason which prevented me from claiming the merit of that production it is to this something that the latter part of the line alludes for in it he had told the public that his majesty had ten children which it knew very well before hence the epithet wellknown  ver    sir thomas the petronius of the present age needs not the addition of a surname to make the world certain who is meant by this appellative    but popularity alas has wings and flits as soon from poets as from kings my pompous posiscript found itself disdained as much as miltons paradise regained  and when i dared the patent snuffers handle to trim with pinchys aid old englands candle the lyric muse so lame was her condition could hardly hop beyond a third edition yes it is a general truth and strange as true kenrick shall prove it in his next review that no one bard in these degenerate days can write two works deserving equal praise whether the matter of which minds are made be grown of late mephitic and decayed or wants phlogiston i forbear to say the problems more in doctor priestleys way he knows of spirit the material whole for priestley has the cure of shlb  es soul ver    the cure of shlb  es soul it is not here insinuated that the soul in question wants curing the word cure is here put for care in the sense in which ecclesiastical lawyers use cura animarum

consequently forgotten yet if the reader will please to recollect how easily i brought to life sir william chamberss prose dissertation which had been dead half that time he will i hope give me credit for being able to recover this dead poem from oblivion also it was sent to her majesty on her birthday with a present of irish grogram and the newspaper of the day said but i know not how truly that the queen was graciously pleased to thank the noble author for both his pieces of stuff the poets exordium seemed to have been taken from that very ode in horace which i have also attempted to imitate in this pamphlet it began by assuring her majesty that ireland was too poor to present her with a piece of gold plate  could poor ierne gifts afford worthy the consort of her lord of purest gold a sculpterd frame just emblem of her zeal should flame this supposed poverty of his native country struck me at the time as a mere gratisdictum i have therefore from verse   0 to verse     of this epistle endeavored to refute it for the honor of ireland    sure then she might afford to my poor thinking one golden tumbler for queen charlottes drinking i care not if her hinds on fens and rocks

i will pay it  it will purchase yankee blood  ver     i care not etc alluding to these lines in the same poem where starving hinds from fens and rocks view pastures rich with herds and flocks and only view  forbid to taste etc and in a note on the passage he tells us that these hinds never eat animal food but says not one word about potatoes that most nutritious of all aliments which is surely very disingenuous    and well i ween for this heroic lay almon will give me wherewithal to pay tax then ye greedy ministers your fill no matter if with ignorance or skill be ours to pay and that is an easy

a genuine poet has more of meaning and intent than h modern acts of parliament it is i fit and right when heroes die the nation should a tomb supply yet not the votes of both the houses without the assistance of the muses can give that permanence of fame that heroes from their country claim and tell me pray to our good king what fame our present broils can bring even k should the howes which

does to me great delectation it is whispered by some people in the secret that the very pacific cast of the laureats birthday ode occasioned the noble bards exaltation as it was thought expedient to have another poetical placeman in readiness to celebrate the final overthrow of the american rebels nay it is assured that a reversionary grant of the office of laureat has in this instance been
