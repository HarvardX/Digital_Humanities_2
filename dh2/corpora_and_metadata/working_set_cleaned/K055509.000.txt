britannias glory first from ships arose  to shipping still her power and wealth she owes let each experienced briton then impart  his naval skill to perfect naval art   a treatise on practical seamanship with hints and remarks relating thereto designed to contribute something toward fixing rules upon philosophical and rational principles to make ships and the management of them and also navigation in general more perfect and consequently less dangerous and destructive to health lives and property  by william hutchinson mariner and dock master at liverpool  printed and sold for the author at all the principal seaports in great britain and ireland       the address this treatise on practical seamanship with hints and remarks relating thereto as mentioned in the contents is humbly addressed to all whom the different parts mostly concern but more especially to young sea officers who use their utmost endeavors under providence to make the knowledge and discharge of their duty in their stations the principal pleasure and pursuit of their time which may make them a benefit and not a burden to their country their friends and themselves in their voyage through life  it must be allowed that the improvement of our ships and the management of them for many years past has given that remarkable superiority british seamen have over others on all important occasions yet i have learned from experience that this art of seamanship and its importance is not so generally understood amongst us as it deserves for one trading part of the nation has by their practice the experience the other wants  some men are so devoted to the methods they have been accustomed to that they cannot be prevailed upon to try another others endeavor to try impracticable methods and attempt to make ships do impossibilities such as to back them astern clear of a single anchor when the wind is right against the windward tide that drives them to windward of their anchors or to back a ship with sails so set as to prevent her from shooting ahead toward a danger when laid to or driving broad side with the wind right against the tide not knowing that a ship driving on either tack will always shoot and advance bodily forward the way her head lies in spite of any sails that can be set aback all which i trust will be shown in their proper places in the following work  not only the above instances by which i have known ships go on shore but the whole duty and conduct of sea officers as far as mentioned in this book has hitherto been left entirely to the slow progress of experience by which they and all concerned with them are constantly liable to be great sufferers by mistaken practices in seamanship  frequent observations of this defect induced me to endeavor to fix the best rules for practical seamanship that seamen may not be left entirely to learn their duty by their own and other peoples misfortunes which has been the case hitherto but by the experience of others who have gone before them from all that i have seen in the many different trades that i have been employed in those seamen in the coal and coasting trade to the city of london are the most perfect in working and managing their ships in narrow intricate and difficult channels and in tide ways and the seamen in the east india trade are so on the open seas  i have heard it was said by the great doctor halley that the safety of navigating ships in his time depended principally upon three ls meaning lead latitude and lookout but a late mathematician a friend of mine at liverpool said that there was no hidden or unknown principles concerned in the art of building sailing working and managing of ships but the laws of motion the pressure of fluids and the properties of the leaver which are all well known to the british philosophers and mathematicians and nothing so much deserved their attention and pursuit to bring this art to its utmost perfection for the welfare and support of great britain  these reasons and that of the most of the useful arts having been made public to our great improvement and advantage emboldens me to publish this labored performance on this long neglected subject which i must own will appear to great disadvantage from the unexpected difficulties i have found in being a new writer venturing to lead the way on so important and extensive a subject in this learned criticizing age but for my imperfections as a scholar i hope the critics will make allowance for my having been early in life at sea as cook of a collier and having since then gone through all the most active enterprising employments i could meet with as a seaman who has done his best and who as an author would be glad of any remarks heartily pointed out how to improve his

of liverpool page  0  the conclusion page  0  practical seamanship as the elements principally concerned in the management of ships are air or wind and water i hope i shall be excused in taking the liberty to endeavor to explain what i have learned from others or know myself from experience of the properties of these fluids so far as they may concern practical seamanship  on air it is enough for our purpose here to say that air in motion which moves ships is a fluid body as much as the water they swim in this is proved from many experiments and may be perceived from what we see ordained by the all great author of nature in birds insects and all animals that fly how they float or swim steer and govern their directions through the air by their wings and tails upon the same principles that fish swim in water  and air is proved by experiment to have its weight in air of about seventeen grains to a quart near the surface of the sea the weight of air as a quart vessel when the air is pumped out by an air pump weighs about seventeen grains less than when the air is in it but the air weighs less and less in proportion as it is higher above the surface or level of the sea and its property is to buoy up or raise any matter that is lighter than it self bulk for bulk as may be seen by smoke steam or vapors rising up to certain heights till they come to air that is of the same weight with themselves where they float and make mists fogs or clouds which darken the sky and hinders us from seeing any considerable distance about us till they are dispersed or separated or fall in rain or snow etc  confined air in ships deserves particular notice it often occasions diseases foul air in ships and sometimes immediate death as has frequently been the case in the pump wells of ships of war charcoal fires etc in close places are dangerous and sometimes fatal too many people together in close places filth and dirt made and suffered to continue below fouls the air therefore every seaman that does not know it should be told that by his common breathing he fouls a gallon of air and requires a gallon of fresh air to breath in every minute so that for the preservation of themselves they should not grudge or think much to keep the places where they rest as clear and clean as things will admit of and use every method possible to keep ships clear of bad air which becomes proportionably heavier as it becomes more foul and loosing its circulating property it naturally descends to and stagnates in the lowest vacancies where it hastens to corruption every thing that is subject to decay even the ship and her materials and much more so the provisions which must consequently make unhealthy ships  to get clear of foul air when foul air in ships proceeds from their being over crowded with people below which may prove very fatal to prevent the bad effects of its lying in a ship i would recommend to keep the pumps constantly working though no water in the ship till a lighted candle will burn clear in the bottom of the pump well where the worst air lodges as being the lowest and greatest vacancy in ships holds and all water pumps will act the part of air pumps or ventilators as it is known that the water would not rise to the sucking pumps if the air was not first pumped out of them and as guinea ships whilst the slaves are on board have their large close fire furnace standing nearly over their pump well how easy might a short copper pipe of about fourinch bore be made to go into an iron nozel in the side of the furnace and the other end on to a lead or wooden pipe of near the same bore that might be carried down into the pump well by various ways and as they make their fires for cooking just after midnight which is the time when all the slaves are below and then ventilators are most wanted it is known from experience in ships of war were such pipes are used that whilst the fire burn by its rarefaction it will draw up and expel a constant flow of air from the pump well so that by these means the lowest and foulest air may be got out of ships and the fresh air will naturally circulate and take its place the pressure of air   the power of the airs pressure on all bodies near the surface of the sea is computed to be about fifteen pounds weight on every square inch it presses every way in all directions not only downwards but slanting sideways and upwards as may be seen in common without machines for that purpose by those little round leather suckers as they are called used by boys at play which when wet and clapped upon smooth stones press the air from between the stone and the sucker then hawling upon the string in the middle it makes a small vacuum or little hollow space void of air and the airs pressure upwards opposite to the vacuum is what the stones are lifted and carried by about the streets  the pressure of the air downwards is known and experienced in many cases the bad effects the airs pressure may have on ships etc which ground in mud and its bad effects are felt upon ships sometimes when they take out a raft port which they think high enough out of the water when the ship is afloat but if she after that grounds by the tide leaving her upon mud so as to press the water from under part of the bottom the airs pressure downwards against that part in the mud where there is neither air nor water will confine the ship from rising out of the mud till the water flows much above her floating mark and the water may run in at the raftport and sink her and in small vessels which are deep loaded and lie aground upon mud and especially if their bottoms are flat such as a great number of vessels are which carry goods up and down rivers when deep laden the masters dread and avoid as much as they can laying them in the mud on account of its suction as it is commonly called and thought to be but is entirely owing to the airs pressure downwards acting upon the parts where the air and water are pressed from under them that their vessels are in danger of sinking before they can rise or float out of the mud and which sometimes pulls pieces of sheathing off ships bottoms from the same cause when the water gets between the bottom and the sheathing and none between that and the mud the same cause will also keep wood or any other thing that will swim and is lighter than water from rising for if their buoyancy dont lift them before the water flows upon them the weight and pressure of the water is then added to the airs pressure downwards to prevent their rising  if a man though famous for swiming or diving how mud may occasion people to be drowned by accident should fall or out of bravado jump into the water to dive if his feet only reaches the mud and sink so far as to press the water from under them the pressure of the air and water downwards will hold his feet so fast that all his struggling will not be able to relieve him the only help that can be given him is something that he may grasp or lay hold of with his hands before he looses his senses or a boathook etc to hook him at all hazard and to hawl him out of the mud  the airs pressure is the cause of what is commonly called suction what is commonly or vulgarly termed suction is caused by the pressure of the air which forces and raises the water upwards in our common suckingpumps as they are called where the working of the boxes and clappers only pump up the air first and takes off its pressure downwards from the inside or bore of the pump when the air pressing upon the water in the well will make it rise to the height of thirtythree feet above its level up a pump or pipe where the power of the air is taken off and quicksilver that is about fourteen times the weight of water will rise to about thirtyone inches in a tube or glass pipe void of air  and these prove a balance or equal weight to the pressure of our air or atmosphere and which air when in its most dense or heaviest state will very seldom raise these fluids higher  on the weather judged from the weight of the air but the air in our northern climates is constantly varying and is sometimes about a tenth part rarer or lighter than at other times consequently when lightest looses about a tenth part of its power to buoy up any matter that is floating in it or to raise water or quicksilver which last then stands at its lowest station in our barometers or weatherglasses at about twentyeight inches high on the index where the weather is marked the consequence of the airs being in its rarest or lightest state is that either the watery particles floating in it will fall in snow or rain or it is made light by an over charge of elementary fire or sulphurous particles floating in it by which i have had my sails stuck full of black specks from the dews falling then upon them when sailing upon the coast of barbary this inflamatory matter in the air no doubt is the cause of lightening and thunder for i have seen the same sort of black specks on the sails of ships where they have been struck and tore with lightening and if rain snow or thunder does not happen a storm of wind as marked on the index is expected to be the consequence by the airs flying or rushing along with a swift motion from where it is dense or heavier and endeavoring to come to an equality in weight with the place where it is rare or in its lightest state as the air increases in its weight it presses the heavier on the quicksilver or mercury below and raises it proportionably higher in the tube and when it comes to twentynine inches and a half the air is then reckoned at the medium or middle state and there the weather is marked changeable but when the mercury comes to be forced above thirty inches from that to thirtyone inches is marked fair dry frost serene weather etc as such may be expected when the air is dense or in its heavy state it then raises and buoys up the particles floating in it to a greater height where they may be separated so as to make the sky clear of clouds for a time these are the conclusions which i imagine our philosophers fixed on when they endeavored to make the barometer or air weigher to foretell the different weather that might be expected  but as a sailor i venture to say of the uncertainty of weather glasses that the weather often proves very different from what is pointed out by our weatherglasses or by any other of those improved instruments or rules that have been made by later and more accurate observers of the air and weather that i have yet seen and i doubt their being of any great service to seafaring people for i have seen strong gails with a high glass not only easterly which commonly raises the mercury but when up at thirty inches i have known it blow strong westerly with rain and snow i have likewise seen moderate and fair weather with the mercury as low as twentyeight inches three tenths i have been in the open ocean along way from any land in moderate and fair weather sailing pleasantly along when suddenly the ship has been struck with a single flash of lightning this inflamable matter in the air like electrical matter seemed to take fire at the touch of the ships masts  but in justice to barometers i must own i had once a storm once pointed out by the weather glass and but once the advantage of a true admonition of an approaching storm of wind from tampions portable barometer which i carried to sea with me as a weatherglass for some time and this happened at the mouth of the english channel when about seventy vessels sailed from the downs with a moderate breeze in the s e quarter in the morning after leaving the downs i perceived a sudden fall of the quicksilver from about twentynine inches and a half to about twentyeight inches and a half we had then all our small sails set on this alteration i ordered all hands to work and took in our small sails got down topgallant yards and did all that was thought most necessary to prepare for an approaching storm which came on about eight in the evening when we were abreast of the lizard the wind from being moderate at s s e came suddenly to n n w and blowed so strong that though we had no sails loose but the foresail in the brails yet it laid the ship more down on her broadside than ever i knew her by any stress or pressure of sails this sudden change of weather and of the wind to the opposite point of the compass probably proved of bad consequence to all who were unprepared for it the next morning we saw a dutch or danish ship floating bottom up which we supposed was loaded with timber and had been overset by this unexpected storm taking her aback with all sails set and the accounts we had afterward were that most of this fleet suffered damage  on the defects of a weather glass for sea service but i must acknowledge a defect in this portable barometer for sea service which is that the quicksilver always kept the ships motion up and down so that its height must be taken from the medium of that motion and i never had the opportunity of meeting with the marine barometer such as was carried to sea by the great doctor hally and which i judge from its not being continued in practice has not answered the commendable design of giving some certainty of the weather to ships at sea yet it must be allowed that the discovery of these properties in the air or atmosphere has proved of great advantage in the management of pumps and siphons or crooked pipes to raise water and in many other useful inventions  on wind wind may be said to be only the air moving over the surface of our globe from one place where it is heavier toward another place where it is lighter which difference occasions its different directions and the swiftness of its motion is in proportion to the different densities of the air in different places as providence has pleased to order it for many valuable purposes  we call it calm when the air is without motion but when the air moves we call it wind and its power is calculated to increase in proportion to the square of its velocity or swiftness with which it flies which is at the rate of about sixty miles an hour in one of the greatest storms in our climate as the ingenious smeaton has shown in his table of winds after he had found out what may be called the fixed standard for windmill sails from ingenious experiments which i have seen him make in a close room for the air though at rest or in a calm will act upon any body that is put in motion as so much wind of the same swiftness suppose a ship launching in a calm to gain a velocity or run at the rate of a mile in a minute at this time the ship will feel the same effect from this calm as one of our greatest storms of a mile in a minute or sixty miles an hour would have had upon her stern when she was fast upon the stocks and a ship launched with the same velocity and in the same direction with this storm of wind would feel it calm for the time the run as fast as the wind blowed as may be noticed when it happens that ships are launched with a brisk wind and their colors blowing aft the same way they are to run when they come to a quick motion in launching their colors fly fored for that time and when any body is put into so quick a motion through the air as not to give the air time to close behind it in that case it makes in some degree a vacuum and in proportion to this vacuum there will not only be the resistance but the pressure of the air acting upon these bodies which may be near fifteen pounds upon every square inch and this may be the reason why ships masts and yards some times are rolled away in a calm when they are put into so very quick motion by a laboursome ships rolling a ship under way in a calm where there is a strong tide or current will be affected as if a light air or gentle wind was right against and in proportion to the strength of the tide or current as the wind happens to blow with or against the tide or current a ship will feel less or more wind in proportion to the rate of the tide or current  wind in many instances is altered from its natural direction on eddy winds and how the wind is altered from its natural direction as in a narrow river that has high land or high trees close to the water on each side there the wind commonly blows either right up or right down the river when the wind blows right across a river or right off any high land or when a ship is close under high land when it blows strong they often feel such gusts of eddy winds in all directions that ships pendants are sometimes seen to be blown right up in the air in such situations they cannot trim their squaresails fast enough to any advantage therefore it is best to have the squaresails close furled and if any sails can be of advantage it must be the staysails mizen boomsails trysails and such others as may be worked without laying so long aback as to give the ship sternway  a ship sailing close by the wind one particle or part of air drives off the other from the lee or afterleach of the sail which turns the wind from its direction for a little time as may be noticed by a ships aftersails being obliged to be trimmed sharper than her headsails and her ensign not flying above three points to leeward when the ship is sailing near six points from the wind  when ships are sailing quartering or before the wind the wind then blows perpendicular to or right upon the sails which makes them bag more or form a hollow so that the wind when it blows strong may compress the air in the belly of the sail into less compass than its natural state for air contrary to all other fluids has that property that it may be compressed into a very small space as is known by charging and discharging of windguns etc  on water the proporties of water water is a fluid element capable to float ships and philosophers tell us that the particles or single parts of water are so small that their form cannot be preceived by the best microscopes or greatest magnifying glasses but that they must be round and smooth from their moving so freely one amongst another and from their easily giving way and opening a passage for all bodies moving therein and particles of water must be hard and touch each other as it is known from experience that water cannot be compressed or forced into less compass than its natural bulk by any power or weight that can be employed upon it and as action and reaction are equal and contrary to each other it reacts as it is acted upon  water will float the greatest or heaviest bodies that take up more room in water than it self and ships boats or vessels with all they contain in or about them and all other things that will float in water are exactly the same weight as the bulk of water they displace by the bulk of that part of their bodies actually in the water and below their swiming mark which is lower down or higher up according to the weight or density of the water they swim in for ships are known to swim lighter in salt water than in fresh in proportion as the salt is heavier than fresh therefore suppose a pint of water to weigh a pound as it does or thereabouts in common and any thing that will swim in water and weigh a pound put into a vessel full of water will displace or make run over its own bulk of water to its swimming mark a pint for a pound the same rule holds good to ships of the greatest burden or to other bodies according to their bulk  the power and pressure of water is known to increase according to its altitude regardless of its quantity for suppose a tight dock to be made that would nearly fit to the shape of the bottom of one of our first rate ships of war to her floating mark half an inch or the least thickness of water would lift and float this ship as effectually as the whole ocean for water like other fluids presses equally in all directions therefore the water must press equally against the ship as it does against the dock which must consequently float the ship as soon as the water comes to the height of her floating mark and suppose this dock could be filled with water when the ship is out of it it would weigh the same as did the ship with all her materials then in and about her and the small quantity of water which floated her  a ship which has the flatest part of her bottom lying sixteen feet deep on the pressure of water and leaks at different depths which is often the case the water then presses sixteen times as much upwards against this flat part as it does on any part of the same ship about the waters edge and so on to any other part according to its depth and suppose this ship to have four leaks or plug holes of equal bigness that could be drove out occasionally the first at one foot under water the second at four feet the third at nine feet and the lowest at sixteen feet in the flat part of her bilge that hole at four feet deep would leak or let in as much water again in the same time as that at one foot deep and that at nine feet three times as much and that at sixteen feet four times as much though it run into the ship upwards and so on in proportion to the square root of the height of the water above the leak or plug hole therefore leaks in ships are more or less dangerous according to their depth under water  the great doctor halley says different shaped bottles lake by the waters pressure that the pressure of the water thirtythree feet deep which is equal to the pressure of our atmosphere pressed the natural air into half its space in his divinghell i have tried experiments on the pressure of water upon bottles of different shapes corkd up without any thing in them but common air making them fast to a leadline just above the lead when two common square flat sided casebottles which would hold about three half pints each broke at the depth of between six and seven fathom but two oval formed thin florence flasks about the same size bore the pressure to about fifteen fathom deep and a quart bottle round one way but having two sides somewhat flated bore about fifteen fathom and a round common quart bottle broke only at about twentyeight fathom at great depths i imagine few things that are made hollow and tight will bear the waters pressure i have seen an instance of its great power when by my ship driving off the bank in gibralter bay into deep water our anchors would not reach the ground at a hundred fathom and when we hove them up we found our two new nunbuoys had their sides crushed inwards by the waters pressure  on waves water at the surface is powerfully acted upon by the wind and by that according to its strength which forces the water from its natural level which it always endeavors to come to but is prevented and disturbed by several causes acting upon it when the water is in motion by a strong tide or current and the wind blows strong against it it makes the most dangerous and troublesome waves heigh waves at sea are supposed to move along at the rate of about twenty miles in an hour  on ships hulls though i allow that planners and builders of ships generally know best which form is most likely to answer the different trades or other purposes they may be designed for yet as a seaman i hope i shall be excused in taking the liberty of giving some remarks and hints which i think may contribute to make these most noble and useful machines less imperfect than they sometimes are  when ships are contracted for to be built and their dimensions agreed upon the owners commonly want what is called a long floor which is generally reckoned to make ships have all good properties and this long floor is made by having so many floortimbers exactly of the same mold laid all at equal height on a straight keel in the mainbody or most bearing part of the ship and are called very properly so many dead flats and then the other floor timbers begin to have more rise till they come to stand upon dead wood toward the stem and sternpost to form the entrance and run of the ship  against building shs with long straight floors this method of building ships with long straight floors as abovementioned for many reasons may be proved to be a wrong practice for it is well known how much greater power any great stress by weight or pressure of fluids has upon any body that is straight or flat and how little they will bear in proportion to bodies that are made curvd or some ways circular so as to form some sort of an arch as may be observed in those almost flat arches which though made of but small and loose materials such as brick and mortar will bear great stress and weight upon them and it is known from experiments by the air pump how much less pressure of air from without will break a vessel that is flat sided than will break a vessel that is rounding or circular which last will bear the whole pressure of the atmosphere without being hurt and the experiments mentioned in the ninth page of the pressure of water on different shaped bottles show us that the first square casebottle which broke at between six and seven fathom deep had two of its sides a little rounding outward which two sides came up whole but the other two being more flat were burst in notwithstanding the extraordinary thickness of the glass of these square bottles compared with that of the florence flasks which are made like an egg shell and which bore fifteen fathom pressure these experiments and what may be learned from observation show the bad effects which the water often has by its great power of pressing upwards against the long floor of a ship so that it soon makes the place of these dead flats hog and become a hollow upwards whilst the ship in her upperworks seems to keep her proper sheer and that this is a fact may be perceived by any one who takes the least notice when they see long floord ships laid upon even ground how the keel and the floord part of the bottom bends upwards or when put upon level blocks in a gravingdock how hard they bear upon the fore and after blocks which blocks i have known split and the keel damaged by the stress being much more upon its fore and after parts than on that part under the flat of the floor and that the ship has been so strained as to be obliged to be dockd a second time which must naturally weaken her and she must carry less weight in proportion as her floor is bulged upwards which must form one of the worst bottoms a ship can swim upon by its being a hollow upwards where it should be rounding downwards which in my opinion would contribute greatly to make ships stronger to bear the pressure of the ground as well as the water and help their sailing steering staying and wareing  for the above reasons and many others which might be given to build ships with rounding bottoms i am of opinion that all ships should be built with a root or rank end of a keelpiece fored and which should be straight all the way below and the upper part worked with a curve from the stem to the afterpart of the floor so that the fore and main part of the ships bottom may be made to form a curve or be rounding a little downwards suppose with about the same sheer as ships bends have in common and the stem should project with such a rake forward from the upper part of the keel that all the horizontal waterlines in the ships entrance may form curves outward all the way which will be less resisted in passing through the water than those unnatural hollows which are too commonly made there and which i have known to occasion very destructive pitching motions in a fine ship  the above method of building in my opinion would turn to the advantage of all concerned for by the floor timbers lying so much farther forward on this curvd part of the keel it self without chocks or the dead wood fored that is commonly made use of the ship will be stronger and more buoyant to carry more with less timber iron and workmanship i would recommend the deep end of the keel to project as far forward before the scarf of the stem and the fore gripe added to it to be as rank as can with safety be fastened this with the deepest part of the keel fored will make up for what may be thought wanting in the uprightness of the stem and the rankness of the keel under the lowest flooring to help the ship sailing by the wind the stern post should have no more rake aft than just to make the back of the rudder stand upright when the ship is upon an even keel and the run or afterpart of the bottom to be according to the main and forepart if built full for burden at a small draft of water the run in proportion to be fuller and shorter to make her answer this purpose but if the ship is to be built sharp for sailing fast by the wind as well as with the wind large then she will require a long run drawn fair without any extraordinary full part in the water to hinder it from rising and closing to its level again regularly and readily in proportion as the body of the ship may be forced through the water without making a great eddy or carrying much dead water after her but sharpness may be carried to an extreme for ships require a spreading body at the waters edge both before and abaft to support them from being plunged too deep into the sea and gives the water more afterbody to act upon as it rises and closes abaft to help the ship forward in her progressive motion when sailing fast  difference of sharp and full ships sailing from experience i can say that the sharp and slight built ships will sail faster than the firm and full built in little winds though when it blows strong they will not bear to be pressed with sail above certain degrees to advantage but otherwise then the fuller and stronger built ship will have the advantage by bearing pressure of sail and will then perform better in proportion to the strength with which the wind blows  i have sailed in a ship built full for carrying in the east india trade which was took by a french squadron in little wind but when the wind blew strong she could be the headmost and weathermost ship in the fleet the last war but one i commanded a ship remarkably sharp and slight she was built at malta for a cruising ship from the timbers of their old galleys she measured above   0 tons was    feet keel and    feet beam she was built low with a shallow shelving bottom every way in chasing with this ship when little wind and a head sea we have steered right up to the chase when all their endeavors could not keep their ships head to the sea but lay broadside to the waves a small pressure of wind and sail would put this shell of a ship to her utmost speed and when the wind blew with a velocity of about thirty miles an hour i reckoned in sailing large we could make her go at the rate of about eleven miles an hour therefore we never desired more wind but rather less than that to give us all the advantages we wanted in cruising against our enemies so as to be able to take or leave as we pleased in tacking this ship when it blowed so fresh that we could just carry whole topsails we found our advantage in hawling up the mainsail and foresail to make her sure in staying otherwise she would get sternway so quickly as to prevent her coming about this bad property i attributed to the lightness of the ships body which could not bear so much sail aback without losing her headway and the long time she took to bring the wind ahead was probably occasioned by her length being out of proportion to her breadth for a ready and close turning ship this ship had another great defect viz want of her bows being fuller at and above the waters edge which would make little or no resistance in the water to hinder ships sailing in fine weather but is a great help to their sailing by keeping them from plunging so much into the sea in bad weather which was the case with this ship when pressed hard with sail upon a wind for in a great sea her bows being like a wedge she plunged herself under forward which not only hindered her sailing so fast as she would have done but occasioned her straining to such a degree at those times that we were obliged to add biling to pumping to keep the water from gaining upon us  this is mentioned to show that shape and proportion are of the greatest consequence in the structure of the hull of a ship with respect to her sailing as well as to her strength  advantages attending rounding bottoms what i contend for is that all ships whether full for burden or sharp for sailing should be built with the full parts of their bottoms to form an arch downward instead of having long straight floors as has been mentioned as it is well known when a round cannon ball is shot slanting into the water the reaction of the water makes it rise into the air several times before it immerses and sinks though it is about eight times heavier than its bulk of water which will naturally act with the same principles upon ships which have their bottoms somewhat circular all the way as they are forced forward through the water the entrance and forebody of the ship in the water have the passage to open by dividing and sinking the particles of water till they have passed the main frame or lowest flooring the reaction of the water upwards against this shaped bottom will naturally tend to lighten or lift the ship from plunging into the sea all the way that there is any resistance which i reckon ceases at the lowest main frame for there the water begins to rise and close again to come to its level which in my opinion must act upon the tapered after body and run if well formed so as to help the ship forward in her progressive motion and she will naturally act and turn upon this lowest part of the bottom because within this main or midship frame must be the center of the greatest cavity or hollow part of the ships hold and thereabout will be the center of gravity of the ship and all that she contains and will thereby become the center of motion and the waters pressure upwards being greatest against this lowest part of the bottom all will contribute naturally to make this the proper center for the ship to turn upon to make her more manageable in steering staying or wareing and this last is a very valuable property for it is most commonly wanted when ships are in the greatest danger and expeditiously performed may be the saving of the whole and this seems to be pointed out by natural judgment and what may be seen in the mechanism of nature and the curve of a ships bends and upper works so as i would have their bottoms to be dont offend but please the eye and all straight and flat parts about a ship disgust us the swiftest fish seen in motion at sea as well as those fowl which swim and dive in water are all formed with their bodies rounding as is above recommended  i had the advantages of the above recommendation farther confirmed by an accidental experiment made by a commander of a long and flat floord collier cat who is a man of veracity he related to me that loading his ship at liverpool with rock salt in order to prevent the ship from being too stiff and laboursome he had it stowed in as short a compass as possible in the middle or main body of the ship and left two great empty spaces one before and another abaft which occasioned the flat floor under the salt to bend downwards and so as to make the ship very leaky this as may be supposed opened the butts in that part the ship by accident came aground when he could sensibly feel her touch first under where the salt lay which was contrary to what he ever felt by her before and he solemnly declared that he never knew the ship to sail steer stay or ware so well before or since  there is another strong circumstance which i think is a certain sign that the rounding shaped bottom and projecting stem is wanted for ships in general the best trim as they are built now is found to be by the stern this cants the straight part of their long floors upwards which must make a longer resistance farther aft but then it acts in some measure as the rounding bottomed ship would do but to more advantage upon an even keel and the more upright a ships stem is the more she will require to be trimmed by the stern to make her stay as well as ware readily for the center of these turning motions will be where the center of gravity is that is about the main frame so that the more upright the stem is the more it will hinder the ship turning either way so readily and experience is the best guide in these matters i have enquired after the properties of a ship that was built with stem and sternpost both upright the report i had from the commander was that her performance came far short in sailing to what was expected from her bottom and that before they raised her abaft so that she stowed more goods there which brought her to sail two and a half feet by the stern she often refused either staying or wareing so readily as other ships in company would and now that they are obliged to sail so much by the stern they are much plagued to get the anchors up from under the keel or fore foot which may be of bad consequence where there is little room to get under way so that the projecting stem gives great ease in getting the anchors up readily as well as helps a ship greatly to rise and fall easy and prevents her from being pressed or plunged deep into the sea for these and many other good reasons the stem should keep projecting as high as the upper deck  thus i have endeavored to prove that to make vessels pass through the water with the least resistance and give them the best properties for managing them under sail they should have a projecting stem the bearing part of the bottom should form an arch downwards the lowest flooring at the main frame and what is called the floor should be with about the same sheer as the lower part of the bends and the sternpost so near upright that the back of the rudder may stand perpendicular to the keel rounding bottoms would take the gound with the least damage this form of a ships bottom in my opinion will also recommend itself to take the ground with the least damage for it is well known that a ship strains and receives damage less or more in proportion as she sits upright or lays along on one side and what makes a ship lie along so much upon level ground but the present practice of having a rank or deep keel under the main body of the ship which cants her over so far that the ends of the floorings or lower futtocks bear the stress upon the ground by which they are often broke and if the ship has a long straight floor it is liable to be bent upwards which causes the whole frame to strain the more by being thus unnaturally constructed  where ships are liable or are designed to take the ground as in dry tide harbors the rounding bottoms will certainly answer that purpose best as they may be built either full for carrying or sharp for sailing as occasion may require with little or no depth of keel under the main body so as not to make them lie a long but as they may sit quite upright upon level ground which will make the principal weight and stress tend toward the middle of the lowest flooring under the main or midship frame where the center of gravity of the whole will be accumulated and supported as upon the crown of an inverted arch which form must be allowed to be capable of bearing the most pressure with the least damage and to lay the greatest strain where it ought to be upon the middle or strongest part of the floor timbers  to answer the objections which may be made to the want of a deep keel in the midships on account of strength or sailing upon a wind or beating on the ground  st i say that making the kelson larger and its bent downward along with the ceiling and outside plank in this part will greatly make up above what may be thought a deficiency in strength  d to make the ship hold an equal wind it has been observed that what keel may be wanting under the midship frame is made up by what is added forward under the scarf of the stem and suppose a ships keel in common to be a foot deep all the way fore and aft and suppose the rounding bottomed ship to have but six inches keel under her midship frame and to have eighteen inches under the scarf of the stem this will make up that deficiency forward and abaft the run becomes so sharp and thin that the plank lies almost upright with the plain surface of the keel and sternpost and as to striking on the ground if the ground is nearly level ships commonly destroy the two ends of the keel before the midship is hurt and if they come to roll much upon their keels the rounding bottom will have the advantage in proportion as the keel is shallower a midships the stroke will be less and lower down under the main floorings where the ship by this form of construction is strongest and most able to bear repeated shocks  on hanging ships rudders ships are sometimes lost by having their rudders beaten off in striking upon the ground which may be prevented by a method of hanging rudders practiced at parkgate and which i think deserves particular notice and especially where the navigation is among shoals or where ships are liable to strike upon the ground this method permits the rudder to rise about  0 inches by having bands upon the rudder the same as are in common upon the sternpost with a long iron spindle to go through the eyes of all these bands and which permits the rudder to rise and fall as the ship happens to strike and from the good report of foreign ships as well as coasters that have tried this method i think it ought to become more general where the rudder head comes upon deck or where it can be contrived to let the rudder and tiller rise high enough for this purpose which will save the stress from the sternpost as well as the rudder from breaking and unshipping which is often the case from the present practice by having those short irons upon the rudder that are chockd and stopped to prevent the rudder unshipping  on hause holes the many disadvantages that i have seen to attend hause holes being too small makes me mention here that it is absolutely necessary that all hause holes should be made big enough at first to admit the ships cables when spliced with a short splice to go freely through them  on masts and yards i profess myself an advocate for tall masts and short yards from the example of ships in the coal and timber trades to the city of london and from the experience i have had in ships sailing faster upon a wind from shortning their yards which must ease them by making every thing lighter in proportion as the yards are shorter even the expense is less at first fitting out and to the ship and every thing aloft in wear and tear afterward and in sailing her with fewer hands  all masts which are to be made from crooked poles should be made and fitted to stand with the back aft that is with the projecting or crooked ends forward which will make them stand upright without that great stress upon the stays that has to act against all the other rigging to prevent the masts heads from raking too much aft which is most commonly the case  the method we now practice of having few blocks and little to phamper aloft for ease and neatness is certainly right and should be pursued as far as it can with safety but i would advise not to carry this fashion to an extreme by having too many sheave holes cut in the mast heads for i have known many top masts break in the place of the sheeve holes under the rigging  topgallantmast going up and down abaft the topmasts i have found from experience answers many good purposes in a cruising ship and a great advantage to a ship that has much to turn to windward as they may be struck and kept close struck occasionally with the whole topsails atrip  on ships sails the square sails suitable to taunt masts and short yards as here recommended will be in proportion deep and narrow which will trim and stand much fairer upon a wind than if they were shallow and broader and if the ships employ require it will admit of larger staysails such staysails as are now made with judgment not to hoist too high at the back of the square sails to shake the wind out of them but which permit all the sails to stand to great advantage clear of each other as may be seen in the front plate where the ship is represented in a light breeze sailing close by the wind  to endeavor to make a ship sail by the wind narrow deep square sails recommended and turn well to windward deserves the greatest regard because safety as well as many other great benefits depend upon it the good effects of deep and narrow squaresails cannot be better recommended to answer this purpose than by the performance of ships in the coal and timber trades to london though the designed properties in building and fitting these ships are burden at a small draft of water to take and bear the ground well and to sail with few hands and little ballast yet these ships perform so well at sea that the government often makes choice of them for store ships in the most distant naval expeditions and in narrow channels among shoals and turning to windward in narrow rivers there are no ships of equal burden can match them for which i attribute a great deal to their deep narrow squaresails which may be perceived to trim so flat and fair upon a wind that all the canvass stands full at a proper angle from the directions of the keel so that the wind goes freely off from the lee leach of these sails without being much altered in its direction from one sail to the back of the next which is not the case when a ships squaresails are so broad as to overlap each other much one sail then shakes the next to it and they extend so far to leeward that the lee sheets make the afterpart of the canvass or lee leaches stand rather as so much back sail to stop the ships way or only to press the ships side down and to leeward which is the effect of all the canvass in a ships sails when it does not stand at a proper angle with the direction of the keel when a ship is sailing close by the wind where a deal of canvass is wanted to sail fast large the narrow deep squaresails have in height what they want in breadth and all the flying sails including the topgallantsails as such being all of lighter canvass may be made as large as things will admit of to answer this purpose in little winds and when it comes to blow so strong that these flying sails cannot be carried then the standing squaresails will be found broad enough  i had the yards of a frigatebuilt ship shortened so much and the mainsail made in proportion so narrow that the maintack was hauled down through ironbound blocks which hooked to eyebolts within board fixed for that purpose and which made the sail to stand much better and work much easier than when at the chestree without board  foretacks to stand as far to windward as maintacks the foretacks of all ships should be made to stand by bumkins or at the catheads as far to windward as the maintacks by which i have experienced the foresails will stand as near or nearer the wind than the mainsail will when trimmed at the same angle for the same reasons a colliers foretopsail stands upon a wind without a bowline as the wind acts upon the head sails without being turned more aft from one sail to the other abaft it  the angles ships sails stand at upon a wind i have taken the angles that the principal sails stand at from the direction of the keel on board of a ship and sloop as they have been turning to windward with a pleasant breeze the ships mainsail and foresail with their topsails and topgallantsails above them trimmed and stood at three points of the compass which was at just half the angle the ship stemd from the direction of the wind which was at six points upon each tack but the crossjackyard at the same time required to be braced up to two points and the mizentopsailyard to a point and a half so that the plain or body of the mizentopsail stood at a point and three quarters or nineteen degrees the mizen stood at about a point and a half or seventeen degrees and the staysails between the masts stood at about the same angle seventeen degrees when drawing full and by the wind the sloop stemd at five points of the compass from the direction of the wind when her mainsail foresail and jib stood at about half that angle or two points and a half from the direction of the keel upon each tack  setting many sails in an easy manner in ships designed to carry many small sails in little winds i have had the experience of turning to windward with thirty effectual sails set in a simple easy manner and had them drawn when in real practice at sea and they were as is represented in the front plate besides two jibs foretopmaststaysail spritsail and spritsailtopsail which are known to stand very well upon a wind we had a forestaysail stood very well by our foremast standing well aft and the foretack well to windward as before recommended and by having two sheeves in each truck at our long topgallant mafts heads we hoisted the topgallant royals up to the trucks by the sheeves on one side and the main and mizen spindle staysails by the sheeves on the other side of the trucks at the main and mizen topgallant mafts heads we set a gaff topsail with a light yard slung by the thirds hoisted up through a block at the after part of the cap at the mizentopmasthead the tack hauled down on the weather side to the after corners of the mizen top and the sheet to the gaff end this sail was easier managed and stood to more advantage than when set with a cumbersome heavy gaff rigged at the mizentopmast head for that purpose we set a large driver with a light pole for a boom with two tail blocks at the small or outer end which we run out aft on either side and lashed it to the rail so that the blocks on the outer end stood right aft facing the middle of the stern upon either tack the driver slung by the third of the yard like a log sail hoisted within about four feet of the end of the mizen gaff which was about three feet longer than the mizen required it on account of this sail the tack hauled down to the weather quarter piece on either tack and the sheet to the block amidships with a bowline hauled to the mizen mast which made the sail stand fair upon a wind at an angle of about a point and a half or sixteen degrees from the direction of the keel we set a foretopmast studding sail for a water sail the yard slung by the third hauled out to the other tail block at the boom end with the straight leach or the sheet clew uppermost and made fast to the weather corner of the stern rail and the lower clew had two sheets or lines led into the aftermost gunport or scupper in the waist on each side so that in tacking when the wind was near ahead we shifted the forepart of these sails to the weather side which trimmed them ready for the other tack by which they prevented the ship from falling too much off and had good effect upon her sailing in a light breeze of wind but when it came to blow fresh the wind reflected from the mizen shook the driver so much that we took it in when sailing close by the wind and when we rigged in the boom it lay snug fore and aft on one side stopped to the rail and was much more out of the way than a cumbersome heavy yard which is often used for a driver boom and which lying across is inconvenient and holds wind when the ship is sailing close hauld and can only serve to set the ail to advantage when sailing with the wind quartering or before it  in sailing any thing from the wind to right before it on sailing lage with many sail we easily shifted our driver boom to different parts of the stern and by the heel ropes at the heaviest end within board trimmed it as the wind required so as to make the driver and water sail stand as fair and as far or farther out from the ship than could be done by a yard across for a boom as above mentioned we set topgallant studding sails without troublesome and cumbersome booms on the topsail yards by having thimbles fixed at the outer end of the topmast studding sail yards we kept the tacks reeved and both ends made fast to the inner yard arm so that they could be come at from the topsail yard arm to bend the tack and haul it out which spread the sails and made them stand very well and showed with the driver and water sail as in plate the  st where the ship is represented sailing with all sails set with the wind quartering but i must own we were obliged to stop the inner yard arm of the topmast studding sail with the outer gasket of the topsail yard arm when the sail was set abaft the topsail to prevent the outer yard arm from flying forward  it is said that we have ships that will bear and carry sail so as to get to windward or keep clear of a lee shore as long as canvass will stand in such a case safety must often depend upon the sails therefore the method of making them should have all the strength that can be given to prevent their splitting in times of danger  sails how strengthened in the making it would contribute greatly to make canvass stand a storm and wear much longer if the sails were made with robbin gromet and point holes in the middle of every seam and about half an inch lower down in the sail than those holes that are found necessary to be between the seams and which fall in the single part of the canvass by this method the greatest strain will be upon the seams which are the strongest parts of a sail and will bear a greater stress than they will by the present practice of making all the above holes in the single part of the canvass clear of the seams which is done to avoid as i suppose cutting and sewing through so many fold of canvass for there is now made about the same quantity of holes as i would wish to recommend here that is a hole in each seam and one midway between which is enough for any sail and for the sail that reefs by the foot a point hole in each seam is found sufficient  i have tried to manage the sails in a cruizing vessel and in codsmacks a fishing with robbins and points in the seamed parts of the sails only in order to reef and unreef them with more expedition and lay the more stress where the principal strength of the sails lay but found from experience that it requires robbins and points in the middle part of each cloth to confine the sails cleverly to the yards and gaffs therefore the holes that are made in the single part of the canvass ought to be a little higher up in the sail that the principal stress may be upon the seams which i reckon is about three times as strong as the single part of the canvass when the sail is seam pricked as all the foul weather sails ought to be in a zigzag or serpentine manner as soon as they are stretched a little by wear so that if the sails are not confined to the yard stays and gaffs more by the seamd part of the sail than by the single canvass the weight of the seams will contribute to split and wear out the single canvass much sooner especially when the sails flap hard in gales of wind or when obliged to carry sail in little wind with a great rolling sea  instead of cutting these holes through so many folds of canvass at random with a knife i take the liberty to recommend to have a round hollow tool or gouge with a mallet and a block upon the knees for the purpose of cutting the holes more regular  on rigging and ropes we should avoid all unnecessary rigging as well as blocks for every thing that the wind blows upon about a ship that dont stand in the plane of direction with the sails is a hindrance to the ships sailing upon a wind therefore the running rigging should not go double where single will answer the purpose those stays to the long topgallantmasts heads and the close network with bobs which i have seen hanging under the fore part of ships tops are useless tophamper and crowfeet there in my opinion do more harm than good  where the jibboom is to go through anupright cap at the bowsprit end which is certainly the best way the end of the bowsprit through the cap should be left long enough for the collar of the foretopmaststay to lie under it and spread on each side of the cap which answers good purposes in keeping the stay so much farther forward it stays the mast better and a larger foretopmaststaysail may be set to advantage and lets the jibboom go freely out and in as occasion may require  i have experienced the advantage of having the topsail yards as well as the lower yards rigged to hoist with a double block with two straps upon the yard to make the sheaves stand fore and aft and a double block with a long double strap before the crosstrees with a leading block at the mast head to go as geers instead of ties which are constantly chassing in the tie block upon the yards by the sheave standing athwart the same way with the rolling motion of the ship which makes the ties so often break but by the above method as geers the sheaves of the blocks standing fore and aft prevent the chaffing by the ships rolling motion  i am surprised to see continued in some ships the old practice of having the mizentopsail braces and bowlines go across when they do as well on the same side and gives a clear opening to set a large mizentopmast staysail to great advantage  i would advise to have all ropes above six inches round to be cable or double laid ropes above six inches to be cable laid that is with nine strands instead of three with the same number of yarns for reason as well as experience teaches us that all single or shroud laid ropes with three strands only and above six inches round the outside yarns in each strand are strained in making the rope hard enough by being wormd or twisted round at so great a distance from the center that the yarns about the middle of the strands are by that means made to be slack so that before they come to bear a strain the outside yarns must be broke that this is a fact may be perceived when opening a strand of a large shroudlaid rope one sees there the inside yarns are drawn up slack when the outside yarns are worn out and broke for which reason i would recommend the standing rigging above six inches to be cable laid with the same quantity of yarns which will be stronger than the shroudlaid rope in proportion as all the yarns lie in a straighter direction with the length of the rope consequently they all bear more equally a part of the strain  i have tried the strength of a number of threads together made fast to a scale beam first laid in a straight direction without any twist like to a solvigee second the same number moderately twisted third an equal quantity twisted more and found from repeated experiments that those with the moderate twist bore the greatest weight before they broke and that a number of threads joined together will not bear a proportional weight to one of them singly that is ten threads comes a great way short of bearing ten times the weight that one thread bore singly and i reckon the case is the same with a rope and one of its yarns  on stowing and trimming a ship a ship sailing steering staying and waring and being lively and comparitively easy at sea in a storm in my opinion depends greatly on the cargo ballast or other materials being properly stowed according to their weight and bulk and the proportional dimentions of the built of the ship which may be made too crank or too stiff to pass through the ocean with safety which makes this branch of knowledge of such consequence that rules for it ought to be endeavored after if but to prevent as much as possible the danger of a ship oversetting at sea or being so laboursome as to roll away her masts etc by being improperly stowed which is often the case  but this subject requires and deserves encouragement for the labor of some of our greatest mathematicians to account from fixed principles and give reasons why ships or the same ship may be thus differently effected by stowage so as to instruct seamen in this most important point of duty because success as well as safety may greatly depend upon it for it is known that our government has had two ships of war built by the same mold fitted out in the same manner and with the same materials as near as possible yet one ship answered much better than the other this can only proceed from different management which induces me sailorlike not to halt before i find myself quite lamed but to push forward at all hazard to endeavor to explain what i know from experience and observation which i hope will be found of some service if it but induces others more capable to consider and treat on this most important subject with that attention and to that extent it deserves  when a ship is new it is prudent to consult the builder who may be supposed acquainted with the ship of his own planning and most likely to judge what her properties will be to advise how the cargo or materials according to the nature of them ought to be disposed of to advantage so as to put her in the best sailing trim but i would recommend trials at every favorable opportunity afterward to find out or to confirm which is the best trim of a ship for sailing as experience is the only guide  i was in a fine ship which did not sail to expectation experience the only method for finding ships best sailing trim and the fault was always laid on her not being stowed to swim at her proposed trim which was so much by the stern that a full part coming into the water aft near her loading mark prevented her stowing the cargo so as to bring her to that designed trim but when the experiment came to be tried to swim her more upon an even keel so as to keep the too full part more out of the water the ship then sailed much better i have been cruizing in concert with a ship that we outsailed every way but by their taking their anchors from her bows and stowing them abaft the bitts gave her the advantage in outsailing us after that both by the wind and large  what sort of ships may require different management in stowing ships must differ in their form and proportional dimentions to make them answer their different purposes they will require different management in the stowage which ought not to be left to mere chance or done at random as goods or materials happen to come to hand which is too often the cause that such improper stowage makes ships unfit for sea therefore the stowage should be considered planned and contrived according to the built and properties of the ship and which if they are not known should be enquired after if she is narrow and highbuilt in proportion so that she will not shift herself without a great weight in the hold it is a certain sign that this ship will require a great part of heavy goods ballast or materials laid low in the hold to make her stiff enough to bear sufficient sail without being in danger of oversetting but a ship that is built broad and low in proportion so that she is stiff and will support herself without any weight in the hold this ship will require heavy goods ballast or materials stowed higher up to prevent her from being too stiff and laboursome at sea so as to endanger her masts being rolled away and the hull worked loose and made leaky  the bad consequence attending ships too crank or too stiff i speak from experience having been in ships of both extremes some too crank and others too stiff and i have been in company with a ship so stowed as to be so crank as proved fatal to her and crew which last is the most dangerous of the two extremes  the bad consequence of a ship being too stiff i experienced in one of the governments old twenty gun ships which was bought and fitted out with lighter guns and materials than she formerly carried and was loaded with a general cargo of different goods for the west indies she was but about fourteen days at sea when down came our main yard occasioned by the new main tie being chafed to pieces in the middle of the rope or inside of the strands by one strand rubbing against the other from the ships extraordinary quick rolling motion and which soon wore out the other rigging and also worked loose the hull in proportion with quite a full ship from jamaica we have rolled away a new set of main lanyards in one night though we used in the stowing her all possible means that the goods of the different cargoes we carried would admit of so as to lay the heaviest part as high in the middle of the ship as we could to overcome this bad property notwithstanding which when in company with other ships in fine weather sailing before the wind with a long following swell of a sea they all carried their topgallantsails and studding sails without any inconveniency or danger when we were obliged to take in our studdingsails topgallantsails etc and lower the topsails half mast to save the topmasts from being rolled away we loaded a cargo of lead and leather etc for leghorn and stowed the lead upon a great height of leather which we screwed down with boards upon it to support the lead at a proper height to keep the ship tolerable easy in the sea which answered our design the first part of the passage very well but the ship working by the motion of the sea occasioned the lead by its weight to press the leather a great deal lower in the latter part of the passage by which she became so laboursome as to roll away two topmasts in spite of our best endeavors this experience convinced me that this ship was too broad and her decks say too low in proportion for a merchant ship for carrying general cargoes to the best advantage but she was more fit for what she was first designed viz to carry heavy guns and heavy materials above water which could counterpoise and make her more easy in great seas  but there are good properties mixed with bad ones in ships of all constructions the above mentioned ship was so stiff without ballast that we have laid in an open road with the topmasts an end and guns upon deck with a clean swept hold ready for her cargo and we had the advantage of carrying a pressing sail with an upright side upon a wind our principal care was to look up at the mast to see how much they bent to prevent their being carried away when the crank ships side would be pressed down and make her go heeling much along at the same time but when two ships of these different properties meet with turbulent dangerous high waves then the extraordinary stiff ship will be so laboursome by a quick jerking deep rolling motion as not only to endanger the loss of the sails rigging and masts but the hull may be worked loose and made leaky by the same violent rolling motion when the crank ship in company at the same time may be comparitively easy in rising and falling with the waves without that destructive rolling motion for when she is turned upon one side by the force of the wind or waves her recovery is so slow that a danger is apprehended of her not rising upright again which slow motion is the cause that she receives little or no damage when the stiff ship may be greatly distressed  the medium of being neither too stiff nor too crank to be endeavored after this shows there must be a medium for the best proportioned breadth of a ship according to her designed business and which should be endeavored after that she may be stowed neither too crank nor too stiff and which is such as to admit the ship to yield or heel to her sails when the masts are in danger of being carried away by being overpressed for that ship is sufficiently stiff for any purpose that will bear to carry away her masts before she will overset if this trim could be hit upon by any rules for the construction and stowing of a ship it would be of great advantage to make them pass through the ocean with more case and consequently less damage for the overstiff ship when presd hard with sail strains every thing imperceptably to a dangerous degree and to guard against her masts being carried away obliges to keep a constant looking up to see how much they bend which cannot be so much attended to as when the ship heels in proportion as she is overpressd which gives the surest warning to take in sail in proper time  the weightiest part of the cargo or materials ought to lie in the main body of the ship in order to help a ships sailing and to be lively and easy in her pitching and sending motions it should be contrived by the stowage that the principal and weightiest part of the cargo or materials should lie as near the main body of the ship and as far from the extreme ends fore and aft as things will admit of for it should be considered that the roomy part of our ships lengthways form a sweep or curve near four times as long as they are broad therefore those roomy parts at and above the waters edge which are made by a full harpen and a broad transome to support the ship steady and keep her from plunging into the sea and also by the entrance and run of the ship having little or no bearing body under for the pressure of the water to support them therefore should not be stowed with heavy goods or materials but all the necessary vacancies broken stowage or light goods should be at these extreme ends fore and aft and in proportion as they are kept lighter by the stowage the ship will be more lively to fall and rise easy in great seas and will contribute greatly to her working and sailing and to preserve her from straining and hoging for which reason i think it a wrong practice to leave such a large vacancy in the main hatchway as is usual to coil and work the cables which ought to be in the fore or after hatchway that the principal weight may be more easily stowed in the main body of the ship above the flattest and lowest floorings where the pressure of the water acts the more to support it as mentioned page the  th on the pressure of water  on the center of gravity motion and cavity of a ship these are fundamental points which are certainly in a ship and her trim as last mentioned depends upon their places but so little are they understood as i have been told that a great sea officer was heard to say when his ship was laboring hard in a rough sea how should she but roll when she had so much tophamper which was ascribing the effect to a wrong cause and what will be often the case till the fundamental principles are known i am therefore emboldened to endeavor to communicate what i have learned of these difficult points hoping an abler pen will some time undertake to mend and make up my defects in the knowledge of these points that they may become useful to seamanship  the center of cavity of a ship on the center of cavity is a point in the middle of the hold or hollow buoyant part of the hull which supports her loading and her materials but it is in reality the cavity or the center of the bearing part of the ships body that is immersed in the water that acts to support her in all the different situations and motions a ship is subject to which occasions this center of the cavity immersed to be always shifting its place as the different parts of the ships hull happen to be in the water it moves from being about the midship when the ship swims upright and upon an even keel to forward or aft as the ship is trimmed more by the head or stern and from one side to the other in proportion as the ship is made to heel  the center of gravity of a ship is a point some where in her and center of gravity where the weight of the whole ship cargo and materials in and about her is brought to a point when the ship swims upright and upon an even keel it is some where in a line of direction from the stem to the sternpost and where another line would cross it about the midship frame from one side to the other where if the ship could be suspended in air she would lie in any position she was put into  but the center of gravity of a ship is always liable to alter its place higher or lower more forward or aft on one side or the other according to the stress or weight that happens to be laid upon the different parts of the ship or her materials not only by the management of the stowage but by the power and pressure of the waves and wind  why a ship oversets and what supports her from over setting the center of gravity of a ship as in other heavy bodies has always a tendency to descend toward the center of our globe whether the ship is on shore or afloat if it is not prevented from falling by a base or bottom that spreads without this point to support it for whenever it happens that a ship is laid on shore and heels so much that the center of gravity overhangs that part of the ships bilge upon the ground that ought to support it the ship will be sure to tumble over if not prevented by some means and when a ship is afloat if ever she heels so much that the center of gravity goes farther over to one side than the center of cavity or the middle of the bearing part of the ships body then immersed in the water the ship will overset but whilst the center of cavity immersed goes faster and farther over to the ships side in her motions so as to keep without the perpendicular of the center of gravity the ship will be supported from oversetting and the water will act upon the center of cavity immersed in proportion to its distance without the center of gravity with more or less power to bring the ship upright again as soon as the force of the wind or waves ceases or the power or weight is taken off or shifted that occasioned the ship to heel or turn on one side  on the center of motion the center of motion of a ship depends upon the places of the center of cavity and gravity as last mentioned and as they alter the center of motion shifts its place but in ships as in other heavy bodies in motion this point always endeavors to be at the same place with the center of gravity and it is really so when the center of gravity is above the surface of the water and the ship is afloat but when the center of gravity is below the surface of the water and the water smooth then the center of motion is at the waters edge which i found by experiments that i made with models of ships about three feet long in a trough of water  experiments on models of ships to find out their center of motion i first tried a model that was made exact from a draft well designed for a fast sailing ship with a rounding bottom as has been recommended it was quite light and had only a mainmast in to heel her by she swam upright and drew three inches water aft and two forward i then stuck pins in at the waters edge in the middle of the stem and sternpost then heeld her gunnels in by the mainmast head which caused the pins in the stem and sternpost to rise out of the water and form a sweep upwards that made it evident the center of motion was higher up then i tried where her center of gravity was by suspending her in air between two pointed irons in the middle of the stem and sternpost and found it about an inch and a half above the pins at the waters edge and found the points of suspension on each side about the same height above water a midships i stuck pins in these four points pointing to the center of gravity in the hold i found by repeated trials that these upper pins or points were the axis or the center of motion that she turned upon when making her heel and roll those upper pins in the stem and sternpost had little or no motion whilst those pins at the waters edge rose out of the water as she moved from side to side and when she was made to pitch and soond by pressing her down fore and aft those pins on each side amidships seemed to have little or no motion whilst i confined them as steady as possible to a point  i loaded the same model with lead till she drew four inches and a quarter fore and aft there stuck in pins at the waters edge in the stem and sternpost and found the center of gravity two inches and a quarter below these pins then heeling her in the water gunnel in each way as before found the pins in the stem and sternpost to continue at the surface of the water i raised the lead higher up in the hold till i found the center of gravity at the waters edge then heeling her in the water as before found the center of motion at the same place i raised the lead still higher till the center of gravity was about half an inch above the pins at the waters edge then the model would just hear herself from oversetting in this trial the center of motion was at the same place with the center of gravity about half an inch above the surface of the water  i tried a model of a high full built ship that was rigged and had guns upon deck so that she would but just support herself from oversetting she drew five inches water forward and six inches and a half aft stuck pins in the middle of the stem and sternpost at the waters edge as before and found the center of gravity fore and aft an inch and a half above these pins at the waters edge there put in pins and tried by heeling her in water as above and found these upper pins the center of motion or axis that she turned upon which will always be the case when the center of gravity is above the surface of the water an instance of a ship launched agreed with and confirmed the above experiments  a merchant ship built with a high and ornamented top the center of motion shown by the launching of a ship upon a narrow thin bottom having her lower masts in and rigged when she was launched and as is common at such times had a great many people upon deck all these raised the center of gravity so high and the center of cavity immersed lay so low in her sharp bottom when she came into the water that it would not support her upright but she sallied and laid down on one side with the black struck above the bends amidships in the water this frightened the people upon deck and all getting upon the upper side she then sallied or rolled over as low the other way and the people as before shifted themselves to the contrary side which made her keep constantly thus sallying whilst they towed her with boats about half a mile and got her to a side where the people gladly got out of her  she was launched without her rudder and i had the opportunity of being near her and observed a boat under her stern that was held by a man with the boats stem close to a rudderband about three feet above the waters edge which rudderband i perceived to have little or no motion but was the axis of the center of gravity and motion that she turned upon while she was thus sallying or rolling with her upper works in the water which i reckoned was as high above water as the keel was under water amidships when the ship was upright  causes are best discovered by their effect from experience and observation we must find out true principles this ships sharp bottom in the water when she was upright made too small a base and the center of cavity lay too low to support her upright with the center of gravity lying so high above water that it made her sally or lie down on one side till that brought a broader base into the water and the center of cavity then immersed higher up and farther over and without the center of gravity so that the center of cavity then became as a prop to support the ship from going lower as she sallied each way and in this case the center of cavity was the center of motion that she turned upon when her side was laid down for all the weight and power that was without the center of cavity acted as a lever the same as when ships are hove down keel out that lifted the center of gravity a little as she sallied which soon preponderated again the center of gravity and motion are at the same place in great seas and a ships behavior depends upon that place and the people always moving over to the upper side accounts for this ships sallying  this ships behavior and the above experiments in my opinion make it evident that the center of motion of a ship is at the center of gravity and according to the built of the ship and her center of gravity being higher up or lower down the different properties or behavior of ships may be accounted for from the construction of the above ship when loaded with refined salt that just filled her the center of gravity being then a great height the report of her performance at sea was that she answered very well and was remarkably easy in her rolling motion in great seas though the spectators at her launching expressed themselves that they would be loath to go in her to sea on account of her rolling  its a known property of all heavy bodies heavy bodies turn in swift motion upon their center of gravity and bring their heaviest end foremost forced into quick motion through air or water that they turn upon their center of gravity as their center of motion i have seen a bomb shell turn round in the air by the center of gravity being near the middle and where the center of gravity lies near one end that heaviest end will go foremost in all directions upwards as well as downwards as may be seen in kyrockets and arrows shot from bows an arrow shot with the light end upwards immediately turns upon its center of gravity for its center of motion the same causes produce the same effects upon ships when by high mountainous waves they are tossed up and down with a violent quick motion  it must be allowed that there is a point in a ship which may be called the center of motion and which she turns upon consequently it has less motion than any other part of the ship when rolling pitching scending or in any other motion a ship is subject to in great seas when its place is then at the center of gravity which lying higher or lower according to the built of the ship contributes to make her comparitively easy or uneasy in high waves  suppose a well proportioned ship for carrying cargoes in general reasons why a well proportioned ship may be easy or uneasy could be when loaded so that the center of gravity and motion were even with the surface of the water this would make her remarkably easy in her rolling in great seas and again to suppose the same ship without dunnage to be loaded with lead which is eleven times heavier than its bulk of water in a smooth sea this might seem a benefit by making her extraordinary stiff upon a wind and what little she was made to heel to her sail would turn upon the center of motion at the waters edge but if she should meet with great seas so that she must rise and fall in proportion to the height and quickness of the waves that would give liberty for the center of motion to act with its natural tendency to the center of gravity which by this slowage would be laid so low that the ship would roll away her masts and be in danger of foundering by working her hull to pieces  for a further confirmation of the above opinion the properties of a collier cat laden with timber i examined into the properties of a collier cat of about five hundred tons burden that carried her loading of riga timber without any ballast in the hold and had about a ninth part of her cargo upon deck and on the quarters and was sufficiently stiff and remarkably easy in her rolling in great seas comparative to what she was when laden with newcastle coal though she carried herself full of them yet she was then remarkably laboursome in her rolling and this difference may be accounted for from the above principles for when this ship was loaded with riga timber which is lighter than its bulk of water it was computed that about a third part of her cargo lay above the waters edge at her loaded mark which would bring the center of gravity and motion as high as the surface of the water when she drew about sixteen feet amidships from thence to the upper part of the rigging at the maintopgallantmast head measured one hundred and eight feet which is somewhat less than seven eight parts of the whole above water and above the center of motion and is more than an eighth part under water and below the center of motion and what made her sufficiently stiff was her extraordinary breadth and the tight free board or upper works above the loaded mark that supported the center of gravity so high and that occasioned her to be so remarkable easy in her rolling as the water and waves acted at the least distance and with the least power possible above the center of motion on that small part of her hull above her load mark to move and give any degree of violent rolling motion to so large a part of her body that was under water and below the center of gravity and motion for what her keel was made to move side ways her topgallantmast head had a little less than seven times more to move in the same time the difference of being loaded with timber and coal therefore her rolling motion must be much less and easier in great seas than it would be if she was loaded with coal which is heavier than its bulk of water and would make the center of gravity and motion lie so much lower down in the hold suppose four feet below her load mark when she drew sixteen feet water in this case the water is perpetually acting with an additional power on that four feet of the cavity of the ships hull that is immersed above the center of gravity to support the ship and make her so much stiffer to carry more sail upon a wind with an upright side in smooth water as before mentioned and the same cause will make her more laboursome in great seas when she comes to be lifted up with a swift motion from the bottom to the top of a high steep mountainous wave that may break in upon deck at the same time as represented plate the  th on ships lying too the ascending side of the waves in this case acts with an additional power to turn the ship bodily more on her leeside in proportion as the center of gravity and motion lie lower than when she was loaded with timber and at the same time like other heavy bodies in motion upwards she has a greater tendency to turn her bottom more up as the center of gravity lies lower as mentioned page the   d and in proportion as these combined causes have turned the ships weather side up at the top of the wave which then leaves the weather side with more of the bottom lower down without water to support it which must naturally fall on the descending side of the wave which now acts on the lee side of the ship to turn and plunge the weather side into the hollow of the next wave which will act as before to give the ship more violent rolling motions according to her breadth and the height the waves have to act upon the ships hull above the center of gravity and motion which now lies a little less than a tenth part from the keel to the top gallantmast head so that for every foot her keel is made to move by the above powers side ways the mast head has nine feet to move in the same time instead of seven with a slower motion which was the case when she was loaded with timber which i hope will be understood to account for the difference why she is more laboursome when loaded with coals than with timber the consequence of loading lead without dunnage and to suppose this ship was to be laden to the same draft of water without any dunnage in the bottom with lead which is eleven times heavier than its bulk of water which might bring the center of gravity and motion eight feet below the waters edge and within eight feet of the lower part of the keel which is little less than a fifteenth part from the keel to the topgallantmasthead in such a trim its well known from experience that in a storm the above mentioned causes would act with so much more power to give her more quick violent rolling motion and for every foot her keel was made to move sideways the mast head would have to move fourteen feet in the same time which would be sure to make her roll away her masts in the first place and after that become so much more laboursome for want of them so as to be in great danger of foundering by working loose the hull  i hope what has been said on this important subject makes the principles understood how ships act and how they are acted upon by those natural causes above mentioned and the necessity there is to try every expedient that may prevent the loss and damage that is done by ships being too crank or too stiff for i am convinced from experience and observation that it is not the shape of the ships bottom that makes her easy or uneasy in her rolling motion which is a common notion but it is the center of gravity lying higher or lower according to the breadth and height of the vessel the water acts with more or less power that makes narrow built ships fittest to carry heavy cargoes with the least expense of dunnage and for light bulky cargoes broad ships will answer best as the above mentioned ship was much easier in her rolling motion when loaded with timber than with coals which was a certain sign that her deck lay too low for her breadth to carry that cargo with ease in great seas and by account she was stiff enough quite light to bear sail to go any where and only took in ballast to make her sail better by the wind so that its evident that this ship as well as all others experiments recommended to find out ships best trim by their different degrees of stiffness have their safest easiest and best trim and that depends upon their different degrees of stiffness which in my opinion might be found out by making nice observations how much the ship is made to heel when hoisting the longboat in and out o in the tackles along side clear of the water which is supposed to be smooth and the ship quite upright when the experiment is  and the remarks how much the ship is made to heel may be read by various ways as by water upon deck standing in p places or running over from one side of the deck to the other by making marks at the waters edge without board by measuring the different heights of the gunnels in the broadest part from the waters edge by a plumbline in the highest vacancy within board from any fixed thing above and down into a vacant hatchway or from the middle of the after part of the companion to the cabin deck or bulk head of the cabin or from the middle of the fore or after part of the mizentop upon deck etc and to set down the remarks in the log book with the draft of water and the ships behavior at sea each time the experiment is tried which in time by taking pains might become of great service and in the above mentioned ship by this practice would be found a very sensible difference by her heeling more when laden with timber than with coal as above mentioned in case she was to load lead or iron a judgment might be formed by this experiment how the stowage would answer so that in this or any other ship where there had been sufficient experience by this practice the stowage might be altered as occasion might require before she went to sea where ships are too stiff or too big for the longboat to be heavy enough for this purpose the longboat might be filled with water to a certain height each time and in ships of war might be added to the weight of the long boat a certain number of guns by being run out on one side close over to the other and they might alter her trim as experience might require by stowing the iron or heavy ballast higher or lower in the main body of the ship  on getting a ship under way it is supposed that the ship is now stowed and trimmed to the best advantage and that every thing is ready for sea to sail with the stood tide recommended if it is in a tide way it should be a rule when the wind serves to get under way and sail against the flood which gives time to get in the moorings or the anchor up and stowed away at pleasure and the ship may be steered without danger in little room through a crowd of ships should any be in the way or through narrow or shoal channels with a flowing tide by which means many risks may be avoided  to prevent the difficulty that often happens in getting the anchor to heave apek with the first of a windwad tide recommended when it blows fresh with a windward tide when the tide first sets or makes right to windward you should heave in the cable as it slacks till the anchor is apeek before the ship swings end on the tide to bring the wind aft that may keep the ship ahead of the anchor with the cable so tight under the bows and bottom that it cannot be hove in without breaking the ships sheer by putting the helm hard over first one way then the other this slacks the cable so that it may be hove in briskly for the time the ship sheers broad side to the tide from one side of the anchor to the other but the ship is liable to get so much head way in the time of sheering that makes her bring up with so powerful and sudden a erk that i have had the experience of breaking the cable by this practice in the downs which obliged us to stay there with a fair and to get our anchor again  on getting under way with a lee tide if you are under a necessity of getting under way with the wind and tide in the same direction to consult the officers on necessity occasions  md and ships or oals lie near right astern dangerously in the way you are to go in such a situation or any other that happens to be dangerous i would recommend where time will admit of it to d every capable officer to look about with attention where the danger lies to consider and consult what is best to be done and what can be expected for the ship to do on the occasion and especially if there be but little wind suppose it to blow at the rate of six miles an hour which at an anchor will seem a commanding breeze but it should be considered that if the tide runs at three miles an hour when the ship is under way she will lose onehalf of the winds power that may hinder her from performing what may be expected from the most dexterous management the method of proceeding to be made known and after the opinions are heard the intended method of proceeding should be made known that none through ignorance may hinder but that all may know how to help to put the design in practice whether the ship is to be shot ahead or backed astern of the danger this might contribute greatly to prevent loss or damage that is often done by weighing the anchor and proceeding without thought of the difficulties that often attend getting a ship safely under way in narrow or crowded places and making a stern board is frequently necessary and the best management depends so much on the right ordering of the helm the effects of which on these occasions i shall endeavor to explain  on the helm what we call the helm is the tiller that turns the rudder on either side of the after part of the keel and sternpost for the water to act upon as the management of the ship may require and as ships differ in breadth abaft so should the tiller in its length that is the tiller should be just long enough to reach close over to each side when the rudder stands at an angle of    degrees or bears three points of the compass from the direction of the keel which is generally allowed to answer best for to make the rudder go more over is found from experience to increase the resistance of the ships way which lessens the power of the rudder to steer and manage the ship in proportion as she loses her way through the water fault of the helm going too much over yet in boats and larger vessels where the rudder and tiller admit of it i have seen people so stupid as to put the helm in tacking almost right athwart the stern which tends more to stop the vessels way than to bring her head round against the wind and waves from one tack to the other this shows how necessary it is as far as possible to have things fixed by the best rules to prevent such bad practice  to confirm that the angle of    degrees is sufficient with a bevil i tried the rudders of many ships some built sharp for sailing others full for carrying dutch as well as english and found some fault of the helm not going enough over though very few of their rudders that stood at so large an angle as    degrees but most at about  0 degrees and several at but about    degrees or two points and a half which is certainly a fault to loose any of the rudders outmost power because it is often wanted on the most important occasions when safety may depend upon it  moving the helm can have no effect to manage a ship but when she passes through the water or the water passes by her in a tide or currents way then the water gives equal power to the helm as if the ship went at that rate through the water  when the helm is a midships the rudder can have no effect to turn the ship either way as it then stands in the same direction with the keel and sternpost but suppose the helm put to starboard the effect of the water upon the rudder it turns the rudder toward the larboard side of the ship which makes the larboard side of the rudder to resist the water which acts with a power according to its velocity or the ships head way through the water against the larboard side of the rudder to turn the ships stern to starboard and consequently her head to port and the center of this turning motion is allowed to be at the ships center of gravity as mentioned page the   th it may easily be perceived that when the helm is put hard a port how it acts from the same causes to turn the ships head to starboard as may be seen by looking at plate the  th where the plane of a ship in three different situations is represented with the helm hard aport which makes it evident that when the ship has headway the water must act against the starboard side of the rudder in a direction so as to turn the ships stern to port or toward that side the helm or tiller is put upon and her head to starboard from that side that the helm lies as abovementioned  on the helm when a ship has sternway this deserves particular notice because the most masterly management depends upon it on very important occasions as will appear hereafter  when a ship gets sternway through the water the helm has just the contrary effect upon the ship to what it has when she has headway as may be perceived by the abovementioned figures plate the  th with the helm hard a port when the ship gets sternway the larboard side of the rudder the effect of the rudder when sternway in that direction is the first part of the ship that the water acts against and it causes such a resisttance as to have a powerful and ready effect to turn the ships stern to starboard from that side the tiller lies and her head to port that is always toward that side the tiller is put upon whether to starboard or port which should be strictly attended to on all occasions when a ship is about getting or has got sternway through the water  suppose a ship at a single anchor situated as mentioned page the   th the wind and tide being both in the same direction and ships or shoals lying near right a stern in the way you must go and that to keep clear of them it requires to cast the ship upon the larboard tack and make a sternboard in all these proceedings i speak of a three mast ship and the main braces leading aft  to cast a ship upon the larboard tack and back her astern of danger as above mentioned in trading ships it requires all hands to heave up the anchor therefore all the necessary sails should be made as ready as possible the three topsails hoisted and the yard braced sharp up with the larboard braces and the mizen hauld out before weighing  in this situation you have only to attend the helm and put it aport when the anchor weighs the tide running aft acts against starboard side of the rudder and in that direction will cast the ship the right way and bring the wind upon the larboard bow which may be kept so at pleasure by the helm till the ship begins to get sternway through the water which should be strictly noticed to put the helm hard aport or a weather which puts the plane of the sp in a position as represented plate the  th figure the  d and suppose the wind on the larboard bow with the topsails aback which will soon give the ship sternway through the water which will act against the larboard side of the rudder in that direction and will have great power to prevent the ship from falling too fast off from the wind and by the anchor under the bow while it is heaving up and the foretopsail kept shivering she will drive as the ship is represented plate the  d figure the  d by which means it may be supposed that she has drove past and kept clear of the danger or of the ship figure the  th and has got the anchor up and room to ware and get before the wind as is represented figure the  st in the same plate  thus making astern board the  ng a sternboard gives an advantage in getting under way as above from a single anchor as the anchor heaven up easier when the ship goes astern and at the same time it is heaving up it helps to keep the ships head to the wind which will continue the stern way the longer but notwithstanding all these helps its well known from experience that a ship cannot be steered long stern foremost under sail so as to keep the wind before the beam but she will keep falling off so long as the sternway continues until she brings the wind abaft the beam and then the sternway the power of the weather helm and her falling off will all cease at the same time and the ship will drive broad side through the water for a little time as is represented figure the  d plate the  d till she gets headway which is a proper time to ware as above mentioned if the anchor is close up but where there is little room to ware i would advise not to attempt it if it can be avoided till the anchor is hove quite up for many ships have been run on shore in attempting to ware by stress of head sail whilst the anchor is heaving up  but let us suppose that from the above situation instead of backing astern to clear a danger it requires the ship to be shot ahead and that there is but just room enough close by the wind to clear a danger that lies in the way to leeward  to cast a ship upon the larboard tack and shoot her by the wind ahead of danger suppose the ship figure the  d plate  th could not be got under way with safety without shooting ahead of the ship figure the  st  to proceed with safety from such a situation much depends on the anchor being hove briskly up after it is out of the ground and having proper sails ready to set to the best advantage the three topsails must be hoisted and the yards sharp braced up with the larboard braces forward and the starboard braces aft when the anchor is at a long peek so that at weighing the anchor you may have only the helm to attend putting it hard aport the tide will act upon the rudder and the foretopsail being braced sharp up with the larboard braces will readily cast or box the ship off the right way so as to fill the after sails when the foretopsail may soon be braced about and filled before she gets sternway and the helm may keep the ship under command to steer her by the wind ahead clear of the danger but if the ship gets sternway in casting the helm should be kept hard a weather to prevent her from falling too much off in case of getting sternway from the wind and when she gets headway again you should be very cautious how you ease the weather helm with the anchor much below the bows which increases the resistance forward and may bring the ship up in the wind so as to prevent her shooting clear of the danger which should be guarded against by the weather helm and head sails as gibb and foretopmast stay sail etc as soon as the ship is shot far enough ahead to clear the danger to leward and there is but little room ahead its certainly best to bring the ship too and drive with the helm ale with the main and mizen topsails aback and the foretopsail shivering as represented in plate the  d figure the second till the anchor is up then take proper time to ware as before recommended  suppose a ship riding in smooth water in the stream of a tide with the wind two points on the starboard how and so near the shore on the larboard side that she must be cast upon the larboard rack to clear the shore  to cast a ship on the larboard tack when riding in a tide with the wind two points on the starboard bow this i have done from the above situation by the common method of proceeding as mentioned in the last case having the three topsails hoisted and the yards sharp braced up with the starboard braces aft and the larboard braces forward with the starboard for opbowling well hauld and at the anchors weighing putting the helm hard a port the tide acting upon the rudder and the wind upon the falls braced in that direction brought the ship about with the wind on the larboard bow before she got sternway which should be always strictly noticed for in all proceedings of this kind if a ship gets sternway before she brings the wind right ahead you may be shue that she will not come about the right way in that case it must be the surest way directly to veer away cable to  by  anchor and bring the ship up again and carry out a small anchor on the larboard bow taking in the rope and hauling it tight on the larboard quarter when the bower anchor is apeek or you must lay till the windward tide makes to bring the wind on the larboard bow when you may get under way and clear the shore  to cast a ship upon the larboard tack when riding with the wind right ahead and to ware her short round before the wind in little room in this case the head sails only should be loose casting with a lee tide viz the foretopsail hoisted the foresail in the brails braced sharp up with the larboard braces the jib and foretopmaststaysail set with the larboard sheets flat aft when the anchor is apeek and if there is a lee tide running at weighing the anchor the helm should be put aport so ar as to bring the wind a little on the larboard bow which should be kept so by steering the ship till the tide ceases to run aft which should be strictly noticed by the water along side then put the helm hard astarboard or alee and when the ship gets sternway the water will act very powerfully on the starboard or lee side of the rudder in that direction to turn the ships stern to windward whilst the wind acting at the same time upon the head sails aback will box her round off upon her heel so as to bring the wind almost aft by the time she looses her sternway then the ship will cease falling off and soon get headway which should be attended to and the head sails be braced about flat with the starboard braces and the helm shifted hard aport at the same time  when there is no tide but the water still at weighing the anchor the helm must be hard astarboard and as the ship gets sternway casting in still wter the water meets with so much resistance against the starboard side of the rudder in that direction that the rudder acts with great power to turn the ships stern round to port and the head sails being set and trimmed as above mentioned and the foresails let fall with the starboard bowline hauld close forward will contribute to cast the ship the right way round so far by the time she loses her sternway as you may then proceed as above directed and may get the ship under command of the helm to steer at pleasure as she gets headway the success of this case depends greatly on heaving up the anchor briskly from the above it will be easy to know how to cast and get a ship under way upon the starboard tack the same rules hold good only to manage the helm and sails the contrary way to that which has been described  on turning to windward it may not be amiss here to endeavor to explain by what means and upon what principles it is that this most noble and useful machine a ship is made to gain ground and is brought about from one tack to the other against the wind and waves when they are moderate  it is well known that we have ships that will sail from six to nine miles an hour upon a wind when it blows fresh and the water is smooth and will make their way good within six points of the wind so as to gain to windward in still water a third of what they run by the logg suppose six miles an hour to gain two miles or nine miles to gain three to windward with the sails trimmed in that oblique or slanting direction as is particularly described page the  0th which certainly tends to force the ship much more broadside to leeward what makes a ship gain to windward than ahead for it is a known principle that a ship sailing with the wind upon the beam and the plane of the sails trimmed to four points or fortyfive degrees from the direction of the keel the sails at that angle tend equally to drive the ship broadside to leeward as ahead so that a ship sailing and turning to windward as above mentioned must be owing to the shape of the ships hull which makes little resistance in sailing ahead compared with the great resistance made by the broadside in the water not only by the ships extraordinary length in proportion to her breadth as has been observed but all those thin parts the dead wood cut water gripe stem keel sternpost and rudder which make very little resistance in the ships going ahead but a powerful resistance sideways that though the sails are trimmed in that sharp direction yet in a moderate wind when the ship can carry all her sails by the wind and the water smooth she will sail with the wind two points before the beam as fast or faster than she will do when right before the wind with the same breeze thus suppose the wind blows at the rate of ten miles an hour when one of these fast sailing ships may sail at the rate of six miles and gain two to windward which increases the power of the wind one sixth part and makes it act equal to twelve miles upon the sails close by the wind and if you put right before the wind so that we will suppose the ship to go about five miles an hour this reduces the power of the wind one half and it has not one half of the canvas to act upon that it has when the ship is sailing close by the wind to confirm this opinion an experiment to prove that when the wind blew   knots a boat sailed   by the wind and large i have tried experiments and found the velocity of the wind in a pleasant breeze by a man running on the shore right before the wind so as to keep a light vane in his hand becalmed when he run with a logline fastened to him five different times to be about nine knots i then tried a schooner rigged boat with two sails close by the wind and found that she sailed by the same logline five knots at five points from the wind then i put her right before the wind and tried her with both sails drawing full when she went but the same five knots by the log three different trials before and by the wind at the rate of five miles an hour when the wind blew at the rate of nine miles an hour to sail within   points of the wind is near enough for a   mast ship i reckon that a fast sailing ship would have gone as fast or faster than this boat at six points from the wind with her principal sails braced up to three points of the wind as before observed which is sharp and near enough to the wind for a three mast ship that has more tophamper to hold wind than a sloop or schooner rigged vessel and therefore requires to sail farther from the wind to overcome all the resistance that is against her and a ship makes more or less leeway in proportion to her headway on which depends the power of the helm to steer and bring her about from one tack to the other in the most advantageous manner so as to gain ground to windward i have in chasing to windward been coming fast up with many a vessel that sailed much nearer the wind than we for it should be considered that a ship sailing at six points from the wind nothing but the sails properly trimmed contributes to give her headway and all other parts of the ship or her materials that the wind and waves act upon tend two points out of eight to give her sternway and the wind may be said to be reflected so as to act upon the after part of the ship as if it was only three points from being ahead as may be perceived by the fly of the ensign and the aftersails upon the mizen mast standing at an angle of only a point and a half from the direction of the keel as mentioned page the  0th therefore to trim a ships sails to steer nearer the wind than six points must tend to lessen her headway and in proportion increase the leeway so that there must be more lost than gained by this practice except in a very narrow river where it may prove sometimes necessary  on tacking and turning to windward this excellent property of a ship turning to windward and tacking or staying well depends greatly on her dimensions shape of her bottom and being trimmed and i reckon a ship is in the best trim for tacking on a ships  trim  sailing as well as sailing both by the wind and large and is the most manageable on all occasions when she will almost steer herself close by the wind under all her principal sails carrying the helm near amidships with a trembling motion this a fast sailing ship will often do when it blows fresh and the water is smooth though two thirds of the canvas as i have computed stand before the mainmast and a good deal of it over the bows upon the bowsprit and jibbboom when there is none which projects over the stern when a ship carries the helm alee at such times it is a sign that she is too much by the stern or the masts are stayed or stand too far forward but when a ship is not enough by the stern or the masts rake or stand too far aft she will gripe and carry the helm aweather which is thought by many to be an advantage in turning to windward an experiment of a rudder fixed to the stem of a sailing boat this opinion i have heard refuted by a very plausible experiment tried on this account by fixing a rudder to the stem of a sailing boat so that it could be pointed to windward occasionally on either tack thinking this would make the boat carry her proper helm aweather and the water would act upon the lee side of the two rudders in a direction so as to cause her to gain more ground in turning to windward but it was sound from experience to increase the resistance ahead and that it did more harm than good i have experienced great advantage from suiting a ship with more head than after sail to ease the weather helm when chased by a much superior force at a small distance to leeward carrying a pressing sail close by the wind at such times it may be perceived how much the water is raised above its natural level before and on the lee bow and you may see a hollow below the level on the luff of the weather bow by the head way and the ship heeling to the pressure of the sail she makes a fuller water line to leeward than to windward consequently a greater resistance on the lee than the weather bow which is the reason that ships in general require so much more head than after sail and to swim so much by the stern to be in the best trim to steer and be under command of the helm so as to make them most manageable  ships lightly ballasted or of an extraordinary length are very uncertain and require extraordinary attendance and time in tacking as is mentioned page the   th when a shorter well proportioned ship in a good trim for turning to windward may come about so fast as to make it difficult to work and manage the sails so as to get them properly trimmed in due time  to tack a ship when in a dangerous situation by a ruff sea or when her trim or her property is such as may make her staying doubtful such circumstances certainly deserve attention as safety may depend upon management every thing should be ready and clear the people properly stationed the sails fairly trimmed the ship cunned and steered just full and close by the wind and if it is a ruff sea to take the advantage of the first smoothest time when the ship has as much head way upon her as can be expected to haul down the jibb if set at such times is of great service and not to put the helm a lee all at once but luff the ship up by degrees to shake the sails and not till then order the helm hard alee with a loud voice to let go the lee sheets forward but not the lee braces and foretopbowline as in common to back the head sails too soon that stops the ships head way which must continue to give power to the helm till the wind is brought ahead else you may be sure the ship will not stay to off tacks and sheets and haul mainsail when the wind is a point on the weather bow this swings the yards sharp round that the main tack may be got close down whilst the head sails becalm the foreleach of the main and maintopsails at the same time the wind blowing aslant on the afterleach of these sails acts jointly with the rudder to turn the ships stern so as to bring her about the right way as represented by figure   plate the  d  when a ship comes about at such times she is sure to have stern way by the time the head sails are hauled therefore the helm should not then be shifted alee as is commonly done but should be kept hard aweather till her sternway ceases the water acting upon the weather side of the rudder prevents the ship falling round off from the wind which the helm when hard alee occasions while the sternway continues and strict notice should be made by some object ahead or by the compass that the ship continues coming about till the wind is on the other bow for if she stops with the wind ahead and by the water along side her headway is perceived to be done the helm should he directly shifted to the other side so that by the sternway the water may act upon the rudder and bring her about the right way and then the helm should not be kept alee but immediately shifted and kept hard aweather till her sternway ceases for the reason already given the head sails may be hauled as soon as possible for the ship will be sure to fall off the faster and farther in proportion to her sternway so that the weather braces should be tended to prevent the head yards flying fore and aft as they will do if it blows fresh and to keep the head sails shivering that the fore tack may be got easily close down the ship stopped the sooner from falling off and shifting the helm alee when the sternway ceases the head sails may be trimmed sharp as the ship is perceived to come too  to tack a quick turning ship in a fresh gale and smooth water a good or bad haul in this case makes a material difference in gaining to windward and in wear and tear and in the ease of the people i have been in a ship that when hauling mainsail it was always catched aback as is represented figure   plate  d so that we had the maintack to get down five or six feet and the after sails to trim after the ship was tacked and that this is often the case may be seen from the common print of a ship tacking where it is represented in the same manner this is owing to the custom of always putting the helm hard alee whether the ship requires it so far or no and not hauling the mainsail till the wind is right ahead  therefore to make a good haul at the time when it is known that the ship will be very quick in stays the helm should not be put hard alee as customary but half down alee less or more as experience proves to be sufficient to bring her about before she looses her headway to off tacks and sheets as soon as the sails shake that the mainsail may be hauled with the wind two points on the weather bow as represented figure i plate  d this management helps the ship in stays and gives time and a favorable opportunity to get the maintack close on board and the after sails fairly trimmed by the time they fill so that the people may be all at liberty to haul and trim the head sails then the helm should be shifted or righted only as the ship may require by her head or sternway to work her close and not always hard alee as customary for if the ship has headway it may bring her up in the wind and if sternway it may make her fall broad off from the wind as before mentioned  it must be allowed that the less helm a ship is tacked with so as she dont get sternway the farther she will shoot and gain to windward in stays for the rudder stops the ships way through the water more or less in proportion as the helm is put over to either side i have tried experiments in a cistern of water experiments made on the helm more or less over with a model of a ship with a model of a ship that had the helm prepared to traverse four points of the compass each way which was marked out from the center of the rudders motion and pushing her right forward through the water with an equal power first with the helm amidships she went much farther before she stopped than she did afterward with the helm altered a point at a time to four points when she shortened her distance and made a less sweep each trial and as to a ship coming about with little helm it is well known that will often happen when not intended by a small neglect of the helm  in narrow channels tacking in very narrow channels where a ship has very little room to turn to windward she may require the helm to be put down hard alee all at once and the lee braces forward sheets and foretop bowline all to be let go at the same time also to brace the head sails which may prevent the ship shooting a shore in stays when this happens the mainsail may be hauled with the wind three points on the weather bow when the after sails shake and the head sails take aback by being raced to which will give more time to get down the maintack and to trim the after sails without hindering but rather helping the ship to stay as before observed for suppose a ship was to be launched head foremost wih her square sails set and trimmed sharp with the larboard braces forward and the starboard braces aft and with the wind three points on the starboard bow as represented figure i plate  d it is evident from thence that the wind would act whilst the headway continued so as to turn the ships head to starboard and on the after sails to turn the stern to port which would bring her round on the larboard tack though she had no rudder hung or if she had her helm amidships by the effect of the sails only  but the best lessons for tacking and working to windward in little room on working to windward in the coal trade to london are in the colliers bound to london where many great ships are constantly employed and where wages are paid by the voyage so that interest makes them dexterous and industrious to manage their ships with few men in a complete manner in narrow channels more so than perhaps in any other trade by sea in the world the seamen there go regularly from one thing to another which they know depends upon them by the great practice they have in turning to windward against westerly winds through narrow and shoal channels with their deep loaded ships that are trimmed so near an even keel to make them draw as little water as possible and their mainmasts stand farther aft than common this occasions them to gripe which often obliges them to work spritsail and all the head sails they can bear to make them manageable when turning to windward in narrow channels when it blows so strong that all hands cannot haul aft the fore sheet but are obliged to heave it aft by the capston even then it would be looked upon as a great blunder to make a bad haul observing always the ships quick or slow motion in stays to off tacks and sheets so as to be all ready and haul mainsail in the proper time whilst the wind takes the back of the weather or fore leach of the main and maintop sail which swings them sharp round with the main sheet block close aft and the main tack on the other side close forward to the chestree or the tack hole so that they have only to haul in the slack of the main tack and sheet and trim the after sails whilst becalmed by the head sails so that all hands are at liberty to help to haul and trim the head sails when the weather requires it  it must be allowed as mentioned page the   th that these ships being adapted for this trade are rigged as light as possible to make them work easy to windward in narrow channels with few hands they have no lifts to the lower yards no foretop bowlines and have short main bowlines and snatch blocks for the main and fore sheets the main braces lead forward so that the main and maintop bowlines are hauled and belayed to the same pin the same way with the main brace so that one man easily lets them all go together at once when the mainsail is hauled or rather swung so sharp round by the wind as above mentioned with so swift a motion that though they haul every thing hand over hand can only get in the slack of the maintop bowline by its going single which they make fast to keep the sails thus swung sharp round till the main tack is got down and the yards braced up then haul the bowlines upon the main brace for the reasons given and the ship being trimmed near an even keel with the mainmast standing far aft as before remarked makes them work close by preventing them falling much off from the wind though they may have lost their head way when the head sails are hauled and they are mostly built with pink sterns rounding inwards in their upper works that they trim the sails to stand full within five and a half points of the wind and so little tophamper above water to hold wind in proportion to other ships that when turning to windward in narrow channels they beat ships that would beat them in the open sea which must be owing to such reasons as have been given and that the running ropes may run clear in making short trips they dont coil them up but they let them run as they were hauled  turning to windward in very narrow channels safety depends greatly on getting a ship at first fairly under way and where there is water enough it is certainly best to heave short upon the anchor and weigh with the first of the tides making to windward and if the wind is partly across the tide it will cast the ship with her head toward the weather shore which she may be kept clear of by driving with the sails aback as represented plate the  d figure   till the anchor is up and stowed and as the tack toward the weather shore is the shortest it is prudent to back as near the lee side as you can with safety to make the first board the longer to get the proper sails fairly set and to get all ready in time for tacking and to make as bold as possible with the weather shore on which side a ship is always surest in coming about and in case of missing stays a ship may be backed off from the weather shore as above mentioned till she has room to fill and set the sails and get all her head way to try her in stays again without any danger but when the ship is got about to stand toward the lee shore where she is not so sure in stays when going slanting with the tide as going across it and especially if there runs any waves that may hinder the ship staying and not being sure of all the ropes running clear upon this tack for the first time therefore it may be necessary to put the ship in stays in good time that in case of a miss there may be room enough to fill and try her the second time or to use such means as may prevent her going on shore  but when the wind is right against the tide that begins to make to windward it requires caution not to weigh the anchor till the ship swings end on to the tide and brings the wind so far aft that she may be steered right against the tide till the anchor is up and stowed and the sails with which the ship is to work are all ready as represented figure i plate the  d and to haul the wind from being close over to one side which gives the whole breadth of the channel to get the ship fairly under way close by the wind and ready for tacking let the first trip be made as short as possible till it is found how the ship and people work upon both tacks and make them longer or shorter accordingly afterward but care should be taken not to stand into an eddy tide on either side which may be perceived by a rippling which has often occasioned ships to miss stays and go on shore  there is a saying amongst seamen if a ship will not stay you must ware her and if she will not ware you must box haul her and if you cannot box haul her you must club haul her that is let go the anchor to get her about on the other tack each of these masterly performances deserve particular notice  on box hauling a ship many advantages as well as safety often depend upon this being put properly in practice for it often happens that a ship refuses stays when there is not room to ware in time so as to avoid danger by the common method of filling the head and shivering the after sails etc therefore whenever a ship in a dangerous situation is put in stays and it is perceived that she stops coming to before she brings the wind ahead it is then certain that she will not stay therefore she should be immediately box hauled by keeping the helm hard alee and haul off all bracing about the head as well as the after sails hauling close forward the lee fore and foretop bowlines and up mizen and down after staysails at the same time the wind will then act upon the sails thus aback and the water upon the lee side of the rudder by her stern way will box the ship short round upon her keel with her stern up to the wind far enough aft for the after sails to draw full the right way to act with the helm which must be shifted hard aweather when the stern way ceases so that the head way with the wind so far aft will readily bring the ship round on the other tack the main and fore tacks are easily got down when the wind is upon the quarter and shivers the sails the main sheet easily hauld aft and the after sails braced up and trimmed sharp as the ship brings the wind more aft which help her round the faster till the wind comes on the other quarter that the mizen and mizen staysail may be set to take the right way to bring her to the wind whilst you tend and trim the head sails as she comes to  boxhauling may be proved to be the surest and readiest method to get a ship under command of the helm and sails to answer many occasions in little room as well as to ware and bring her from one tack to the other with the least loss of ground to leward when a ship refuses stays why a ship loses little ground in boxhauling nice managers of sloop rigged vessels turning to windward in narrow channels when they want but little to weather a point rather than make another tack have a practice of running up in the wind till the headway ceases then they fill again upon the same tack this they call making a half board thus a ship in boxhauling may be said to make two half boards first running with her head then with the stern up in the wind by which two motions a ship if well managed rather gains to windward and brings the wind almost aft by the time the stern way ceases so that she is under the command of the weather helm and the after sails to bring her short round on the other tack with the first of the headway in which time only it is that the ship goes any thing to leward worth notice in boxhauling therefore it should always be put in practice on these occasions by putting the ship in stays though it is known she will not come about with her head to windward and in a gail of wind and high waves or when there is not people enough to manage and haul the head sails the after sails only may be hauled and the fore sheet hauled close aft again when its perceived that the ship has done coming to as is represented plate the  th of a ship imbayed on a lee shore which shall be spoke of in its place  on club hauling a ship this is to get a ship from one tack to the other by letting go an anchor when by an eddy tide or by a ruff sea or being out of trim or from any other cause she refuses to stay or ware in time to avoid danger when this happens in shoal water found by the lead that if the ship has not water over her anchor she should have sternway given her and not headway when the anchor is let go and the weather anchor is likelier to go clear of the ship than the lee one therefore both bower anchors should be ready on these occasions  turning to windward at sea will be noticed hereafter on making of passages  on a ship driving to windward with the tide it often happens that there is not room to turn a vessel to windward through a crowd of ships or in narrow channels but she must drive by the help of the windward tide  a ship in this situation must be managed according to the manner you design to proceed for if the tide is strong enough in proportion to the wind so that she will drive fast enough to windward stern foremost it will certainly be the best as it may be done with or without any sails set the yards being braced sharp up as represented plate the  d figure   a ship may be steered at pleasure and to a great nicety end on to the tide and she will drive stern foremost in less room than her own length but it will require above three times her length to drive broadside if the wind is right against the tide and dexterous management is required on such an occasion because a ship will always shoot and tend toward that shore ahead of her so that you cannot drive far upon one tack though with the sails aback without waring at times to drive on the other tack or the ship will soon shoot on that shore ahead of her which i have seen instances of in spite of all endeavors to back astern  reasons why ships shoot ahead more than they can be backed astern when driving broadside with the tide though the sails are aback  ships in general have a longer and sharper runaft than they have an entrance forward the sternpost and rudder stand more upright than the stem and gripe and they swim more or less by the stern therefore the after part of a ship must be more powerfully acted upon by the windward tide than her fore part in the water which consequently sets her stern more to windward than her head which at the same time is more acted upon by the wind above water than her stern in proportion as the foremast and all belonging to it is larger and stands further forward than the mizen mast stands aft and the bowsprit with the jibboom and all that belong to them projecting so far over the bows and nothing projecting over the stern to hold wind in the same proportion abaft they must naturally cause the ship to drive with the wind mostly abaft the beam  and though the most effectual means are supposed to be used on such occasions to keep the ships bow to the wind and prevent as much as possible her falling off and shooting ahead by letting her drive with the after sails braced flat aback the mizen hauled out the helm alee and the head sails kept shivering as is represented by figure   plate the  d where it appears as if a ship might be backed astern at pleasure yet experience proves the contrary and the following reasons may be added to those above mentioned the helm must be kept alee when driving in this way and though the after sails are aback the ship will shoot ahead and back astern alternately but she will come to with a slow motion by her headway till she brings the wind before the beam which gives her sternway and makes her fall round off upon her heel with a quick motion and brings the wind so far abaft the beam that she soon gets headway again so that she will shoot much farther ahead than she backs astern which makes it difficult to drive broadside with the tide right against the wind in little room with safety  but i have heard of this difficulty being overcome by two vessels driving broadside with their sterns confined near together by a rope that each vessel could check and command the other at pleasure to keep in a fair way which i think is practable to the advantage of both vessels as they may drive without any sails only hoisting a staysail occasionally  to drive a ship broadfide to windward with the tide right against the wind it is a masterly and necessary piece of seamanship to be able to perform this with safety where there is very little room as is represented plate the  d where the ship figure   by the help of a strong tide may be supposed to have drove stern foremost right to windward where it was too narrow to drive broadside and is got where there is but just room and tide enough to drive broadside which may make a great deal of difference in the ships driving according to the wind and tide for if we suppose the wind blows so fresh that the ship cannot be made to go less than at the rate of two miles an hour through the water when driving stern foremost the tide must run at the rate of three miles to make her drive one mile an hour to windward but where the tide runs but two miles an hour the ship will then be at a stand between wind and tide but when she is brought to and drives broadside as represented by figure   she may not drive above half a mile through the water so that what is the difference between that and what the tide goes she will drive to windward  a ship may drive stern foremost without any sail as she only requires steerage way to command her and the less way she has through the water the faster she will drive so that when it blows fresh to contrive and make stop waters may be of service to help her to windward but to bring a ship to where there is little room so as to drive broadside will require the three topsails the mizen and the jib and foretopmast staysail to be ready to hoist to make her manageable to back or fill stay or ware as may be required for to endeavor to bring a ship to without sail to throw aback occasionally she would perhaps shoot on that shore ahead before she loses her headway  now let us suppose that the ship figure   plate the  d after driving stern foremost as above mentioned has set her topsails braced sharp up with the larboard braces in order to bring to and drive broadside on the larboard tack in this case the ship should be sheered as near the starboard shore as she possibly can with safety then put the helm hard astarboard hauling out the mizen as soon as it will take the right way so as to bring the ship round to with the topsails aback to prevent her shooting too near the larboard shore  a ship bringing to with much headway will bring the wind nearly right ahead by the time the headway ceases then the helm should be shifted hard aweather and the sails being aback will soon give her great sternway by which means a sternboard may be made to back her as near the shore astern as possible for as it has been observed a ship driving broadside may easily be shot ahead when she cannot be backed astern and this is the only time a sternboard can be made to advantage at the ships bringing to for when the sternway ceases the helm must be put and kept hard alee and the ship must drive with the main and mizen topsails aback the mizen hauled out and the foretopsail kept shivering as is represented figure   plate the  d and if the mizen staysail was set with the sheet to windward it might help to keep her more to the wind so that she might drive the farther on one tack before you are obliged to ware her to drive on the other tack which must be done as soon as the ship is perceived to draw near the shore ahead which will always be the case with a ship driving right to windward for the reasons given  when you intend to ware as a ship is always coming to and falling off by her head and sternway when thus driving take the opportunity when she has just done falling off by her sternway as she is then as far astern as she will be upon that tack and the wind as far aft being then all ready up mizen down mizen staysail if set shiver the main and mizen topsails fill flat the foretopsail up jib and foretopmast staysail if necessary shift the helm hard aweather the tide then setting round the stern as is represented by the ships wake and boat to windward figure   it will act with such power upon the rudder in that direction that with the first of her headway the ship may be wared and proceeding as before brought to so as to drive on the other rack in this manner a ship may be managed to change tacks and drive right to windward with the tide in less room than any one would think possible that has not had the experience  but instead of waring as last mentioned i cannot help thinking it would be better to put the ship in stays filling the after sails flat keeping the foretopsail just drawing full till the ship comes to so that it will take aback to help her about and if she stays let the helm lie as it will then be aweather the ship may then be backed by making a sternboard toward the shore astern at pleasure and if she refuses stays it gives a favorable opportunity to brace the topsails aback and boxhaul her round as has been described page    by which she will lose less ground than by wareing and the ships trim may require this practice as it is known that loaded colliers will stay when they will not ware and when light in ballast they will ware when they will not stay  the above management is founded on a supposition that a ship is to drive through a long straight reach or channel where the tide runs true right against the wind  to drive broadside to windward with the tide running across the channel or in a river of a winding or serpentine form in channels where the tide runs across through swashes etc the ship should be laid to drive with her head toward that shore the tide sets from and the setting of cross tides is best perceived by some objects which may be found to lie nearly in the direction of the channel observe nicely how your ship opens or shuts these marks that the sails may be kept aback shivering or full to shoot ahead as the tide may require so as to keep the ship in a fair way  driving in a crooked or serpentine river as represented plate the  d the tide commonly runs winding like the river from a point over into a bay on the other side and out of a bay again past the next point into the next opposite bay etc therefore at the bottom of each bay where the tide begins to set out again the ship should be put on the other tack to drive with her head toward the next point as represented by the ship figure   by which means a ship may be backed astern to drive clear of the shore ahead upon both tacks  when the wind blows a point or two of the compass across a tide that runs true a ship driving with her head toward the weather side may be easily managed so as to keep in a fair way by backing filling or shivering the sails and the more the sails can be kept shivering the faster the ship will drive  though a windward tide helps a ship to work and makes her manageable when driving to windward yet it is very necessary to have an anchor ready to let go as occasion may require  on bringing a ship to an anchor various situations and different sorts of harbors roads and coasts different directions and strength of winds waves and tides make it impossible to fix certain rules to bring a ship properly to an anchor at all times and places yet in my opinion a great deal may be said on this subject that deserves notice and first it may be necessary to make some remarks on coiling cables  on coiling cables it may be the loss of a ship to coil a new cable with the sun as it is termed before it is properly stretched or the end taken through the coil for it is almost sure to come up in kinks when yeered out and especially in cold weather the greatest dependence being on new cables they are commonly kept in reserve till the other cables or the anchors give way which makes this bad practice in coiling them the more dangerous therefore it should be first considered how to manage the cables to make them work and coil to the best advantage and run clear of catch sakes as well as kinks  a cable in my opinion works and wears much better for being iled the same way that it runs round the windlass or bitts therefore the cables for the starboard anchors which work round the windlass against the sun should be coiled against the sun and those for the larboard anchors coiled with the sun as they work that way round a windlass and as they run out round the bitts the contrary way so that the cables should be coiled accordingly and to make new cables answer this practice is the first time to coil them with the sun over the cable tier hatchway with larger o less sakes according to the limberness or stiffness of the ope and take the upper end through the coil to coil it down in the tier this will make the rope pliable to coil and veer out easy clear of kinks either with or against the sun  to coil a cable to run clear of catch sakes the cable should always be laid out from the inside sake to the outside sake at the farther end of the cable tier farthest from the hatchway this will likewise coil the cable so nuch lower in that part near the hatchway so as to give more room and height to bend and coil the cable and for the bends to upset clear when veering away  the bad custom of coiling cables with the sun so as to run in kinks proceeds first from the ropemakers who for their ease coil them that way to send them to the ship where without thought they are too commonly coiled down the cable tier the same way because a new cable before it is well stretched will always bend of itself that way in coiling for the rope opening against the lay gets clear of a turn at the bend of every fake which is the reason that a new cable bends and coils so easy this way but when this cable comes to be veered out this turn must come into the cable again at the upsetting of every bend but the lay of the rope inclines it to keep clear of this turn which prevents the fakes from upsetting and causes it to come up in kinks by which bad practice i have known many narrow escapes therefore all new cablelaid ropes hawsers and towlines as well as cables that require to run clear of kinks should be either coiled against the sun till they are well stretched or with the sun and the end taken through the coil as before mentioned for the same reason as it is well known that a coil of new rigging will not run clear of kinks without the end is properly taken through the coil but to coil a new cable against the sun that is from the right hand to the left requires a turn to be forced into the lay of the rope at the bend of every sake which makes it troublesome to coil this way but this turn in every fake makes the bends upset of themselves so that the cable veers out very easy  now if we may suppose that the anchors and cables are all ready so as to be sure of running clear the next things to be considered are the depth of water the room strength of the wind waves or tide where you expect to anchor also that the buoy and buoy rope range of cable handspikes stoppers ringropes and buckets of water to throw on the windlass or bitts be all ready as occasion may require and to give as great a scope of cable as the place will permit before you offer to bring the ship up because the length and weight of the cable will contribute greatly to ease both the anchor and cable as well as the ship when the waves run high for which reason i have known ships have the inner ends of the sheet and best bower cables spliced together so that by oversetting one cable they could vear out both upon one end to either anchor if necessity required it for it is well known in a storm when the waves run high and especially in deep water that a ship will ride much easier and longer by two cables or more upon one end to one good anchor than by two anchors with a single cable to each for to ride by two anchors they must lie far enough asunder on each bow to prevent one anchor from hurting the other cable by which a ship seldom pulls hard upon both cables at the same time but first pulls hard upon one cable if but a short scope it plunges her deep into the sea then that strain draws the ship toward that anchor which slackens that cable so that by the next wave she strains hard upon the other cable and so on she pulls first at one and then at the other which causes a ship to labor and be very uneasy in the waves in comparison to what she would be if riding by one good anchor and a great scope of cable which admits the ship to fall and rise easy with the waves without hauling the whole length and weight of the cable off the ground which makes the anchor hold longer without coming home  in letting go an anchor care should be taken that the ship does not hurt herself upon it in case of shole water and that the anchor is not fouled by the cable getting about the fluke or stock of the anchor which may prevent its holding the ship when any strain comes upon it  to come to an anchor when the wind is right against the tide it should be a rule to shoot the ship ahead of the anchor or sheer her clear of it upon the same tack you design to shoot her upon the next tide endeavoring always to keep the ship in swinging with the tide on one side of the anchor to keep clear of it for reasons that will be given in its place on keeping a clear anchor as it is represented plate the  d it may be supposed that the ship driving to windward has got to an anchoring birth or the tide is so far spent that she will drive no farther to windward and must come to an anchor on the starboard tack in this case at letting go the anchor the ship should be shot ahead of it and kept ahead with the helm aweather and the yards braced full with the larboard braces and the foretopmaststaysail and mizen set full as is represented by figure   plate the  d till the windward tide is done that she falls to leeward and rides windroad with the wind anchor and cable right ahead as represented figure   plate the  d in which position she will lie till the next windward tide  to come to an anchor when going with a strong wind and tide the same way where there is room it is certainly necessary to full the square sails as the ship is running before the wind and tide and to take room to bring her to by putting the helm hard over to starboard or port and haul out the mizen to bring the ships head up as much as possible against the wind and tide at letting go the anchor which will contribute greatly to bring the ship up with safety and ease compared with that bad practice of letting go the anchor as the ship runs right before the wind and tide without handing the square sails which adds all that extraordinary force of the ships way through the water to the strength of the wind and tide which increases the strain and rubs the cable to a dangerous degree by which i have seen great damage done as breaking the cable etc which might have been avoided by bringing the ship to and letting go the anchor as above recommended  the damage that is often done on this occasion proceeds from want of consideration for as it has been observed before a ship sailing right before the wind and a strong tide does not feel the real strength of the wind therefore apprehending no danger lets go the anchor as the ship runs which if it does not make something give way must greatly strain every thing that is immediately concerned in bringing the ship up  to come to an anchor when the wind is right across the tide where it can be done the ship should be always put upon that tack that stems against the tide when the anchor is let go and if it is designed to continue at a single anchor in order to keep it clear i would recommend to sheer and keep the ship to leeward of the anchor by keeping the helm aweather and the foretopmaststaysail set with the sheet to windward as represented by the ship figure   plate the  th for the reasons which will be given on keeping a clear anchor  great advantages may attend letting go the anchor steming against the tide and especially where the tide runs over rapid for it gives an opportunity to take notice at what rate the ship may be going astern so as to judge whether it may not be necessary to keep sail set in order to help to bring the ship up and ride easy in a rapid tide i have been where we let go the small bower anchor with all sails set with a fresh breeze of wind against the tide and veered out the whole cable and the ship still drove then we let go the best bower anchor and veered out all that cable by which the ship brought up and road so close to a shole astern that we were obliged to ride with the helm aport to keep the ship with a broad sheer to prevent her touching the ground which would have been fatal to the whole the rapid tide would have overset the ship broke away her masts and turned her over and over upon the shole which would probably have been the case had it not been for the sails being kept set which helped to bring the ship up and ride  to come to an anchor at slacktide or in still water where there is neither tide or current it is expected in this case that the sails are taken in as the strength of the wind and situation may require to bring the ship up with case in moderate weather and where there is room it is certainly best to bring the ship to under the topsails throwing her head up to the wind by putting the helm alee with the topsails lowered down or clewed up and when the ship is perceived to get sternway then let go the anchor to the ground but veer out no more cable but as the ship takes it by driving to leeward from the anchor as represented by the ships figure   and   plate the  th and not offer to bring the ship up till it is thought that she has a sufficient scope of cable to ride her on which it depends to make the anchor and cable hold as occasion may require  to come to an anchor in roads that are often crowded with ships so as to take and give good and clear births the best anchoring births in these places are commonly well known by marks which the first ship naturally takes up and has a right to keep clear from any other ship anchoring so near as to make her a foul birth as is represented by plate the  th where the ship figure   may be supposed to be come to an anchor in the best birth having the castle and windmill in one line and the houses and church in the other line of direction pointing exactly to the anchor these particulars ought to be wrote down in the logg book as should likewise the bearings by the compass of extreme points of land sholes rocks or sands all which it may be necessary to remark so that a course may be steered to keep clear of them if the ship should be drove from her anchors in the night or in thick weather and that the anchors may be found again by the marks made when they were let go if their buoys should disappear  if it is a tide or trade wind roadsteed the next ship that comes ought not to anchor right ahead or astern of the first ship so as to lay in each others hawse but should come to upon the bow and quarter at a proper distance to prevent other ships from coming between and in a slanting direction from the tide or wind as is represented by the ships figures   and   plate the  th this in my opinion might contribute to the safety of ships in such places as the dwns yarmouth roads or the west indies and other such places that may be crowded with ships when it happens to blow strong upon a lee tide or in strong sea breezes in the west indies each single ship may then veer away what cable may be thought necessary and keep clear of the other ships hawse astern or in case of driving or casting this gives a better chance to keep clear of each other  a friend told me that he often got a good anchoring birth in the west india road steeds by first running down through the middle of the fleet where he often perceived good births left vacant by some ships that had sailed from the middle of the fleet then he steered out from among the ships and turned to windward of them all so far as to give time to take in and furl all the sails and run down before the wind amongst the ships without any sail and let go the anchor at the designed birth which he could not have come at by any other means the like practice may answer the same purpose at other times and places  to come to an anchor when designed to moor with the best and small bower anchors in places exposed to waves from one quarter more than another and if the ship is to lie for some time exposed to all the various winds that may blow it should be made a rule to let go the first anchor so that the ship may be moored with the second anchor to lay with an open hawse toward the sea or the most open or worst part of the road or river where the greatest waves can come from to give the ship violent pitching motions which are always very destructive to the cables when riding hard with a cross in the hawse for which reason the cross in the cables should always be toward the smooth water quarter  to let go all the anchors to best advantage when that is the only chance left to keep the ship off a lee shore this desperate occasion happens when the anchoring ground lies less than two cables length from the lee shore or when the ship is only that distance from it with the wind and waves so high right upon the shore that it is found impossible for the ship to keep off the shore with all the sail she can carry so that safety must depend entirely on the management of the ground tackle  in such a dangerous situation where if one anchor or cable sail there is not room to bring the ship up by another and it is counted a great disgrace to let a ship go on shore with any ground tackle on board that might have been used to help to ride her therefore the utmost endeavors should be used to let go all the anchors a little distance from each other and as much as possible in a line along the shore that one anchor may not hurt another cable and that the cables lead clear of each other and made to bear a strain in proportion to their strength to help to ride out the storm  to put this difficult performance in practice i would recommend to get the square sails handed with the quickest dispatch possible but to keep the foretopmast main and mizen staysails set the yards braced full and the helm put hard aweather to keep headway upon the ship shooting her along the shore as much as possible till all the anchors are let go contriving to begin with the weathermost anchor or that that has the cable in the weathermost hawsehole and so on with the next weathermost anchor paying out the cables as fast as possible that the ship may keep shooting ahead till the last anchor is let go  on keeping a clear anchor it is allowed to be a masterly and material branch of seamanship to be able to manage a vessel riding in a tide way by a single anchor so as to keep it clear from the cable getting foul of the fluke or stock and sometime soul of both fluke and stock which may be the case and the anchor thus fouled as it is termed prevents its holding the ship and may occasion her to drive on shore or athwart another ships hawse which often happens from the want of proper methods being put in practice to keep the anchor clear this therefore deserves the utmost regard for in open roadsteeds when only waiting for a fair wind it may be better and safer to ride by a single anchor than to be moored when it blows hard and among many ships which are liable to drive athwart each others hawse so that to save both ships the leewardmost may be obliged to cut or slip if riding by a single anchor they have only one cable to get clear of but if moored with the two bowers they have two cables to get clear of which may be at a time when both ships and men may seem to be the sport of wind and waves and which may make one ship to rise whilst the other falls and tear in pieces even our heart of oak and make our seamens hearts of oak fail which we boast ourselves so much upon for what chance does feeble men stand to send off the blows one ship gives to the other at such times of distress when nothing is heard but the crashing of timber etc and crying out for the leewardmost ship to cut to relieve them so that if moored and must part with both anchors she may have only one anchor left to bring her up again and ride by and safety may still depend on keeping that clear all which prove the great necessity of endeavoring after fixed rules to keep a single anchor clear  to keep a clear anchor with the wind right against the tide it should be a fixed rule on this occasion at the tide first setting to windward to shoot the ship ahead of the anchor to keep it clear and not to offer to back her astern of it for that is found by experience to be impracticable not only for the reasons given page    on a ship driving broadside and on this occasion when the cable lying upon the ground the ship swinging with the tide will bring the wind so much abaft the beam that it will be impossible to back the ship astern clear of her anchor yet i have seen this attempted in capital merchant ships and even in his majestys service i have seen some expose their ignorance in this important point of duty  it should be another fixed rule always to endeavor to shoot or sheer a ship on the same side of the anchor each tide to avoid the risk of the anchor not turning in the ground as the ship goes round it as she will do when she is let pass at random on one side of the anchor one tide and on the other side of it the next by which bad practice the cable is liable to get foul of the upper fluke of the anchor  this case i must refer back to the example page    where the ship figure   plate the  d is described to be managed according to the above rules when she was brought to an anchor and was shot ahead of it upon the starboard tack so that when the windward tide makes again she should be cast and shot ahead of her anchor upon the same tack as before is represented figure   plate the  d until she swings to windward of the anchor and comes to a proper sheer with a tight cable growing on the larboard bow and the wind on the starboard quarter keeping her on this sheer with the helm aport then the sails may be taken in till the windward tide slacks for there is no danger of a ship breaking her sheer whilst the tide runs strong in proportion to the wind that keeps her astern of the anchor but when the tide slacks or the wind becomes so strong that the ship shoots end on upon the tide ahead of her anchor then is the time that she is liable to break her sheer against the helm and requires assistance with sail and the yards to be braced about etc to prevent her from falling over her anchor and fouling it  but to cast the ship figure   on the starboard tack as above mentioned when the lee tide is done the head yards should be braced up sharp with the starboard braces the after yards with the larboard braces the foretopmast staysail set with the starboard sheet hauled flat aft and the helm hard aport then the windward tide coming right aft acts upon the larboard side of the rudder in a direction such as will cant the ships stern to starboard and the wind at the same time acts upon the foretopmast staysail and the head yards to cast her head to port upon the starboard tack and suppose that by the setting of the tide or other accidents that contrary to your design the ship should cast on the larboard tack in that case every thing is ready trimmed as it should be to ware her round on the other tack the helm being aport is now hard aweather the head yards and foretopmast staysail is flat full the after yards braced the other way all act together and will bring the ship round on the starboard tack before she comes near her anchor then the mizen may be hauled out and the foretopmast staysail and head yards set drawing full to shoot her ahead till she drives to windward of the anchor with a tight cable as before described  but to cast a ship the right way at an anchor with a windward tide is best represented plate the  th with a side view of the ship figure   to cast her upon the larboard tack when the lee tide slacks the helm is put aport to sheer the ship and bring the wind on the larboard bow then set the spritsail and spritsail topsail topped up to port the jib and foretopmast staysail with the larboard sheets flat aft and the jib sheet under the spritsail yard arm to guy the sail farther out to port the head yards braced sharp up with the larboard braces the after yards with the mizentopsail set braced sharp up the other way strict notice should be taken when the lee tide is quite done to put the helm hard a starboard so that the windward tide acting upon the starboard side of the rudder in that direction and the wind upon the sails and yards makes them evidently tend to cast the ship the way designed and when she is cast you have only to fill the head sails and yards to shoot her ahead with a tight cable till the tide sets her to windward of the anchor or swings her near end on to the tide and brings the wind on the larboard quarter then the head sail should be taken in and the head yards pointed to the wind wi the larboard braces and if she continues to ride ahead of the anchor which should be strictly noticed by the buoy or the growing of the cable more aftersail should be set the mizen and mizen staysail added to the mizen topsail to help the starboard helm to keep the ship from breaking her sheer against the helm and bringing the wind on the starboard quarter when this happens with these sails set the mizen and mizen staysail must be immediately taken in shiver or keep drawing full the right way the mizentopsail set the jib or foretopmast staysail the yards and helm being trimmed the right way as before mentioned to keep clear of the anchor and bring the ship round on her proper sheer again with the wind on the larboard quarter then down headsails and endeavor to keep her on this sheer as before directed till the windward tide is done  on keeping a clear anchor when the wind blows a point or two across the tide in this situation when the tide makes to windward it will naturally cast the ship with her head toward the weather side and for the reasons before given will swing her to bring the wind so far abaft the beam as to prevent backing her astern of the anchor to keep it clear therefore i would recommend to shoot her ahead of the anchor to the weather side till she comes to her proper sheer the wind being on the quarter a little across the tide will keep her from breaking her sheer whilst the windward tide runs and she may be easily shot ahead on the same side of the anchor again as before described when the windward tide is done  but whenever the wind blows so far across the tide that the ship can be shered and kept to leeward of her anchor i recommend this as much the best practice to keep a clear anchor  to keep a clear anchor when the wind is right across the tide i strongly recommend the simple and easy method of setting the foretopmast staysail with the weather sheet flat aft and the helm aweather whereby the ship may be sheered and kept near the same place to leeward clear of her anchor both stood and ebb as represented by the ship figure   where she naturally must be each slack tide in the situation as represented by the ship figure   plate the  th but this method of sheering a ship to leeward being quite contrary to that bad custom which is practiced in the coal trade of sheering ships to windward of their anchor and though i allow them to be the greatest proficients in managing ships in narrow and difficult channels hope to convince them that their practice in this instance is wrong but dame custom i know from experience is a powerful adversary and a great enemy to improvements and will seldom submit to conviction notwithstanding that i shall endeavor to make a fair comparison by describing both methods as they are represented in plate the  th which was made for this purpose only and then leave the merit of both to the determination of impartial judges first then let us suppose the wind to be off shore and right across the tide as is represented plate the  th and that the ship figure   is commanded be capt reason and came to an anchor on the larboard tack fleming against the tide as described page    with her helm aweather to sheer the ship to leeward of the anchor which method not only keeps the ship clear of her anchor but also makes her ride so near end on to the tide with the wind rather abaft the beam that she may be helped with sail to ride easier in a rapid tide and when the tide is moderate she will lie sheered right to leeward of her anchor where she must be at each slack tide as has been before observed and if we suppose that she came to an anchor at slack tide as described page    she will then lie with the cable and anchor in the same direction with the wind right ahead so that when either tide makes so as to bring the wind upon the bow they have only to hoist the foretopmast staysail with the sheet to windward and put the helm aweather to keep her anchor clear as you see represented by figure   plate the  th  now we will suppose dame custom commanding the ship figure   in the same plate comes to an anchor on the starboard tack steming against the tide and puts the helm a lee which sheers the ship and lays her anchor in a slanting direction to windward as represented by figure   till the tide begins to slack then sets the mizentopsail aback and in little wind sometimes adds the maintopsail aback to back the ship astern clear of her anchor which makes her form a sweep half round her anchor according to her scope of cable from her being near right to windward to right to leeward of her anchor as represented from figure   to figure   where the ship must naturally lie in that situation every slack tide with the wind and anchor right ahead till the other tide makes then they shift the helm alee braces aback the mizentopsail and yards etc and sheer the ship nearly right to windward to complete almost the circle quite round her anchor every tide as represented from figure   to figure   where it appears plain the ship is made to take up above twice the room of the ship figure   consequently in that proportion her cable rubs over twice as much ground and is more liable to sweep foul of stones wreck or lost anchors etc which may greatly hurt it and it may get under the upper fluke of her own anchor if the anchor does not turn in the ground as the ship is sheered round it which probably will be done at the last and first part of the tide when it runs easy when if the wind is moderate and the bottom a tough clay it is great chance but the anchor lies with the stock to windward by the strain upon it in that direction as above mentioned and the cable may go over the stock when lying flat upon the ground as the ship was backed to leeward of the anchor and may sweep under the upper fluke as she is sheered to windward again which makes it evident that by this practice dame custom is likely to ride with the cable foul of the upper fluke of the anchor as represented figure   and to suppose the wind and tide so moderate that the ship does not drive yet the strain upon the upper fluke may cant it toward the ship and raise the farther stock arm off the ground by which in a clay bottom the anchor may perhaps lie in that position so that when the tide slacks and the ship is backed from figure   to figure   it will clear the cable of the anchor sluke and as they sheet to windward again from figure   to figure   the cable is likely to sweep under the anchor stock arm that lies canted off the ground i defy the adherents of dame custom to account for their cables so often getting under the anchor stock which naturally lies flat upon the ground but by this bad practice  again suppose dame custom comes to an anchor at slack tide the anchor will naturally lie in the same direction with the ship and wind right ahead and when the tide makes instead of keeping the ship to leeward as represented figure   then old dame sheers and lies to windward of the anchor as above mentioned and suppose the wind to change and come so far abaft the beam that the ship cannot be backed astern of her anchor but shoots ahead as the tide slacks in this case if it is good holding ground we may reasonably suppose that the anchor has not turned in the ground as the ship has gone round it the cable will then naturally sweep the upper fluke of the anchor so that dame custom is likely to be adrift with the lee tide if it blows fresh or the tide runs strong and may carry other ships adrift with them which makes it dangerous for reason to lie near dame custom in crowded roadsteeds which must make great confusion when one sheers their ship to leeward and the other to windward of their anchor they may sheer on board each other which i have known to be the case and dame custom has then abused reason by calling him lubber for sheering the ship to leeward of her anchor when reason who had observed their wrong proceedings wagered in his own defense that dame customs anchor was then soul which proved to be so at heaving up  there is so much to be said against this bad custom of sheering to windward of the anchor that i am surprised how it came into practce as nothing reasonable has appeared to me could be urged in favor of it even in respect to work to wear and tear all are greatly against it so that i would advise every ship commanded by reason to resort and lie together as far from the adherents of dame custom as the room in the place will admit of as they all sheer one way to leeward of their anchors they may lie with much more safety clear of each other in less than hall the compass of ground that dame custom takes up as is made evident by plate the  th which i hope will prove sufficient to condemn the practice  it is but fai that we remark what effect the change of wind might have upon the ship figure   to leeward of her anchor when it made dame custom soul her anchor by being to windward of it as mentioned above suppose then that the wind comes four points abaft the beam as long as the foretopmast staysail with the sheet to windward will keep drawing the right way and the helm hard aweather reason to leeward of her anchor will never come near to foul it and to suppose by the force of the wind the ship ranges ahead of the anchor that she breaks her sheer it will be with her head to leeward clear of the anchor till the tide drives her astern of it again so that whilst a ship by this method can be kept to leeward of her anchor she should never be sheered to windward of it  on mooring ships rules cannot be fixed to suit all places and all ships but different methods may be necessary according to the road the size of the ship her draft of water and how she may be provided with ground tackle etc where the tide runs very strong and there is water enough it is certainly best to moor water shot the anchors and cables lying in the same direction with the tide which can then have but little effect upon them in comparison to what it has when a ship is moored across the tide where the power of the tide alone upon the moorings is of itself sometimes enough to bring the anchors home therefore great ships that have sheet anchors and are well manned to clear the hawse when obliged to lie where the tide runs strong moor with the best and small bower anchors water shot but small ships having only two bower anchors and but few hands to clear hawse drawing less water may moor out of the strength of the tide with the small bower and stream anchor and hawser athwart the tide and keep the best bower anchor in reserve as occasion may require  when a ship is to be moored only to wait for a fair wind the best anchor and open hawse should be toward the foul wind quarter but when a ship is to lie with all winds that may blow the best anchor and open hawse should be toward the worst wind that may blow to raise the waves and give the ship a pitching motion as is mentioned page    and must leave no more of the smallest moorings within board than just enough to freshen the hawse on occasion by which they will hold the longer by having the longer scope and the hawse will be the easier cleared  where a ship is liable to ground with the ebb and not to float till the flood tide runs strong the safest method is to moor across the tide which lays the ship clear from getting damage upon her own anchors then it requires to attend and slack the mooring that her stern may swing over upon the flood to prevent her girting and when moored with a small anchor and hawser the helm should be always shifted to sheer her toward the small anchor to ease the strain upon the small moorings and to lay the principal stress upon the bower anchor and cable to ride the ship when the tide runs strong  i have been mooring a ship in a very narrow river where the shore on each side was nothing but loose shilly stones we laid the bower anchor close over to one side of the river and made fast a hawser with a long bowline knot to the middle of a twelve feet deal board buried on the opposite shore under the shilly stones broadside and its lower edge a little slanting toward the ship which held her better than an anchor would have done in its place another remark of this kind which i think deserves notice is what i have known done where anchors placed one to back another could not be made to hold in sand but a bulky bundle made of rushes that grow on sand hills buried under the sand and trampled upon has held so that it would break a cable made fast to it and no doubt but any thing of the same bulk would answer the same purpose  on keeping a clear or open hawse in roads where ships are liable to be put in great motion by waves which may make dangerous destruction of the moorings with a foul hawse and the danger and trouble there is in clearing it when the waves run high make it highly necessary to endeavor to cause the ship to swing the right way each tide to keep the hawse clear which the wind will do when it blows across the tide as may be supposed in plate the  th and that the wind was off the shore across the tide when the ship figure   was moored with an open hawse toward the shore to wait for a fair wind whilst that wind continues the ship will swing with her stern from the shore and keep a clear hawse without any trouble but when the wind comes to blow right opposite to one tide and in the same direction with the other tide running along the shore as represented by the ship figure   plate the  th then it requires management to make the ship swing with her stern from the shore to keep the hawse open on both tides the method of proceeding the first part of the windward tide when the wind is right ahead is fully described page    and to swing a ship the latter part of a windward tide when the wind is right aft requires only to put the helm over that way her stern is to go as in this case to starboard which will bring the wind on the larboard quarter if it is little wind the mizen mizen staysail and mizen topsail braced up sharp may be set to assist the helm as the tide slacks to swing her the right way to keep the hawse clear without the trouble of towing with a boat running out a rope and a small anchor etc which a calm or the setting of the tide may sometimes require to be done  on serving the cables to prevent their chaifing as safety may often depend upon this not only when the waves run high but in smooth water where the tide runs strong and by giving the moorings a trembling motion may chaif them therefore care should be taken to have them well served not only in the way of the hawse and cutwater but so far as to reach below the gripe for a ship moored water shot or at a single anchor with a windward tide when it blows so fresh that she ranges about and lies ahead of her anchor with a tight cable which may be hurt under the bows and gripe if not served low enough therefore it is certainly best to have the cables properly served ready for mooring as the time and place the ship is to lie in may require as our east india ships in the passage home when in a fine weather climate put the proper service on their mooring cables and in the coal trade to london they put on their cables what they call a long and short service to continue on for the summers work  the best service that i know to preserve a cable from chaising in a storm when the waves run high are such as are used in the coal trade to london it is cut from the best part of a tanned horse hide big enough to wrap two or three times round the cable which is readily and easily put on and taken off and much better than plats commonly used in merchant ships which is long and troublesome to pass and beat about the cable and after that is liable to become slack as the cable stretches and rubs backward and forward in the hawse and when the ship pitches hard it sometimes separates and makes openings between the parts of the plat so that the cable may be chaifed in these openings which a leather service is not subject to being all the length of the hide in one piece the method of putting it on the cable is first to wrap two or three fold of old canvass the length of the leather service which if too stiff to put on dry requires only dipping in water and beating it against any wood which makes it immediately soft and pliable then let as many hands as can come at it wrap it as tight as possible upon the old canvass round the cable tying it tight and smooth on with sinnit or three yarn nettles made for that purpose greasing them and the service very well before veering it into the hawse hole  i would advise to avoid a practice i have seen used on this occasion that is taking a timber hitch with some nettles round the cable upon the canvass then wrapping the leather service and the tles round the cable together which raises the leather in the place of those nettles where it will soon chaif through  how the weakest moorings may be best applied to help a ship to ride out a storm in a dangerous situation all practicable hints that may contribute any thing toward safety deserve notice and it may often happen that the small bwer cable may be too much wore or the small moorings known to be too weak to bear the strain of the ship to ride out a storm when the anchor at the best cable is in danger or expected to come home in this case i would recommend endeavoring to make the weak moorings serve for a backing to the best anchor and cable contriving a traveller as it may be properly called of sufficient rope to go slack round the best cable without the hawse and well secured with rolling hitches seized etc to the weak moorings that may be veered away or let go as occasion may requires or if short of rope to make a proper traveller a stopper may be put on without the hawse till the end of the small moorings is put round the best cable with overhand hitches like a garland and well seized open enough that it may slide along the best cable till it comes to the best anchor stock which may prove such a sure backing to it as to prevent its coming home so that by this means there is a much better chance to ride out a storm by the best cable singly than to run the risk of either anchor coming home to bring them both ahead together by which one cable is apt to get foul of the other anchor and to get so entangled as to make the anchors come home or cut that cable which is foul of the anchor if the ship has a pitching motion  since the last page was printed off i have heard of a long bowline knot being made use of on this occasion which i think is better than the overhand hitches mentioned for this purpose  but it must be allowed that this as well as all other uncommon methods requires judgment to contrive and resolution to put the design speedily in practice as the occasion and necessity may require to preserve the whole when safety depends upon riding out a storm  on unmooring a ship there needs little to be said on this subject if the ship lies in a clear roomy place as either anchor may then be taken up first by veering to it or weighed with a boat etc but if situated among a crowd of ships or near the shore then it requires to look about and consider well to take up that anchor first that gives the clearest birth to cast the ship or get her under way in the most advantageous manner clear of the dangers that may be near for want of conduct on such occasions i have known great damage done  it is observed in the address what was said by the celebrated doctor halley that the system of navigation in his time depended upon three ls lead latitude and lookout each of which deserve particular notice as safety in my opinion will always greatly depend upon them  on heaving the handlead this method of sounding the depth of water is peculiar to our seamen and i judge had its rise in the coasting and coal trade to london where their success and safety depend greatly upon it and which make them so dexterous by their great practice so that they will heave the lead far enough to reach the bottom and give true soundings in eleven or twelve fathom water when the ship may be going at the rate of four or five knots through the water and their rules are equal to their dexterity and which deserve mentioning and should in my opinion be followed as standard rules for the hand lead for want of which being properly used i have known many misfortunes and fatal losses which might have been avoided i have heard of a commander of a large ship in the above coal trade who in dangerous places always hove the lead himself and cunned or ordered the ship about according to the soundings which he sung or spoke out aloud as the other men  rules commonly observed by a good leadsman when first ordered to the lead he takes care that the inward end of the line is made fast to prevent loosing it  d that the lead and line may run clear and come fair to hand he takes them out before that shroud next to his foremost hand where he stands to heave  d the first cast of the lead he only heaves out about six or seven fathom of line which prevents the lead being over hove and readily makes known that the ship is not in immediate danger when no ground is found at that depth and it is an easy way to clear the line for a deeper cast the next heave if the occasion requires it  th when sounding in less than five fathom water or when there happens a sudden alteration of less water he heaves the lead as fast as possible and speaks out the sounding briskly with a loud voice and does not sing them out which takes so much time that i have known a ship to come aground before the sounding was made known  on singing out the soundings this custom is certainly a benefit to a fleet of ships sailing near together in difficult channels where safety depends upon the lead as in the coal trade to london where i suppose the practice began and finding the advantage of hearing each others soundings as a guide to the whole  another advantage attending this practice is where a commander is not well acquainted he may go of the deck and look at the soundings laid down in the chart or instructions for the place and hear the depth of water sung out at the same time to compare how they agree  but it must be allowed that there are risks attending this practice by the leadsman standing still all the time he is singing out the soundings for which reason the above  th rule for a good leadsman should be strictly observed to avoid the danger there mentioned to have happened whilst the leadsman was singing out the soundings with a long tone thus be thee mark three etc in which time the ship came aground which might have been avoided had the soundings been spoke out quick as above recommended this makes me think that it may be a disputed point whether the soundings may not be as well or better heard when spoke out quick with a loud voice than when they are slowly sung out if so the advantage must be greatly in favor of speaking out the soundings on all occasions  on sounding with the deepsea lead i would recommend what i have found from experience to be an advantage that is having this lead only fifteen pounds weight with a smaller line than common kept ready upon a reel made large enough for the purpose like a log reel and hung up in beckets where a man can readily take and hold it between his hands on any sudden occasion and that the lead may sink the faster to have small and few marks as the handlead and line will get soundings at any time in ten fathom water the deepsea line need only be marked from ten to seventeen fathom as common and from twenty upwards with knots as small as those in the logline  this lead requires various methods of heaving it according to the depth of water expected and the ships head or lee way at the time the lead is to be hove when a ship is sailing right an end without much lee way if soundings cannot be got by heaving it from the cat head or spritsail yard a man must carry the bight of the line to the jibboom end and with a tight line swing the lead forward when a man gives it all the force he can from the spritsail yard this method well managed will heave the lead the farthest it can be done to get soundings without bringing the ship to  to bring a ship too to sound the difficulty of getting true soundings in a gale of wind increases in proportion to the depth of water and the violence of the wind and waves the best method that i have experienced is to pass the lead from the weather quarter round the stern to leeward without all to the fore part of the quarter deck and a man to carry the bight of the line to the lee main yard arm which is to be laid square when the helm is put alee to bring the ship too and when the ship begins to shoot to windward by her head way then the lead is to be swung right to leeward from the deck whilst the man at the yard arm with a tight line swings it as far as possible to leeward of the ship which gains to windward of the lead whilst the head way continues and then runs her stern up to the wind by the sternway backs near to where the lead was hove by which means as mentioned in box hauling page    a great deal of line may be run out nearly up and down and the lead being armed with tallow makes it certain whether it has struck the bottom or no and if it has shows what sort of a bottom there is  when and how often it may be necessary to try for soundings must be left to the discretion of the commanding officer and will be more or less so according to the nature of the coast place or situation of the ship the want of it being done in due time is well known to have occasioned many fatal losses therefore they who neglect heaving the lead will always be blamed in proportion to the degree of danger and the loss the neglect may occasion  on the latitude the latitude when it can be got by a good observation with a good instrument must be allowed to be the only sure guide we have in navigation because it not only gives to a certainty the ships place north and south but it likewise helps us to form a judgment how far a dependence may be put on our reckoning east or west in proportion as the latitude by the account kept of the ships way agrees or disagrees with the latitude observed in the passage in general so more or less dependence accordingly may be put upon the longitude reckoned to be in  on the latitude of places being wrong laid down where people are strangers to places that they have not laid down from good authority in new charts or books of established good character but have them only in old books or general charts on a small scale where the latitudes may be very erroneous great caution should be used to avoid the ill consequences that may attend such errors when the ship may be drawing near to danger or in making a landfall etc  i was in a ship bound from lisbon to mazagan a portuguese garrison on the coast of south barbary with which in very fine weather and a fair wind falling in as we thought by the latitude observed we were in a fair way to find the place the latitude of which we had only laid down in an old general chart on a small scale being all of us strangers we traced the coast close along shore by day and laid the ship to at night thus we searched for the place so long in vain that we despaired of finding it therefore it was resolved to try if it was possible to turn the ship to windward against a lee current then running and go to gibralter to get a pilot to find the place when in our way back we found it was above a degree of latitude to the northward of where we had ever looked for it owing to its being wrong laid down in the chart and to our officers not getting every possible information concerning a place where we were not acquainted before proceeding on the voyage  at closing this subject i cannot help acknowledging that great service done to all seafaring men by mr hadley in the invention of his excellent quadrant for observing the latitude in so easy and certain a manner and which i can say from experience is most excellent when compared to our old instruments for that and the many other useful purposes it answers in taking angles horizontally in surveying and of the sun and moon or moon and stars toward finding the longitude and equal altitudes to find true time etc  on lookout a good look out may justly be said to contribute more than any thing toward safety not only from shores or shoals etc but from ships running on board each other at sea which no doubt often has and may prove fatal to all those who neglect it therefore the utmost care should be taken that this duty is not done in a careless manner and the transgressors should be punished  i was in a ship in company with a fleet of ships of war turning to windward in the night with a fresh breeze of wind when our mate of the watch as walking the weather side of the quarter deck was alarmed with hearing called out from another ship a good lookout before there and an answer made by several aye aye  the mate ran to leeward looked under the mainsail and saw a frigate on the other tack running right on board us her jibboom run within our lee mizen shrouds and tore them all away her sheet anchor fluke took our main chain plates tore them all away and plowed away the plank and timbers till it got clear through our ships side before one ship stopped the others way and were so locked and entangled together that had it been a ruff instead of a smooth sea as it happened to be one or both ships must have sunk before they could have been got clear of each other  this shows notwithstanding the strict discipline used on board our kings ships that this important duty is negligently done there as well as in other ships by careless men not considering how much depends upon their looking out when sculking or diverting themselves with stories upon the forecastle they without looking out at all will answer regularly to the word of command aye aye which occasioned the above misfortune for these reasons as long as the weather permits the lookers out stationed on deck should be made to walk each man by himself which will prevent them from being diverted or sleeping on this duty for it is well known that a man may stand and sleep but he cannot walk and sleep and to make this duty both easy and well done it should be taken spell and spell according to the number of the watch that can be trusted and as circumstances may require  the widest and clearest part of the ocean must be allowed to require a lookout for any two ships that are crossing each others track may meet and destroy both and the worse the weather the more occasion there must be for caution i was crossing the western ocean where we had a very narrow escape sailing with a gale of wind quartering under mainsail and foresail when the lookers out upon the forecastle seeing a light right ahead took it for and said one to the other it is a star for which it passed till we came so near before it was perceived to be a ship lying to with a light out that we only just got clear of her stern by putting our helm hard aport which just saved both ships from destruction  to prevent being deceived on this occasion i think it necessary here to remark that when any light appears in the horrizon or near the waters edge that it cannot be a star for the atmosphere or air so obscures the stars that they cannot be seen to rise or set in the horrizon when drawing near to any danger where safety may depend entirely on a good look out if the weather permits and the ship is manageable and will work under her topsails with the mainsail and foresail in the brales it gives a fair opening for the officer as well as others upon deck to look round them to see any dangers as may appear the little difference thus made in the ships sailing is not to be compared with the advantage given for safety or preventing damage on such occasions  on looking out for land it is found to be necessary in foreign voyages to propose a reward for the man that first sees and calls out land if it proves to be really such and if it be not such i think it is a bad custom to abuse him if he happens to give a false alarm by mistaking a cloud for land because it is well known that the land sometimes appears much like a cloud or a cloud much like land at a distance or the land may be covered by a cloud that often makes it difficult to distinguish one from the other for which reason a man should not be made a sufferer for a mistake of this kind but should be encouraged and have liberty to call out from the mast head that there is something like land appears this might prevent the bad consequences that sometime happen from people being afraid to speak in good time for fear of being mistaken and meeting with discouragement  on looking out aloft for shoals etc this duty well done may prevent a ship coming aground therefore the looker out at the mast head on this occasion should be encouraged and strongly recommended to make known without fear or reserve all alterations or different appearances of the water a seeming change of color should not be omitted though it may often proceed from the reflection of clouds yet it may prove shoal water and neglect may be fatal for which reason an officer should always take the trouble to go up to look at what is noticed from the mast head on all occasions and all riplings broken water or the appearing of an extraordinary smooth water when the sea is rough should all be strictly noticed as they may prove to be great dangers  for want of attending to this smoothness on the water from the mast heed i had a very narrow escape from running the ship on shore in turning to windward through the gulf of florida when standing toward the colleradoes with a design to make as bold with them as possible in order to make a longer stretch on the other tack i ordered the man at the mast head to look out sharp for broken water which we expected to see at a sufficient distance but instead of meeting with breakers we fell into an extraordinary smooth water all at once which was taken no notice of from the mast head we tacked the ship in a great hurry and had but four fathom water when the ship was got about and was but just clear of the ground  on seeing shoals in clear water from the masthead in those seas where the water is very clear and the weather fine frequently from the mast head may be seen shoals that the ship might touch upon and especially if the sun shines astern or is abaft the beam when the ship goes her course this enlightens and makes more visible the parts of the shoals toward the ship so that from the mast head i have had the experience of cunning a ship in the best of the deep clear of dangerous shoals through channels where we were not acquainted but a rough sea or the sun happening to shine ahead of the ship the way she is going hinders the sun shining ahead hinders shoals being seen that way the shoals being seen under water though it may be clear and smooth i had this last case confirmed by an instance in looking out for shoals called the silver keys or plate rocks lying off the n e part of hyspaniola the sun happened to shine ahead of the ship when a part of the shoals we had passed was seen astern from the quarter deck before any was seen from the mast head which made me hasten to the mast head very angry with the man looking out till i was convinced that he was not in fault for nothing could be seen under water ahead the way he was ordered to look out owing to the dark or shaded parts of the shoals being toward the ship and the water reflecting the suns rays upon the eyes of the looker out that prevented us seeing the dangers i ordered the helm aweather and brought the sun aft and cunned the ship out again clear of these shoals which we could see very plain with the sun astern they seemed to be coral rocks here and there one in a straggling manner with about four fathom water upon them that we had passed  on the longitude at sea by observation i venture sailor like to make some remarks on this fourth l the discovery of which has been long expected and is still laudably pursued and encouraged by all the learned nations of the world  the great rewards offered and the encouragement given by our government has occasioned many methods to be tried for this useful discovery of late a fair trial has been given to mr erwins marine chair to observe by jupiters moons at sea mr harrisons famous time piece which performed so well in the voyage of trial to the west indies as to gain l  0000 reward and now what is recommended and published by order of the board of longitude miers tables and maskalynes nautical almanac to observe and calculate by the sun moon and stars which i doubt will require too nice observations and too long calculations to be performed without errors by the generality of such seamen as at this time navigate ships at sea who will think it too difficult to come near true time of day or night on this uncertain element and every minute out in that makes an error of a quarter of a degree of longitude  except the longitude can be come at by a certain easy method it may do more harm than good among the vain positive part of men therefore without this much labored for discovery can be brought within the reach of common capacities and learning to perform with some certainty without being liable to many errors which every man is subject to in nice observations and long calculations among a multitude of figures it may be productive of effects contrary to the design especially by putting people off their guard and giving too much confidence to the vain and positive part of men who cannot bear to be thought wrong in their reckoning many instances i could give of this disposition but will only mention one who though he was steering an easterly course in the night and was told that land was seen ahead he replied that the devil must bring it there if there was any which he could not believe  the consequence of his obstinacy was the loss of a fine large ship and a rich cargo  the board of longitude in order to facilitate the discovery that is expected to be found by this last mentioned method has ordered that the masters for the royal navy must qualify themselves by learning to pass an examination to show that they understand the nautical almanac which is a task in my opinion that cannot reasonably be expected from many of our most hardy and expert navigators whose education has been mostly from early youth through the hard laborious and busy scenes of life at sea and have never had the opportunity to get the learning that is necessary to understand the true principles of this almanac  on this occasion with humble submission to the learned i speak for myself and many masters of ships who can conduct a ship to any part of the world that has its latitude and longitude right laid down without having learned so much astronomy at school as to understand the characters signs and terms etc that are used in those almanacks to describe our system or set of worlds with their moons and their motions round the sun which terms etc are in an unknown tongue to one who is but a mere english reader and our world and moon with their motions and places are there set forth in a complex mysterious manner telling us every day where the sun is in the ecliptic where no star is to be seen at that time which makes us so little acquainted with the fixed stars as to think that they and the sun according to the old notion go round us every day as they appear to do by our worlds daily motion and as it is from our knowledge of the fixed stars that lie near the moons path that the observations for this discovery are to be principally made and which shows the great necessity not only on this account but for many other benefits to seamen to have our suns system of worlds and the fixed stars more easily described to seamen for us to endeavor to get the course motion and place of our world and moon described and represented in such a plain manner that such navigators as are above mentioned may form some notion how we and the five other worlds called planets that belong to our system are constantly changing places each in their different orbits or paths and going faster or slower according to their distance round the sun once in their year in wonderful order from the fixed stars in one part of the firmament round to the same stars again according to the laws given them by the almighty creator and conductor of the universe as is illustrated and in a particular masterly manner shown in fergusons astronomy where the names of the twelve signs in the zodiac and the rest of the constellations are in english whereby the fixed stars are to be known but the most fruitful imagination cannot find the least resemblance to those figures they are commonly called by and which require a great while to learn so that notwithstanding the pains taken by this extraordinary selftaught philosopher to whom i acknowledge myself under the greatest obligations as what little i have learned in that science is from him yet i cannot help thinking that this ancient method of teaching the motions of our system is perplexing and is a burden to the memory for the reasons given above and that it might be much better and easier taught to seamen by the form of the chart of the mariners compass  it must be allowed that we excel the ancients greatly in shipping and in navigating them a compass chard ecliptic recommended instead of the twelve signs since time has discovered and brought into use that noble instrument the mariners compass by which a seaman knows how to steer a ship and to calculate the ships way he must understand how to quarter and divide this compass into the   0 degrees which extended out in straight lines from the suns center might represent the   0 degrees of the ecliptic in a much more familiar manner to seamen in general than the    signs therefore to answer the above good purpose i would recommend to those in power to get a set of large plates engraved such as are used now to stamp handkerchiefs with the first to represent our solar system as it really is with the sun in the center and its rays to form the sea compass chard with the   0 degrees extending outward through a large circle divided into the months and days of our year the north point pointing to the   st of december which may properly be called and understood to be the northermost part of the worlds orbit as we then enter into what is now the northermost constellation in the ecliptic called gemini which makes our shortest day when at the same time the south latitudes have their longest day the reasons for it and the other seasons of our year will appear evident by having our world delineated on the eight capital points of this compass ecliptic n n w w s w etc round the sun as mr ferguson has done in his  th plate of astronomy from which and a scheme he drew for me to make observations on the tides i formed this design of what i call the seamens system and had one drawn and put upon a wheel work planetarian to observe whether our neighboring worlds passing near us in their orbits had any influence on the tides but found none  thus by having our globe represented in different parts of her orbit which she moves in at the rate of near one of the   0 degrees of the ecliptic every day and in that time turns once round on the center of her daily motion which is at the poles that lie in a direction of    degrees inclinable toward the plane of her orbit and the year round always keeps pointing toward the same part of the starry firmament as is evident to any common observer who may see how our north pole always points toward what we call the north pole star that never goes below our horrizon in north latitudes by which and a little thinking it may be perceived in general how our nights and days with their alterations and the suns declination are brought yearly about by the sun always enlightening that half part of our globe that is turned directly toward it and as it is on the   st of december when our globe is on the north point of the ecliptic when i would have the year for this system to begin when the sun shines directly upon the south tropic its light reaches  0 degrees round on our globe takes in all the south polar circle where it is all day by its then pointing most toward the sun when it is all night in the north polar circle because it points most from the sun as represented in the figure on the north point of the ecliptic  but by comparing small things that can be seen often helps us to form an idea of what is too big for our senses to discern a bomb shell of    inches diameter forced into motion through our air may be seen by its fuse to keep turning round and round on its center of gravity as it moves forward so our globe in round numbers about  000 miles diameter insensible to us moves forward in her orbit as may be supposed at the rate of about  000 miles in every minute of time whilst it is known to keep regularly turning on the center of its poles a quarter of a degree of longitude which makes    degrees for every hour of time that brings about midday and midnight to all the different parts of our globe between the polar circles in    hours as they are represented by the    meridians in the figures which all center or cross each other at the poles divides our globe into the   0 degrees of longitude east and west as well as measures the   0 degrees of latitude north and south  the daily and yearly motions of our system of worlds how our system of worlds with their moons move round the sun  on our four seasons the winter quarter   with their moons round them are all one way that is from west southerly about to east and from east northerly about to west again what we seamen understand and call against the sun or its apparent motion as our globe is represented when it passes the north point of the ecliptic and goes through our winter n w quarter from n to w in its orbit which brings our north polar circle more and more out of the dark into the light and lessens the suns south declination every day till it comes to nothing on the  0th of march when we are upon the west point of the ecliptic and the center of our daily motion is then broadside to the sun which shines right upon our equal night line and reaches both poles that make equal day and night to all the inhabitable parts of our globe when the sun rises and sets on the true east and west points of the compass without variation and at the  th hour in the morning and evening of that day  we then enter into our spring and s w quarter of the ecliptic the spring quarter and move forward every day as above mentioned from the west to the south point of our orbit as may be seen by the scheme how our north latitude days lengthen and the suns north declination increases to    degrees on the   st of june when the sun shines right upon the north tropic and reaches over all our north polar circle which then points most toward the sun when the south polar circle points the most from it that it can do the year round as represented by the figure on the south point of the ecliptic  we next go through our summer s e quarter of our orbit the summer quarter from the south to the east point of the ecliptic on the   d of september when we are again broadside in the center of our daily motion to the sun which then shines directly upon our equal night line and reaches both poles that it rises and sets on the true east and west points of the compass and at the  th hour morning and evening the same as when we are on the west point of the ecliptic on the  0th of march  the harvest quarter to complete the year we go through our harvest or n e quarter of our orbit from the east to the north point of the ecliptic which every day brings the south pole more into the light for its half years day and the north pole goes as much into the dark for its half years night until the   st of december when we are upon the north point of the ecliptic again and the sun having its greatest south declination what occasions the half years day and night at the poles shines right upon the south tropic and enlightens all the south polar circle when the north polar circle is all in the dark owing to the south pole then pointing    degrees toward the sun when the north pole points as much from the sun which is then true south from us at noon by the compass as we are true north from it which may be perceived by the meridian pointing right to it at the beginning of the four seasons when we may see the sun and we bear true n and s e and w from each other by the compass and on the  0th of march when we are on the west point of the ecliptic the rising sun bears true east by the compass and on the   st of june when we are on the south point of the ecliptic our north pole then points    degrees toward the sun which from between the tropics is as it bears by the compass true north from us as may be observed by the noon meridian pointing straight to it and on the   st of september when we are on the east point of the ecliptic the setting sun then bears true west by the compass from us as we are true east from it and these four compass quarters of our orbit whereby our four seasons and quarters of the year are distinguished contain each  0 degrees which complete the   0 degrees of the compass ecliptic which drawn out to the extent of a large handkerchief will give room for all that is necessary to answer this purpose eight different places and faces of our moons and jupiter with his moons in miniature to be added to the scheme our moon with a different face in her orbit may be put to each figure of our globe and jupiters moons as mr ferguson has ingeniously done in his  th plate of astronomy might show how they may be observed going into and coming out of jupiters shadow from our different meridians in the different parts of our orbit and without saturns orbit may be placed the stars to the fourth magnitude of the    signs of the zodiac as the before mentioned necessary observations for the longitude are to be made  by this scheme and as the almanacks give the suns place every day at noon the almanacks to give our worlds place at midnight in the degrees of the compass ecliptic to show our worlds place at midnight in degrees of the compass ecliptic which in this scheme goes through the days of the month and which will point out very plain what stars of the ecliptic will be brought upon or nearest to the meridian every midnight in the year this would soon make us so acquainted with them as to know all the principal stars of the    signs many of which are always visible in clear nights where we navigate so that on many important occasions exclusive of the longitude to know them as they appear would be of the greatest service to seamen and more especially to the thinking part of navigators who never learned astronomy they may hereby form a notion how we are situated and move in our daily and yearly motions round the sun conjectured to be from us the distance of about a hundred million of miles among the other worlds that belong to our system and also how observations for the longitude may be made by jupiters moons as above mentioned to try to observe jupiters moons at sea with dollands improved spyglasses recommended to get the difference of time from greenwich as given in the almanacks allowing four minutes of time for every degree which will give the longitude in east or west and by comparing dollands improved spyingglass with the reflecting telescope i cannot help thinking that the weather may often permit these observations to be made at sea with dollands best glasses which certainly deserve a fair trial as it is well known some officers are by practice so expert with them that they can stand upon their sea legs as it is called and balance themselves in a surprising manner so as to counter act the ships waving motion when they are using the spying glass or taking observations so that by practice it is to be hoped these observations will become of great use at least in smooth water and as we pass jupiter in his orbit once nearly every year it should be noticed as represented in the scheme that when we are coming up with jupiter to observe his moons going into his shadow and when we have past him to observe them coming out of it and that their motion round him is the same as our moon round us against the sun from the right hand to the left  i would further recommend to those in power to have two large star spheres made public to have two more large plates engraved and made public with the west and east spheres of the fixed stars as represented on the best celestial globes the first plate to begin and continue the degrees of the equator and ecliptic according to the yearly course of our globe from our winter to our summer solstice and the second plate from our summer to our winter solstice again and to have the days of the year added to the degrees of the equator the meridians of which will point out our situation to know what principal stars will be visible and come upon or near the meridian every midnight in the year and to have them named marked or numbered so as to be better known to an english reader than the hard names and characters they now bear and as the equator crosses the ecliptic that extends to the opposite sides of the north and south tropicks and the poles of the ecliptic to the opposite sides of the polar circles in each of these spheres shows by inspection from the days of the month at the equator the declination of the stars that lie in the plain of the ecliptic the year round occasioned by the obliquity of our worlds motion to the plain of the ecliptic as before mentioned  these three schemes thus made public on handkerchiefs done by masterly hands in my opinion would induce the inquisitive part of seamen who are so much on duty upon deck in the night to employ their vacant time in comparing these representations and what has been said on the occasion to what may be observed and learned from the grand system of created nature the general laws given to our suns system of worlds to make them and the principal fixed stars more easily and generally known the east india trade best adapted for these improvements the east india trade is best adapted for these improvements because they run most of their great extent of longitude out and home in pretty high south latitudes which give them the favorable opportunity of seeing and observing all the stars as well as the planets as they appear to the southward a well as the northward of the ecliptic and can compare any trials or observations that may be made for the longitude with the variation of the compass the curve lines of which lie near north and south in their long track from the coast of brazil to india so that they correct their longitude by the variation of the compass which they find to great nicety very readily by their great practice in taking azimouths and amplitudes at all opportunities  on making passages from all that i have seen those seamen in the east india trade are the most perfect in the open seas and those in the coal trade to london the most perfect in difficult narrow channels and tide ways where they sail by the voyage which makes it their interest to be as dexterous and expeditious as possible in working and managing their ships which in general are   or  00 tons and which makes this trade the best nursery in the world for hardy active and expert seamen and as most ships must be conducted through channels or narrow waters in their way to sea i will endeavor to remark what i think deserves notice in making passages in this coal trade  on making passages in the coal trade in the navigation from newcastle to london two thirds of the way is amongst dangerous shoals and intricate channels as may be seen by the chart of the coast and the ships are as large as the sh channels will admit them to get through with the flow of the tide which requires to be known to a great exactness to proceed in proper time and dexterous pilots to navigate through those channels with safety and expedition to make so many voyages in the year that they may be gainers by their ships which are numerous as well as large and managed by the fewest men and in a more complete manner than in any other trade that i know of in the world considering the difficulty of the navigation and how deep the ships are loaded and how lightly they are balasted yet they meet with very few losses in proportion to the number of ships which the owners generally run the risque of and thereby save the expense of insurance by which means they can afford to freight their ships cheaper than others so that they are become the chief carriers in the timber iron hemp and flax trades  blowing weather and contrary winds often collect a great many of these colliers together so that they sail in great fleets striving with the utmost dexterity diligence and care against each other to got first to market with their coals or for their turn to load at new castle where at the first of a westerly wind after a long easterly one there are sometimes two or three hundred ships turning to windward in and sailing out of that harbor in one tide the sight of so many ships passing and crossing each other in so little time and room by their dexterous management is said to have made a traveling french gentleman of rank to hold up his hands and exclaim that it was there france wa conquered the entrance into the harbor being so very narrow with dangerous rocks on one side and a steep sand bank on the other with a hard shoal bar across where the waves of the sea frequently run very high and puts them under the necessity of being very brisk and dexterous  what is most worthy remarking here when they are going out with a fair wind in their great deep loaded ships to prevent striking drives rolling over the bar and the waves running high upon the bar that they would make the ship strike upon it if she was to sail out pitching against the head waves to prevent which when they come to the bar they in a very masterly manner bring the ship to and she drives over rolling broad side to waves which management preserves her from striking  a ship got to sea by diving stern foremost with the tide i have heard of a bold single adventurer getting to sea out of this harbor when many ships lay windbound with the wind and waves right in and right upon the shore without the harbor he having a small handy ship and no doubt materials and men that could be depended upon made every thing snug and ready as the occasion required and got as near the bar as she could ride with safety and had the sails that were designed to be carried furled with ropeyarns that would easily break he then took the advantage as may be supposed of the first of the ebb of a high strong spring tide when there was water enough and so drove over the bar stern foremost with the sails all furled and the yards braced sharp up as mentioned page    by the strength of the tide out of the harbor till they reached the sea tide from the southward along the coast then put the helm hard astarboard and brought the ship by the wind on the larboard tack and expeditiously set all the sails they could carry the tide checking the ship two points on the lee bow helped her to get to windward off the lee shore so that they made their course good along the coast and got their passage  when it happens that a great fleet of loaded ships sails out in one tide with the first of a westerly wind those that draw the least water take the advantage and get over the bar first to sea where they strive and carry all the sail possible to get and keep ahead of each other and the fastest sailing and best managed ships commonly get the advantage whilst they are in the open and clear part of the sea till they come to work out of yarmouth roads where for want of water the ships of the greatest draft are often obliged to stay far the flowing of the tide and each ship is glad to follow another that they know draws more water than themselves when going through dangerous channels what advantage they make of each other when sailing in fleets this collects many of them near together again for their mutual safety each heaves the lead and makes known aloud the soundings which often proves the principal guide to the whole fleet as by that they find and keep the best of the deep in the intricate channels they pass through and in which they often have a great deal of turning to windward against strong westerly winds when they are obliged to stop the lee tide they do it with the best bower anchor and cable to the better end which makes them so expert in heaving up their anchors and getting under way as well as working their ships to windward as particularly described page  0 and especially up the swin channel in such weather when they would not venture to proceed with a fair wind this seems a paradox to many people therefore it may be of service to explain their singular conduct on this occasion  when they turn to windward up the swin in dark hazey weather they know by their soundings when they are in a fair way why they choose  turning wind rather than a fair one for safety and what side of the channel they are on and by standing quite across the main channel from side to side avoid the danger of being hooked in on the wrong side of spits of sand into swatches where the tide runs through and where there is the same soundings at the entrance as in the right channel which is the reason that with a fair wind and hazey weather a compass course is not to be relied upon therefore each ship very artfully endeavors to get a leader that they know draws more water than themselves and the leading ship knowing their danger running no farther than they think is safe how they steer by one another in hazy weather commonly lets go her anchor the next following ship apprehending the same danger has their anchors ready and lets it go just above the first ship and the next steers close past these two ships and comes to an anchor just above them and so on with the next till the whole fleet forms a line one above the other so that the ship that was first becomes last when they commonly again heave up her anchor and steer close by the whole fleet if they are perceived to ride afloat and the next ship follows them and either comes to an anchor again above the uppermost ship as besofe or proceeds forward according as they find by the soundings by which they know that they have past the dangers they were afraid of and gets into a safe track where they can depend upon the compass course then they set and carry all the sail possible to get or keep ahead of each other  their management in working these large ships to windward their dexterous management in london river up most parts of london river with their mainsails set is likewise remarkable and from their great practice knowing the depth of water according to the time of tide and how much the ship will shoot ahead in stays they stand upon each tack to the greatest nicety close from side to side as far as possible things will admit of to keep in a fair way and where eddies occasion the true tide to run very narrow or ships etc lie in the way so as not to give room to turn to windward they very dexterously brail up mainsail and soresail and drives to windward with the tide under their topsails by such rules as has been described and in the pool where there is so little room to pass through such crowds of ships their management has afforded me the greatest pleasure and when they get near their designed birth to what a nicety they let go the anchor veers out the cable to run freely as the occasion may require so as to bring the ship up exactly in time in surprising little room clear of the other ships and lays her easily and fairly along side of the tier of ships where they moor so that as they say they can work and lay their ships to a boats length as occasion requires and there is no doubt but that to shorten the voyage by which the men are paid occasions this extraordinary industry and dexterous management every man for his own interest here exerts himself encouraging and striving to get before and excel each other in doing the necessary duty when it happens that the ships come aground they readily first carry out a catch anchor and towline and if that is difficient they haul out a bower anchor by it to heave the ship off in heaving up their anchors briskly with a windlass they greatly excel other merchant ships but the difference of men as well as things can only be known by comparison i had a ship in the merchants service that hove with nine handspikes double manned at the windlass to heave up the small bower anchor which we found so difficult and took up so much time that to avoid the risques we run in getting the ship under way in narrow waters i was going to have this anchor changed for a less till at london i happened to employ a mate and seven men from a collier ffr of  up an ancient to transport the ship to the graving dock at deptford when these seven men only hove up this anchor by two brisk motions for each square of the windlass in a quarter of the time that it used to be done by    men and this difference was entirely owing to their dexterity learned by great practice they rise with their handspikes and heave exactly all together with a regular brisk motion which unites their powers into one and they are equally brisk and clever in warping or transporting a ship with ropes and likewise in handing reefing and steering etc  on making passages in merchant ships if the ship in her way to sea requires a qualified pilot who is liable to be called to an account for any misfortune it is but reasonable that he should be obeyed and consulted by the ships officers and that they should see all things necessary both men and materials be ready to proceed in proper time otherwise the pilot may justly refuse to take charge of the ship for want of these necessary preparations i have known many bad accidents happen  these ships in general i can say from experience compared with the colliers just mentioned are under great disadvantages in the dexterity of their men to work and manage them in narrow channels and tideways their crews in common being a mixture of good and bad seamen and in heaving up their anchors with a windlass the efforts of the good men are lost among the bad who for want of practice or a willing mind do not keep time to heave altogether with the good men but heave in a lubberly manner one after another which occasions the great difference mentioned in heaving up that anchor which seven men performed much better than eighteen whose strength was so divided sailing by the month makes the lazy bad part of a ships crew more backward in doing their duty as being no way interested to expedite the voyage  if the channels are narrow with swatches joining them why two objects for leading marks should be endeavored after that occasion cross tides amongst shoals that are under water all possible pains should be taken to get two objects for leading marks that lie nearly in the same direction with the channel which are much better than any single mark buoy or beacon to which single mark a ship may be kept steming toward and may seem to go in a fair way to it yet by the tide or lee way may be carried insensibly out of the channel on shore by which i have known great loss and damage for want of being strictly noticed and guarded against by observing the true bearings of the compass or the lead and its stray line how the ship goes over the ground different to what she stems  going with the ebb tide makes it much more dangerous than proceeding with the flood and especially where there is a great flow of water which falls fast in proportion so that if the ship comes aground there is little chance of getting off again that tide therefore it requires the more care and caution and when it happens that you are obliged to proceed forward in the night if a boat can be sent to show a light where the buoys or dangers lie that you have to pass i can say from experience it may often prove a good method to keep clear of the ground  if it happens by the set of the ebb tide etc that the ship is found to be out of the proper channel upon a shoal and the wind so that you cannot shoot her off with the sails it should be immediately resolved what is best to be done whether the time of tide affords water to give the ship a chance to drive over the shoal or let go the anchor and endeavor to warp into the channel again this has been my case when i ordered the anchor to be let go and begun to warp but the tide fell so fast that the ship grounded upon the shoal and i perceived afterward she would have had water enough to have drove over the shoal if we had not let go the anchor  when a ship comes aground that is liable to take a great heald and may strain as the tide leaves her the topmast should be struck that they may come easily down while she continues upright and she should be eased from all tophamper or it should be laid as low down as possible and when she begins to take her heald the main and fore yards may be used for shores the lower yards may be used as shores on occasion being lashed to the chain plates scoppers etc by which not only their weight is taken off the ship but they may support her from straining and when necessity requires it the spare booms may be used for shores and to lash iron crows with the sharp end below the end of each shore may be a means to keep the lower ends fast to the ground  now we may suppose a ship got to sea clear of these dangers that required a pilot who has now left the ship to the management of the commander and proper officers and when the course that is to be steered is ordered the compass and coursets be looked after the compasses should be examined to see that they traverse freely and should be compared how they agree with each other both in and out of the binacle which should be cleared from all iron from about it and if the commander should be otherwise engaged a proper officer should be appointed to attend to the course steered and to the soundings of the lead if it is kept going to avoid what i have known of late and many other instances of ships being run on shore by course when the blame has been laid on the compass  whilst one officer takes the care of the ships course etc the other officers with the whole crew according to their stations should be properly employed in clearing and preparing the ship to contend with the turbulent waves of the sea to prevent and guard as much as possible port and hatches to be secured against the bad and fatal consequences which i have known to happen from shipping water before things have been properly secured that the people may be properly refreshed with sleep which nature demands to enable them to do the duty as it ought to be done as soon as things is got to rights to admit of it the watch should be chose and set  on choosing the watches the crew as far as they are known to be good and bad should be equally divided and they should be told by the commander that the safety ease and success of the whole depends chiefly on every one doing or getting the necessary duty done with watchfulness care and diligence according to their different stations which he is in duty bound strictly to look after and treat each of them as their merit or demerit deserves safety depends chiefly on the watch upon deck the watch upon deck have upon them the important charge not only of the safety of the ship and their own lives but the lives of the other watch and all that are below therefore any neglect of duty by the watch upon deck and especially in keeping a good look out should be resented by all the rest of the crew the watch below should lie down with such clothes on as to be ready to turn out directly when all hands are called which may be to save the whole from immediate destruction these declarations help greatly to reconcile the crew in general to that strict discipline which may be absolutely necessary to be established at the beginning of the voyage and especially when passing through dangerous narrow seas  the commanding officer of the watch in my opinion the officer on deck to use his judgment to avoid danger should not be put under that too common restriction of being obliged to wait for the approbation and orders of his captain when any unexpected great danger appears to be very near but it should be recommended to him to give such orders as in his judgment he may think the immediate necessity for safety require to avoid the nearest danger so as to give time to call on the captain to direct what is best to be afterward done  on shaping a course and navigating through dangerous narrow seas or straits where tides or currents run strong in seas where shoals lie interspersed at a distance from the land and where tides or currents run so strong as may greatly alter both the intended course and distance which has to my knowledge occasioned many fatal losses no pains should be spared in shaping the course to calculate how the intended course and distance is to be made good the tides or currents to be noticed for it is well known that a strong tide or current has the same effect upon a ships way at sea though it may not be so visible as in a river where it is plain to be seen for which reason the setting and strength of the tide or current as near as can be got should be reckoned in the calculation and set down in the log book as a course and distance in keeping the ships way the same as the log which ought to be hove and remarked every hour and this is not too often because in that time there may be great alterations in the ships way as well as the tide  for these reasons as well as on other important occasions every prudent diligent officer should endeavor to get all the helps he can come at from tide tables books charts etc to make himself as well acquainted as possible with the tides and should take all favorable opportunities to try and remark their ebbing and flowing setting and strength of the tides as well as of the currents that may be found in their track of navigation in order to form a judgment how to allow and reckon them as a course and distance in the account of the ships way as above recommended by this it will certainly help him to come much nearer the designed course and distance than if no notice was taken of them but the velocity of the tide varies with its height which will be mentioned from observations that cannot be ascertained by theory the uncertainty of practical navigation at sea and the many other unavoidable errors that occurs in practical navigation which makes it so uncertain and differ so much from the theory that makes the ships reckoning answer to the greatest nicety upon paper when in reality she is often sound at a great distance from what was expected  therefore as so little dependence is to be put in reckoning the ships way or place it should not be thought wonderful in the course of a long winters night that instead of stearing clear or falling in with a place as expected the ship is often found in another place or from being on one side of the channel she is found unexpectedly on the other which makes it absolutely necessary and especially in the night or thick weather to proceed with the utmost care and caution under such sail as the weather and situation will admit so as to make the ship easily managed care and caution and means used to avoid dangers when they appear a good look out being always properly kept whenever it happens that real danger unexpectedly appears let not perverse obstinancy take place so as to loose time in doubting and disputing but immediately use the best means to avoid the danger  the anchors and cables should be kept as ready as possible on these occasions to find out your situation if the place you have fallen in with cannot be known by the appearance it makes take the bearings and extending of it each way by the compass the depth of water etc and compare them with the chart of the place this is the readiest and most likely means to find where you are which may be of the utmost consequence in proceeding forward or retreating by this fresh departure being right for i have known many losses occasioned by taking one place for another  on turning to windward in narrow seas how far it may be right or wrong in bad weather to keep beating against contrary winds in dangerous narrow seas may be a disputed point and it must be left to the discretion of the prudent and discerning officer who will consider his risk wear and tear with all the advantages or disadvantages that may attend beating at sea and that if obliged to bear away for a road stead even there the wear and sometimes loss of the ground tackle must be considered and also that the ship is liable to drive or be drove on board of by other ships so that when a ship can be kept at sea with any prudent degree of safety though she cannot get but may loose ground yet the chance it gives of being in a fair way for a change of wind and that by its varying but a little it may give an opportunity of making slants to get round a point or head land or through the narrow seas into the clear open ocean by which bravery there has been many instances of ships making a voyage and one did so to the west indies and back again from liverpool whilst others were waiting there all that time for a fair wind  but in a tide way when the wind and weather and the navigation is such that admits a ship to stop tide this gives so great an advantage to gain ground to windward that it may be deemed wrong to lie waiting for a fair wind for it may be said that the ship not only gains all that the tide runs her to windward but it makes her hold a better wind to make her sail faster ahead than she would do with the same breeze of wind in still water consequently she makes less leeway so that in smooth water it may be reckoned that the ship gains about one third to windward of what she sails by the log as mentioned page    this added to what the tide runs may gain a great way to windward in a tides working when a ship comes to an anchor at slack tide remarks when stopping tide and the cable is veered out to ride by all the lee tide then heaving the lead and the log every hour after till the next slack tide will give a favorable opportunity to observe the setting and strength or velocity of it and what it ebbs or flows in every hour the whole tide also the time of each slack tide with the moons age and her distance from the earth if it can be got all which deserve to be particularly remarked in the journal  when the wind happens to blow so that the ship will lie up aslant upon one tack nearly to stem the lee tide then the best management is to stand on the other tack with the windward tide as far as the situation will admit with safety to get and keep to windward that may give the opportunity to stand upon the slant tack the whole leetide so as to loose little ground and save the risk of stopping the leetide by coming to an anchor  to sail in shore the first to the tide and off the latter part of it it deserves to be noticed that in narrow seas or wide channels where the tides run strong both flood and ebb they begin first to run in shore and run a great deal longer in the offing therefore the advantage should be taken to stand as close in shore as safety will permit at the first making of the windward tide and stand to the offing the latter part of it by which management our coasting ships being well acquainted often beat through the kings channel against fresh contrary winds that keep other ships windbound  on taking a departure from the land now let it be supposed that a ship has got far enough to sea to take her departure from the land and is going to be navigated in the open ocean the departure should if possible be taken from some remarkable head land or place that has its latitude and longitude ell laid down in your books and charts and if it  in a fair way for a landfall homeward bound the more pain should be taken to get an observation with all the quadrants on board well adjusted according to rule and to examine how they agree with each other and how they answer to the bearing and distance of the land of departure in sight as laid down and a rough sketch of the appearance it makes should be taken and also the soundings at the same time if they are a guide to the coast all which should be fully remarked in the journals not only for the reckoning outward but for safety in making a good landfall homeward which depends much more on your own observations and remarks than what can be found in any books or charts  difference between the theory and practice of navigation after the dpa from the land is taken then begins what we call the art of navigation which by mathematical rules gives the true  and distance from one place of port to another only by their latitudes and longitudes being given to reduce the various traverses a ship often makes in twentyfour hours into one course and distance and find the latitude and longitude the ship is in by account every day at noon which by theory can be made to answer to the greatest nicety so that a learner at school can keep a reckoning of a long run and make the designed landfall agree to a mile with his account of the ships way but in practice it is found from experience that it cannot be done to be solely relied upon even by seamen of the greatest capacites whose chief dependence as before noticed must be therefore on lead latitude and a good look out  the difference between the theory and practice of navigation arises from defects in the methods and instruments which we are in steering and in the measuring and marking down the ships way and also in not making proper allowances for bad steering lee way ships drift or bearing away from the true course in squales variation of the compass and tides or currents all which cannot be brought exactly to a regular account but are liable to errors which depend much upon mens different judgments in correcting them therefore each of these articles deserve to be particularly noticed as they occasion not only the above difference but the difference of one ships reckoning to another on the same passage and also one mans reckoning to another in the same ship  on steering in general the difference between good and bad steering is of such consequence to navigation that it deserves particular regard because good steering not only gives nearly the true course as steered by the compass but the ship sails much faster and farther in the same time and with much more case both to the helms man and the ship in a gale of wind with turbulent waves for whatever a ship goes from her straight course the shortens her distance so much and requires more helm which works and makes both ship and helms man very uneasy and when carrying a pressing sail there is great danger of the ship being broached to which may prove fatal to the whole therefore all hints or helps and every thing that good steering depends upon should be made as easy and plain as possible for the helms man in a dark night when he has nothing but the compass to steer by on the goodness of which he entirely depends therefore this most noble instrument should be first spoken of  on ships compasses where there is so many lives and so much property depending on good compasses i have been surprised and vexed to hear some people begrudge the price of dr knights improved steering and azimuth compasses which i thought when i bought one of each not only deserved the price but the inventor the thanks of the public as a trading nation and a maritime power for so great an improvement in that important instrument the needle which governs the chard in this is a strong artificial magnet of itself and having an agit socket traverses upon a polished steel center pin that the ships head cannot move the least degree to one side or the other but these compasses instantaneously show the motion by which much better and safer steerage may be made than with our common campasses which are made very slight and imperfect with needles that contain very little magnetic power and have only rough soft brass sockets and center pins which soon blunts and are liable to be out of order so as to prevent the chard from traversing freely a ship may move a great way from her course before it can be perceived by a bad compass which may occasion dangerous steerage in spite of the best helms man therefore the best of compasses should always be allowed as the difference between good and bad will be but a little in the expense of a ships outfit  on the steering wheel the great advantages experienced from steering a ship with this excellent machine has occasioned it to become more and more in use even small ships that have their tillers upon deck frequently now steer with a wheel which gives the helmsman an additional power to command and move the helm at pleasure from side to side whilst he stands firm on one spot that he may keep his eyes fixed on any mark ahead or on the compass and observe to a great nicety the ships motions or tendency to go from her course so that she may be steered steadier and confined nearer to her true course by the wheel than by the tiller which the helmsman must go along with from side to side as the ship requires that he cannot discern her motions so nicely nor has he equal power to move the helm as occasion requires  as the advantages of the wheel are so great they deserve the more pains taken to have them made as perfect as possible the barrel of the wheel should be exactly proportioned to the size of the ship that either three or five turns of the wheel rope may be just long enough so as to lose neither power nor time in moving the helm three points of the compass each way from the direction of the keel as mentioned in page    and as most of our wheels have eight spokes to have the spokes of the wheel marked and some large ships have nine or ten the handle part of each spoke should be marked so as they may be distinctly known by feeling as they pass through the helmsmans hands the midship spoke where the wheel rope is nailed marked with a rope yarn as in common and the three or four spokes on each side i ii iii or iiii notches cut with a knife suppose on the foreside of the wheel on the starboard side and on the after side of the wheel on the larboard side the half turn spoke if there is one to be plain without any mark by which marks it may be readily known where or how far the helm is on either side though the tiller is below out of sight this gives the helmsman the liberty to use his eyes entirely in observing the ships motions to steer her to the greatest advantage  on steering a course it is certainly the duty of the officer of the watch to use his utmost endeavors to get the ship steered as near the course that is ordered as possible and when the ship is perceived to be going exactly her course by the compass the helmsman should be advised to look and find a mark ahead that will not alter fast to steer by and only to look at the compass now and then as occasion may require to observe whether the mark alters so as to make it necessary to find out another that will answer nearer to the course for it is well known that a learner will steer a ship to a greater nicety by a mark ahead than a good helmsman can do without a mark by the compass  difference between good and bad helmsmen a good helmsman when a ship is difficult to be steered at taking the helm he first observes how it lies then looks with a sharp eye which way the ship is inclined to go from her course and moves the helm with a brisk motion far enough to stop her that way and feels by the stress upon the rudder ceasing which feel ought always to be noticed as well as any alteration to the eye when it is a proper time to ease the helm to prevent her from going on the other side of her course for a ship is no sooner stopped by the helm from going to one hand than she will be inclinable to go to the other hand if the helm is let lie in that place therefore he keeps moving the helm with a brisk motion as far as is found necessary to confine her to the course and by feeling the marked spokes of the wheel as they come into his hands soon perceives how much helm and how far she requires it each way to command and steer her steadily along with the least helm and trouble to himself  a bad helmsman instead of endeavoring to confine the ship to her course by moving the helm each way as abovementioned commonly lets the helm lie until he sees the ship is got on one side of her course then moves it so far as to bring her to her course again before he offers to stop or meet her with it and then she gets on the other side of her course so as to require a great deal of helm both ways by that the ship is steered but little right forward but kept yawing about from one side of her course to the other which shortens the distance gone and makes both course and distance very uncertain and works the bad helmsman as he works the ship from side to side which makes both very uneasy and if the waves run high when carrying a pressing sail large by bad steering there is great danger of broaching the ship to therefore none but the best helmsmen should be permitted to steer at such times  on suiting a ship with sail that she may be well steered when it is difficult to steer a ship her officers should take care that her sails are kept properly trimmed and that she is not over pressed with sail and especially after sail which may make her so ungovernable as to put it out of the power of the best helmsman to steer her with all the helm that can be given her therefore the helmsman should always be told to acquaint the officer of the watch when the ship gripes so hard that the helm hard a weather or hard over each way will not command her that the sails may be better trimmed or after sail taken in or more head sail set as the occasion may require  on steering upon a wind in the open ocean in a variable winds way when a ship has got sea room clear of the land i have thought it a wrong practice to steer upon a wind by the vanes and sails just touching full which seldom gives a direct course but varies as the ship comes to and falls off which makes both course and distance the more uncertain therefore a course should be ordered to a point or half a point of the compass as the wind will admit to steer the ship with a full sail and only look at the vanes to see if the wind alters that the course may be altered accordingly by this means a truer course as well as distance and more distance may be got especially if the ship lies a slant toward her true course which makes it the more necessary as the ship will sail the faster and make less leeway and this last should be well considered because the ships real course by the compass depends much upon making a proper allowance for her leeway  on making allowance for leeway this in a most inconsistent manner is generally left for    hours to the judgment and memories of the different navigators who probably are below asleep or their attention taken up with other things great part of the time this therefore must make the allowance for leeway very uncertain as it is liable to vary and be more or less every hour as the wind happens to vary blow less or more or the waves run higher or lower more ahead or astern of the ship and as she has been steered upon a wind though under the same sail and differs greatly from any school boys rules that can be proposed of allowing more or less leeway according to the sail a ship can carry for it is well known that two ships may be in company with equal sail set when one by her construction and trim may not make half so much leeway as the other  this defective and uncertain manner of making allowance for leeway in my opinion is one of the principal causes and reasons that can be given why the reckonings in the same ship should differ so much from each other when the courses and distances that the ships way is reckoned from are all taken from the same logbook which if no mistake be in the calculations should make them all nearly agree  what in my opinion would contribute greatly to lessen this defective part of navigation is to have a quarter of a circle of sheet lead divided so as to make the eight points of the compass nailed upon each quarter with one side parallel to the keel and the other to the beam as they have in most capital ships by which the ships wake or drift that she goes to leeward of what she stems by the compass may be set to a sufficient nicety upon both tacks by the officer of the watch who should make the allowance and set down the real course or drift made by the compass every hour which by this means will certainly come much nearer the true course than when left without any rule to different peoples memories and judgment as abovementioned  to have   quarter circles pointing to each quarter and bow here i think it proper to remark as these quarter circles of lead are commonly made and cut from a whole circle about six inches diameter with the thirty two points of the compass scratched out in straight lines from the center the other two quarters should be nailed on each side of the baracado or fore part of the quarter deck pointing on each bow before the beam as those abaft points abaft the beam so that any objects such as ships points of land shoals buoys or beacons may be readily set by these quarter circles to know how far they are before or abaft the beam and by observing how the ship stems by the compass at the same time the bearing and alteration of bearings may be easily and readily taken which i can say from experience will often prove of great service  on measuring a ships way at sea the many errors that are known to attend the log has occasioned many laudable attempts to bring in to practice more certain methods to ascertain a ships way through the water the most promising methods that i have met with were smeatons and burdets sea way measurers i had a trial of smeatons in a voyage to leghorn which seemed to answer much better than the log whilst the ship went less than six miles an hour but when she exceeded that rate the friction increased that hindered the first mover of the wheel work turning round proportionally free as the ship went faster which mr smeaton said he could easily do if he could find suitable encouragement and mr burdets contrivance seems to me a further improvement which i think deserves more trials and encouragement from those in power  on measuring a ships way by the log this method defective as it is must be made the most off till a better is brought into practice  the learned have with much seeming reason recommended to us to have our loglines marked  0 feet to a knot and the glass to measure  0 seconds of time which are exactly   0th part of a geographical mile and of an hour and must be allowed to agree better with exact calculation than our common practice of having but    feet of line to a glass of    seconds of time which line is four feet eight inches or about a ninth part short of the above proportions yet in our practice this is found from long experience to measure very well a geographical or sea mile of  0 to a degree which mile in my opinion should become general and be used in the scale of all our sea maps instead of our english statute mile which is about a  th part less by which difference the unlearned may be deceived  common practice can only be proved to be right by frequent fair trials i was mate of a ship in the jamaica trade from london outward bound and we marked the logline seven fathom to a knot to a    second glass as usual till we were disappointed of seeing our expected landfall according to our reckonings our commander then asked how we had marked the logline he was answered seven fathom to a knot he then ordered the line immediately to be new marked eight fathom to a knot and said that the ship was one eighth part short of her longitude by the line being marked seven fathoms instead of eight to a knot and so it proved for we made the land as he said but in our passage home by this rule we found the ship a great deal above an eighth part of the longitude ahead of all our reckonings which nearly proved of fatal consequence as we were carrying all the sail possible with a westerly gail of wind and hazy weather when we luckily perceived by the color of the water that we must be in soundings and it proved so and found ourselves far up the kings channel in a fair way and we had escaped a great risk of running the ship on shore unexpectedly with all sails set this convinced me that it was not the fault of the logline being marked seven fathom but another cause that may be mentioned hereafter and that is known always to have this effect upon ships in their voyages to and from the west indies so as to make more difference of longitude out than they do home  proportions for the line and glass the proportion of seven fathom of line to a glass of    seconds being right is confirmed by the general practice in the east india trade as well as all other trades that i have been in my opinion is that it will stand the test of any fair trial in a voyage to leghorn the ingenious mr smeaton sent with me for trial his abovementioned seaway measurer and some other now marine instruments which made me take extraordinary pains to have our log kept nicely marked as above and to be hove regularly every hour in order to find out by experience how many turns of this way measurer answered to a mile to fix this to a greater certainty i took an opportunity that then offered and steered to the westward till we could steer cross the bay of biscay and aong the coast of portugal as near upon the true meridian to the southward as possible where we reckoned there was neither tide nor current to effect a ships way and had the favorable opportunity of fair wind and weather to compare our distance run by the log to what was made by good observations for several days and i sound that they nearly agreed which i think makes it evident that these proportions for the log answer very well if properly attended to and therefore cannot be the cause which occasions bad reckonings and if it is an error it must be allowed to be on the best and safest side that the reckoning should be rather ahead than astern of the ship to put people upon their guard in proper time to prevent the fatal consequence that may attend an unexpected landfall  the readiest and surest way to mark and try the logline is to mark the ne and try the glass to have the whole length of the half knot    feet measured and marked straight along the deck and to have the knots put into the line so as they may be easily shifted backwards or forwards as the stretching and shrinking of the line often requires but before this is done the half minute glass should be tried whether it runs exactly    seconds that if it is found to run more or less the line should be marked longer or shorter according to these porportions as    gives    what will a second or two more or less give and this may be done sufficiently near by the scale and compass and the glasses may be tried by a musket ball fastened to a thread held steady in one hand between the finger and thumb exactly    inches from the ball which must be swung by the other hand and continued swinging more than thirty times by which i have found from frequent experience each swing then measured a second of time sufficiently near for this purpose even when the ship had some motion from the waves but the best instrument for this purpose as well as many other useful and curious purposes at sea is a good watch or time keeper that shows seconds which will answer equally well in a storm when the waves run high as in smooth water therefore every officer that has the charge of navigating a ship should have one of the best he can afford to buy  it is a sufficient trial for the quarter minute glass if it runs cut exactly twice for the half minute glass once but after all ones care in finding out exact proportions by which to get the true distance run the whole depends chiefly on those who heave the log and hold the glass neither of which should be done by careless people especially when the ship sails so fast as to require to use the quarter minute glass which will double all errors therefore this glass should be as seldom used as possible  the learned as before mentioned have very justly recommended to have the line that is run out above the knots set down in thoms of   feet each being the tenth part of their  0 feet knots the same exact rule may be easily used only by having a measure of four feet two inches and a half marked on the rail on each quarter where the log is hove that will measure tenths of a mile from our    feet knots which must be allowed will come much nearer the true distance and agree much better to the tenths of miles in the traverse tables than that old and bad practice of setting down nothing less than the half knots or that more exact method of marking down to fathoms of six feet and these tenths of a knot above or under the knot or half knot might be very easily measured by the officer that heaves the log  but after all the exactest rules the most effectual method in my opinion to try what dependence can be put upon the log and those that heave it is that i have before mentioned if opportunity permits clear of tides or currents after a good observation had for the latitude that is to allow for the variation and steer due north or south till a second observation if it can be done in a favorable time which will give the truest real distance that can be got at sea to compare with the log  on heaving and marking down the log only once in two hours it surprises me to find this old bad practice still continued in many capital merchant ships because it makes the unavoidable errors in getting the true course and distance not only greater but doubles them in working the days work and marks down not nearer than half knots of the odd line which must still increase the errors of the distance for if we suppose two fathom of odd line is omitted to be set down every time the log is hove this makes a difference of near seven miles in the    hours  this practice lies under another great disadvantage which is that of not affording sufficient room to set down and explain the necessary remarks and occurrences that often happen in the twentyfour hours  on heaving and marking down the log every hour this practice compared with that above has many advantages attending it those unavoidable errors arising from the wind and weather varying and the ship sailing faster or slower than when the log is hove must be lessened one half and the odd line that is run out marked down in fathoms or tenths of a knot every hour must certainly come much nearer the true course and distance than the above old method  but it must be allowed that they who have been accustomed to the old method may be a little perplexed in working the days work and reckoning those odd fathoms or tenths of a knot that is left over above the miles the ship has gone on any one course and which is under no fixed rule but when they amount to above half a knot let them allow a mile and when under half a knot omit them as fractions to be left as many other material things must be to the judgment and industry of the navigator on which depends chiefly all comparative good reckonings  as to the difference of trouble in this method it should not be mentioned if it is allowed to contribute to lessen the defects of navigation which it certainly does and therefore should become general i will then take the liberty to show in a days work my manner of keeping a ships way at sea which i learned first in the east india trade so that they who have been used to the other method may compare and judge for themselves  ship liverpool through st

longitude she is reckoned to be in at noon which will prove much better for many reasons than that method of seting down the difference of longitude to avoid exposing how much the longitude reckoned to be in may be wrong which by the by can be no disgrace to a man when he does his best it is likewise necessary to draw the track of each day from one latitude and longitude to the other with a black lead pencil on the general chart to compare the ships situation with the nearest land or shoals to prevent as much as possible being surprised by unexpected dangers  on a ship when in the open ocean after a good look out as mentioned in page    the principal dangers now to contend with are violent winds and waves for which the ship should be prepared and every thing secured and made as snug as possible according to the weather that may be expected and as the length of the run may require the cables may be unbent the hause holes plugged up if they lie low and the bower anchors stowed somewhere within board which is not only a great ease to a ship but may make her sail faster as mentioned in page    and may prevent the foot of the foresail from chafing against the upper arms of the stocks and the lower arms from plunging in the water which may affect both the ships way and the steerage all tophamper that is now unnecessary aloft should be got down and stowed below such as top ropes top blocks mauls runners and tackles that can be spared which may ease the masts and prevent a great deal of chafing amongst the rigging  on turning to windward in the open ocean in variable winds when a ship will sail aslant stemming near her intended course it is natural to stand upon that tack as long as circumstances will admit because the wind may vary to make a slant on the other tack by which a ship may be got slanting forward on her way then it may be worth while to carry a pressing sail if it blows fresh and steer by the compass a little from the wind as recommended in page  0  which may contribute greatly to shorten a passage  but when the wind blows strong and the waves run high near to the point of the intended course that nothing of a slant can be made on either tack then it may be deemed very wrong to press and strain a ship with any more sail than to make her rise and fall easy with the waves for a little time with a favorable wind will fetch up what may be lost by taking in sail in good time to give ease to the ship masts and rigging etc  on taking in sails to save them and give ease to a ship sailing upon a wind in a storm on these occasions the climate season of the year frequency of the wind blowing strong in one quarter and the appearance of the good or bad weather that may be then expected with all other circumstances of the ship men and materials should be considered to form a judgment how to act when it comes to blow so fresh that the topsails cannot be carried without being eesed and then if the topgallant yards are up whether it may not be necessary to get them down and strike the topgallant masts if they go abaft the topmasts as mentioned in page    and especially if it is at the beginning of a long winters night in which time both wind and waves may be increased to a violent degree before morning and which may make the ship pitch roll and labor so as greatly to strain every thing and make it dangerous for the people to got them down at such times and if the wind and weather should prove favorable they may be easily got up again in the morning and by this practice at the first of the voyage in smooth water the people will learn to be expert in getting them down or up as occasion may require  as the wind and waves increase a fast sailing ship upon a wind when pressed with sail especially head sail will be plunged deep into the sea so as to increase her pitching motion to a dangerous degree this i have experienced in chasing upon a wind when both the pumps and bailling at three hatchways could not keep the ship free from water till the chase bore away before the wind by which movement she soon became our prize for we could not have chased her much longer upon a wind owing to the sharpness and weakness of our ships bows as mentioned in page thirteen  let us now suppose a ship brought to her close reefed topsails the top gallant yards and masts down and every thing made snug according to the appearance of such wind and weather as may be expected i have been at getting the spritsail yard and jib boom in upon deck to beat against westerly storms and it is certainly a help and gives great ease to a ship on such occasions let us also suppose the gale to increase so that the topsails must be taken in in doing of which they are very liable to be split and blown to pieces if proper management is not used to preserve them  on taking in topsails upon a wind when it blows strong the best method is first to station the people to advantage according to their strength and the dependence that may be put on them man well and haul tight the lee clew and bunt lines then let go the bowline and lee brace man the weather brace and when all is ready let fly the leesheet and brace the sail aback to the weather shrouds whilst clewing up which will keep it quiet from flapping till it is handed  on taking in the courses upon a wind in a storm when the mainsail or foresail is to be either reefed or handed it is certainly the best method for the safety and ease of the men the sail and the ship first to lower down the yard keeping it level with the lee lift to prevent the lee yardarm from plunging into the sea and if but weakly manned haul up the weather clew garnet first with the sail full then station the people to the best advantage as abovementioned let go the weather bowline and lee brace that as soon as the lee sheet is let fly the sail may be braced aback to keep it from flapping that it may be hauled up with safety at more leisure and the yard being down must contribute greatly to prevent those fatal accidents that have often happened from a weight of men reefing or handing these sails with the yards aloft when the ship may be laboring with such violent and quick motions that it may be difficult for men to hold themselves fast and the yard being down gives equal advantage in setting the sails again after being reefed etc for the tacks may be safer and easier got down and the sheets hauled close aft and the yards swayed up afterward  on brailing up the mizen even this requires management at times when the only method to still the sail and prevent its flapping that it may be furled easily is to man well and haul upon the lee brails only and only take in the slack of the weather brails till the lee ones are lose up for if the weather brails are too much hauld upon it will till the sail so full of wind as to prevent its being furled  on taking in the fore main or mizen staysails these only require to be hauled briskly down that they may be uried or stowed away  on taking in the topsails mainsail or foresail when sailing large or before the wind in a storm when the wind is on either quarter the lee sheet should be first clewed up then the yard pointed to the wind and the buntlines etc ed as much as possible before the weathersheet is let go if the sail cannot be backed the wind blowing nearly along the yard will preserve the sail greatly from flapping so as it would do if the yard is let lie square to the wind  when the wind is right aft one sheet should be clewed up first then with the brace on the other side the yard should be braced as sharp up as possible haul up the bunt and leach lines as much as they can be before the other sheet is let go and if to save the sail it be required and things will admit that the ship could be steered with the yard pointing to the wind for a little while it may contribute greatly to save and get the sail secured  but on all such occasions as these and especially in the night when the word of command cannot be heard nor can the people see or be seen by their officers so as to be directed by any means to get the duty done as it ought to be the only method is to muster the people altogether first and make known what and how the thing is intended to be done and station them accordingly that none may plead ignorance in excuse for any mismanagement that may happen  on taking in the foresail at the time of waring when a ship will not bear to carry her courses it is certainly the best practice first to secure and hand the mainsail as the foresail may be carried a great deal longer and with the mizen main and staysails a ship may be steered close to the wind so as to make her tolerably easy and lively in the sea and especially when beating to windward in narrow seas these are the most suitable sails a ship can be under at such times because she may be the easier and readier wared and when the storm increases that the ship will not bear to carry the foresail it may be taken in with great advantage in the time of waring by the abovementioned rules after the people are got together and the intended method of proceeding made known to them all as soon as the ship is perceived to begin to ware the yard being kept braced sharp up the tack and bowle may be let go and the weatherclew garnet hauled up and when the ship is near before the wind the bunt and leach lines and the other clew garnet may be hauled up and if the situation admits and the occasion requires it the ship may be  with the wind on the quarter till the sail is secured  on laying a ship to in a storm this is intended as much as possible to preserve a ship from the dangerous effects of violent wind and waves by endeavoring to steady her from laboring and make her rise and fall with the waves as lively and easy in the sea as possible and the best method for doing this i can recommend from long experience is for the ship to be under her lowerstaysails with the mizen reefed and balanced etc and the yards braced full as represented in plate   fig   and not by the common method of laying a ship to under a reefed or a whole mainsail with the foresail aback in the brails as represented in figure   of the same plate  on lying to under a mainsail with the foresail aback in the brails that this method is far from being the best to answer the abovementioned purposes may be proved from reason as well as experience for a ship laid to in this manner with some sails full and some aback and the helm made fast alee as customary instead of keeping her bow to the wind and waves which only can keep her easy in the sea she will be constantly coming to the wind so as to shake the weather leach of the mainsail by her headway the foresail being a back and the power of the waves so much ahead soon give the ship great sternway and the helm being alee as beforementioned makes her fall round off four or five points from the wind which causes the ship to labor and strain in proportion as she comes to and falls off from the wind and also exposes those flat and weakest parts the counter stern quarter and broadside to bear the shock of a violent and dangerous sea that sometimes breaks in and does great damage and the mainsail is often split at such times as well as by the power of the wind and the quickness of the ships rolling motion from the ascending to the dscending side of a high wave acts with more or less force in proportion to the bigness of the sails to split them  facts from experience are the only confirmation of a practice being right or wrong i was in one of our east india ships bound home late in the season was five weeks beating round the cape of good hope against westerly storms when to preserve and keep the ship from rolling too much we often laid her to under a whole mainsail with the foresail aback in the brails as represented figure   plate the  th when the abovementioned bad custom split our mainsails faster than we could repair them till we had none to bring to the yard but were obliged to wait till they were mended and they split again in less time than was taken up in mending them during which time we commonly laid to under the mizen when for want of a little more sail to steady her amongst the waves she became more exposed to those dangers abovementioned laboring with a more quick jerking and deeper rlling motion in the sea and we found the want of the mainsail which is the most material sail upon a wind to take the advantage at such times when the wind varied so as to make slants by which only we got round the cape after the time that is said to be limited by the company to prevent damage to their ships and cargoes  on a ship under lower staysails and mizen in a storm for the reasons now mentioned after long experience my practice has been instead of laying the ship to in this manner first to secure and hand the mainsail and if the gale increased i handed the foresail reefed and balanced the mizen the mizen main fore and foretopmast staysails kept set as we might have done with the abovementioned ship or such another as is represented figure   in the same plate were both methods may be seen in order to make a fair comparison of the two from practicable facts  on the advantages of a ship being kept under lower staysails and mizen instead of lying to in a storm from what has been said it may with justice be concluded that a ship laid to with the helm alee must be constantly coming to and falling off from the wind more or less in proportion to her head and sternway so that when a ship is laid to in a storm a represented figure   plate the  th that the power of high waves are added to the wind she must naturally run up too near the wind by her headway and then both wind and waves unite to give her sternway which makes her fall round off and throws her stern up against the wind and waves which then act very powerfully against those tender parts till she gets head way again and makes the ship uneasy and labor some to a dangerous degree as abovementioned to avoid which i strongly recommend to keep the ship under way as it may be called with the lower staysails with the reefed and balanced mizen set and the yards braced sharp full as representen by figure   plate the  th which will certainly contribute greatly toward producing the following advantages  by this method a ship may be kept with so much headway upon her as to be under the command of the helm to steer her nearly to a course six points from the wind which ought by all means to be endeavored after to keep her bow that bold and strongest part pointing to the waves where they can do her the least damage and makes the ship at the same time much easier and livelier in the sea than being laid to as abovementioned and these small sails are handy and strong compared with the mainsail being commonly made of equally strong canvass and proportionably less liable to be split either by the wind or waves and can be set or taken in easily with safety and stand so flat and fairly divided from the bowsprit end to the stern that tend greatly to steady the ship as well as ease all the masts yards and rigging from jerking and chafing in her rolling and preserve the mainsail and foresail the two most material sails that are to be depended upon on some extraordinary occasion that may require their being set and carried upon a wind in bad weather  for these reasons where ships do not wear and use a main and fore staysail in common i would recommend to have them as ready to be bnt and set as possible on these occasions having hanks upon the stays and gro upon the sails for this purpose  on bearing away in a storm to scud before the wind and waves when the waves run high and sudden necessity requires to bear away it should be considered that the low headsails which the ship may be wared under when she comes before the wind may be becalmed by the height of the waves which may break violently against the stern and fill the deck with water but that loftier sails being set would give the ship more way through the water  i had an instance of this in a cruising ship under low sails upon a wind in a storm when the ship and all things forward gave way so much that obliged us to bear away before the wind and the low sails we had wared under were becalmed by the height of the waves when the ship was in the hollow part of the sea they came running against the stern with great violence and filled the deck with water which frightend the people so that several of them called out with tears in their eyes that the ship would founder we got the close reefed maintopsail set which had the designed good effect to catch the wind and always kept drawing full above the waves this increased the ships way so much that the waves did not reach her with above half the velocity and power as before and gave the ship time to rise and fall gently with them without shipping much water for the waves i suppose might run at the rate of about  0 miles an hour the wind going at about  0 and the ship above  0 miles by the log which naturally lessened the power and violence of the waves above one half upon the ship this proves the advantage and even the necessity there is for having a close reefed maintopsail ready to set when going to scud before high waves  on sailing large or before the wind in squall proceeding in squally weather must be left to the judgment and prudence of the officer that has the command to act as the circumstance and the situation of the ship and crow will admit to run more or less risk in carrying more or less sail accordingly but this i can say from experience that it is not sufficient that a ship can be got before the wind at the time of a heavy squall with a great deal of sail set which may endanger not only the masts and sails but the ship may be so over pressed with sail as to put it out of the power of the helm and the best helmsman to steer her from broaching to which may prove fatal to the whole  where rules cannot be fixed the result of facts from experience must be our only guide i was in a ship in the jamaica trade from london where our commander would not permit any sail to be shortened or taken in without his order or consent when carrying a pressing sail large with a westerly gale at the coming on of a squall of wind he was called upon and when he came upon deck he took the command and cunned the helmsman to endeavor to keep and steer the ship right before the wind without being obliged to shorten sail but the ship was so overpressed with sail as to lose the command of the helm to steer her which almost proved fatal to us all  all unnecessary dating risks of every kind when there is no pressing occasion to require such should be avoided and condemned as the greatest folly for there can be but little lost and a great deal may be saved by lowering or taking in sail in good time when a ship is sailing large or before the wind in the time of a squall as sails may be soon and easily set again when the squall is over which may be the means to prevent great loss or damage  among many instances of this kind that i have known i met with one by the foolhardiness of a london pilot who would not let our sails be lowered when sailing before the wind in a squall which made the masts bend so much that when we wanted to clew down the topgallant sails and topsails we could not get them down which shows the necessity there is of clewing these sails down and securing them down from flying up again before a squall comes on for had this squall proved any stronger or continued any longer we must have lost our masts in spite of our utmost endeavors  this shows the folly of running such imprudent risks when little or no advantage can be gained by it for it may be a disputed point whether a ship sails any faster for being thus overpressed with sail to such a dangerous degree when sailing large or before the wind but a ship sailing upon a wind in squally weather may often be under a necessity to carry a pressing sail yet then it should be considered that if the topsails etc are not clewed down in good time that the heeling of the ship added to the bending of the masts may hinder the topsails etc from being got down in the time of a squall which may prove of bad consequence  on scudding or sailing before the wind in a storm many precautions are necessary on this occasion every thing abaft and about the mizen mast should be taken in and stowed away as snug as possible and i have known the mizen gaff lowered close down on the occasion  if the waves run high it may be absolutely necessary for the reasons given to have a closereefed maintopsail set though only scudding before the wind for the ease of the ship  but when carrying a pressing sail to make the most of a storm great care should be taken that suitable sails are only set and they should be trimmed to the best advantage so that the ship may be kept under the command of the helm to steer her which should be strictly noticed by the commanding officer of the watch to  against broaching to for it should be considered that a ship at such times may be so overpressed and plunged so deep into the sea forward with sail that instead of dividing the particles of water on each side in an easy manner to open a passage through it the full pas of the bow and other stops not designed to be in the water drive a great body of water above its natural level before her bows which may increase the resistance ahead to such a degree that will rather decrease than increase the ships head way in proportion to this rise of water and the stern being lifted up as much as the head is pressed down the helm must then naturally lose so much of its power at the same time so that when the wind may be going four times as fast as the ship and the waves as fast again it is not to be wondered at that ships are sometimes broached to against the power of the helm the remarkable loss of the sussex east india ship homeward bound from china first arose from her being broached to when sailing before the wind  what has been said on this occasion shows the necessity for much care and pains to be taken both by the officer and helmsman as before recommended and none but the best helmsmen should be admitted to steer at such times and whenever danger appears from one mans steering others should be tried and the sails altered and trimmed to the best advantage that if possible the ship may be steered without the danger of being broached to a great risk attends relieving the helmsman on relieving the helmsman especially in the night when he that is to take the helm often comes but half awake from sleep and takes the helm without examining where it lies at the time and how far the ship requires it each way to confine her to the course thus not considering the danger he at first lets the ship get such a sheer that his best endeavors cannot stop her from being broached to or brought by the lee to prevent which the helmsman that is to be relieved if he has steered well should not quit the helm before he has showed and made known to him that is to relieve the particulars of her trim how she may be best steered at that time  it is well known that there is great difference in ships steering according to their built and trim full built ships when deep loaded are often difficult to be steered when sailing large in a gale of wind i have been told of some that could not be steered their intended course before the wind but would broach to each way in spite of their utmost endeavors but have been obliged to lie to with a fair wind which has often been the case of an expert diligent officer of my acquaintance therefore every hint that has the least reasonable appearance to remedy this evil deserves attention and should be tried hints to prevent broaching to on this occasion when a ship cannot be steered right before the wind without broaching to suppose a trial should be made to steer her with the wind two or three points first on one quarter then upon the other for a little time each way this reduces the danger to only being liable of broaching to one way that is to windward which may be much easier guarded against by the weather helm this one way than both and to suppose the ship to be steered with the wind on the larboard quarter with the closereefed maintopsail set and braced up with the larboard braces and the head sail trimmed sharp the other way with the starboard braces and the helm a weather as represented in the plane of the ship fig   plate   which evidently tends greatly to counteract and get the better of those causes beforementioned which occasion a ship to broach to and may keep her under the command of the helm but if this method should not answer there is another which i think could not fail of success that is to veer out and tow right over the stern a towline or hawser or as much of a cable end as may be found sufficient to keep the ship before the wind and prevent her broaching to  at such times as these to allow for bad steeage when a ship cannot be steered to the course that is ordered it should be recommended to the officer of the watch to take particular notice which way she goes most from her course to make an allowance and mark it down accordingly  on cunning to the helmsman this custom is useful in general even when done by a quartermaster it answers the good purpose to confine the thoughts and attention of the helmsman to his duty as he is obliged to repeat the cun though he with reason as i have often done moves the helm contrary to the cun in order to confine the ship to her course by such management as before mentioned the good helmsman after a little experience of the ships trim must be allowed to know best what helm is required to steer a direct course  but when sailing is dangerous by bad weather squalls high waves or other dangers that may suddenly appear then cunning becomes a matter of great importance and the cun of the superior officer or who he may appoint should only be attended to and answered briskly by the movement of the helm as well as by words to avoid the danger or to help to ease the ship to rise and fall gently with the waves as it is well known much to ease a ship in her laboring motion to luff her up with the helm a lee at the approach of a high steep wave when sailing close by the wind but to suppose a ship at the same time sailing two points from the wind it is disputed whether it is best that she should be luffed to or should bear a way from a dangerous wave  on sailing and cunning with high winds and waves right upon the beam this way of sailing in my opinion deserves particular notion because it is more exposed to danger and damage than any other way of sailing for a ship upon a wind in high waves is  accordingly and with so little head way upon her that she may be luffed up to a dangerous wave and by that made much ease and when sailing large a ship runs from the wave and wkens is force a ship lying to and driving to leeward yields and gives ome way to a high wave when it strikes her which may a little abate its bad effect but when carrying a pressing sail with the wind upon the beam which is common because counting it a fair wind a fast sailing ship is reckoned then to sail faster through the water than any other way with the same wind as she does not recede from the wind or waves and makes little or no lee way on the danger of this way of sailing but this exposes a ship to all the violent effects of dangerous high steep waves which may strike and break with their utmost velocity upon the broadside to windward whilst the ships great head way through the water makes the greatest resistance to prevent her from yielding or giving the least way to leeward and those other causes mentioned pages    and    when a ship is lifted up broadside with so quick a motion from the bottom to the top of a high steep mountainous wave it is not to be wondered at that the ship men or materials may receive great damage at such times and the greater the ship and the more water she draws the more liable she is to damage smaller vessels give more way to the waves when suck i have been in a small vessel in company with a fiftygun ship that had her mainsail split and other damage done by the waves breaking on board them whilst we received none in the small vessel at another time crossing the western ocean in a light merchant ship with our guns which were six pounders stowed down in the hold upon the ballast for the ease of the ship when sailing this way a stroke of a wave canted our ballast and guns from the weather to the lee side of the hold and broke the stantions that supported the lowerdeck beams these and many other instances confirm my opinion of the great danger attending this way of sailing  on cunning and steering a ship when sailing in this way on luffing up to or bear away from a dangerous wave it may be disputed whether she should be luffed up to or bear away from a dangerous wave approaching upon the beam reason as well as experience teaches us that the helm should be put hard a weather to bring the approaching wave as far aft as possible to lessen its force by the ships running forward and giving the mere way from it rather than to luff up with the helm alee to meet it with so much fail and headway upon the ship that must increase the stroke of the wave and may produce a violent and dangerous pitching motion i had an instance of this when i was mate of a ship and it was my watch upon deck when sailing in this way at the approach of a dangerous wave coming right upon the beam i ordered the helm hard a weather but my commander ordered the helm alee which occasioned the wave to have the abovementioned bad effect though we received no material damage yet in my opinion it would have been less hazardous to have bore away with the helm aweather  but to do justice on this occasion it must be allowed that ships in general commonly carry a pressing sail in this way and are apt to gripe and carry the helm nearly hard aweather to steer the intended course so that without this is noticed and guarded against by the officer of the watch by having only a suitable sail set and properly trimmed it may be out of the power of the helm when hard aweather to make the ship ware fast enough to avoid the bad effects of a dangerous wave when perceived to be coming upon the beam  after all that can be said on this way of sailing to avoid the danger sailing in this way when the waves run high i look upon the danger so great that it ought to be avoided as much as possible and it may be commendable to alter the course so as to steer with the wind and waves either a point before or abaft the beam or for a time each way if the occasion required that nicety  on carrying sail against head waves great caution is necessary on this occasion to prevent the damage that may be done by it sometimes even to pitching away the bowsptit masts etc and as the waves in the open sea do not immediately cease with the wind that raised them but often continue to run the same way for a great while after the wind is changed even to the opposite point of the compass therefore when a sudden change of wind happens care should be taken not to be too forward in setting or carrying sail so as to give the ship too much headway against the old waves before they are fallen for it may pitch the bowsprit under water which i have seen done to a dangerous degree sometimes headwaves will rise against and reach a ship a long time before the wind that raised them which may make it equally dangerous to press the ship with too much sail against them  on loofing and setting sails in loofing square sails when it blows fresh it should be a constant rule to loose the leeyard arm before the weatheryard arm to prevent the danger that the people to leeward are often exposed to of being thrown from the yard by the sail flying up over their heads in setting the topsails or topgallant sails upon a wind when it blows fresh it is an approved method to haul home the lee shoot first and if the sail be kept shaking by the weatherbrace the weather sheet may be easily got home but when sailing large the weather sheet of these sails are most commonly hauled home first in setting the mainsail and foresail if the wind requires it the tacks are hauled down first but in box hauling or waring the sheets may be hauled nearly aft whilst the sails shake with the wind upon the quarter and the tacks may then be got down  now let us suppose a ship has proceeded so far in her passage as to draw near to danger or to make her designed landfall  on drawing near to danger or making a landsail on these occasions it should be considered beforehand what it most depends upon to keep clear of the danger or to make a good landfall if they have regular soundings to it at a great distance then the lead may be the surest guide but if it be steep to without soundings then the latitude if it is known and a good look out with the ship properly prepared for it as mentioned page    may contribute greatly toward safety  when going to cross dangerous latitudes where projecting points of land or shoals may lie in the way or in making small islands such as cape de verd and canary islands it is certainly very wrong to run without much caution in the night or in thick weather with a erowd of sail on presumption that the ship is far enough to the westward to go clear of them which has occasioned many fatal losses being deceived by the constant easterly current that runs in this track which in my opinion is the principal cause that ships so often make more longitude out than they do home in west india voyages as before mentioned page   0  it is the latitude only when known by observation and not the longitude that can be depended upon for the ships being near or clear of danger i was in an east india ship outward bound the captain of which rather than run the risk of crossing the latitude of one of the cape de verd islands in the night tacked ship and stood back to the northward under an easy sail till day light when it plainly appeared that if we had continued our course to the southward we must have run upon the island before daylight  to make a good landfall if the situation and circumstances of wind and weather permit that a ship can sail with a leading wind true east or west to the place of the designed landfall it is an approved method to get into that latitude in good time and especially homeward bound from the western ocean and to endeavor by all possible means to get observations to make proper allowance for the variation of the compass leeway bad steerage currents or tides if known to keep the ship as near as possible in this designed latitude when got into the designed latitude the uncertainty of the longitude makes the distance to be run as uncertain therefore in the day and clear weather all the sail that is possible with safety should be carried but in the night or thick weather if it is thought prudent to run it should only be with such sails as the officer and people on deck can look round them and work the ship to avoid the danger in whatever manner it may appear  notwithstanding these rules and precautions in landfalls i have experienced very narrow escapes both in america and on our own coast where we are very liable to be deceived by the tides and in cloudy weather by taking one place for another among many instances it was my case in a ship from leghorn to london when in a cloudy afternoon we fell in with and just got a glimpse of the south side of st marys scilly island which by our reckonings and an account we had from an outer bound ship we took it for and concluded it to be the lizard point which we had seen therefore ordered as i thought we might with confidence steer a channel course for the night but our mistaken situation though in a fair line of direction with our channel course occasioned the ebb tide that sets n w between scilly and the lands end to take the ship on the starboard bow which sheered us insensibly into the bottom of mounts bay about midnight we were surprised with broken water and land extending as far as we could see on our starboard bow when carrying topgallant sails with a fresh gale quartering at s w and large swelling waves from the main ocean right into the bay  the hurry we were in to exert our utmost endeavors at this critical moment may be judged from our dangerous situation we had our small sails to take in and our topsails to get down before we could bring the ship by the wind to lay her head from the nearest breakers and we had the main and foretopsails to close roof and the topgallant yards etc to get down when we had not room to stand above a quarter of an hour upon a tack clear of the breakers this so alarmed some english passengers and even one of them who had been brought up to sea that they all assembled in the great cabin to prayers which they thought was their only refuge for safety but putting the ship in stays which she refused and then wating her round on turning out of mounts bay and our management in box hauling by box hauling as represented in the two figures plate the  th frightened them from prayer and they all came upon deck thinking we were running the ship on shore we thus managed her by box hauling as soon as we perceived the ship ceased from coming about in stays we hauled the fore sheet close aft again trimmed the headsails flat whilst the sails were shaking and hauled about the main and main top sail the same as if the ship had stayed hauled up the mizen and kept the helm hard a lee as represented by figure   in the same plate by which the ship getting great sternway turned short round upon her heel till she filled the main and main top sails the right way we then shifted the helm hard aweather when the ship got head way with the sails trimmed as represented by figure   which brought her readily round with little loss of ground by these means in about twelve hours we turned to windward so far off the lee shore as represented at figure   so as to weather the lizard where to prevent such dangers at this place as we narrowly escaped they have since erected light houses for which they have my thanks and in my opinion deserve the thanks of the public the like public thanks will be due to whoever may be instrumental in getting a distinguishable light or lights on holyhead to prevent as much as possible such fatal losses as have often happened in carnarvon bay occasioned principally by the ebb tide taking ships on the larboard bow in st georges channel when steering from tusker for holyhead which sheers them insensibly into carnarvon bay if the tide is not properly allowed for as beforementioned  that a ship sailing against a tide or current necessary cautions in strong tide channels which takes her on either bow is the cause that alters her course must be evident to every one who knows that when a ship is sailing with a leading wind in a narrow river or channel against a strong tide or current it requires nice steerage right against the stream to keep her in a fair way for if the stream is let to take her on the starboard bow she will soon sheer upon the larboard shore if on the larboard bow upon the starboard shore etc so that the same cause will have the same effect in all narrow seas or channels in proportion to their breadth where the tide or current runs strong it may be highly necessary in the night or thick weather to endeavor to steer right against the stream whilst it runs against the ship as circumstances may require to keep the ship in mid channel or in a fair way till daylight or until the weather is so clear as to permit to see the danger at a sufficient distance to run across the stream boldly for the land to know the ships real situation which may be a means to avoid such dangers as abovementioned and to proceed forward with more safety proceeding in this cautious manner is especially necessary in st georges channel where the tides run so strong that when a ship happens to enter it at the first part of either flood or ebb if the land cannot be seen clear enough to make proper remarks the tide may make vast alteration in the intended distance to be run not to mistake the land as well as in the course by which peoples judgment is apt to be misled and they take one place for another which has occasioned great loss and damage to my knowledge  therefore after a nights run in st georges channel if the land you happen to fall in with appears dubious to avoid any bad consequence that may attend a mistake no pains should be spared to get a certain knowledge of it at the clearing up of a fog i have been obliged to send a boat on shore to enquire what land it was that we found ourselves so near to and which surprised us afterward to find it was a part of the isle of man and we should not have known it without this trouble such great alteration does the different state of the atmosphere sometimes make in the appearance of land  now let us suppose a ship arrived safe to where she is obliged to take in a pilot if he is to be boarded from a sloop schooner or hoy rigged vessel under sail at sea in bad weather it may be dangerous and is often attended with damage if not properly managed therefore it deserves notice  on getting a pilot on board in bad weather at sea this is sometimes attended with so much danger that the pilot sloops belonging to leverpool rather than run the risk of boarding a ship from their own sloop sometimes go no nearer to the ship than to have a small rope thrown to or veered astern to them which they make fast about the pilots body under his armpits he then goes overboard into the sea when as near the ship as they dare venture and he is hauled on board the ship by the rope  it is a bad and common practice in many ships when the pilot vessel has got near them to lay the ship to with the helm alee and to let her drive with the main or foretopsail aback thinking they may be boarded by the pilots vessel without danger but no sensible pilot that knows what would be the consequence will offer to board at such time whilst the ship lies to but if an unexperienced pilot boards a ship upon the weather quarter which seems much the best for the purpose the ship then heelding to leeward keeps the yards masts and rigging clear from getting entangled yet it is well known from experience that it is more difficult to board to windward than to leeward and that a stroke by a wave from a small vessel against a large one will do much more damage than a stroke by a large vessel against a small one because the large vessel resists and does not give way to the blow of the small one which would yield and give way to a stroke from the large one in proportion to the difference of their weight for which reason a ship should always be boarded on the lee side but to do it whilst she lies to is attended with too much danger to risk when the ship has any motion from the waves for the helm being a lee the ship may get sternway and fall round off from the wind whilst the pilots vessel is boarding which may occasion great damage and for want of a stern rope i have known rowing boats when boarding get athwart the hause and sink at such times  the best method for this purpose in my opinion is when the pilot vessel is got near but still far enough to windward for the ship to sail right forward about a point from the wind with the afteryards braced sharp up the main yard aback out of the way and sail enough especially stay sails to keep good head way upon the ship the more the better so that she has only a little less way than the pilot vessel which may shoot up under the ships lee quarter where a stern rope and one passed aft from forward should be ready and thrown them by which they may tow and steer their vessel clear from damage under the lee quarter sheltered by the ship from the waves and may watch for a smooth sea and sheer to the ship at pleasure to board the pilot and sheer clear again with the least risk possible  on pilots a pilots qualifications should as much as possible be every way equal to the dangers and difficulties that attend his navigation and should know where the shoals extend to a great distance and where the channels are narrow intricate and shallow where and when exposed to dangerous waves where life as well as property being at risk none should be admitted to take upon them this important charge but such as from experience and practice can give a ready verbal account of the course and distance from one place to another the flowing and setting of the tides depth of water land marks buoys beacons lights etc and should not only be seaman enough to work and manage a ship to the best advantage in fine weather but capable when in difficult situations to form a right judgment what is best to be done for safety and what can reasonably be expected for the people and the ship to do on every occasion  the best and most dexterous pilots for working and managing ships in crowded narrow or dangerous channels are those at tinmouth haven who from much practice by having many large collier ships to pilot in and out as mentioned page    are more expert than any other people that i have seen and they take remarkable pains to get the ship steered to their mind they look out sharp and cun the helmsman loud and quick and make him answer and move the helm as the occasion may require to counteract as much as possible the motion of the waves that may make the ship deviate either way from her intended tract and when they turn to windward into the harbor they likewise observe with great attention and cun quick to keep the ship fairly full and by the wind with good way upon her under the command of the helm to make her work the better and when they come to where there is not room to turn to windward they take care to lay her head the right way brail up the courses and drive to windward with the tide where they have only little more room than the ships length  but when or where a pilot is found defective in seamanship or capacity to judge and act with skill and prudence on difficult or dangerous occasions it is certainly the duty of the commander and proper officers to be upon their guard and not to give up their judgment and themselves implicitly to a pilot of whose conduct they have no assurance which has to my knowledge occasioned great damage and fatal losses  therefore when a pilots capacity is not known his behavior in management and design of proceeding should be noticed and treated with more or less confidence as his conduct seems to deserve and when it plainly appears that his conduct cannot be depended upon then self preservation the first law of nature makes it a case of necessity and point of duty for the commander to interfere with the pilot and trust to his conduct no farther than is consistent with safety and not to be afraid of that false common notion that if a commander of a ship interferes in the pilots duty he makes himself answerable for the consequence to the ensurers but it is quite otherwise for the ensurers ensure the commanders conduct therefore instead of being blamed by the ensurers he certainly deserves their thanks for endeavoring to prevent loss or damage that is likely to be the consequence of a thoughtless blundering pilot that has fallen to his lot which has been my case when we had a very narrow escape  but pilots like other ranks of men must be allowed to have different capacities and dispositions and according to their practice must be more or less capable of their duty consequently among the many there must be a variety of good bad and indifferent yet the respectable character of a pilot on the whole entitles them to be treated with all the respect and encouragement their usefulness deserves so that when a pilot proves deficient in his duty and a better is not to be had to make the most of him it is certainly best to endeavor by all possible means to help and advise him with candor what may be thought best to be done according to circumstances and if his spirits appear to fail him in a dangerous passage or situation and no remedy lest but to go forward he should then be cheered and encouraged to keep up his heart and not to let fear nor intoxication with liquor get the better of him which may be of equal bad consequence  but the most danger is from those inconsiderate and unexperienced pilots who think a ship may be managed and conducted with equal ease and safety among shoals as their own small vessels to which they have been accustomed therefore they think there is no occasion to wait for the tide the daylight or clear weather but to push forward at all hazard though it may be such weather that no lights marks buoys beacons nor the dangerous shoals in the way can be seen nor guarded against by a compass course nor by the lead at a sufficient distance to keep clear of them  i had the experience of a pilot of this sort who wanted to run in the night amongst the shoals when nothing could be seen for a guide to keep clear of them therefore i opposed him till daylight when it blew fresh right upon the shore with drizzling hazy weather that we could not see a mile before us he pressed me very hard to bear away and set sail i reasoned with him of the danger and would not consent till we had a consultation of the officers when he was told of the great risk there was in running upon a lee shore in such bad weather that if we fell in at any great distance from a fair way he was to consider that the ship was not to be worked and managed in little room among shoals like the small vessel we had taken him from etc he answered that the greatest danger was from our not running to get into safety when we might and that his life was as dear to him having a family depending upon it as any of ours could be to us and that if he could but see any part of the land or even the breakers he could steer in by them to get into safety  by the pilots persuasion we bore away for our port but with all the necessary precaution possible to guard against the apprehended dangers abovementioned we run before the wind under close reefed main and foretop sails thinking we should be obliged to carry them by the wind if occasion required to make the ship work or to keep clear of the lee shore the lower sails in the brails ready to set on either tack by the wind the anchors and cables all clear all hands at their stations looking sharp out and the deep sea lead going in    fathom water we saw land and shoal broken water near ahead which was shown to the pilot asking him which way we should go now he pointed from the danger we were nearest to but looking the way he pointed nothing could be seen but broken raging waves we asked him what was then to be done being in five fathom water i perceived he was overcome with fear and had nothing to say but left us to save ourselves as we could we then brought the ship round to by the wind and notwithstanding we were well manned was obliged to get the main and fore sheets aft with the tacks not above two thirds down by which under providence and the ships fast sailing we but just cleared the breakers on the leeshore which would by all appearance have proved our total destruction if the ship had been left to the conduct of the pilot who after this as it is common with all such unthinking men went from a rash confidence to such extreme fearfulness that he thought we could not possibly get far enough from the danger we had so narrowly escaped when the weather cleared up with a sudden change and a gail of wind right off shore that put us under reefed courses we could but just see the land from the mast head  this pilots conduct and the many instances of damage and fatal losses that have been occasioned by rash imprudent and defective pilots prove the necessity that a commander may be often under to interfere with the pilot but it should always be done in a calm friendly manner to advise or assist him in whatever he may seem deficient for it is but natural to suppose that a commander should know the trim and properties of his ship from experience and what dependence may be put on her for sailing steering staying waring or to ride at an anchor and how they can work and manage her on extraordinary occasions in narrow and dangerous channels and should form a better judgment what the ship and crew can do than a strange pilot who may be a brave man and know his way very well yet for want of experience may be much inferior to the commander in working and managing the ship and when this is the case it should be agreed for the pilot to show the way and point out the dangers whilst the commander works and manages the ship to keep clear of them which in my opinion may often contribute greatly to prevent misfortunes but when pilots are known to be thoroughly qualified to work and manage a ship as their navigation requires then the commander has only to see that the pilots orders are obeyed  but when ships are going for shoal flats bar or tide harbor where safety depends upon the height and time of tide which makes all hints or remarks from observations on the tides deserve notice therefore sailor like i venture to give some observations upon them  on the tides the tides and the knowledge of them are of such great and important advantages to our navigation and especially among our many shoals flatts bar and tide harbors where it depends entirely upon the certainty of the flow and time of the tide to proceed with safety therefore our utmost endeavors should be used to get the greatest knowledge of the tides that is possible in all our tide and bar harbors that lie near the sea by observing and remarking the time and how much they flow on an average not only at full and change but at the quarters of the moon which is the time that the tides are at their greatest deviation from the mean and common way of reckoning them which if it was made public might contribute greatly to come at a more perfect theory of the tides as well as prevent the loss and damage that may be occasioned by ships running for our shoal water harbors at a wrong time of tide being deceived by the old common method of reckoning the tides which is very erroneous especially at the quarters of the moon and marking the time of flowing at full and change always to a point of the compass adds to the uncertainty of a ship from sea to find the time of high water which from experience i can say has occasioned great loss and damage damage done by running at a wrong time of tide i was in a west india ship running for a bar harbor in ireland by this erroneous rule when we beat off our gripe rudder and a great deal of the stern post and after part of the keel upon the bar and had seven feet water in the hold when we got into the harbor and was obliged to run on shore to prevent sinking at leverpool i have observed ships coming in at neap tides about the quarters of the moon when instead of meeting with high water as expected by the common way of reckoning they have found it about a quarter ebb that for want of water enough they have often struck or come aground and laid upon the bar when loss or great damage has often been the consequence  for these reasons and being requested by my friend mr ferguson the astronomer who with great labor and pains furnished me with large schemes tables plans etc relating to the tides in the year      when i began and have continued to make observations on the time and height of the tides flowing at the old dock gates in leverpool which is about three miles from the mouth of the river that is so broad and extensive that as a branch of the sea no land floods or freshes has any effect on the tides in the river opposite to the town where the least flow of water that i have observed in neap tides was nine feet at the dock gates when low water was just even with the sill of the gates from whence is marks in the stone work upward to twentytwo feet and a half from which the heights of the tides are taken but having no marks below the sill of the gates toward the river where from observations made on the whole rise of some tides i have reason to conclude in moderate weather that in proportion as the tides commonly rise above the nine feet mark at the gates they fall the same below the sill of the gates and that the four feet and a half mark is near the half flood mark let the rise be what it will though it does not agree with half the time of flowing nor ebbing of the tides  but to observe more exactly the whole rise of one of our middling tides i had a board fixed upright at low water in the river marked with six inch marks each foot high enough to observe by a middling tide nicely observed till the tide reached the dock gates and remarked the time it flowed to each foot the rise of the whole tide which was twentytwo feet and an half from seven feet below the dock gates to the fifteen feet and an half mark at the gates in five hours fifty minutes the first half tide rose in two hours forty minutes but the next to high water was three hours ten minutes so that the first half tide rose in fifteen minutes less time than the last and it fell again to the half flood mark about fifteen minutes less time than it was in rising but the slack tide at low and high water must be allowed to account for part of these irregularities it ebbed the tide before as i judge it does most commonly in moderate weather six hours thirty minutes added to the flood five hours fifty minutes makes twelve hours twenty minutes the twenty minutes difference in time between these two high waters agree with a tide table that is calculated and published here yearly by messrs holdens the benefit of which to be mentioned hereafter  i had the above tide drawn into a scheme sie of the wave of the tide dividing the feet as the water rose and fell by the minutes of time the wave of the tide as it may be called formed a curve near the parabolic or the range of a bomb shell only spread out at the bottom as the first and last half foot in flowing took about thirty minutes varying by degrees faster and slower to half tide when it flowed the fastest a foot in about ten minutes of time  the old method of reckoning the tides by mean or equal difference of time or the bearing of the moon by the compass the tides flowing compared with a tide clock from full to change has been found very defective i had a tide clock made that was planned by mr ferguson to show the time of tide by this rule i kept the clock going as near as i could to sol time and what proved very remarkable that at the quarters of the moon when it was really high water by the tide the clock commonly showed only three quarters flood so that from the full and change to the quarters of the moon the time of high water commonly lost near a quarter of a flood or above an hour from regular time  many laudable attempts have been made to fix easy rules to agree with these deviations abovementioned which  be allowed a great improvement in reckoning the tides yet i have learned from experience and observation that to come near the truth nothing less than calculating the attractive powers of the moon and sun tides higher and lower in proportion to the moons distance according to their distance and situation from us which makes a great difference and brings on both spring and neap tides sooner or later and alters their height as well as the time of high water even at full and change of the moon the only stated time they will vary fifteen minutes though all proper allowances may be made of two minutes of time for every hour the full or change happens to differ from the stated time of high water  as we move round the sun and the moon round us in eleptical orbits and the moons motion is faster or slower as she is nearer or farther from us which is reckoned to be about   000 miles nearer to us when in her perigee than when in her apogee and thirteen days and a half in going from one to the other that makes the high and low tides constantly vary accordingly and which seems to me to make about a sixth part difference in the height of the tides from whatever they may flow in common which i reckon about twentyeight feet to be the whole flow of our common spring tides when we have about eighteen feet at the abovementioned dock gates but when the moon happens to be in her perigee at full or change then we have about twentyone feet at the gates and when this happens at the quarters of the moon instead of    feet as in common at neap tides we have about fourteen feet at the gates and when this happens at equal night spring tides we have about twentytwo feet at the gates and the neap tides low in proportion if the moon happens to be in her apogee and what is very remarkable when the day and night tides run highest that from about the tenth of may to the tenth of november the night tides that flow from six in the evening to six in the morning run the highest and from the tenth of november to about the tenth of may the day tides run the highest and this difference often amounts to eighteen inches  why the spring and neep tides come sooner or later when the moon happens to be in her perigee at the quarters makes high neap tides as before observed the spring tides following puts up early and the highest tide is often on the full or change day but when the moon happens to be in her apogee at the quarters the following spring tides are late in putting up and not at the height till the third or fourth day after the full or change and all the other intermediate tides are influenced in the same manner according to the moons distance and situation and as she is going farther from or coming nearer to us in her orbit all which deserves notice on many occasions especially when it may be doubtful of a ships havin water enough to answer her purpose  the times of the tides flowing the progressive difference of the time of the tides flowing and the progressive difference of time between one high water and another are likewise obedient to the laws of the same powers for when the moon happens to be in her apogee at the full or change then her motion in her orbit is slowest that for five or six tides afterward the progressive difference of time between one tide and another is only about fifteen minutes till they lose about an hour from equal time then they alter nearly to equal progressive time of twentyfive minutes each tide to the quarters when they flow about four oclock whether the quarters are long or short almost as near a stated time as they flow about eleven oclock at full and change and after the quarters of the moon the progressive time of flowing begins to increase often to fortyfive minutes each tide till they fetch up the lost hour and comes up to equal time about six tides before the full or change which six tides only agrees near with the abovementioned tide clock differing each tide about twentyfive minutes till the full or change when they begin to make their deviations again as above described  but the ingenious mathematicians messrs richard and george holdens from observations here and some from bristol tables for the time and height of the tides flowing have formed a theory and an accurate method whereby they calculate and publish yearly tide tables to show not only the time but the height of the tides flowing at liverpool old dock gates which i can say from experience agrees surprizingly near to observations therefore i take the liberty to give the principal part of the preface to the tide table for       the preface a perfect theory of the tides and an accurate method of calculating them has been greatly wanted in every age since navigation was first practiced and though industriously sought after has hitherto baffled the researches of the most learned and as their theory has hitherto remained defective so their methods of calculation founded thereupon have succeeded no better for as i am now furnished with about three thousand observations made upon the tides at liverpool and three hundred and sixty at bristol with which i can compare my own and all other methods of calculation i think i may venture to assert that all the methods given us in books of navigation and all the tide tables inserted in our almanacks preface to the ide le are very frequently subject to the error of an hour and many times of much more except that of monsieur de la caille which yet is often liable to an error of forty minutes as any person will find who takes the trouble of making a sufficient number of observations  indeed no person can expect that it should be otherwise who considers that monsieur de la cailles and all other methods except that of monsieur cassini which in truth is no better depend entirely upon the moons age or her distance from the sun without regarding the different distances of either the sun or moon from the earth their declinations the latitudes of places or any thing else that affects the tides  thus deficient are all former methods in computing only the times of high water as for the heights the calculation thereof has never before been attempted by any one that i know of though they are as i apprehend equally necessary for of what advantage can it be to the seaman to know when the tide will be at the highest if there will not be at that time depth of water sufficient for his purpose indeed it would be of no more service to know that there would be depth enough of water unless he knew at the same time when to expect it but to know what height the tide will rise to and at what time must contribute greatly to his security and is it not absolutely requisite that a tide table should inform him of both these  if any person shall think proper to compare this table with his own observations he ought always to set his watch right immediately before by some good sun dial for these calculations are made according to solar time  and if the watch be thus truly regulated i doubt not but that they will be sound to correspond very nealy with the observation as this table is composed with the same care and exactness as the last i having had the assistance of mr bryan waller through the whole work  indeed it cannot rationally be expected that any method of computation can perfectly agree with the tides because they are subject to various alterations from the wind yet notwithstanding all the irregularities caused thereby the heights given in the last tide table have agreed with the observations upon an average within seven inches and the times within five minutes  geo holden   notwithstanding gales of wind affect the tides advantages of these tide tables i observe it is more in the height than in the time that they are made to differ from these tide tables and then an allowance may be judged according to the strength or velocity of the wind blowing for or against the course of the flood tide which here comes from the south west quarter which to suppose may increase the height of the tide above this theory at the rate of about an inch for every mile of the winds velocity above a fresh breeze of about ten miles an hour and decreases the height in proportion as the wind blows from the north east quarter  so that these tide tables must certainly be of great utility to all that are concerned in the time and height of the tides flowing and from their height may judge of their velocity which i reckon opposite to the town is at the rate of about a mile an hour for every fathom it flows up and down and that is about two and a half at common neap and about four and a half at common spring tides and there is seven feet more water on the bar of the common channel than at the old dock gates so that by the tide table it may be judged when a ship will have water enough to get into the river and into the docks with safety and how to birth them according to their drafts of water not only in the wet docks but in the graving or repairing docks which are of different depths that they may have water enough to get out as well as in and they are thought to be of that importance to our pilots that the laws for regulating the pilots make it a penalty of five pounds for a pilot being without a tide table and a watch kept to solar time  therefore i hope these tide tables will meet with all the encouragement that the ingenuity and labor deserves to continue their publication the moons distance to be attended to for the height and strength of the tides till time gives them a fair trial how near their theory agrees with other shoal dangerous ports or places that depends upon knowing the certainty of the time and height of the tides flowing to proceed with safety which may be a means to recommend such tide tables to be tried and used in proportion to the advantages that may be experienced from them but till time brings this about the only method to judge when the tides will be higher or lower than common is to attend to the moons distance being near her perigee or apogee as beforementioned which are remarked in the nautical or whites almanacks and should be in all our navigation books where the flowing of the tides are remarked and to make an allowance as a storm of wind happens to blow near or against the direction of the flood tide to make allowance for the wind being for or against the flood tide which i have observed to make an alteration of about three feet in the height of the tides when i judged the wind blowing at the rate of about fortyfive miles an hour i cannot perceive as has been imagined that the tides are affected when our neighboring worlds are passing near us in the same side of our orbits as mentioned in page    or by the different weight of our atmosphere as shown by the barometer and as i live fronting and but fourteen yards from the dock gates abovementioned which opens with the flood and shuts at high water whilst i am able and willing would be glad of any directions rules or hints that might improve observations on the tides to make them more useful to seamen pilots mathematicians astronomers or philosophers  on ripplings or races that run at the edge of strong tides these waves rise perpendicular very quick and run in a confused manner in all directions and fall with so swift a motion up and down which makes in some measure temporary vacuums in the air that interrupt the natural course of the wind which keeps a ship the longer among these tumultuous waves that toss her about with such violent confused distressful motions that immediately stops her way through the water and the power of the helm to command her and though there may be a fresh of wind make the sails p to the masts that they do little more than drive along with the race of the tide therefore as much as possible should be avoided as dangerous especially to open vessels as i have experienced in passing one in a schooner rigged vessel when we shipped so much water as nearly to sink us before we got through it but when a vessel must pass them it is best to do it with the wind large to get the sooner through and of late i have known a ship of  00 tons that fell into one off the island of ushant by which they had their two boats washed off the deck and lost and did a great deal of other material damage  on a ship at anchor waiting for the tide a ship lying near the shoals she is to pass or go over i have known great advantages in observing the shoals at low water and the flowing of the tide by the lead and comparing it by the ships draught of water a great help to form a judgment when a ship will have water enough  where different remarkable places can be seen and distinguished as the tide flows up to them that continues nearly the same difference with the bar or shoal that the ship is to go over these should be remarked in the draught of the place what water there is when the tide is up to them as may be seen in the instructions at the bottom of the chart of the bay and harbor of liverpool where there is eight different remarks for that purpose but the best method is where distinct signals can be made by colors or lights on shore  on leading marks through channels or to avoid dangers when these are to be erected for this purpose only they should be made singular to differ in appearance as much as possible from other common buildings and their likeness laid down not only in miniature in their real situations with the compass lines of direction leading to them but in larger figures with their height in feet in some vacant part of the chart of the place as the principal leading marks and light houses are in the last plate of the chart of liverpool by which they may be known and distinguished from other objects and from each other to prevent mistakes and as buoys may be much better distinguished from one another by their shape than different colors we have for some years past laid cask buoys to be left on the larboard hand to observe marks buoys etc with a spying glass recommended and can buoys on the starboard hand in coming in through our channels as may be seen in the chart abovementioned which must certainly be a great help and guide to lead a ship in a fair way into a harbor and when the time and weather permit i would recommend to observe them with the spying glass at a distance as they appear above the horizon to compare their likeness situation and bearings with the chart  best colors for marks bys etc from all my observations red seems to be the best and most striking color to make these objects conspicuous at a distance in all weathers and situations though it must be allowed that when white happens to reflect the sun rays toward the eye or situated in a shade makes it some times very conspicuous yet to take all weathers and situations it is often very bad to be seen and a white buoy is bad to be distinguished among broken waves but a mark colored in thirds with black white and red will answer best in all weathers and situations  wood marks that are made to be shifted as the channels alter to prevent their being blown down it is common to leave an open space between each board that is nailed to make them conspicuous the light passing through these open spaces i have observed to obscure the marks to a great degree especially when the sun was any way behind them and by having them boarded close proved a great improvement to make them be seen much better there is a curious observation that may be made when a ships mast or any other small object that comes in the way of the sun when it is near the horizon that it can be looked at with the naked eye how the sun obscures and makes a deep dint to appear in the sides of these objects which deserves the notice of astronomical observers  on lighthouses as many valuable lives and great property often depends upon the certainty of seeing these lights at a sufficient and proper distance  therefore no pains of expense should be spared to make them as perfect as possible to answer their designed purpose especially where there is a sufficient fund allowed to support them or where the increase of trade and shipping are taxed so as to make large profits arise from them which deserves the attention of all the public that is concerned to get our lighthouses improved upon the best plan for the greater safety and advantage to shipping  it is well known from reason as well as experience that open coal fire light exposed to all winds and weathers cannot be made to burn and show a constant steady blaze to be seen at a sufficient distance with any certainty for in storms of wind uncertainty of open fire lights when lights are most wanted these open fires are made to burn furiously and very soon away so as to melt the very iron work about the grate and in cold weather when it snows hails or rains hard the keepers of the lights do not care to expose themselves to the bad weather are apt to neglect till the fire is too low then throws on a large quantity of coals at a time which darkens the light for a time till the fire burns up again and in some weathers it must be difficult to make them burn with any brightness and when they are enclosed in a glased close lighthouse they are apt to smoke the windows greatly nor affords so much constant blaze that gives the most light as oil lamps or tallow candles of two pounds each but these last require often snussing to prevent their light from being dull so that after trial of these different sorts of lights we have fixed upon lamp lights with proper reflectors behind them to answer best here at liverpool  on oil lamps with reflectors and lighthouses it is well known from experience that our common street lamps advantages of lamp lights when the oil is good will burn a long winters night of sixteen hours without any attendance and consume but very little wick which plainly proves them the most certain constant and steady uniform lights that can be used in lighthouses where shipping has to pass through dangerous and narrow channels by them as they have here at liverpool situated in a deep dangerous bay with shoal sand banks at a great distance from the shore as may be seen by the chart lies open and exposed to the most current storms of westerly winds and strong tides which raises high and dangerous waves that occasioned many great and fatal losses before      when four lighthouses were erected two large ones called the sealights leading through the channel out to and in from sea till the two hoylake lights are brought in a line that leads into a very good road steed to lie till it is a proper time and tide to proceed to liverpool as may be seen by the chart and the losses have been very few in comparison to what they were before these lighthouses were built which proves their great use to the trade of this place for safety as well as expedition in getting out and in by them liverpool light houses they are built from twentyfive to one hundred and one feet high as the situation and necessity requires two of them a great height above the level of the sea as the curvature of our globe requires according to the rules laid down in several of our navigation books which should always be considered in proportion to the distance of the shoals from the lighthouses which should be so high as to appear and be seen above the horizon at a sufficient distance without the shoals from a ships deck that her situation may be known by the lights being open or near in a line either to run or get and keep the ship off by them in a fair way as the occasion of time or tide may require  lamps and reflectors how made and fixed these lamps and reflectors as represented in plate  0 fig   and   are fixed in the light room right fronting the channel or line of direction for a fair way and opposite the middle of the window which should be high enough in proportion to the reflector and extend in width each way as far as necessary the light can or may require to be seen  these reflectors are made as near as they can be to the parabolic curve by drawing a set of parallel lines right across the focus or center line and mark the focal distance above the parallel lines and take an extent from the focal distance to each parallel line one after the other with these extents mark each parallel line in its turn from the focus or burning point with dots on each side of the focus line to the extent of the designed diameter and making a regular sweep from dot to dot as represented in plate  0 fig   by which method a form may be made for the curve of a parabolic reflector of any focus or diameter to have the property when the suns or any other rays of light or fire comes upon them in parallel lines they are reflected to and cross each other at the focus which makes the focus the burning point and just the contrary effect when a burning blaze of fire or light is fixed in their focus all the rays of light that falls upon them are reflected right forward in parallel lines with more or less power in proportion to the luster or brightness of the reflectors which are illuminated so as to look like a blaze as big as the reflectors themselves to people in that quarter nearly facing them by the angle of reflection being equal to the angle of incident  we have made and had in use here at liverpool reflectors of one two and three feet focus and three five and a half seven and a half and twelve feet diameter the three smallest made of tin plates sodered together and the largest of wood covered with plates of looking glass shaped as represented by fig one and two plate  0 and fixed as near as can be to the abovementioned rules and a copper lamp the cistern part for the oil and wick stands behind the reflectors so that nothing stands before the reflector to intercept the blaze from acting upon it but the tube that goes through it with a spreading burning mouthpiece to spread the blaze of the lamp parallel to and with the middle of it just in the focus or burning point of the reflector as may be seen by the figures abovementioned  we have a feeding can with oil to stand upon the cistern of each lamp with a small brass cock that is turned to drop or run a little according to the consumption of oil that it may be kept near to the level of the mouth of the lamp near which is a little rim to prevent any drains of oil along the tube to the reflector as may be seen in fig   which drops from the rim to a drippingpan that stands below the reflector and if the cock of the feeding can should be turned to run too fast to prevent an overflow of oil there is a small hole and a tube in the cistern that lets the oil into a tin can standing below it the lamps like the reflectors are proportional in their bigness to make a greater or less blaze as their distance to be seen requires their spreading burning parts are from three to twelve and fourteen inches which makes the blaze the same breadth and burns higher or lower according to the quality of the oil on which the goodness of the lights greatly depends and as the wick is common cotton thread spun for the purpose of lamps and wound in lengths to fill the mouth of the lamps about a quarter of an inch thick and as it consumes there is long mouth pincers the lengths as above to haul out the wick altogether through the tubes as the occasion requires and are snuffed with a pair of sheers in one hand and a tin box with a little water in it in the other for the snuffings to prevent the danger of fire and is only required to be attended and trimmed by their keepers every four hours  thus are these lighthouses constructed kept and situated as abovementioned and has stood the test of fair trial and the preference and advantages given to them even by their opposers as there always will be to new things commonly calling them new whims till time and trial confirm them useful improvements which these are allowed to be by all that have seen them for in a dark clear night the two sea lights notwithstanding their height and the curvature or roundness of the sea as before mentioned may be plainly seen when they are in a line with the horizon not only from the deck but from the mast head of a ship which gives the advantage to see which way they are open to bring them in a line in good time either to keep the ship off or run in by them in a fair way as the circumstance of the time and tide prudently considered may require  but it may be said that these reflecting lights only suit such places as require them to be seen only from one quarter of the compass which must be acknowledged though two of our lamps give a blaze twelve and fourteen inches square yet there is but little reflected light above three points of the compass each way but then it must be allowed that the blaze of the lamps can be seen as in common with other lights above half the compass clear of the edge of the reflectors which illuminate greatly the atmosphere fronting them that adds greatly to the light even in that situation  lighthouses requiring to be seen more than half round a light house that may require to be seen above a half or   th of the compass may be fixed upon this plan with two or three reflectors one to face each quarter and have the tubes for the lamps from one cistern or to have a parcel of small lamps with reflectors of four inch focus and eleven inch diameters as represented in plate  0 fig   and   which may be set upon shelves in rows very near the window the upper row nearest and those below a little behind on hand lamps and reflectors to prevent those below from smoking those above them by such means the rays of light that would go toward the land or against a dead wall where they are not wanted are reflected forward to add to the light that goes toward the shipping for which they are designed  but where a lighthouse requires to be seen equally from all quarters quite round the compass and lighted with a number of candles or common lamps as it is known from experience that their rays of light pass and cross each other freely in all directions without any visible interruption which makes it a disputed point whether reflectors would be of any service which in my opinion a number of those hand lamps with their reflectors set round upon shelves near the windows as abovementioned would reflect many rays of light in an horizontal direction clear of the smoke that would fall above and below the windows and throw more light through the windows with than without the reflectors from an equal quantity of lights but the advantage that would be gained wants to be confirmed by experiment  these hand lamps and reflectors were contrived to make night signals by lights signals for ships seen off and in distress to be set in the stair case windows of our upper sea lighthouse that fronts toward the town in case of any vessel being perceived in distress in the night or when it is too dark to see the day signals which are represented with the lighthouse fig   plate  0 as they were published upon a chard to make them known and as they have given general satisfaction since they have been in use and afford a greater number and variety of different vessels than any other set of signals i have seen i thought deserved this notice besides these public signals several merchants have flagstaffs erected at a little distance from the lighthouse that when their ships appear with their particular signal their colors are hoisted on their flagstaff for their information  it is further proposed to have at this lighthouse a set of gun chambers charged with a composition of fire balls next the powder then filled with sawdust and a sur plug drove hard in with a wooden mall that when any vessel is perceived to make signals of distress for help either by day or night they are to be answered by firing one of these chambers which stands with its breech upon the ground that prevents any recoil therefore discharges its contents right up in the air with a loud explosion which will not only alarm the town to send help but the fire ball sparkling in the air will give the distressed a great satisfaction to see that their signals are noticed to expect help the situation of this lighthouse is well adapted to answer all these purposes standing fronting the town and docks at three miles distance upon a stone hill about forty yards high above the level of the sea at high water which makes it very conspicuous both from the town and at sea it being the first object that appears on shore above the horizon in a fair direction for its channel as may be seen by the chart  but to return to the hand lamps and reflectors as beforementioned i tried one of them with our reflectors of three feet diameter and one foot focus made and glassed as represented in fig     but it proved greatly inferior though it might be seen at nine or ten miles distance and in trying them with a common shop lamp with equal wicks and set in different windows of the stair case of the lighthouse that faces the town as abovementioned when the reflected lamp eclipsed the common lamp to such a degree that i could not see it without using a spy glass at three miles distance and these small reflectors being only beat out of common tin that if they were improved and made of blown quicksilvered glass silver plated copper or reflecting telescope metal as concave mirrors and sodered all together with the lamp in a tin pan like a dripping pan as represented in fig   and   only with the addition of tin stays behind the reflectors to keep altogether in handling them about it is a doubt with me whether a number set as before mentioned would not be preferable to our large reflectors for i have perceived from experience that our large reflectors of one foot focus and three feet diameter reflects a stronger light in proportion than our large reflector of twelve feet diameter and three feet focus  another great benefit i thought might arise from these hand reflectors if they were brought to perfection single light houses might be distinguished from one another by having different numbers of windows luminated by them but in trying experiments with two of them set in the first and second staircase windows of the lighthouse already mentioned experiment of the distance of a gn s not to appear as one fig   they appeared at three miles distance only as one light though they were above ten feet asunder and required to be set in the first and third windows which is above nineteen feet asunder to appear as two distinct lights at three miles distance which shows how much these imperfect hand reflectors illuminated the atmosphere and how necessary are experiments before new designs of this kind are put in execution  in lighthouses where reflectors are designed to be used and the lights require to be seen at the greatest distance possible according to their high or low situation above the level of the sea the reflectors should be made to stand with their axes or center pointing to the horizon but where they are only required to be seen at a small distance to lead over a bar or through a channel near them then the reflectors should be pointed to the most necessary or most dangerous place by which means the most rays of light are reflected to where they are most wanted and from experience we find that plate ground glass answers much best round and window with the best glass recommended both for reflectors and the light room windows and the larger the panes and the less wood in the window frames to obstruct the light the better and the windows that are framed round or circular as well as the lighthouses stand and resist the wind much better than those that are made flat by the octagon or eight sided form and to keep the light rooms as clear of smoke as possible i would recommend a large opening in the center of the roof with a nice cover and a large vane to make it traverse freely with the wind and to withold whatever contrivance or the best materials that can make them the most perfect as far as the fund which is to support them will afford should be looked upon as an act of great villainy for the reasons given  experience makes another remark here necessary that without there is a small vacuity made in the walls of lighthouses for the wet to drain down it will beat through and rot the wood work  on running for dangerous tide or bar harbors circumstances of times and places are so variable that no rule can be laid down for this purpose yet something should be said to endeavor to prevent as much as possible running imprudent risks at improper times which has to my knowledge occasioned great damage and many total and fatal losses when both time and tide prove favorable to a ships situation it is then a point of duty and highly commendable to push forward with all possible expedition to get into port  but when either the time or the tide proves unfavourable to a ships situation then it is the duty of the commander to be upon his guard and act with prudent caution as the occasion may require to consider and consult what ought to be done and not to be persuaded even by a pilot to run at an improper time of tide or in the night or when it rains snows hails or in hazey or foggy weather it is well known that lights nor any other objects can be seen at a sufficient distance to keep clear of dangers and where the lead cannot be depended upon for a guide at such times and under such circumstances and especially when the waves run dangerously high upon the shoals the utmost endeavors should be used to keep clear of them till a favorable time and tide offers to get into safety and nothing but to save a ship from sinking or foundering in deep water should be a sufficient reason for running farther among dangers than there is a prospect of safety whilst there is any possibility to keep a ship off from them  on running for liverpool at improper times for want of such prudent precautions and endeavors as abovementioned has occasioned great damage and many fatal losses in attempting at improper times to get into the port of liverpool where the dangers are so many and great as to require not only a proper time of tide but clear weather and daylight to proceed with a common chance for safety yet such has been the imprudence and folly of pilots and commanders of ships to run for our dangerous crooked bar channels when no guides could be seen and no compass courses nor the lead to be relied on by which they have lost their ships and lives and some fatal losses have been sioned by subverting the very advantageous designed use of our lighthouses which are to show ships the way into hylake a good adsted to wait for a suitable time and tide to get through the dangerous channels into the river or to get and keep a ship in a  way to be ready to proceed through the dangerous parts of the channels as the circumstances of the wind time and the tide flowing but a little after daylight may require  but the great abuse and il use made of those lights have been in running in by the two sea lights with gales of wind right upon the shore in the night and instead of running into hoylake by the two hoylake lights as before mentioned they have attempted to run through our dangerous rock channel where their vessel has been beat all to pieces when nothing but the floating wreck has made known the misfortune but no people saved to tell their melancholy tales rmmended  tall a proper me and e o which might have been avoided by running into hoylake or to have kept off under sail to windwards off the sand banks till the next days tide as a pilot of one of these unfortunate vessels was advised to do when they boarded him and which should be the practice of all ships trading to the port of liverpool whilst it is possible to be done it is certainly better in a gale of wind to keep a ship under sail to windward though it may be troublesome than to risk riding upon a leeshore to wait for a proper time and tide and especially at the n e buoy of hoyle where they lie openly exposed to such high waves from the sea that often breaks the cables that have been long foreign voyages but if they hold prevents their heaving a head against the flood and to save tide it is very common to cut of p their cables and ns a great risk in casting and getting the ship fairly under way at such times in so little room without anchors to bring them up as the occasion afterward may require which has often been the occasion of great damage and always a certain expense and risk in getting the anchors again  all possible pains should likewise be taken by observing the marks on shore as mentioned in the instructions of the chart to observe the height of the tide by the marks on shore to hit the proper time of tide according to the ships draft of water for when the waves run high there may be as much danger in running too early as too late on the tide for when the tide falls fast a ship soon ceases from striking hard which she continues to do all the time it flows and may be drove out of the best of the channel danger of running too soon in the tide for it a ship strikes till she looses her head way through the water she is then left in a manner entirely to the power of the tide wind and waves which may prove of fatal consequence at such times by driving her quite out of the channel as the water slows as we have sand banks detached from the main that has very little water upon them at common tides that a ship stands but a little chance of beating over them or the people get to the main to save their lives if they are obliged to quit her  in the finest weather and smooth water to guard against cross tides it requires great care to observe and manage so as to fall in with the shoal parts of these channels at the proper time of tide and a brease of wind to have the command of the ship to keep her in a fair way from being carried by the cross tides that run over the sands through the swatches and false deeps out of the proper channels in spite of a boat towing ahead which makes it too dangerous to attempt passing these channels in a calm but when a calm or bassling winds are likely to happen when passing them boats to tow or the anchor ready to let go as the occasion may require should be made as ready as possible to prevent the ship being carried on shore by these cross tides which has often happened and loss and great damage been the consequence by the tide washing the sand from under them more in one place than another that occasions their straining to do much more damage than if a ship laid on firm ground on grounding on a sand ank when the stood tide runs strong over it   what i think farther deserves particular notice on these occasions i have seen many instances of ships by running too early in the tide have come aground upon a sand bank with the stood tide running very strong over it when they have let go the anchor to prevent the ship driving farther on and though they have veered out a long scope of cable have been much deceived in their expectation to bring the ship round with her head upon the tide to ride her because she drawing most water aft hangs her by the stern on the ground nearly end on to the tide so that the anchor seldom holds to bring her more than broad side to the tide which increases the strain to bring the anchor home that she swings and lies with her stern nearly end on to the tide as at first and drives farther and farther on with the flood as the anchor comes home which may prove of bad consequence in many situations therefore i have often thought how this might be prevented by putting a spring or two upon the cable with a rolling hitch a hint to de a ship by the stern etc so as to have two parts to take one on each quarter so as to ride the ship by the stern till the tide flowed enough to give room to swing clear of the ground and as the situation may require to sheer or cast her stern toward the deepest water by slacking or letting the spring go on that side designed to cast her to lay the strain on the spring and the helm on the other quarter taking care that the cable is clear of the heel by which means a ship may be swung or ride by the stern clear of the ground till the tide is done as the occasion may require  a hint on fogs i have known ships get aground and receive great damage by being catched in the narrow and shoal parts of channels in a fog and as fogs are allowed to be only low clouds or moist dense vapors near the surface of the earth i have heard of instances that by going to the mast head they have got sight of objects for their guide when nothing was to be seen from the decks i recommend these expedients as worth a trial when there is occasion for them  here i hope i may be allowed for the present to conclude the voyage of practical seamanship by supposing after a successful voyage the ship to have arrived safe by good management under providence clear of all those difficulties and dangers that has been or may be mentioned hereafter  on letter of mart ships and privateers this is a trade that has and most likely always will be carried on in time of war with other trading nations and ships as well as armies are well known to be more or less powerful according to their force in proportion as the people are disciplined and exercised in their duty but for want of instructions how this is to be done i have known our people vastly at a loss both in privateers and merchant ships when a war happens after a long peace as in the first part of the war before the last i was in an east india ship of    guns and a letter of mart ship in the jamaica trade where our great guns and small arms were never exercised because none on board either ship knew how it was to be done which might have been the occasion of the loss of ourselves and ships if we had happened to have fallen in with and engaged disciplined ships of equal force which must be allowed will always have greatly the advantage over ships where their crews are not disciplined the more daring and brave they are the sooner they fall into confusion which our people are the more liable to by being in general too eager to fight regardless of dangers from superior discipline or force or any other disadvantages that may attend their situation which proves the necessity that some instructions should be attempted for our letter of mart ships and privateers to prevent as much as possible their falling by their own extraordinary courage and bravery therefore from the experience of two wars i shall endeavor to point out what i think may be of some service in the first of a war to fit them the better to attack an enemy or being attacked to defend themselves in the course of a voyage or on a cruise against the enemy  but i must own this is a task much more fit for those gentlemen that have had the experience of the late brave actions and improved discipline of our incomparable royal navy and as i never had that advantage i hope my defects will be thought the more excusable  on fitting out letter of mart ships and privateers safety as well as success in my opinion depends greatly on the manner these ships are fitted out trading ships designed more for defense than offense i would recommend to be made to look as big powerful and warlike as possible in order to intimidate but privateers the contrary to look as little and defenseless and conceal their power as much as possible till there is a real occasion for it then as suddenly as possible to make it known as the occasion may require to give the greater surprise which i can say from experience may often give great advantages  as to the size and number of great guns the dimensions strength and properties of the ship as mentioned in pages          etc should point out what she will be able to bear without being too crank for a sailing and a fighting ship though it must be allowed that the advantages in a sea fight are greatly in favor of the heaviest shot but the many storms a ship may have to contend with in a winters passage or cruise in a turbulent ocean where the great guns may be often rendered a useless and dangerous encumbrance by the waves running so high that nothing but small arms can be used against the enemy for which reasons a ship should not be overcrowded or overburdened with too heavy cannon  short and light guns recommended our late improvement in the metal casting and boring of iron cannon makes me recommend that they may be made short and as light of metal as possible to bear a sufficient proof which not only gives proportional safety and ease to a ship in the times abovementioned but are managed and fought with greater safety ease and expedition and will do sufficient execution at the small distance the bravery of our people makes it necessary to fight our ships to the greatest advantage and instead of mounting them on the common gun carriage i take the liberty to recommend what i call the swivel carriage not only as a great advantage to the ship in carrying them with more safety and ease all weathers but likewise to the people in exercising or fighting them which i shall endeavor to prove from reason as well as experience  on the common gun carriage great guns mounted on these carriages to be ready at sea in time of war are commonly carried either run out of the ports or kept housed with their muzzles against the ships side at the upper parts of the ports as represented by one in letter d plate   but is much more masterly delineated in falconers famous marine dictionary which came out a good while after my plates were struck off in his  th plate the guns are represented both run out and stowed as last mentioned fig    with the muzzle against the side of the ship above the port and he very judiciously remarks at the securing the guns to hook the takles so that a second breeching may be added lashed and bowsed as tight as possible to prevent the guns from breaking loose which may be productive of dangerous consequences and this by report has so often happened in our royal navy that it was conjectured that the victory a first rate ship of war was lost by it therefore this method of carrying great guns deserve more particular notice  on the method of carrying lower deck guns i own on this occasion to speak principally from the experience of only one ship that had only been three voyages to the east indies when she was fitted out first to cruise three months off the western islands we carried thirtytwo guns and eight of them    pounders on the lower deck housed as last mentioned with their muzzles against the ships side above the ports which when the waves ran high did so work the ship and the ship them with all their tackle about them to such dangerous degrees that for the safety of the whole we were obliged at different times to put these guns down the hold and leave our stations to run for safety to a port to get our leaks stopped  notwithstanding this method is general in all large ships of war that carries lower deck guns yet i appeal to reason and all who have observed or considered what occasions these guns to make so much noise and fetch so much way in and out as the ship rolls works and labors hard at sea as has been mentioned so must these guns be an additional power according to their weight and number added to the weight above them with the masts yards rigging and sails all combine with high waves to strain and make the ships sides bend and fetch the more way as she rolls and especially in that part made weak by the tier of lower deck ports a little above the waters edge where these guns are secured in the manner abovementioned by their breechings at the lower part of the ports and their muzzles confined to the side above the ports which part must naturally bend and give more way when the ship rolls than the lower part of the ports where the breechings are made fast as may be seen by the figures abovementioned by which it must appear evident to reason the cause of lower deck guns breaking loose that this tier of guns in every violent low roll the ship makes those on the lower lee side as it may be called must move altogether and press their muzzles with great power against this lee side to strain it outward so as to slack their takles and breechings greatly when at the same time the weather or upper side bends in proportion against the muzzles of the weather guns to force them inwards farther than the stretching and straining of the breechings can with safety be expected to allow so that i rather wonder that they do not break loose oftener especially in old week laboursome ships and more liable in three deck ships than in two deckers because they have so much more weight and two tier of guns above them to strain and work the ship the more in proportion at the lower deck ports as abovementioned  on carrying the guns run out by this method it must be allowed that they are carried with more ease and safety from the damage and danger abovementioned secured only with their two takles that confines the breast of the carriage close to the side at the cill of the port where the straining of the ship can have little effect between that and the deck to make the guns fetch any way worth notice but they projecting so far without board exposes them at all times and to all weathers and each gun must have what is called a half port which are both troublesome and cumbersome and the gun ports must be kept hauled up that makes what may be called a rough and incumbered outside which in small and deep loaded ships when carrying a stiff sail upon a wind are plunged into the sea and stops water to leeward whilst those to windward hold wind which must naturally be a great hindrance to a ship sailing upon a wind and liable to wet the charge in the guns therefore to remedy these defects and other inconveniences that attend the great guns being mounted on the common carriage is the reason why i take the liberty to speak and recommend a fair trial to be made of swivel carriages for great guns  on swivel carriages for great guns this carriage must be allowed to be somewhat more complex than the common one because it consists of two parts the carriage part with the iron work for the gun takles and breechings as in common with other carriages and the sole of the carriage on which it swivels or turns as occasion requires represented by the figures e and f plate   we had a set of them made for the liverpool privateers guns that carried twelve pound shot the sole parts as represented by the figure f were made about three inches thick with iron axes and lignum vitae six inch trucks so that the gun could be just swivelled about over them on the short bolt figure   that was drove upwards with a square head below that had holes in the corners for four nails and a square plate above a little rounding upwards with holes at the corners fitting the bolt and let in even with the sole at the inner part of which is fixed a dovetail plate with an eye for the train takle and two iron pall that turns in grooves in and out with the direction of the sole on the ends of eye bolts exactly to confine the gun and carriage in a straight direction with the sole as shown by the figures   in the train part of the sole  the carriage part e made as in common with other carriages to fit the size of the gun and when upon the sole the height of the port and to unite it to the sole part right under the trunnions of the gun was fixed a three inch plank with the four bolts of the trunnion irons clinched through it even with the wood and likewise fastened to the cross breastpiece of the carriage with a hole and two square plates one above and another below in the middle as represented figure   at e just to fit and turn easily round the center bolt in the sole figure   where a double forelock goes through the upper end to secure together the sole and carriage part at the in or train part is fixed an inch plank fastened with the eye bolts for the gun takles clinched through it for the bed and quoins of the gun to rest upon and all this lower part of the carriages as well as the upper part of the soles was made as plain and smooth as possible and the stress or friction lay chiefly on the two iron plates under the body of the piece so that when the two palls were turned back the guns could be easily swivelled round by hand any way the occasion required  on those carriages carrying the guns with more convenience ease and safety to the ship than the common carriage this must be allowed to deserve some notice and attention for on a winters cruise or passage in a turbulent ocean there may be more danger from the violence of the waves to be contended with than from the enemies ships and the guns mounted on these carriages after exercise or action at the word of command to house and secure the guns they are swivelled round upon the soles fore and aft with their muzzles forward then the takles hooked to the two eye bolts at the train of the sole which is bowsed with the gun close to the side and there secured by hooking the takles to the eye and ring bolts of the carriage part and to those in the side where the takle falls are expended in lashings round and about the guns by which they may be secured and stowed snug and most out of the way that is possible either on the upper or lower deck close to the ship side without pressing hard against it and with all their weight within board resting on the ends of the beams and the lodging and hanging knees where the decks and the ships sides are strongest to support and carry them not only with more ease and safety but afford more room within board to work and manage the ship than when they are carried run out and gives the advantage of keeping all the ports close shut to keep the guns dry in small or deep loaded ships and cnceals them till it is necessary to show them and avoids all the other disadvantages that has been mentioned to attend their being carried constantly run out these reasons and other advantages that i have experienced attends the sivel carriages i hope will be thought sufficient to recommend them to answer the purpose of carrying the guns with more ease and safety to the ship than the common carriage either on the upper or lower deck where the difference is represented by the two guns in figure d plate    the advantages of these carriages above the common ones either for exercise or action comparative difference can only be known by fair trials in practice in the abovementioned ship liverpool our spare carriages were of the common sort when we were going to exercise our great guns i ordered and had one of them near the midships mounted on a common carriage and had it exercised with the same men along with the other guns as they had done before and gave the word of command proportionally slow as this gun required till the people had got expert in working it then had an empty cask put out for the guns to be pointed at and ordered to go through all the motions of charging and string as fast as they could and observed the difference of time between this gun on the common carriage and the other next it on the swivel carriage at which the people performed regularly all the motions five times for those with the common carriage thrice which must be allowed to be a great difference and these five men quartered at this gn were so tired with their hard labor in proportion to those five at the other guns which beat them so much that they begged to have their gun mounted on their swivel carriage again which i consented to being sufficiently convinced of this difference of five times to three with less labor and fatigue  on pointing the gun to the object in action they have likewise not only the advantage of being fired so much oftener but pointed with more ease and certainty to do execution by the captain of the gun only swivelling and breeching it about by hand and makes the signal to fire when it points directly to the enemy independent of the other people which the common carriage requires to be done by the other men with their gun handspikes to breech about the gun as their captain looks along it and makes motions by tapping on each side of the breech with his hands as his orders cannot be heard makes it very uncertain to got the gun pointed right to his mind for the people are liable to breech the gun too far each way or not far enough that tires his patience especially when he hears other guns fired so long before his may be aggravated contrary to his inclination to make the signal and fire the gun wide of the enemy rather than be thought so much tardier than the other people who may only to show themselves brisk be induced to fire at random if not strictly attended to by their officers and it cannot be expected that they can attend every gun and when the situation of the enemy requires the guns pointed as much forward or aft as the ports will allow as represented by the two guns on the different carriages figure c plate   it may be perceived that the sole of the swivel carriage stands in a direction right in and out that when the gun is fired it recoils right back opposite to the port ready and easily run ut again after charged when that on the common carriage recoils back in the same direction that the gun points a great way from the port that makes it troublesome to get it to the port again and especially if they happen to be the lee guns and the ship heels the difference for the peoples safety in the time of charging the guns likewise deserves notice as may be perceived by the position of the two guns sign d as abovementioned that on the swivel carriage is swiell about so that the people at the muzzle and breech stand sheltered from the small shot that may be fired in at the port when those at the common carriage are exposed to it  but it must be acknowledged that these swivel carriages require a little extraordinary trouble to keep the upper part of the soles clean and greased a little at times to make the guns swivel easy upon them and as it is common to hear objections against new things the only one i heard against these that they would not stand a long and contested fight which i own we had not the trial of having learned from experience that to make the contest short in our favor was to get so near the enemy that our people could not well miss their object and as the takles and breechings are all upon the carriage part i could not perceive from all my experience that they would not bear as long firing as the common carriage for the center bolt etc has nothing to move but the weight of the sole after this i was induced to think this carriage worthy the notice of the managers of our royal navy therefore i got a nice model with a gilt gun etc made and a friend to present it to lord anson then at the head of the admiraly and was ready to give a report of it but my well meant endeavors were disregarded for i never heard or saw any thing further of my gun and carriage afterward  if time after trials should bring these swivel carriages into practice i would recommend what i thought would be a further improvement to enable the captain of the gun to point it to the object with still more ease by having a hole bored tapering in the center of the cascabel of each gun and to have light round handy crows made to fit the holes which in my opinion would give power to a single man to point the gun in any direction from its highest elevation to its lowest depression and without injuring the cascable from answering all its necessary purposes  but in either sort of carriages care should be taken that they are of a proper height for the ports for i have often seen guns mounted so low that when the breech was raised they could not recoil clear of the cill of the ports which is a great fault  on fortifying the quarter deck whatever may contribute to shelter and save the people must be allowed to deserve notice various methods and things have been tried for this purpose i was in a ship that had bags of ox hair that was said would resist even cannon shot but in fighting with a french frigate i saw one of her shot go through eighteen inch of hair and through the middle of an eighteen inch mast and a long way over our ship afterward which proves no fence can be made about a ship against cannot shot but only against small and musket shot a fence may be made many ways  however this fence or breastwork may be made to shelter the people from small shot in common they are no more than breast high so that the musketeers can fire fairly over it upon the enemy but from experience in fighting i have observed among new fighting men there will always be some of them apt to show that natural instinct of selfpreservation and in order to keep their heads under shelter of the breast work from the enemies shot fire their muskets at random up in the air in seeing this and to prevent the bad effect of such examples in fighting i have made a faint lunge at a mans breast with my drawn sword and obliged to threaten death to any man that should show such a bad example though it must be allowed only a failing and not a fault among new undisciplined landsmen first coming to action especially at seeing a man shot through the head above the breastwork may show a little fear but by practice prove brave afterward  therefore to remedy this defect which i perceived in fighting the small arms in fitting out a privateer afterward we had a rail as in common breast high on each side the quarter deck and on the rails were fixed light iron crutches with the arms about a foot square and a shoulder to keep the bottom of the crutches about six inches above the rails and thin boards about six inches broad laid upon the bottom of the crutches and netting with large square matches were so med just to hold a hammoc with its bedding longways and from the gunnel to the rail was boarded up on each side of the stantions and filled up with rope shakens cork shavens etc which is found sufficient proof against musket ball which made so ready and good a fence for the quarter deck musketeers that the most timorous could point his piece with the utmost confidence between the rail and the netting and fire right upon the enemy by having his head as well as his body under such secure shelter  for the same reasons in clearing and preparing the ship for fighting i used to make the forecastle and top men lash the hammocs to shelter them horizontally on the outside of the fore and topmast shrouds close to one another breasthigh then a single hammoc above leaving a little vacancy to point and fire their muskets through which guards that tender and most important seat of knowledge the brain part of the head as well as the other parts of the body which it governs from the enemies small shot  on carrying swivel guns in the tops the high situation of these guns promises a great advantage to do great execution in close fighting but i have learned from experience that there is not room in a small ships top to fight those guns without great danger of fire and blowing up the ammunition chest which we had the misfortune to do that killed one of our topmen for which reasons and the great weight and encumbrance of them and their ammunition at so great a height makes me recommend muskets only to be carried in the tops of small ships as they can be pointed and fired in all directions as occasion may require and so easily and readily charged that they are to be preferred to all combined pieces called organs etc which are also under the disadvantage of taking up more time in proportion to the musket in charging them again  on the powder and shot as the execution of the shot to conquer an enemy depends entirely on the goodness and strength of the powder which differs so much that the greatest care and caution is absolutely necessary to guard against being cheated in the quality of the powder for i have experienced some that looked very fine and good made for the use or rather shameful abuse of the african trade that instead of firing shot with sufficient velocity it would hardly fire itself but spent itself in phizzing one phiz after another out at the touchhole and taken up so much time in burning that it could not be used as priming for great guns  this base practice of making so very weak powder should by some means be put a stop to because it not only hurts the merchant adventurer but the intention of government in giving so large a bounty on exportation for the encouragement of the trade of making good gunpowder therefore it should be either under the inspection of proper essay masters or bring into practice proper methods to try its strength and i can say from experience that the common small pistol powder provers that drives a circular graduated plate round does not answer the purpose for they will differ greatly with the same powder  to prove the powder therefore i would recommend for this purpose of trying powder to have a gun of a half pound shot fixed in a convenient place mounted firm on a wood block or bed elevated exactly at    degrees and the powder to be tried by an ounce charge how far it will throw the half pound shot without any wad and in proportion for every foot or yards distance under or over a standard distance that might be fixed by governments powder to ascertain its strength and value under or over proof according to the different trade or purpose it is designed for as well as for privateers or letter of mart ships which should be of equal goodness with that for the royal navy  on shot the first and principal both for quantity and quality is the round iron cannon ball because it will go and penetrate farther with a greater velocity than any other to do execution when engaging with a superior force but when come to a close fight with a ship of inferior force expecting to make her a prize then the endeavors should be not to destroy the ship if it can possibly be avoided but to distress them to make a submission therefore some suitable shot that will answer that purpose best should be provided and i would recommend round tin cases to fit the bore of the guns and filled with musket ball and square bar iron cut about    inches long tied in bundles with ropeyarns just to fit the guns or cast iron bars about the same length a square one about an inch diameter in the middle and four others quartering rounded on the outside to fit the bore of the guns when tied with rope yarns  on keeping a clean bottom the great difference this makes in a ship steering working and sailing makes it a matter of such importance that all possible means should be used to prevent the ships bottom from growing foul and the best method that i have experienced for this purpose is to be provided with what i call a cask scrubber as represented in plate   fig a which i have often used in different ships with success when at an anchor and in calm weather on the open ocean i had these scrubbers made of elm board about an inch thick and twelve broad the middle part of the frame just to fit a ten gallon cask that was lashed to the battens at each end and the long square spaces on each side of the cask filled with birch broom stuff projecting about six inches without the frame and wedged fast toward the ends with long wedges against boards that slides with small tenants at each end in a groove to keep the birch fast and firm for scrubbing the bottom even close down to the keel and the iron work which unites the two parts by a joint that they may the more naturally ply to the curved or rounding parts of the ships bottom with the slings and the ropes fastened to the eye bolts may all be perceived and understood by looking with attention at the figure that represents that side of the scrubber that is hauled next to the ships bottom  in using this caskscrubber we bad a block lashed under the bowsprit end and another on the driver boom rigged out right aft and a single rope reeved in these blocks and made fast to the slings marked     in the figure and just long enough to veer and haul the scrubber along the bottom fore and aft close to the keel another rope bent to the lower part of the scrubber as marked   and hauled tight under the bottom and made fast to the inside of the boats main thoft when the upper part of the scrubber is even with the waters edge a midships on the other side then the people was ordered to walk fore and aft with the rope to the scrubber till it came up to the waters edge each way the boat moving the same way with the scrubber the people in her helping by pushing their hands against the ships side till the first depth is thought to be clean enough then the people in the boat hauls by their rope the scrubber a depth lower by which and the empty casks it is confined and pressed to the bottom at the different depths till it is scrubbed clean down to and even the keel itself by the rope going fore and aft under it  when a ships bottom can be kept clean by such easy means i think it should be reckoned a great reproach to those who neglect it because success may depend upon it not only in time of war but in peace on southern voyages especially in the african slave trade where i have known a ship that lst the whole adventure of her voyage and come home with her btm covered all over with clusters of mixed shellfish projecting m the bottom and in diameter about six inches each made up of large barnicles mussels and oisters as represented fig b plate   which naturally increased greatly the surface and stopwaters of the bottom to hinder the ship from sailing one half the distance more than she might have done had her bottom been kept clean as abovementioned consequently made her passages in half the time which might have made a gaining instead of so great a loosing voyage for which reasons rather than such a necessary work should be neglected i think it should be made a part of the commanders instructions to do it when it cannot be done by other more effectual means and where iron work is not provided to make a scrubber of this sort of two parts as above mentioned i have thought that one part might be made to answer the purpose and slung with ropes without any iron work  on the sailing of letter of mart ships or privateers situations circumstances and times vary so much that no established rules can be fixed yet i presume something may be said that may prove of some service to inexperienced people in this made  it is a common saying among commanders of ships that it is better to k their wres than their orders which are common on these occasions to proceed with all possible expedition to the designed stations or tracks of the enemies trading ships to take prizes etc but it should be considered for the same reasons that their cruizing and armed trading ships may be expected to be met with in the track of our trading ships that may require to come to immediate action and if the ship and people are unprepared for it for want of being properly stationed and not having had some exercise in their duty of fighting as before mentioned page     it may prove the loss of the whole and as a further inducement to get the ship and people prepared as soon as possible for action i can say from fortunate experience that the richest prize i have been at taking in the course of the two last wars was upon the south coast of ireland which track they had made choice of to avoid our crusing ships on the french coast and to meet with some of our merchant ships in their way one of which they had taken  on stationing and exercising the people for the above reasons the people should as soon as possible be all stationed or quartered to the best advantage according to their capacities the oldest and best seamen to be captains of the great guns the young nimble and expert to the rigging and tops the landmen to the small arms and the boys to be powder carriers for the great guns etc and as they come on board if it is possible that it can be done they should be exercised accordingly and to encourage and make them willing they should be told that not only their success but their safety as well as liberty depends upon their being expert in their exercise which should be with as few easy simple words and motions as possible both for the great guns and small arms that they may the sooner be fit for action  the exercise of the great guns as reduced from  0 words of command as they used to be to    are very well described in falconers marine dictionary but this being for the guns on the common carriages i take the liberty to mention the difference we used for the swivel carriages at the word of command cast loose the gun the train or one of the gun tackles is hooked from an eye bolt amidships to the train of the sole of the carriage and the gun bowsed in till it has room to be breeched about to the foremost pall turned down for that purpose then turn down the after pall which done the guns are then ready to be run out either for exercise or action and when the gun is run out the two palls are to be turned back with one motion then the gun may be breeched about and pointed by hand fore or aft on the object or enemy as much as the width of the port will allow and when the object or enemy is much before the beam let the guns be run out close to the after part of the ports and when abaft the beam close to the fore part of the ports that they may be pointed more fore or aft as the occasion may require and the breechings not being seized but rendered through the thimble at the breech make both parts tight alike to bring the guns up in any direction they may be fired in either foreward or aft and when the guns are run in breech about their muzzles forward to load then turn down the foremost pall and breech the gun to it and then down after pall to run out the gun again as before mentioned  the exercise of small arms i would recommend that it should be done with as few motions as possible and as is done in the front rank of our army kneeling upon the right knee and only rising up to fire as the place and occasion may require which not only keeps the people under shelter but firm in their place to do their duty without being tosted about by the ships motion in the sea especially the landmen who cannot be expected to have got their sea legs as it is called so as to stand firm to load their guns when the ship has much motion  on exercising maneuvers how to atack or defend a ship as soon as the ship has got to sea i would recommend what was my practice that is to take the first possible opportunity to have all hands called to quarters the officers in their stations to have every thing made properly ready and fit for action to have a general exercise not only of the great guns and small arms as before mentioned but the method of working and managing the ship to take the advantage of the openings that i know from experience often occur in attacking or being attacked by another single ship which should be studied by every commander and the designed manoeuvers should be taught the people in their general exercise that they may know how to act and move regularly from one place and side to the other as the occasion may require without confusion which is always the consequence when the intention and management of the manoeuveres are not made known to the people in general  for these reason as soon as possible i used to make known to the people in general that when a ship of near equal force brought to with a design to fight us my intention was not to run directly along side and lie to like a log and depend upon mere battering with one side only nor upon the stern chase guns when it is found that there is no chance of running from a ship of much superior force chacing us and when their best sailing is upon a wind it is a common practice for them to run up and bring to under the lee in a trumphant manner depending on their superior power commonly demanding immediate submission without expecting any resistance the designed manner of resisting or attacking i always endeavored to conceal as long as possible as mentioned page   0 and these two cases give all the advantages desired by my method beginning the attack upon the weather quarter shooting the ship up in the wind with the helm a lee till the after lee gun which we begin with can be pointed upon the enemys stern then fire the leebroad side as it may be called as represented in plate the  th the ship figure   begins the attack upon the ship figure   when the topsails are thrown a back with the helm a lee boxes the ship short round on her heels as mentioned in box hauling page    so as to bring the wind so far aft that the ship may immediately be steered close under the enemys stern as the ship figure   is represented running under the stern of the ship figure   with particular orders to begin with the foremost gun to rake them right fore and aft with the great guns as they pass in that line of direction all aiming and siring to break the neck or cheeks of the rudder head the tiller ropes blocks etc that if possible to destroy the steerage tackle which design if it proves successful takes the management of their ship from them so that she must lie helpless for a time in spite of their endeavors and when the aftermost gun is fired put the helm hard a weather to bring the ship by the wind and then stand off on the other tack to keep clear of their lee broad side and act according to their motions and the experience of the effect your attack has had upon them if they continue to lie to either to renew the attack again in the same manner as soon as the ship will fetch their weather quarter again or to make sail off to escape if it has been found that the great inequality of their superior force admits of no possible chance of conquering them though this manoeuvere may have given this advantage which in my opinion ought always to be attempted and not to submit tamely though a ship is above double the force because by this manoeuvere the power of their broad sides may be chiefly avoided  but when the inequality of force is not so great but there is a possibility of conquering and if the success of the first attack is perceived to oblige the enemy to continue lying to in order to repair the damage done their rudder or tiller etc then the blow should be followed by renewing the attack again with all possible expedition in the same manner which gives the opening not only to fire the whole round of great guns to advantage but also to the marines and topmen to fire their small arms at the same time to great advantange to do the most execution possible by firing and raking them fore and aft through their most open and tender part the stern with the least risk possible from the enemies guns therefore gives the greatest possible chance that i known of to make an easy conquest especially if so lucky as to destroy and prevent the recovery of their steerage a ship of much superior force may be brought to such a distressed condition as to be obliged to make a submission for want of the helm to command her therefore when an opportunity offers in fighting this should be always aimed at  but suppose the enemy laid to as above mentioned find themselves not much hurt by this manoeuvere and that you have not succeeded in destroying their steerage and therefore you may expect that they will immediately tack or ware ship and stand after you depending on their advantages of sailing faster and superior force runs up along your lee side expecting by making a general discharge of their small arms and great guns charged with suitable shot on your deck which lies open to them by the ship heeling to destroy your people and to make you submit when this is likely to be their design orders should be given to your people to keep themselves as snug under shelter as possible from their small shot till their general discharge is over then if the ship is found not so disabled but that the topsails can be thrown a back to make a general discharge from the lee side of the great guns loaded with round shot only pointed to the weather side of the enemies bottom amidships to one point at the water edge and box haul the ship to run close under their stern aiming at raking and destroying their steerage with the other broad side and stand off on the other tack as before mentioned to act according to circumstance and the condition you find yourselves in compared with the appearance of that of the enemy and their motions who may be obliged to continue on the other tack to repair damages about their rudder or to stop their leaks in the weather side of their bottom if your aim has proved successful  but when an enemys ship of force makes only a running fight if there is no necessity to cut them off from the shore or from the shelter of other ships etc and you have the advantage of sailing faster o an enemy of force making a running fight the most sure and likely method to make an easy conquest with the least hurt to yourselves or their ship your expected prize is to run close up and shoot or sheer your ship across their stern each way making a general discharge of all your force first with one broad side then the other always aiming with the great guns at the rudder head and steerage tackling for the reasons given that if the shot miss the rudder etc they by raking the ship fore and aft through the stern does the greatest execution possible to distress them so as to make a submission  on this occasion when it blows fresh and obliges to carry a pressing sail large or before the wind to make the great guns as ready as possible and prevent their being fired too low all their breeches should be laid quite down in the carriages and if your ship is crank the yards should be braced so as to shiver the sails at the time each broad side is fired  in all these manoeuvers when the whole round of great guns are designed to be fired care should always be taken to leave two or more men as it may require to charge each gun again when fired on one side whilst the others move over to fire the guns on the opposite side that neither side may be left unguarded all which with every other advantageous manoeuver that may be designed to be put in practice in action on exercising with a risk to point the guns and fire at should be taught the people along with the general exercise of great guns and small arms as before hinted that i have done by throwing a tight empty beef cask over board making it the object of attack for all the guns to be pointed at when performing the above described or other intended manoeuvers about it first by running a little way large from it then haul the wind tack ship and stand toward it keeping it about three points on the lee bow till within a half cables length or musket shot of it then put the helm alee and shoot the ship up in the wind with the topsails aback till the after gun can be pointed to the cask then give the word of command to fire when there is a fair opening to make a general discharge both below and aloft on that side as represented plate the  th the ship figure   beginning the attack on the weather quarter of the ship figure   as before described which the cask may be supposed to represent as well as the ship figure   when you have box hauled your ship and run close past the cask to make a general discharge from the other side as represented by the ship figure   then bearing round away from it waring and haul the wind on the other tack till you can tack and fetch up to it again to repeat this or perform any other manoeuvers that may give an advantage to attack or defend a ship laid to or sailing upon a wind as above mentioned to perform the manoeuver of attacking an enemy that makes a running fight large or before the wind it is only to turn far enough to windward of the cask to give room in sailing down to it to bring the ships broad side to point to it each way but to perform this manoeuver to the greatest advantage with the least loss of time and the ships way through the water which may be of great importance on this occasion to keep close up with the enemy therefore all the great guns should be run out close to the after part of the ports that they may be pointed as far forward as the sides of the ports will admit and elevated as the heeling of the ship when brought to to fire may require as before mentioned and particular orders should be given for the aftermost guns on each side to be fired first as soon as they can be brought to bear upon the enemy because then the ship need not be brought any more to but steered in that direction till the other guns are fired then shift the helm to ware to bring the other broad side to bear etc  after the people have been thus disciplined it is necessary to let them smell powder as it is termed and a little ammunition spent in exercise is allowed may be the means to save a great deal expended to little or no purpose in action therefore i used to allow a small charge of powder for the round of great guns with stone ballast for shot and the musketeers two charges with balls each and give them a fair chance by these manoeuvers to fire both broad sides great guns and small arms at the cask if they sunk it all hands to have an allowance of grog as it is called but if they did not sink it to have the trouble and mortification to hoist out the boat and fetch it on board to serve another time by some such means and methods only it is possible to make the people expert in their duty to fight a ship to the greatest advantages but two ships in concert exercising the different manoeuvers by turns as might be agreed upon and making a sham fight with powder only would contribute most to answer this purpose and to find out the best trim of their ships for sailing by the people moving fore and aft with as many shot as they all can carry with them etc  on a ship cruising in her station situations and circumstances are so variable that no certain rules can be laid down for this purpose yet i think hints may be given that may contribute toward getting sight of and fall in with the enemies trading ships when got in their track on which success entirely depends  cruising the war before last in the employ of that great hero fortunatus wright in the mediterranian sea where the wind blows generally either easterly or westerly that is either up or down the straits therefore it was planned with either of these winds that blew to steer up or down the common channels the common course large or before the wind in the day time without any sail set that the enemys trading ships a stern crouding sail with this fair wind might come up in sight on cruising without sail in the day and under topsails at night or we come in sight of those ships a head that might be turning to windward and at sunset if nothing appeared to an officer at the mast head we continued to run five or six leagues as far as could then be seen before we laid the ship to for the night to prevent the ships astern coming up and passing out of sight before morning or we passing those ships that might be turning to windward and if nothing appeared to an officer at the mast head at sunrise we bore away and steered as before and when the wind blowed across the channels that ships could sail their course either up or down then to keep the ship in a fair way in the day time to steer the common course under the courses and lower staysails and in the night under topsails with the courses in the brails with all things as ready as possible to take or leave what we might fall in with in the night  many other advantages attend cruising without any or but with low sails set as above mentioned in the day time and fine weather when other ships are crowding with all their lofty sails set one may be seen at twice the distance of the other which gives the opportunity to see them a long time before they can see you who may take their bearing by the compass and observe how they alter by which it may be perceivable how they are steering and consult what is best to be done not always to give chase at the first seeing a ship if it is too late in the day to give chase which should always be considered that three mast ships in fine weather with all their lofty sails set may be seen from each others mast heads seven leagues distance which must make a seven hours chase at three miles an hour difference in the ships sailing which is a great deal with a leading wind and if the chase happens to be to windward must make it still longer in proportion of time to come up with her and when they perceive they are chaced and think themselves in danger of being taken will naturally use all possible means to escape out of sight by altering their course in the dark if they cannot be got near enough to keep sight of them in the night  for these reasons without the time situations circumstances and appearance require immediately to give chase with all your sail at the first sight of a vessel otherwise it often happens that you may stand a much better chance to speak with a vessel by endeavoring to way lay and conceal your design and ship from them which may be done even in the day time with all the sails furled as beforementioned till within about four leagues distance that is computed a ships hull in a clear horrison begins to appear above it when this concealment can be made and to be all ready prepared to take or leave and can fall in with the expected enemy in the night or early next morning if they are found unprepared for action must give a great advantage over them but when you cannot be concealed from the expected enemies vessels in sight that may be coming with a fair wind toward you then it should be considered whether instead of giving chase with all your sail set in fine weather it may not be better to disguise your ship to appear as an inoffensive neutral ship by geting your fore and mizen topgallant yards down and the mast struck with only their heads above the caps as mentioned page the   th and either stand upon the wind with the maintop gallant sail set if not noticed till by tacking you can fetch near the intended chase or to steer near the same course with them with stop waters towed in the water which i have been doing with success to make the ship sail so comparatively slow as to induce an enemy to come faster up with you than you could with them by chasing  on chasing in chasing all possible pains should be taken to set and trim the sails to the best advantage as has been mentioned on that subject and to consider the properties of your ship if she excels most in sailing upon a wind when chasing with a leading wind the chase should be kept upon your weather bow to prevent her getting to leeward of you but if you excel most in sailing large and not upon a wind the chase should be kept upon the lee bow to prevent her getting to windward of you or according to the motions of the chase that will naturally endeavor to make use of the same advantages of their best sailing and if they are a light ship or lightly loaded they will sail better large than upon a wind and if a deep loaded ship better upon a wind than large etc all which deserves notice to chase to the best advantage and as soon as it can be done the helmsman should see and be directed how to keep and steer steady by the chase independent of the cun which is known to help a ships sailing to come up with the chase  but it often happens in chasiing that night comes on which makes it very uncertain how long or whether the chase can be seen or not though many may pretend to see her plain long after she has been lost sight of by the commander who should not depend upon other peoples eyes without trying every now and then whether they point to see the chase in one and the same part of the horizon when the ship is privately ordered to be wared about from her course a point or two of the compass each way and according as they agree or disagree from this rule either to continue or leave off chase and crowd sail to get ahead and way lay the chase in the way they seemed to be bound which from experience i can say gives the best chance of falling in with them again  on towing and rowing a ship in chase chasing in little winds and calms may often require both to tow and row the ship with oars therefore to do it in the most advantageous manner deserves notice when towing a ship to make her steer and work it may require the tow rope not only from the bowsprit end but from the jib boomend which will give more power in proportion as it is farther from the ships turning motion to pull her about but when towing to give a ship the most head way possible the tow rope should be made fast no higher than necessary to keep it clear of the water  to row the ship with oars the oars should be made suitable to the room the ship affords to row and stow them in the liverpool privateer before mentioned we rowed with eleven oars on each side and sculled with two run out right aft after the manner of the chinese and in order to add more power by more people pulling altogether at the oars on each side and prevent the confusion and hindrance that is occasioned by the peoples not pulling altogether we had swifters for each side made of single ropes with gromits in them at the same distance of the row ports from each other and put on the handles of the oars so that men could pull between the oars by these swifters which after a little practice soon made all the people pull completely together  the two sculling oars abaft were made crooked or curved with the flat of their blades bending downwards and an iron socket nailed to the under part of the oar at the port when the blade was flat in the water on sculling oars and a short bolt tapered and filed like a woodscrew with a round head was fixed in the middle of the ports for the oars to turn upon and staples in the deck right under the handle of the oars to hook a line with an eyesplice on the handle of the oar that bears the strain whilst the men scull by standing on each side of the handle of the oar and only have to pull to and push from them with all their strength which makes the blade cant and act slanting downwards into the water each way with great power to give the ship head way and may likewise help to steer the ship and bring her about from one tack to the other when it cannot be done by the rudder and sweep a ships stern about as occasion may require when engaging in a calm on sculling in china the comparative power and effect of sculling oars to force a vessel through the water is indisputably proved in china where the people appeared to me no ways expert in their navigation but in this method of sculling all their very numerous river vessels and passage boats great and small without any sail or rudder and this they do in a more dexterous easy and expeditious manner in my opinion than any other part of the world that i have seen i have observed with pleasure their vessels with  0 tons of goods and room to accommodate their families sculled by two men only from the city of canton  0 miles to our ships stemming and sculling against the tide running above two miles an hour and laying the ships on board in a safe and easy manner and not only their large river vessels but their small boats are moved very fast through the water by this method of sculling i was one in a fine eight oard pinnace that was beat with ease and laughed at by two men in one of their common bumbboats in spite of our utmost endeavors this therefore deserves notice and might in my opinion be brought into useful practice among us on many occasions in narrow rivers canals boats to land numbers of men where there is not room to row with oars and our whale boats etc for with the very power they scull the vessel ahead they steer her at the same time which must on this account be much better than a rudder that stops water as has been observed on rudders i cannot forbear here remarking that these chinese sculling vessels are built upon good principles to answer their purpose as all vessels that are to be moved with oars or paddles ought to be having flat rounding bottoms with flanging projecting bows and sterns without keel stem or stern post to hinder their ready turning and drawing so little water that they are easily made to skim in a manner at a great rate over the surface of it where the particles give way much easier than they can do at a greater depth on porposses sculling with the tails and their method of sculling makes them as much as possible for art to imitate the nature of porpoises which scull with their horizontal tails swifter than any other fish we see at sea where they frequently seem to sport and mock a ship when sailing at the rate of ten miles an hour and will swim as may be observed sculling with their horizontal tails cross and cross the ships bows at such an angle that they cannot go less than at the rate of  0 miles an hour which must be allowed to make greatly in favor of the chinese method of sculling their vessels instead of rowing them as we do with oars which are levers and our method of applying their power in rowing will in my opinion never be beat by any complicated machinary  on coming to action now we may suppose a ship to have come up so far with her chase as to perceive them to have the appearance of enemies and preparing for action then the appearance of their force and motions should be strictly observed by the commanding officer and he must proceed accordingly to make all necessary preparations in good time against the worst that may happen guarding against being surprised unprepared by any sham appearance and motions that may be used to deceive as i was in a cruizing ship the war before last when the starboard side of our mizen top was shot away by the enemy before our commander would permit all hands to be called to clear ship for action  when come so near to the enemy in chase that they prepare and fire their stern chase guns which is a sign of weakness and fear and which commonly gives joy to the chasing ship though it must be allowed to give them a chance of shooting away some of your masts and helps their ship forward but as success depends entirely upon getting close up to have them at command therefore without some good reason you should not be tempted to fire your bowchace guns because they will stop your ships head way that may occasion the loss of your expected prize  but when the chase is perceived to be a ship of force preparing and clearing ship for action without running out their stern chase guns then all possible pains and expedition should be used to clear ship and make all the necessary preparations that the circumstances of the time and attack may seem to require to have the yards slung the topsail sheets stopperd to leave nothing to be done but to haul up the courses to come regularly to action  on providing drink for the people another preparation i would recommend when by the enemys appearance it is likely to prove a hard battle and sighting vigorously especially with great guns is such hard work that soon exhausts the peoples spirits and makes them so thirsty as to induce them to go from their quarters to get drink to remedy and prevent this as much as possible when the ships stores will afford it as i have done to order the ships steward to prepare and be ready when called on to mix a gallon of rum or brandy according to their strength with five or six gallons of water in a bucket and with a pint pot serve the people round at their quarters and the top men should have a can slung to haul up their allowance  to suppose chasing with the wind large and that the enemy hauls up his courses and brings to in form of battle on running end on to begin the attack with the maintop sail aback etc as if he thought it most advantageous to begin the attack by firing his broad side to rake you fore and aft as you are running down large right end on toward his broad side which in my opinion is a maneuver that by britons ought never to be refused though it was given as a reasonable excuse for a late unfortunate admirals not running right down upon the enemy who laid to waiting for him for i can say from reason as well as experience when running right down upon the enemy we have received two broad sides in the time without receiving any damage of consequence for it should be considered running in that direction a ship is not above a quarter part as big an object for the enemy to hit as when broad side to and the shape of the bows and built much the strongest part of a ship and may deflect many shot that may hit her in that slanting direction  therefore i think it a point of duty on this occasion to run right down and bring to with the the topsails aback close on the enemys weather quarter and begin the attack by making a general discharge from the lee side then box haul the ship and run close under their stern and make a general discharge from the other side aiming at raking them fore and aft and if the power of the enemy appears to require it put the helm hard over to bring the ship by the wind on the other tack till you can fetch the enemys weather quarter again if they continue to lie too then put the ship about and repeat the attack by the same maneuver as before fully described as well as that of attacking a ship of force that makes a running sight in the exercise of these maneuvers beginning at page     a forestay sail as before mentioned is absolutely necessary for a sighting ship to make her manageable on these occasions when her courses are brailed up  but it must be allowed that a ship is liable to be disabled in her masts yards rigging etc so as to hinder the performing often the abovementioned maneuver still all advantages and openings are to be taken and none given to the enemy in fighting and i know from experience that our people fight much more to advantage in proportion as they are brought near to the enemy who we will suppose continues lying too to fight and that your ship may be disabled from or think it unnecessary to perform the above mentioned maneuver even then i would recommend to begin the attack close upon the enemys weather quarter as the ship figure   is represented attacking the ship figure   plate the  th and only by backing and filling the sails as the circumstances of your own and the enemys ship and people may be observed to require  in performing this maneuver of backing and filling when the enemy lays his ship too to fight on attacking by backing and filling the sails as last mentioned it should be made a certain rule at your ship getting stern way by backing the sails that the helm should be put hard aweather to make her back the farther astern before she loses her stern way so as to gain the more room to get sufficient headway upon your ship to be more under command of the helm to steer and shoot her at pleasure either on the lee or weather quarter of the enemy who lying to with their helm alee is under no command but alternately comes to and falls off from the wind which may being observed take the advantage and shoot your ship up in the wind close under and across their stern raking them fore and aft with what may be called your lee broad side and after that the ship may be backed and boxed off at pleasure to fill and shoot up upon the enemys lee quarter to discharge your weather broadside and back all the sails especially after sail with the helm aweather when the ship gets stern way to make her back the farther astern of the enemy where all the guns may be loaded again and all things made properly ready with more safety to repeat the attack in the same manner if the enemy continues to lie to which may be done by the above management for in making the stern board with the helm aweather and the after sails sharp aback your ship rather gains ground to windward whilst the enemy with the maintopsail only aback drives to leeward and shoots ahead so that when your sternway is done by filling your aftersails your ship may be loffed up to fetch up under the enemys stern again to act as their situation and behavior compared with your own may admit  this maneuver of backing and filling which may be easily continued in practice as long as the masts and yards stand in a three mast ship and gives a great advantage when attacking or being attacked by sloop schooner or any row galley as vessels so rigged cannot back their sails then it may be necessary to have both stern and bow chase run out to prevent their raking or run you on board in those unguarded parts  but let us now suppose that the enemy is found but of equal force to yourselves yet it is still the duty of all commanders to endeavor by all prudent means to avoid being exposed to the enemys shot and to observe and take all advantages that offer beginning and continuing the attack by maneuvers as long as the enemys management admits of it as beforementioned attacking them close under the stern and quarters and not out of bravado to run up along side to try their strength until by your superior conduct and bravery and by appearances you have weakened and distressed them to such a condition that it is but reasonable to save lives and property they should make a submission when threatened with your being prepared and determined in their total destruction if they refuse to submit  but when an enemy on coming near proves much inferior in force and stands no common chance to resist your power then interest as well as humanity to preserve both men and ships from harm on keeping the enemy always before the beam and not to board before driving them from their close quarters requires to run close up to their quarter and demand immediate submission but take care always to keep them before your beam which gives an opportunity to observe their motions and behavior and your own peoples at the same time and prevents their taking any of those advantages that have been described whereby a ship of small force may hurt or escape from one of much greater power and suppose they refuse to submit and take shelter from your shot in their close quarters and expect to be boarded and take the advantage to destroy your people from those close quarters for which reason without some very urgent motives i would never sacrifice men to board them and sight against the great advantages that close quarters afford but manage so as to lay your ships broad side right across their stern and there if possible to secure them by making fast to each of their quarters and raking them through the stern fore and aft to drive them from their close quarters after which your people may be boarded to take possession and take their chance to oblige them to make a submission to prevent farther destruction of the ship or people which both interest and humanity demands from the conquerors as far as it is consistent with their own safety  on treating prisoners of war after an enemy submits and surrenders themselves prisoners of war then not only all hostilities but treacherous designs should immediately cease on both sides and for the health and happiness of the whole while they are obliged to live together in one ship the prisoners should be treated with all the lenity and liberty that safety and good order will admit of and not to aggravate and augment their unfortunate situation by cruel usage and close confinement below to breed disorders and discontent to drive them out of fatal necessity to desperate attempts for their liberty  yet it must be allowed when prisoners of war have their liberty it requires extraordinary care and caution to guard against giving them any opening or advantage that may induce them to attempt rising to take your ship from you in the war      cruising in the mediterranean with the prisoners of three french prizes on board at their entire liberty upon deck apprehending no danger from them upon an occasion i imprudently ordered all our sails to be clewed up and all our people upon deck to go up and hand them with all possible expedition one of the french captains thought to avail himself of the advantage of our people being mostly aloft i providentially perceived he was going to give the alarm for their people to rise and take the ship i put my hand in my pocket took hold of my pocket pistol ran up close to him and told him coolly that he should be the first that should die by the attempt which stopped his proceeding and i calmly ordered our people to come down as fast as possible which they did and made me very thankful to providence for the escape from this danger which i thought afterward might have been avoided by ordering their seamen to go up aloft mixed with ours to do the working part of duty as such occasions may require which cannot be thought unreasonable whilst prisoners of war they are allowed the same provision and liberty as their conquerors as far as is consistant with safety  therefore to enjoy this mutual advantage all such ungrateful and unfair attempts should be discountenanced and abolished from amongst all civilized nations i further learned from this mans attempt what little dependence is to be put on ceremonious professions for this man when first brought on board our ship made many apologies and begged that he might not be illtreated for the resistance he made in defending his ship he was answered that he should be treated rather better than worse for doing his duty like a brave and honest man  on sayings and signs of good or bad weather this is of such importance to navigation as to deserve notice whether any or how far such signs or sayings may be observed or depended upon from experience to be of any use to seamen  it must be allowed that our world and system of worlds and the whole creation as far as we can observe are governed by the almighty creator present to all parts that are moved by his general laws so as to be subservient to answer all the just purposes not only of his general but superintending special providence yet we are told by revelation that our ever blessed savor maker of the world who showed his command of the elements and all nature as far as we know accused the jews who would not descern the signs of the times as foretold respecting himself but the signs of the weather by observations when the sky was red in the evening a sign of fair weather but when red and lowering in the morning a sign of foul weather when seeing a cloud rise out of the west there comes a shower and so it is and when the south wind blows there will be heat and it comes to pass and these signs continue to be observed here to this day and st paul in his voyage to rome in the season of the year when sailing was become dangerous told what would be the consequence to the centurion who believed the owner and master of the ship more than st paul when the south wind blew softly thought they had obtained their purpose but it proved not only great hardships with loss of the ship and cargo but a narrow providential escape of their lives as foretold by st paul  for these reasons all that is known from experience either from the barometer signs or sayings that may any way contribute to point out to seamen the weather and winds likely to be deserves mentioning at least to make them more familiar to observation how they answer  between and near the tropicks it has been often remarked by the learned that both winds and weather are mostly periodical at different seasons of the year the barometer varies but very little but in higher latitudes both north and south like the winds and weather it varies greatly all the year round as mentioned pages       and though this instrument is found defective at times yet it must be allowed the best guide we have for the purpose of showing signs of good or bad weather and i have been lately told from good authority and experience that the ingenious edward narn optition makes the marine barometer to stand the ships motion at sea without being disturbed as beforemetioned i must own the many years observations i have made on the barometer since i printed off the above pages i have often been disapointed in expecting an easterly wind from the glass being high which i find happens with westerly as well as all other winds and that a quick rise as well as a quick fall of the quicksilver shows changeable and uncertain weather and that these changes of the weather and winds no way depend upon the situation or phases of the moon or the sun at the equinoxes as they are too generally thought to do in this climate  from what has been said on this subject it is not to be doubted but that alterations are made in the density of the different parts of the atmosphere that may cause the elements to move so as to give the appearences in the sky from which these signs and sayings had their rise the evening red and the morning gray is the sign of a fine day a clear n w and a foul s e horizon a fishermans night a rainbow or weather gall at morn fine weather all gone but a rainbow toward night fair weather in sight it is reckoned a bad sign when terestial objects at a distance appear extraordinary clear and near and when the stars appear very numerous and glaring the first of the night and when a great white frost appears in the morning  relating to winds when the sun sets in clear an easterly wind you need not fear when the sun sets under a bank a westerly wind you need not want when the wind blows cold it is likely to hold an easterly wind right commonly abates at night our frequent long westerly gales commonly end in varying about to the northward but when the wind backs against the sun as it is called to the southward in the afternoon it is a sign of bad weather and the gale continuing at coming on of squally and blowing weather when the wind comes before the rain lower down the topsails and hoist them again but when the rain comes before the wind first reef and then hand  but to sail from a port or roadsteed or carrying sail at sea in suspicious weather must be left to the commander to form a judgment to act as appearence situation and circumstances may require yet i cannot help remarking i have known many great fatal and total losses by sailing in southerly winds with drizling rain especially in the winter season which in this climate for seamen may be reckoned to begin with october and end in march when the wind from being moderate at s s e after flies about suddenly to the westward and to n n w the opposite point of the compass and blows with such violence as to do great damage and be very distructive to shipping when they are catched unprepaired with a great deal of sail set besides that storm mentioned pages  th and  th i have known many others that have been very destructive and one in particular that deserves notice to go against that vile cruel practice of pressing seamen for governments service in the latter part of last foreign war in the evening i saw one of his majestys snows of war with all sail set crowding away with a large wind at s s e and rainy weather with about   0 pressed men on board that night the wind flew suddenly round to the opposite point n n w and blew a storm that must have overset and sunk her for no remains was ever found but her barge that had floated off the booms so that with a southerly wind and rain ships should be upon their guard and not be covetous of the weather shore for fear it may suddenly prove a dangerous lee one on our coasts  on ships in distress sudden distress of ships at sea has often struck their crews with such panicks as to occasion them in many instances to take the worst instead of the best means or methods for their safety or relief their minds being so discomposed at such times like physicians when sick are reckoned very unfit to prescribe for themselves therefore the utmost endeavors should be used to say all that is thought possible to be of any service on these melancholy occasions as far as circumstances and situation can be described to happen  for it is but too well known that many people after suffering great hardships have lost their lives by too rashly quitting their ships in their boats when they might have been saved if they had staid by their ships  on dangerous leaks suddenly breaking out as soon as the pumps are manned and set to work the utmost endeavors should be immediately used and all possible means tried to find out and stop the leak before the people become jaded by pumping which from experience i can say gives a much better chance for safety than a continual pumping which may prove inefectual without endeavoring to stop the leak  i was in a ship crusing in the western ocean in a gale of wind when the step of our foremast gave way and made so great a leak under it though we had two chain as well as two hand pumps as obliged us to pump with our utmost exertion for half an hour at a spell without ceasing till we unbent our spritsail stitched it over one side with oakum and with ropes to the clews and carings applied it to the leak which stoped it so that we soon freed the ship from water for a time and the spritsail may very well be spared and being made very strong to bear washing is best adapted to answer this purpose and by good management may be applied to any part of a ships bottom to give the oakum a chance to be forced into the leak  when a ship proves weak and works the oakum out so as to make dangerous leaks between wind and water it is common to nail sheet lead upon the seams which i can say from experience that lead breaks by the ships working especially when she hauls under the chains as it is called the strain of the masts and shrouds making the seams open and shut as the ship rolls leather or canvas nailed on slack with oakum under will answer the purpose much better than lead  on a ship overset or laid on her side at sea to recover and get a ship upright from this dismal and dangerous situation with the least damage possible is certainly a task that deserves the utmost attention  the most common method is to cut away the ships masts especially the main and mizen masts in order to make her ware and bring the wind on the other side but reason as well as experience has often proved that this desperate and expensive method has not answered the purpose for the ships hull in that position greatly becalms the masts especially the lower masts and sails and prevents the rudder from having the effect upon the water as to make the ship ware in further confirmation of this i was told by a commander that put this desperate remedy in practice that it would not have answered the design if it had not happened from an accident that some of the lower standing rigging on the lee side being omitted to be cut brought the masts up and made such stop waters on the lee quarter as that only caused the ship to ware  i have heard of another accident that recovered a light coal ship that had canted her ballast at sea and overset so low on her side that the bower anchor happened by chance to go from the lee bow and the cable running out that it took hold in the ground so as to bring the wind ahead which took the sails aback and cast the ship on the other tack when they soon got her trimmed upright again i was in a light coal ship that hove out all her ballast at sea with a scant wind to sail into tinmouth haven where the pilots as well as seamen are the most dexterous in the world in narrow channels these men for the good reason of making their ships sure in stays always work them with their mainsail and all sail that they can carry set when we came to haul our ship by the wind she laid down on her side so as to bring her keel and rudder out of the water to windward our pilot had the presence of mind to let go the lee anchor which brought the ship round to with the wind on the other bow that took the sails aback as they were sharp braced up this immediately brought the ship upright again so that we hauled up the courses hove up the anchor and drove to windward into the harbor by the tide backing and filling under our topsails without any damage  on recovering a ship upright without cutting away the masts the above instances evidently point out what at least should be tried on these dreadful occasions if ground is to be reached by any means the lee anchor or anchors should be immediately let go if it is possible to bring the wind upon that bow that is laid down then the wind may act upon the masts and sails that may be set so as to bring the ship upright again as abovementioned which may be called club hauling a ship to get her from one tack to the other as mentioned page    but in deep water where anchors can be of no service i would recommend that if a towline hawser or cable end can be readily come at and the driver boom hen coops or any other bulkey things can be slung by the middle with ropes and made fast to it or even the driver or any other sail with the clews stopped so as to make a drag sail and veered away with a long scope over the lee quarter to make such great stopwaters as to make the ship ware and bring the wind on that quarter that is down that the ship may be brought to on the other tack and the sails trimmed so as to get her upright again without cutting away the masts which nothing can justify but the utmost necessity to save a ship from foundering because of the great distress this brings the ship under for want of her masts especially her lower masts when they may have a long run to their designed port or to a place where they can get this great damage repaired  to make a ship ware and steer that has lost her foremast to do this must be of the utmost consequence to a ship meeting with this misfortune in a dangerous situation therefore i venture to give my opinion that this may be done by the last mentioned method that is by veering a hawser or cable end over the lee quarter but without any stopwaters only the nun buoys david or any spare spars masts or yards lashed along it to buoy it up from taking the ground in case of coming into shoal water in little wind this will act with great power with the helm to make the ship ware and steer at pleasure and as it is common in many ships to carry a yard across the stern with a block at each end for a driver boom this i would recommend for this purpose and the hawser or cable to be veered out abaft the mizen shrouds over it to guy it more or less from the quarter according as the ship may have occasion to sail that makes her gripe more or less on the helm so as to require it and it may be easily shifted from side to side to answer sailing upon both tacks to be guyed the more to leeward in proportion to the ships griping and when sailing before the wind to secure it over the middle of the stern will prevent the ship broaching to against the helm both ways and this would answer the purpose to make a deep loaded bad steering ship to steer better and prevent her broaching to either way in spite of their best helmsmen by which they are sometimes obliged to lie too with a fair wind as i was told by the commander of a ship who was an expert seaman and a good commanding officer was often obliged to do  on steering a ship that has lost her rudder the method used and found from experience to answer by two of his majestys ships of war and has been made public should be first recommended yet it must be allowed that ships often lose their rudders in narrow channels when they have neither time nor materials to make such perfect towing machines as those used by his majestys ships  on steering a ship with a cable end therefore i would propose a hawser or cable end with the nun buoys spare spars masts or yards lashed along it to buoy it up in case of coming into shoal water and a boom rigged out on each side close aft athwart the stern with a block on each at equal distance as far as they can be supported from the stern and a block on the rail or cunwell exactly opposite the middle of the barrel of the wheel where the steering rope marked with a rope yarn in the middle is to be taken with three or five turns round the wheel when the midship spoke and the mark on the rope is right up then the two ends to be passed across from the under part of the wheel and reeved through the blocks on each side and made fast to the hawser or cable that is to be towed astern exactly amidships and as tight as it can well be to go clear of the stern and veer and heave freely from side to side as the steering the ship with the trimming of the sails on this occasion may require  the wheel rope leading under the barrel of the wheel on this occasion gives a great advantage because the wheel is to be hove round the same way as when the rudder was in its place so that the ship may be cunned starboard and port luff and no near hard a weather or hard a lee as occasion may require it for turning the wheel to put the helm a port heaves the towing machine up to the block on the starboard quarter which stops water on that side and brings the ships head that way and acts with the same power when hove over to the other side etc which is the readiest and best makeshift that i know of for this purpose when no other help can be had and to suppose this misfortune to happen to a vessel that has not a steering wheel it requires no great labor or ingenuity to six a makeshift wheel of a boats windlass or wench or other materials that may be found on board and contrived to six it abaft the binnicle as the best place to answer this purpose   but when it happens that help and assistance can be had from other vessels on this occasion i think it necessary to remark here that i have known ships that have lost their rudders on the sand banks at iverpool that have been steered through narrow dangerous channels by two pilot sloops one with all her sails set leading and towing in a ir way with a rope a head of the ship which had but little sail set and that trimmed as occasion required whilst the other pilot sloop with a rope from each quarter was towed a stern of the ship without any or but occasional sail ready to set to steer and sheer her with the helm on each quarter of the ship as the occasion required to confine her to follow the leading sloop in a fair way till towed into safety  on the danger of a lee shore in a gale of wind when the waves run high of all distresses at sea these are generally allowed to be the greatest and most people pity seamen when in a gale of wind but none so much as those who know from experience the hardships they go through in cold weather long dark winter nights dangerous situations and near a lee shore especially if it is a rocky one when the waves run high it is most to be dreaded and the utmost endeavors should be used to keep from it because it gives little or no chance of saving either ship or the lives of even the best of swimmers  i knew a melancholy instance of this best of swimmers stand but little chane to save themselves two algerine ships of war were drove on shore with a s w gale of wind on the s w coast of the island of minorca and both ships were immediately beat to pieces and the people about  00 in number though the best of swimmers were all drowned or rather killed by the waves against the rocks except one man who upon a piece of wreck happened to be thrown so high upon the shore as to get out of the back sweep of the waves which waves killed the others as might be observed by the bruised wounds on their bodies though this rocky shore was not so steep but i could walk up and down it upon my feet without using my hands to support myself  to avoid such fatal consequences as these which often attend ships going upon a lee shore every possible effort of mind and body should be exerted and tried to preserve and keep the ships off from the shore as being the only chance to save the lives of the crews and the property that is under their charge by which conduct only it is that the hardy and brave officers and seamen can be distinguished from the soft cowardly lazy skulking lubbers who give themselves and the ship up in a cowardly manner to go on shore rather than undergo the hardship to be obliged to contend with the weather wind and waves which is certainly their duty to do as long as there is the least appearance of a chance by any means to avoid the dreadful danger and by which only it is that they can reasonably expect providence to favor them for it is an allowed maxim in common life that it is to little purpose to endeavor to help those who will not endeavor to help themselves and too often are met with dastardly lazy skulkers at sea who when obliged to be exposed to the weather for want of resolution to rouse and exert themselves become so feeble and helpless that they are perished and die with cold when the brave man at the same time may be swetting with struggling manfully in the discharge of his duty  on a ship being near a dangerous lee shore to keep a ship off from a dangerous lee shore so long as she can carry such sail as will give her good way through the water upon a wind to try to clear the shore by carrying sail and to box haul when the ship refuses  is certainly the best method to try what can be done by carrying sail and also reducing all tophamper that holds wind as much as possible for if the shore proves so deep or the bottom so rocky as not to afford safe anchorage then safety may depend entirely on carrying sail and suppose the ship is found imbayd so that she will not clear the shore on one tack and that the waves run so high that the ship will not stay yet she may be boxhauled and wared to lose very little ground as mentioned page    on boxhauling and the instance of turning to windward out of mounts bay mentioned page     with the method we used in boxhauling represented in the figures     plate the  th therefore despair should not take place but an example of spirit and resolution shown by the officers after having consulted together and the people plainly told what is resolved upon and that there is no other chance left to save the ship and their lives but to carry all the sail possible to work the ship in the most perfect manner and when she refuses stays to boxhaul her as before fully described  suppose in this situation it is found that the ship will not clear the shore on either tack and after the utmost endeavors she is perceived to lose ground but as there is no anchorage there is no other means but to continue turning to the last as the wind may abate or it may vary or change in your favor which was the case of an intimate friend of mine who kept turning though fell to leeward instead of getting to windward under these unvoidable circumstances till they thought it would be the last tack they could possibly make before they must be on shore when providentially the wind changed and came right off the shore all at once which saved both the ship and their lives from immediate destruction  but when this happens to endeavor to ride out a storm on a lee shore where there is clear anchoring ground at a good distance from the shore and sailing proves ineffectual to keep clear of it then the chief dependence must be upon the ground tackle rightly applied to the best advantage and it is in common reckoned a great disgrace to let a ship go on shore with any ground tackle left on board that might have been usefully applied suppose then the ship to be properly prepared and to have let go a catch anchor and towline bent like a buoy rope to the crown of the stream anchor and the inner end of the stream cable bent to the crown of the sheet or best bower anchor with as long a scope of cable as possibly can be contrived to make the ship ride safe and easy as is particularly mentioned and recommended page  0 and     but where it is known or found by sounding with the lead armed with tallow that the ground is soul then no more cable should be veered out than necessity requires to bring the ship up to ride with as short a scope as possible because the cable is liable to be chaifed or cut in two by the rocks if that happens there is the more room astern and a better chance for a second or third anchor trying to the last moment all possible means to keep the ship from the shore  where the water is so deep that the anchoring ground lies but a little more than a cables length from the shore then all the anchors should be let go as fully described to answer this purpose page    and    and when the necessity of the situation requites it to cut away the mast if necessity require no hesitation should be made but immediately cut away all the masts except the moremast and the bowsprit and the foretopmaststaysail must be made to hoist to the foremast head which will not only make the ship ride with less strain upon the anchors and cables but if they give way she will be the better prepared when necessity requires it to be done as the last refuge to run and lay the ship on shore to the best advantage in order to save all the lives and property that is possible to be saved rather than let the ship founder or strike the ground at an anchor by the tide falling etc which affords no chance of saving either lives or property therefore all possible endeavors should be used and attempts made to try every thing that can be said or done that may prove serviceable on this melancholy and desperate occasion  on ships being forced upon a dangerous lee shore this often has and may be the fate of many ships in spite of the utmost powers of men and when a ships situation is such that to all appearance it cannot be avoided then the utmost endeavors should be used and no possible means left undone that may any way contribute to be serviceable on this last and most important occasion to save all the lives and property that is possible whether successful or not it deserves the highest encomiums as being the greatest proof of true courage and good conduct  but ships situations circumstances times and places are so different and various that to give advice on this dreadful occasion is difficult yet at all hazard every thing should be said and done for it is well known from reason as well as experience that to let a ship drive at random broad side where the tide is flowing upon a moderate rising shore with her mainmast standing when she comes to strike hard upon the ground by the waves running high will soon overset her on her broad side and cause the hatches to blow off then the waves will break in at the hatchways and compress the confined air within her so as to add the power of blowing to that of beating the ship to pieces which must afford little or no chance to save either lives or property that is liable to be destroyed or spoiled by the waves therefore likely to prove a fatal and total loss  these reasons i hope will be thought sufficient to prove the necessity of endeavoring to point out better management for it should be considered that a ship going on shore at these times in a tides way upon a flood will continue beating as long as the tide flows and until it falls and if she lies broad side to the waves they will have above three times more the power on her than when laid end on to them and the mainmast standing in the main body of the ship occasions her to overset at such times and it is well known that a ship will bear but little beating upon her broad side in proportion to what she will bear upon her bottom  therefore the best conduct on this occasion the best management on a gradual rising shore in a tide way is to use all possible means to keep the ship from going on such a shore as this till after high water and the main and mizzen mast being first cut away then to run right before the wind and waves with all the head way and sails that possibly can be set end on upon the shore to make the ship free herself the more and to run the higher and faster upon the ground so that by the advantage of the tide falling she may soon be set so fast as to be out of the power of the waves to hurt her much by this management in my opinion not only all the lives but the ship and cargo may be often saved which would be all lost by letting her go on shore at random with a flowing tide  notwithstanding a ship may be thus successfully run and set fast upon the shore with little damage to her hull and no danger to be apprehended till toward high water the next tide if the storm continues so long to wait the best time to quit the ship yet people too often let their fears overcome their reason and being in too great a hurry to quit the ship and attempting to get through the waves on shore may often lose their lives and the boats they go in when if they would consider and stay with patience till the tide falls low enough they may get safe on shore with little or no risk and where the tide rises and falls a great deal the ship may come quite adry at low water which time must be allowed to be the safest and best to land whether the ship dries or not for the water is then smoothest and there will be the less way to go in it therefore if possible the people should be restrained from quitting the ship with the boats till toward low water and when got safe on shore it may be absolutely necessary to preserve the boats if possible by hauling them out of harms way above high water mark out of the reach of the waves where they may be turned bottom up and made a place of shelter when there is no other to be had and be still ready to go to the ship if the weather permits and occasion requires  to preserve the bats and the best method to haul them over a sand or strand on this as well as on many other useful occasions the best and easiest method to haul a boat up and down over a long gradual rising sand or strand deserves notice therefore instead of the common method of laying the oars across and hauling the boat upright over them upon her keel end on i would recommend from experience first to lay the boat broad side to the shore the way she is designed to be hauled and healing her off so as to put the blade of a single oar under her keel amid ships and lay all the other oars length way the blade of one to the loom of the other then the boats crew divided equally on each side of the oars takes hold of the gunnel healds her bilge upon the first oar keeping her upon a poise and runs her along with great ease the whole length of the oars at a time and if a little sea tang can be got to put under the bilge of the boat it will make her slide with more ease along the oars which are to be shifted forward when the boat is on the loom of the last oar etc  on hard rocks step to under water and high upright cliffs above water different shores require different management on this desperate occasion and where the shore is nothing but hard rocks steep to under water and high lofty upright cliffs above water which are impossible to be climbed up in this situation no sail can be of any service therefore all the masts should be cut away and safety then depends entirely on the ground tackle being used to the best advantage and if the ship drives till she comes near the high cliffs it is well known they make both the wind and waves to rebound from them to some distance where if the ground tackle happens to hold any thing it may give the ship a chance to ride there and as this is the only chance against a fatal and total loss it ought to be tried in the best manner that is possible  on a gentle  the w are  violent ships drove broad side on a gradual rising shore when the waves are not so violent as to bulge them directly may find great advantage from lightening them abaft or trimming them so much by the head with their goods or ballast as to make them swing end on with their heads to the sea which is certainly the best position a ship can be laid in not only to bear the force of the waves with the least damage while the gale lasts but to heave the ship off after the gale ceases  on saving lives from a ship lost on a lee shore to be any way aiding and assisting to save the lives of people from ships that are forced or lost upon a lee shore must be allowed to be one of the highest acts of humanity and charity that mankind is capable of performing and deserves the highest praise and the most grateful acknowledgments that are possible to be given and to offer to destroy or distress the distressed in this lamentable situation must be deemed the highest act of villainy and deserves the severest punishment which our laws very justly inflict  time circumstances and situations are so various that it is very difficult to write what may be to the purpose on this most melancholy occasion and another defect i must own for which i have great reason to be thankful to providence for never having been shipwrecked therefore cannot pretend to write from experience yet under all these disadvantages as i think it is absolutely necessary that it should be attempted by some body i venture sailor like to do my best  success in many situations may depend greatly on assistance from people on shore but as that is uncertain and cannot be expected in the night or in desert places therefore the utmost endeavors should be used to contrive and try what can be done on board a ship that may be supposed to be bulged or broke so much upon the ground as to be past all recovery and when a current or tide runs so strong between the wreek and the shore as prevents booms masts or yards etc with ropes made fast to them from being veered on shore and even the patent cork lines that ships have had a board contrived for the purpose of veering to people on the shore in order to get ropes passed to make hauling lines or travelers from the ship to the shore as necessity required to save the people has been rendered ineffectual by the current or tide  ecperiments recommended to be tried for this noble purpose therefore in order to endeavor to mend the defects of these contrivances for this most noble purpose i take the liberty to propose to those in power to have experiments tried on board his majestys ships lying in ordinary first whether it is not practicable to make a flying kite on board a ship wrecked upon a lee shore that may by the force of the wind be made to carry an iron creeper or grappling made fast to the end of a coil of rope from the wreck to the shore by which access may be got to the shore when prevented by the tide or current as abovementioned  i would propose these kites to be such as may be easily and readily made on board any wrecked vessel to consist only of two slips of thin deal board about three inches broad and six seven or eight feet long the middle of one nailed right across the other a little more than a third of their length which forms what may be called the head part of the kite then span it tight round the ends with line and sew a piece of a light sail over it with a sail needle and twine then sling it with line from the four ends of the boards with a span from the middle to strengthen that part where the bite of the rope designed to be sent on shore is to be stopped to the slings and at the bottom or tale part of the kite about two fathom from the end of the rope to which the creeper or grappling is to be bent that will likewise answer the purpose of a balancing tail to make the kite mount and fly in a gale of wind with a rope as well as school boys common paper kites will do with twine in moderate weather  now let it be supposed that this storm kite as it may be called may be made to fly with a grappling etc at its tail from a wreck far enough to reach the shore but then it may be asked how is the kite to be made to fall so that the grappling may take hold upon the shore to answer the designed purpose if the occasion immediately requires this to be done i would propose to try the experiment whether by letting the kite rope suddenly run loose for a time would not make the kite fall down to the ground as the common kite does when its string breaks but without immediate necessity required to try this method i would recommend another more sure and will add farther advantages toward answering the purpose  the higher and stronger the storm kite flies on this occasion the better because it will take what may be called heavier or more messengers which in my opinion may be contrived so as not only to bring the kite down upon the shore and be a help to hold the kite rope the faster but a hauling line may be also sent on shore with the first messenger which i would propose to be made of any piece of wood spar or plank    0 or    feet long slung with small rope from a single block to each end in the form of a triangle stitched over with a piece of sail cut in that shape and the kite rope reeved through the block with a hauling line made fast to it which may be sent on shore by it but if this first messenger fails to bring the kite down a hole may be made near the middle of a mainhatch or boards etc and put upon the kite rope and the wind will force them up as messengers so as soon to bring the kite down upon the shore but if it is not likely that any people will be there to give assistance to secure the kite rope i would propose to drive some large nails to stand out from the lower parts of the wood of these messengers to make them hold the kite rope and hauling line the better to get on shore by them  since writing the above i have thought it would be worth while to try whether a hauling line might not be bent to the grappling and stopped along with the kite rope and flown along with the kite at first  the next experiment for this purpose i would propose to be tried is how far it is practicable to shoot a grappling with a rope bent to it lashed along the outer end of a handspike etc made round just to fit the bore of a great gun and long enough to reach from the ring of the grappling close to the wad next the powder with the gun elevated to its higest range in order to get a rope from a wreck to the shore and all the ropes that may be necessary to be joined together on this occasion should be with long splices to answer this purpose best  let it now be supposed that a rope is got from the wreck to the shore and secured as well as possible till some body can be got on shore by it to secure it better to do this i would propose to sling in a light but secure manner to two single blocks one at each end of some of these things that can be easiest come at on board the wreck such as a cot a scuttle cask a chest without its lid a main hatch or a cabin table the lower side up etc that a man or two as the situation and circumstances may admit and require may be secured in or upon this machine then reeve the shore rope through the machine block and to that part of the wreck where it may lead and be hauled tight to the greatest advantage to support the machine running or traveling upon it from the wreck to the shore in the surest and best manner possible and if the wreck has any lower masts standing the shore rope leading over the mast head would most likely answer the purpose best and the top afford a convenient place to get fixed in and go from with the machine to the shore and a hogshead puncheon or a butt in my opinion might be scuttled on each side of the bung for a machine that two men might stand facing each other to great advantage to haul it on shore if the situation required it or any other thing that the shore rope and tackle may be thought strong enough to bear  but the facility or difficulty attending these proposals are in proportion to the distance and height of the shore from the wreck if the shore is low and near the wreck the shore rope may be made to lead the machine upon it with an easy descent from the wreck to the shore with a man or two in it without much strain either to the rope or grappling on shore when this is likely to be the ease a line should be made fast to the machine to haul it to the wreck again by which means it may happen that a ship wrecked crew may soon get on shore with ease  but when the shore happens to be at a great distance and much higher than any part of the wreck this must naturally increase the strain on the shore rope and grappling etc that holds it and to the man or men who are to haul the machine on shore by it therefore to endeavor to case this strain i would propose as it appears to me practicable to contrive and six a small sail to the machine such as a hammock or two that has holes ready wrought at each end a tarpawling or a piece of sail cut for the purpose that may be soon bent or stitched with a sail needle and twine to light pieces of wood one as a yard stopped to the head of an upright piece or two that may be stopped or lashed to the after end of the machine as masts seven or eight feet high above it next the ship and the foot hauled down to the fore part of the machine next the shore this sail set to stand in this slanting direction upon the machine that is to run right before the wind in a storm will certainly help greatly to lift and lessen the strain of the machine upon the shore rope and force it forward with great power toward the shore and if by any such means as these a man or two can be got on shore safe they may secure things to the best advantage and by hauling lines etc may be the means of getting all the rest of the people on shore before the wreck is beat to pieces by the waves  but it may be said that the first adventurers in these machines run a great risk which must be allowed but desperate situations require desperate proceedings when delays are dangerous if this is the only method that appears to give a chance to save life the first adventurers stand the best chance if they succeed in getting on shore safe when every minute the wreck may be liable to be beat to pieces and all left on board most likely to suffer  now let it be supposed that there is neither tide nor current to hinder any floating things being drove right on shore from the wreck by the force of the wind and waves then a towline or other suitable rope with a hauling line etc may be made fast about the middle of a spar mast or yard etc and veered away on shore as far as it will go and if it happens to be an uneven rocky shore it may chance to fix itself fast amongst the rocks by which i have heard a ships crew got on shore when they had almost given themselves up for lost but if it is a sandy or gravelly shore then no such chance can be expected it will then require some people on shore to haul it up and put it under the sand or gravel its broad side to the wreck as described in page    on mooring ships to make it bear the strain that is necessary for the rope to be tight enough for the machine as abovementioned to travel upon from the wreck to the shore  now let it be supposed that a set of good people appear upon the shore for the noble purpose of doing all in their power to save the lives of those distressed people on board wrecks to succeed therein it is absolutely necessary that the people on shore should be made to understand something of the designed methods of proceeding therefore the best and approved methods that experiments may produce should be represented and described in prints for the purpose of being distributed amongst our ships certain rewards for poor people saving lives recommended and amongst the inhabitants along our sea coasts to be made as public as possible and rewards of a guinea certain should be allowed to the poor people on shore for every human life saved by them from wrecks and vessels forced on shore and liverpool leads the way for this noble purpose and in proportion to the danger and trouble they are to be rewarded with more than a guinea as thought by a committee they deserve which encouragement may likewise be the means of saving their own lives from the just laws of our country by preventing their cruelty for the sake of plunder on these occasions and might encourage them to observe and join heartily in whatever methods they perceive the people on board the wreck take to save themselves and to help them in it by securing the shore rope or using the hauling line to haul the machine on shore if it is high above the wreck or made fast to a raft as the circumstances and situation may require and if ever the time come to have such prints on board ships for this purpose one of them should be rolled up and put into a bottle and sent from the wreck to the people on shore by some such methods as has been mentioned or throwing the bottle well corkd into the sea to make them understand the designed method of proceeding which may be the means of saving many valuable lives as well passengers as ships crews whose lives are undoubtedly of much more importance than ships these may be renewed but they are of little purpose without good crews to navigate them and the difficulty we now meet with in manning both ships of war and merchants ships should teach us to use every method to preserve the lives of our brave seamen those supporters of our glory power wealth and consequence as a nation  they dare the raging tempest cheerfully and the dreadful slaughter from thundering cannon does not dismay them therefore how pleasing must the thought and reflection be to all that contribute to help and save them  the conclusion before i conclude i shall beg leave to propose one farther consideration to the serious attention of my brother sailors however unsuitable it may appear to a subject of this kind or to the profession and qualifications of the writer i could wish to impress upon their minds a deep conviction of this great truth that our own utmost skill caution vigilance and dexterity are altogether insufficient of themselves to command success in our proceedings or preserve us from the many dangers and difficulties we are exposed to without his allpowerful protection and assistance whom the winds and waves obey  unless the lord keep the house or ship the watchman waketh but in vain  it is the almighty author of nature alone who formed the universe and is present to all the parts of it urging or restraining the elements  promoting or obstructing the designs of men according to the allwise and beneficent purposes of his government upon whom our success happiness and preservation entirely depend  how diligently then should we study and endeavor by the usefulness and piety of our lives to recommend ourselves to his favor and protection and religiously implore his direction and assistance in all our undertakings  knowing him to be our only sure guide our only certain help in trouble  and we may be likewise assured that it is this persuasion alone and the consciousness of having endeavored to regulate our lives according to his divine will that can afford rational happiness in the most prosperous circumstances or inspire us with true courage in dangers and difficulties  the virtuous and religous man considing in his god will when his duty calls face death itself undismayed having nothing to fear but much to hope from it  whilst the impious and wicked upon the first appearance of danger are often struck with such panies as incapacitate them for acting properly for their own safety or that of others which may unfortunately depend upon their courage and conduct  it would be needless to enumerate in confirmation of this truth the examples with which history both ancient and modern abounds as almost every ones own experience will abundantly supply them  indeed in the seafaring life they occur but too frequently and afford us convincing evidence of the truth of those texts of scripture that there is no peace to the wicked who are like the troubled sea which cannot rest  that they flee when no man pursues  while the righteous are bold as a lion the most striking proof i ever met with of this was in a tyrannical impious selfsufficient commander of a ship in the jamaica trade under whom i sailed who openly made a mock of all religion professing in his conversation that he was under no concern about it that with a conscience as he termed it void of offense a man might make himself very easy and the like but so far was he from this happy state that to extinguish thought and reflection he was almost constantly adding more guilt to his painful and troubled mind which made him visibly a hell to himself and the ship like a hell a float to all on board under his command spending his time at sea mostly in excessive drinking gaming quarrelling abusing and illusing some part of his crew even to breaking limbs and endangering their lives at the first of the voyage officers that refused to join him in his follies were called mean spirited fellows etc and ordered up to the masthead in rainy weather for a punishment to look out during his pleasure  he would damn an officer and ask why he did not give the seamen sugar plumbs only for calling them by their proper names he deemed it an act of piracy for the officer of the watch to offer to lower or take in sail or bear away from the course in heavy squalls of wind though in the open ocean and necessity might require it for the safety of the whole but he must be called upon deck to take the command and being commonly potvaliant rather than be obliged to lower or take in sail in squalls upon a wind would cun and run the ship right before the wind and carry sail till she was so over pressed as to lose the power of the helm to command her  thus this overbearing selfsufficient hero thought to outbrave all the power of storms difficulties and dangers without damage but it proved otherwise for we met with such and so many disasters that once the general outcry of the seamen was to out boats and quit the ship when this boasting hero was desired to exert his authority to stop the people from it he then tyrant like lost all his boasted courage fell a crying like a child and begged his officers to take the command and stop the seamens proceedings which just saved the ship but not without great damage  we were well armed for war against the declared enemies of our country but our commander had the worst of enemies a guilty conscience within himself for when quarreling with one part of his officers the others were called up from sleep in the night to get the small arms fited off and secured to prevent as he said the ship being taken from him  it would be too much to relate the many great troubles this unhappy man brought upon himself in this voyage and the next was his last for they were never heard of after departing from home  i have been more prolix upon this miserable character that it may be a warning to others who wish for success and happiness not to follow his example     but though our present as well as future safety and happiness so much depend upon a good and holy life yet such is our desperate and amazing depravity that instead of rendering due honor and adoration to the divine being for his manifold gracious deliverances  instead of invoking his assistance in dangers and difficulties how often do we ungratefully blaspheme his allsacred name by profane cursing and swearing  how strange is it that sailors whose preservation so visibly depends upon the providential care which they almost daily experience  who are as it may be justly said but an inch breadth from eternity  that they more than any other class of men should be almost perpetually daring the divine vengeance by this most unaccountable vice a vice of all others the most irrational which can offer neither pleasure nor profit to tempt us to the commission of it nor urge in its vindication what some other vices may a natural propensity for no man as archbishop tillotson justly observes can plead that he was born with a swearing constitution  officers sometimes justify this wicked practice under a pretense that their orders would not be sufficiently regarded unless enforced by swearing  idle and vain pretense as upon trying a different conduct i am persuaded they will be soon convinced  from my own observation and experience i can assert that in critical emergencies when the least delay would be fatal to the whole and necessity requires every one to exert his utmost any sort of sharp words or threats uttered with an angry tone calling the unactive lubbers and the like telling the men the necessity for their activity and how much depends upon it will have a better effect than vulgar oaths which from being so frequently heard become no more regarded by them than common words  they having from example and daily practice learned to swear as profanely as their officers  the shameful prevalence of this vice amongst us and the infectious influence of ill example are but too evidently seen from this that the inferior sort of foreigners who have much conversation with us generally acquire this common swearing part of our language first  a melancholy proof that they hear it most frequently  and are perhaps most inclined to imitate it  how highly incumbent then is it upon officers and those in command always to discountenance this vicious practice by their own example as no reformation without this can be expected  especially if they reflect that the more exalted a mans station is the greater is his crime as its influence is more pernicious  and since many a fruitful and flourishing land has been made barren for the wickedness of its inhabitants every impious and profane man ought to be deemed and treated as the greatest enemy to his country  but i indulge the pleasing hope that a reformation will now be soon produced by the virtues of our present most amiable sovereign in whose bright example we see piety morality and obedience to the laws of god and his country strongly recommended  and i would hope that his wishes expressed in his first most excellent proclamation are not only publicly read in all his navy as often as the articles of war but also enforced to check the immorality and profaneness which has too long prevailed amongst seamen of all ranks and degrees  and in order to promote this good end which every one who has the interest of his country at heart will endeavor as much as lies in his power i would earnestly recommend it to all commanders of ships to have a reasonable part of divine worship publicly performed on board every day or as often as conveniently may be  which to our shame be it spoken is often even in our large for the first fifteen years that i was at sea in different trades i never saw any religious duty publicly performed on board except that in an east india ship for two or three sundays when we drew near the cape of good hope we had prayers which ceased after we passed the cape  does not this indicate that the fear of approaching danger was the motive and not a grateful sense of those incessant benefits we are constantly receiving  indeed that great company or their managers are highly blamable in shamefully rating those large ships only at     tons in order to evade the expense of a clergyman and the penalty of the law for not carrying one  it would be well for them to consider that acting upon christian principles is the only true policy and that schemes upon any other principles cunningly devised for the accumulation of wealth may and most likely will in the event prove unto them only an occasion of falling east india ships scandalously neglected  this i think i can say from profitable experience contributes greatly to produce good order harmony and piety on board and check disorder vice and immorality of every kind  even amongst the most dissolute and ignorant in privateers as well as merchant ships  no rational being surely can want exhortation to this most reasonable and bounden duty  for man the only animal in the creation so distinguishingly favored  endowed with faculties to contemplate the glorious works of the creation and enjoy his portion of the good things thereof with gratitude to the great creator and benevolence to his fellow creatures  for man i say to want piety and religious veneration is worse than brutish  for man blessed with the lights of the gospel to direct him in his duty to reform improve and qualify his nature for higher enjoyments  pointing out to him what is most conducive both to his present and future happiness to renounce these high privileges and blindly wallow in sensuality  is truly monstrous  but after all  though our religion lays no restraints upon us but such only as promote our present happiness both as individuals and members of society  yet such is our miserable frailty and so many various and powerful are the enemies and temptations we have to contend with in our course that of ourselves as we have deplorable conviction from daily experience we cannot but fall  with what humble gratitude then what ardor of affection and adoration should we embrace the great salvation revealed in the gospel procured and purchased for us at so dear a price and in so mysterious and stupendous a manner  and freely offered us so much in need and so wholly unworthy of it what ailigence should we use  what holiness of life should we aspire after to ensure to ourselves an interest in this grand attoning sacrifice and how devoutly should we implore the promised assistance of his aiding and sanctifying grace to conduct us safe through this transitory voyage of life to a blessed and happy eternity  let us then under the direction and guidance of this great author and captain of our salvation our allglorious redeemer christ jesus pursue our course with steadiness and resolution and fight manfully under his banner  looking upon him for succor in all our distresses and difficulties who is allpowerful in heaven and earth and will never forsake or reject those who sincerely love and trust in him  to whom be glory for ever amen  finis plate  st
