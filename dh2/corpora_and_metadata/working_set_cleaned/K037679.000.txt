the heiress a comedy in five acts price one shilling and sixpence  entered at stationers hall  the heiress a comedy in five acts as performed at the theater royal drury lane  spectatores ad pudicos mores facta haec fabula est qui pudicitiae esse voltis praemium plausum date plautus london printed for j debrett opposite burlingtonhouse piccadilly mdcclxxxvi  to the earl of derby my dear lord our connection and friendship as well as the partiality i know you will entertain in favor of any attempt at regulated drama mark you as the person to whom with the most propriety and inclination i can inscribe the comedy of the heiress  it also comes to your lordships hand with a secondary claim to your acceptance as owing its existence to the leisure and tranquillity i enjoyed during the two last summers at knowsley  i long intended as your lordship can witness to keep the name of the author concealed after the success with which the play has been honored i must expect that the change of my design will be imputed by many to vanity i shall submit without murmuring to that belief if i may obtain equal credit for the sincerity of another pride which this discovery gratifies  that of testifying in the most public manner the respect and affection with which i have the honor to be  my dear lord your most obedient and most humble servant j burgoyne hrtford street feb   st      preface the approbation the following comedy has received upon the stage and the candor with which every criticism that has come to the authors knowledge has been accompanied might encourage him to trust it to the closet without any other preface than an acknowledgement of his gratitude to the public for the honors done to him and if he detains the reader a few moments more it is not to disavow what has been hinted at in some of the daily prints as a species of plagiarism but to plead it in behalf of dramatic writing in general against rules that if carried to the extent they lead to would fix shackles upon genius and give a very undue limitation to variety  in point of fable for instance  is it a reproach to borrow  surely the dramatist like the architect brings his talents equally to the test whether he builds upon another mans ground or his own and if instead of small and detached parts the writer of the heiress had taken the complete plot of his play from a novel he would have imitated the examples the only imitation to which he has any pretense of the best dramatic poets of every age  in point of originality of characters  it is humbly hoped this comedy is not without it but present instances apart it is submitted to the judicious whether such an exaction of novelty as would make a resemblance to any thing ever seen upon the stage before unacceptable might not materially vitiate the public taste carry the major part of writers beyond the scope of nature and probability and deprive the spectator of that pleasing and infinite diversity of shape and coloring that the leading passions vices and follies of civilized life admit love avarice misanthropy etc etc if drawn a thousand and a thousand times with new shades and in different points of view will do as much credit to invention and have as just an effect in exhibition as if moliere or congrave had never touched the subjects it is not whether there may not be personages in the heiress in whom we may discover family features that is asked but whether they are not still individuals with whom we have been hitherto unacquainted  i a question not for the author to determine  original thought  it has been observed that there is an image in a speech of lord gayville copied closely from rousseau very possibly it may be so the author of the heiress certainly has read that elegant writer and to show how easily invention may be deceived he will quote another writer in his estimation still more elegant who thus accounts and apologizes for unconscious plagiarism  faded ideas says mr sheridan float in the fancy like half forgotten dreams and imagination in its fullest enjoyments becomes suspicious of its offspring and doubts whether it has created or adopted  more sentiments and expression due to the imagination of others may possibly be challenged though they are equally out of the recollection of the author  he would only wish the candid to admit the probability that while he believed them his own he thought them his best  many of the scenes now submitted to perusal have been shortened in representation and a few words have been altered occasionally to preserve connection  a circumstance necessary to be known lest the performers should be suspected of negligence when on the contrary too much cannot be said of their attention and zeal when all have been eminent it would be unnecessary if not invidious to particularize any there is nevertheless a lady to whom by her standing separately and individually in one part of the performance the author without departing from his maxim may express his more than ordinary obligation miss farren by her inimitable manner of delivering the epilogue has made a better apology to the public than any his pen could have produced for a composition which from an accident was much too hastily written in some parts and in others pieced together with a like insufficiency of time  the epilogue excepted no defects in the following sheets can be covered by the excuse of hurry they cannot be so consistently with truth nor indeed with inclination for the author had rather be thought incapable of pleasing after his greatest cares than wanting in the attention and respect which every man who ventures to publish a production of this nature owes to the world and to himself  not to let it pass from his hands without frequent revisal and the best considered finish his abilities can give  prologue by the rt hon richard fitzpatrick spoken by mr king as sprightly sunbeams gild the face of day when lowering tempests calmly glide away so when the poets dark horizon clears arrayed in smiles the epilogue appears she of that house the lively emblem still whose brilliant speakers start what themes they will still varying topics for her sportive rhymes from all the follies of these fruitful times uncheckd by forms with flippant hand may cull prologues like peers by privilege are dull in solemn strain address the assembled pit the legal judges of dramatic wit confining still with dignified decorum their observations  to the play before em now when each bachelor a helpmate lacks that sweet exemption from a double tax when laws are framed with a benignant plan of lightning burdens on the married man and hymen adds one solid comfort more to all those comforts he conferred before to smooth the rough laborious road to fame our bard has chosen  an alluring name as wealth in wedlock often is known to hide the imperfections of a homely bride this tempting title he perhaps expects may heighten beauties  and conceal defects thus sixtys wrinkles viewed through fortunes glass the rosy dimples of sixteen surpass the modern suitor grasps his fair ones hand oerlooks her person and adores  her land leers on her houses with an ogling eye over her rich acres heaves an amorous sigh his heartfelt pangs through groves of  timber vents and runs distracted for  her three per cents will thus the poets mimic heiress find the

gold if it be of any use   mrs blandish cast off style excellent assurance and pray sir to whom are you indebted for the very elements of wheedling and all that has attended it is progress from the plaything in your nursery to the brilliant upon your finger   blandish for the elements my honored sister and partner i confess the obligation but for the proficiency i have attained the sublime of the science while you with more experience are still a novice like a miss at her stuttering harpsicord with a nimble finger but no ear  you keep in tune it is true for that is the merit of the instrument but you are continually out of time and allways thrumming the same key   mrs blandish which in plain english is as much as to say    blandish that human vanity is an instrument of such ease and compass the most unskilful can play something upon it but to touch it to the true purpose    mrs blandish well sir and look round you pray these apartments were not furnished from the interest of two miserable thousand pounds in the three per cents any more than our table and equipage have been maintained by your patrimony  a land estate of three hundred a year out of repair and mortgaged for nearly it is value i believe i have stated our original family circumstances pretty accurately   blandish they wanted improvement it must be acknowledged but before we bring our industry to a comparison in the name of the old father of flattery to whom is that perfect phrase addressed   mrs blandish to one worth the pains i can tell you  miss alscrip   blandish what sensibility to miss alscrip my dear sister this is too much even in your own way had you run changes upon her fortune stocks bonds and mortgages upon lord gayvilles coronet at her feet or forty other coronets to make footballs of if she pleased  it would have been plausible but the quality you have selected    mrs blandish is one she has no pretensions to therefore the flattery is more persuasive  that is my maxim   blandish and mine also but i dont try it quite so high  sensibility to miss alscrip you might as well have applied it to her uncles pigiron from which she derives her first fifty thousand or the harder heart of the old usurer her father from whom she expects the second but come rings to the business of the morning  enter prompt the valet de chamber here prompt  send out the chairmen with the

face and a conceited confidence in his old ascendancy over his lordship but thanks to the accident that kept him two months behind mr monitor will find himself mistaken   mrs blandish beware of the monitor notwithstanding in another quarter lady emily and he were acquainted at the age of first impressions   blandish i dare say he always meant to be the complete friend of the family though without a single talent for the purpose i question whether he ever made a compliment in his life   mrs blandish oh the brute   blandish his game i find has been to work upon lord gayvilles understanding he thinks he must finally establish himself in his esteem by inexorably opposing all his follies  poor simpleton  now my touch of opposition goes only to inhance the value of my acquiescence so adieu for the morning  you to miss alscrip with an unction of flattery fit for a house painters brush i to sir clement and his family with a composition as delicate as ether and to be applied with the point of a feather going   mrs blandish hark you blandish a good wish before you go to make your success complete may you find but half your own vanity in those you have to work on   blandish thank you my dear letty this is not the only tap you have hit me today and you are right for if you and i did not sometimes speak truth to each other we should forget there was such a quality incident to the human mind   exeunt scene ii lord gayvilles apartment enter lord gayville and mr clifford lord gayville my dear clifford urge me no more how can a man of your liberality of sentiment descend to be the advocate of my uncles family avarice   clifford my lord you do not live for yourself you have an ancient name and title to support   lord gayville preposterous policy whenever the father builds games or electioneers the heir and title must go to market oh the happy families sir clement flint will enumerate where this practice has prevailed for centuries and the estate been improved in every generation though specifically spent by each individual   clifford but you thought with him a month ago and wrote with transport of the match  whenever you think of miss alscrip visions of equipage and splendour villas and hotels the delights of independance and profuseness dance in your imagination   lord gayville it is true i was that dissipated fashionable wretch   clifford come this reserve betrays a consciousness of having acted wrong you would not hide what would give me pleasure but i will not be officious   lord gayville hear me without severity and i will tell you all  such a woman such an assemblage of all that is lovely in the sex    clifford well but  the who the how the where   lord gayville i met her walking and alone and indeed so humbly circumstanced as to carry a parcel in her own hand   clifford i cannot but smile at this opening of your adventure  how many such charmers have we met in our former excursions from cambridge i warrant she had a smart hat and a drawn up petticoat like a curtain in festoons to discover a new buckle and a neat ancle   lord gayville no clifford her dress was such as a judicious painter would choose to characterize modesty but natural grace and elegance stole upon the observation and through the simplicity of a quaker showed all we could conceive of a goddess i gazed and turned idolater   clifford smiling you may as well finish the description in poetry at once you are on the very verge of it   lord gayville she was under the persecution of one of those beings peculiar to this town who assume the name of gentlemen upon the sole credentials of a boot a switch and round hat  the things that escape from counters and writing desks to disturb public places insult foreigners and put decent women out of countenance i had no difficulty in the rescue   clifford and having silenced the dragon in the true spirit of chivalry you conducted the damsel to her castle   lord gayville the utmost i could obtain was leave to put her into a hackney coach which i followed unperceived and lodged her in the house of an obscure milliner in a bye street   clifford the sweet cyprian retreat such a priestess of your goddess i dare say did not refuse access to the shrine   lord gayville it is true a few guineas made the milliner my own i almost lived in the house and often when i was not suspected to be there passed whole hours listening to a voice that would have captivated my very soul though it had been her only attraction at last    clifford what is to follow   lord gayville by the persuasions of the woman who laughed at my scruples with an unknown girl a lodger upon a second floor i hid myself in the closet of her apartment and the practiced trader assured me i had nothing to fear from the interruption of the family   clifford oh for shame my lord whatever may be the end of your adventure such means were very much below you   lord gayville i confess it and have been punished upon the discovery of me fear indignation and resolution agitated the whole frame of the sweet girl by turns  i would sooner have committed sacrilege than have offered an affront to her person  confused  overpowered  i stammerd out a few incoherent words  interest in her fortune  respect  entreaty of forgiveness  and left her to detest me   clifford you need go no farther i meant to rally you but your proceedings and emotion alarm me for your peace and honor if this girl is an adventurer which i suspect you are making yourself ridiculous  if she is strictly innocent upon what ground dare a man of your principle think farther of her you are on a double precipice on one side impelled by folly on the other    lord gayville hold clifford i am not prepared for so much admonition your tone is changed since our separation you seem to drop the companion and assume the governor   clifford no my lord i scorn the sycophant and assert the friend   enter servant followed by blandish servant my

gayvilles esteem   clifford with a seeming effort to withdraw his hand which blandish holds sir you are quite accomplished to be an example    blandish i have been at your apartment to look for you  we have been talking of you with sir clement  lady emily threw in her word    clifford disengaging his hand oh sir you make me too proud aside practiced parasite exit   blandish aside sneering puppy

they do  but i have less fortitude or more attachment than others  the inclinations of the man i love are spells upon my opposition   lord gayville kind blandish you are the confidant i want   blandish what has happened since your discovery in the closet   lord gayville the lovely wanderer left her lodgings the next morning  but i have again found her  she is in a house of equal retirement

spirited defense   clifford then you must engage with those if those there are that do not find you irresistible   lady emily i could find a thousand such but i will engage with none whose triumph i could not submit to with pleasure   sir clement apart pretty significant on both sides i wonder how much farther it will go   lady emily uncle did you speak   sir clement reading to himselfand the parties to this indenture do farther covenant and agree that all and every the said lands tenements and hereditaments  um  um  how useful sometimes is ambiguity loud enough to be heard   clifford a very natural observation of sir clements upon that long parchment pauses again upon the chess board   lady emily looking pensively at his face clifford to what a dilemma have you reduced me lady emily if i advance i perish by my temerity and it is out of my power to retreat   sir clement apart better and better  to talk in cipher is a curious faculty   clifford sir   sir clement still readingin witness whereof the said parties have hereunto interchangeably set their hands and seals this  um  um  day of um  um    lady emily resuming an air of vivacity come i trifle with you too long  there is your coup de grace  uncle i have conquered both rising from the table   sir clement niece i do not doubt it  and in the style of the great proficients without looking upon the board clifford was not your mothers name charlton folding up the parchment and rising   clifford it was sir   sir clement in looking over the writings alscrip has sent me preparatory to his daughters settlement i find mention of a conveyance from a sir william charlton of devonshire was he a relation   clifford my grandfather sir the plunder of his fortune was one of the first materials for raising that of mr alscrip who was steward to sir williams estate then manager of his difficulties and lastly his sole creditor   sir clement and no better monopoly than that of a mans distresses alscrip has had twenty such or i should not have singled out his daughter to be lord gayvilles wife   clifford it is a compensation for my family losses that in the event they will conduce to the interest of the man i most love   sir clement hey day clifford  take care dont trench upon the blandish  your cue you know is sincerity   clifford you seem to think sir there is no such quality i doubt whether you believe there is an honest man in the world   sir clement you do me great injustice  several  several  and upon the old principle that  honesty is the best policy  selfinterest is the great end of life says human nature  honesty is a better agent than craft  says proverb   clifford but as for ingenuous or purely disinterested motives    sir clement clifford do you mean to laugh at me   clifford what is your opinion lady emily   lady emily endeavoring again at vivacity that there may be such but it is odds they are troublesome or insipid pure ingenuousness i take it is a rugged sort of thing which scarcely will bear the polish of common civility and for disinterestedness  young people sometimes set out with it but it is like traveling upon a broken spring  one is glad to get it mended at the next stage   sir clement emily i protest you seem to study after me proceed child and we will read together every character that comes in our way   lady emily read ones acquaintance  delightful what romances novels satires and mock heroics present themselves to my imagination our young men are flimsy essays old ones political pamphlets coquets fugitive pieces and fashionable beauties a compilation of advertized perfumery essence of pearl milk of roses and olympian dew  lord i should now and then though turn over an acquaintance with a sort of fear and trembling   clifford how so   lady emily lest one should pop unaware upon something one should not like a naughty speech in an old comedy but it is only skipping what would make one blush   sir clement or if you did not skip when a woman reads by herself and to herself there are wicked philosophers who doubt whether her blushes are very troublesome   lady emily to sir clement do you know now that for that speech of yours  and for that saucy smile of yours to clifford i am strongly tempted to read you both aloud   sir clement come try  i will be the first to open the book   lady emily a treatise of the houyhnhnms after the manner of swift tending to make us odious to ourselves and to extract morose mirth from our imperfections  turning to clifford contrasted with an exposition of ancient morality addressed to the moderns a chimerical attempt upon an obsolete subject   sir clement clifford we must double down that page and now well have a specimen of her ladyship   lady emily i will give it you myself and with justice which is more than either of you would   sir clement and without skipping   lady emily thus then  a light airy fantastic sketch of genteel manners as they are with a little endeavor at what they ought to be  rather entertaining than instructive not without art but sparing in the use of it    sir clement but the passions emily do not forget what should stand in the foreground of a female treatise   lady emily they abound but mixed and blended cleverly enough to prevent any from predominating like the colors of a shot lutestring that change as you look at it sideways or full they are sometimes brightened by vivacity and now and then subject to a shade of caprice  but meaning no ill  not afraid of a critical review and thus gentlemen i present myself to you fresh from the press and i hope not inelegantly bound   sir clement altogether making a perfectly desirable companion for the closet i am sure clifford you will agree with me gad we are got into such a pleasant freedom with each other it is a pity to separate while any curiosity remains in the company  prithee clifford satisfy me a little as to your history old lord hardacre if i am rightly informed disinherited your father his second son   clifford for the very marriage we have been speaking of the little fortune my father could call his own was sunk before his death as a provision for my mother upon an idea that whatever resentment he might personally have incurred  it would not be extended to an innocent offspring   sir clement a very silly confidence how readily now should you and i emily have discovered in a sensible old man the irreconcilable offense of a marriage of the passions  you understand me   lady emily perfectly aside old petrifaction your hints always speak forceably   sir clement but your uncle the present lord made amends   clifford amply he offered to send me from cambridge to an academy in germany to fit me for foreign service well judging that a cannon ball was a fair and quick provision for a poor relation   sir clement upon my word i have known uncles less considerate   clifford when lord gayvilles friendship and your indulgence made me the companion of his travels lord hardacres undivided cares devolved upon my sister whose whole independent possession at my mothers death was five hundred pounds  all our education had permitted that unhappy parent to lay by   lady emily oh for an act of justice and benevolence to reconcile me to the odious man tell me this instant what did he do for miss clifford   clifford he bestowed upon her forty pounds a year upon condition that she resided with a family of his dependants in a remote county to save the family from disgrace and that allowance when i heard last from her he had threatened to withdraw upon her refusing a detestable match he had endeavored to force upon her   lady emily poor girl   sir clement upon my word an interesting story and told with pathetic effect  emily you look grave child   lady emily aside i shall not own it however to him for once my dear uncle you want your spectacles my thoughts are on a diverting subject  my first visit to miss alscrip to take a near view of that collection of charms destined to my happy brother   sir clement you need not go out of the room for that purpose the schedule of an heiresss fortune is a compendium of her merits and the true security for marriage happiness   lady emily i am sure i guess at your system  that union must be most wise which has wealth to support it and no affections to disturb it   sir clement right   lady emily that makes a divorce the first promise of wedlock and widowhood the best blessing of life that separates the interest of husband wife and child    sir clement to establish the independent comfort of all    lady emily upon the broad basis of family hatred excellent my dear uncle excellent indeed and upon that principle though the lady is likely to be your niece and my sister i am sure you will have no objection to my laughing at her a little   sir clement you will be puzzled to make her more ridiculous than i think her what is your plan   lady emily why though her pride is to be thought a leader in fashions she is sometimes a servile copyist blandish tells me i am her principal model and what is most provoking she is intent upon catching my manner as well as my dress which she exaggerates to an excess that vexes me now if she will take me in shade i will give her a new outline i am resolved and if i do not make her a caricature for a printshop    clifford will all this be strictly consistent with your good nature lady emily   lady emily no nor i dont know when i shall do any thing consistent with it again except leaving you two critics to a better subject than your humble servant   curtsies and exit with a lively air sir clement well clifford what do you think of her   clifford that when she professes illtemper she is a very awkward counterfeit   sir clement but her beauty her wit her improvement since you went abroad i expected from a man of your age and taste something more than a cold compliment upon her temper  could not you compatibly with the immaculate sincerity you possess venture as far as admiration   clifford i admire her sir as i do a bright star in the firmament and consider the distance of both as equally immeasureable   sir clement aside specious rogue to him well leave emily then to be winked at through telescopes and now to a matter of nearer observation  what is gayville doing   clifford every thing you desire sir i trust but you know i have been at home only three days and have hardly seen him since i came   sir clement nor i neither but i find he has profited wonderfully by foreign experience  after rambling half the world over without harm he is caught like a traveled woodcock at his landing   clifford if you suspect lord gayville of indiscretion why do you not put him heartily to the test i will be bound for his ingenuousness not to withold any confession you may require   sir clement you may be right but he will confess more to you in an hour than to me in a month for all that come clifford look as you ought to do at your interest  sift him  watch him  you cannot guess how much you will make me your friend and how grateful i may be if you will discover    clifford sir you mistake the footing upon which lord gayville and i live  i am often the partner of his thoughts but never a spy upon his actions bow and exit   sir clement alone well played clifford good air and emphasis and well suited to the trick of the scene  he would do if the practical part of deceit were as easy at his age as discernment of it is at mine gayville and emily if they had not a vigilant guard would be his sure prey for they are the examples of the generous affections coming to maturity with their stature whle suspicion art and interest are still dormant in the seed i must employ blandish in this business  a rascal of a different cast  below clifford in hypocrisy but greatly above him in the scale of impudence  they shall both forward my ends while they think they are pursuing their own i shall ever be sure of a mans endeavors to serve me while i hold out a lure to his knavery and interest exit   scene ii an antichamber alscrip without dinner not ordered till seven oclock  bid the kitchen maid get me some eggs and bacon  plague what with the time of dining and the french cookery i am in the land of starvation with half st jamessmarket upon my weekly bills enter while speaking the last sentence what a change have i

at the cold corner of the table  though i have a mortgage upon the house and furniture and arrears due of the whole interest it is a pleasure though to be well dressed my daughter maintains all fashions are founded in sense  icod the tightness of my wig and the stiffness of my cape give me the sense of the pillory  plaguey scanty about the hips too  and the breast something of a merry thought reversed  but there is some sense in that for if one sex pares away in proportion where the other swells we shall take up no more room in the world than we did before   enter a servant servant sir miss alscrip wishes to see you she is at her toilet   alscrip who is with her   servant only mrs blandish sir   alscrip she must content herself with that company till i have had my whet  order up

blandish you really think that the introduction of otahaite feathers in my trimming succeeded   mrs blandish oh with the mixture of those charming italian flowers and the knots of pearl that gathered up the festoons never any thing had so happy an effect  it put the whole ballroom out of humor and that is the surest test of good taste monsieur chignon that pin a little more to the front   miss alscrip and what did they say   mrs blandish you know it is the first solicitude of my life to see the friend of my heart treated with justice  so when you stood up to dance i got into the thick of

buckle  how it rippd away   mrs blandish did i see it   miss alscrip one of the great feathers stuck fast on the shoe and looked for all the world like the heel wing of a mercury in a pantomime   mrs blandish oh you witty creature how you describe   miss alscrip it was a most becoming rent   mrs blandish and what a display of indifference what an example for a woman of fortune did you exhibit in the bustle of picking up the scattered fragments   miss alscrip when the pearls were trundling about and i insisted upon the company being no longer disturbed but would leave what remained for fairy favors to the maid who swept the room he he he  do you think lady emily would have done that better   mrs blandish lady emily poor girl  how soon must she submit to be the humble second of the family   miss alscrip he he he do you sincerely think so blandish and yet it would be strange if it were otherwise for i could buy her tentimes over   chignon madame vat humeure vould you wear to day   miss

to be about me out of the common way   mrs blandish a new woman   miss alscrip no something to be raised much higher and at the same time fitted better to receive ones illhumour an humble companion well born well educated and perfectly dependant is a most useful appurtenance in the best families   mrs blandish well do not raise her to the rank of a friend lest i should be jealous   miss alscrip you may be perfectly secure  i shall take particular care that friendship shall be out of the question on both sides i had once thought of a restoration of pages to sit in scarlet and silver as one reads in former times upon the forepart of the coach and to hold up ones train  but i have a new male attendant in a valet de chamber who has possession of my bust  my two women will have the charge from the point of the shoulder to the toe  so my person being provided for  the countess of gayville shall have an attendant to wait upon her mind   mrs blandish i vow a most elegant and uncommon thought   miss alscrip one that can pen a note in the familiar the punctilious or the witty  it is quite troublesome to be always writing wit for ones self  but above all she is to have a talent for music   mrs blandish aye your very soul is framed for harmony   miss alscrip i have not quite determined what to call her  governante of the private chamber keeper of the boudoir with a silver key at her breast   enter chignon chignon madame a young lady beg to know if you be visible   miss alscrip a young lady  it is not lady emily gayville   chignon non madame but if you were absente and i had

throws herself into it young woman where were you educated   miss alton chiefly madam with my parents   miss alscrip but finished i take it for granted at a country boarding school for we have young ladies you know blandish boarded and educated upon blue boards in gold letters in every village with a strolling player for a dancing master and a deserter from dunkirk to teach the french grammar   mrs blandish how that genius of yours does paint nothing escapes you  i dare say you have anticipated this young ladys story   miss alton it is very true madam my life can afford nothing to interest the curiosity of you two ladies it has been too insignificant to merit your concern and attended with no circumstances to excite your pleasantry   miss alscrip yawning i hope child it will be attended with such for the future as will add to your own  i cannot bear a mope about me   i am told you have a talent for music  can you touch that harp  it stands here as a piece of furniture but i have a notion it is kept in tune by the man who comes to wind up my clocks   miss alton madam i dare not disobey you but i have been used to perform before a most partial audience i am afraid strangers will think my talent too humble to be worthy attention   a song i for tenderness framed in lifes earliest day a parents soft sorrows to mine led the way the lesson of pity was caught from her eye and ever words were my own i spoke in a sigh ii the nightingale plundered the matewidowd dove the warbled complaint of the suffering grove to youth as it ripened gave sentiment new the object still changing the sympathy true iii soft embers of passion yet rest in the glow  a warmth of more pain may this breast never know or if too indulgent the blessing i claim let the spark drop from reason that wakens the flame   miss alscrip i declare not amiss blandish only a little too plaintive  but i dare say she can play a country dance when the enlivening is required  so miss alton you are welcome to my protection and indeed i wish you to stay from this hour  my toilette being nearly finished i shall have a horrid vacation till dinner   miss alton madam you do me great honor and i very readily obey

tender heart the proof is excellent that the covetous should be deaf to the miserable i can conceive but i should not have believed if i had not seen that a taste for profusion did not find its first indulgence in benevolence exit   end of act the second act iii scene i miss alscrips dressing room continued miss alton thanks to mrs blandishs inexhaustible talent for encomium i shall be relieved

examines her head dress impertinently miss alton with great modesty rises and puts her work together   lady emily there seems to be considerable difference in the decorum of her attendants you need not stay sir   chignon as he goes out ma foi sa tete est passable  her head may pass   lady emily aside how my heart beats with curiosity miss alton having disposed her things in her workbag is retiring with a curtsy missalton i am in no haste on the contrary i think the occasion fortunate that allows me to begin an acquaintance with a person of so amiable an appearance i dont know whether that pert foreigner has led me into an error  but without being too inquisitive may i ask if you make any part of this family   miss alton madam i am under miss alscrips protection i imagine i am represented as her dependant i am not ashamed of humble circumstances that are not the consequences of indiscretion   lady emily that with such claims to respect you should be in any circumstances of humiliation is a disgrace to the age we live in   miss alton madam my humiliation if such it be is just perhaps i have been too proud and my heart required this selfcorrection a life of retired industry might have been more pleasing to me but an orphan  a stranger  ignorant and diffident i preferred my present situation as one less exposed to misrepresentation bell rings i can no longer detain miss alscrip from the honor of receiving your ladyship a respectful curtsy and exit   lady emily there is something strangely mysterious and affecting in all this  what delicacy of sentiment  what softness of manners and how well do these qualities accord with that sigh for clifford she had been proud  proud of what  of cliffords love it is too plain but then to account for her present condition  he has betrayed and abandoned her  too plain again i fear  she talked too of a self corrected heart  take example emily and recall thine from an object which it ought more than ever to renounce but here come the alscrip and her friend lud lud lud how shall i recover my spirits i must attempt it and if i lose my present thoughts in a trial of extravagance be it of theirs or my own it

expect so elevated a salute   miss alscrip dear lady emily i had no notion of its not being universal in france the touch of the lips just between the eyebrows has been adopted for years   lady emily i perfectly acknowledge the propriety of the custom it is almost the only spot of the face where the touch would not risk a confusion of complexions   miss alscrip he he he what a pretty thought   mrs blandish how i have longed for this day  come let me put an end to ceremony and join the hands of the sweetest pair that ever nature and fortune marked for connection joins their hands   miss alscrip

inseparable inimitables   miss alscrip i declare i shall like it exceedingly  one sees so few uncopied originals  the thing i cannot bear    lady emily is vulgar imitation  i must catch the words from your mouth to show you how we agree   miss alscrip exactly not that one wishes to be without affectation   lady emily oh mercy forbid   miss alscrip but to catch a manner and weave it as i may say into ones own originality   mrs blandish pretty pretty   lady emily that is the art  lord if one lived entirely upon ones own whims who would not be run out in a twelvemonth   miss alscrip dear lady emily dont you dote upon folly   lady emily to extacy i only despair of seeing it well kept up   miss alscrip i flatter myself there is no great danger of that   lady emily you are mistaken we have it

standstill in the midst of the course   mrs blandish poor spiritless creatures   lady emily do you know there is more than one duchess who has been seen in the same carriage with her husband  like two doves in a basket in the print of conjugal felicity and another has been detected i almost blush to name it   mrs blandish bless us where and how and how   lady emily in nursing her own child   miss

world we must now revert to nature make haste or you have so much to undo you will be left behind   miss alscrip i dare say so but who can vulgarize all at once what will the french say   lady emily we are to have an interchange of fashions and follies upon a basis of unequivocal reciprocity   miss alscrip fashions and follies  oh what a promising manufacture   lady emily yes and one thank heaven that we may defy the edict of any potentate to prohibit   miss alscrip with an affected drop of her lip in her laugh he he he he he he   lady emily my dear miss alscrip what are you doing i must correct you as i love you sure you must have observed the drop of the under sip is exploded since lady simpermode broke a tooth  sets her mouth affectedly  i am preparing the cast of the lips for the ensuing winter  thus  it is to be called the paphian mimp   miss alscrip imitating i swear i think it pretty  i must try to get it   lady emily nothing so easy it is done by one cabalistical word like a metamorphosis in the fairy tales you have only when before your glass to keep pronouncing to yourself niminiprimini  the lips cannot fail of taking their plie   miss alscrip niminipimini  imini mimini  oh it is delightfully enfantine  and so innocent to be kissing ones own lips   lady emily you have it to a charm  does it not become her infinitely mrs blandish   mrs blandish our friends feature must succeed in every grace but never so much as in a quick change of extremes  enter servant madam lord gayville desires to know if you are at home   miss alscrip a strange formality   lady

discovered without your assistance that this dulcinea has started up in the shape of miss alscrips musical companion  her name is alton leering i tell it you because i am sure you did not know it  or if you had  a friends secret ought to be sacred and to keep it from the only person who by knowing it could save him from destruction would be a new exercise of your virtue   clifford sir you will not know me    sir clement tut tut dont do me such injustice  come all delicacy being over by my having made the discovery will you talk to this girl   clifford for what end sir   sir clement if you state yourself as lord gayvilles friend she will converse with you more readily than she would with me  try her  find out what she is really at  if she proves an impostor of the refined artifice i suspect

conception of a goddess   tiffany aside how he examines me so much the better  i shall lose nothing by that i believe   clifford faith a pretty attracting countenance  but for that apprehensive and timid look  that awe impressing modesty my friend so forcibly described   tiffany adjusts herself and pulls up clifford aside there is no judging of that wonderful sex by rational rules  her silence

something to say to a young person of this house  that  that  looking down at the same time archly i could not but take the description to myself  i am ready to hear any thing a gentleman has to say   clifford aside thank my stars my scruples are relieved   tiffany am i mistaken sir pray whom was you enquiring after   clifford oh certainly you my pretty stranger a friend of mine has been robbed of his heart and i see the felony in your looks   tiffany simpering and coquetting lord sir if i had suspected you had come with a search warrant for hearts i would have been more upon my guard   clifford chucking her under the chin will you confess or must i arrest you   tiffany innocent sir in fact but not quite so in inclination  i hope your own is safe   clifford and were it not my smart unconscionable would you run away with that also   tiffany oh yes and an hundred more and melt them all down together as the jews do stolen goods to prevent their being reclaimed  gold silver and lead pray sir of what metal may yours be   clifford aside astonishing have i hit upon the moment when her fancy outruns her art  or has it been gayvilles amusement to describe her by contraries and are you really the young lady that is the companion of miss alscrip that makes such conquests at first sight    tiffany sir if you mean the young lady who has been named however undeservedly the flower of this family that appears sometimes at these windows and to be sure has been followed home by gentlemen against her inclinations  sir you are not mistaken   clifford aside it has been gayvilles madness or amusement then to describe her by contraries   tiffany i hope sir you are not offended i would not be impertinent though i am not so tasteless as to shy   clifford offended my dear i am quite charmed i assure you you are just what i did not expect but wished to find you you had been represented to me so improperly    tiffany with pertness represented improperly pray sir what do you mean   clifford to rejoice in my mistake i promise you  nay and to set my friend right in his opinion and so without further shyness on either part let us be free upon the subject i had to talk over with you you surely are not looking to lasting connections   tiffany with airs sir i dont understand you  i am not what you suppose i assure you  connections indeed  i should never have thought of that  my

depend on having an answer   runs out enter sir clement sir clement well clifford what do you think of her   clifford make yourself perfectly easy sir this girl when known can make no impression on lord gayvilles mind and i doubt not but a silk gown and a lottery ticket had they been offered as an ultimatum would have purchased her person   sir clement with a dry sneer dont you sometimes clifford form erroneous opinions of peoples pretensions interest and foolish passion inspire strange notions  as one or the other prevails we are brought to look so low or so high    clifford with emotion that we are compelled to call reason and honor to our aid    sir clement and then    clifford we lose the intemperance of our inclinations in the sense of what is right   sir clement aside sententious impostor to him but to the point   clifford sir i would please you if i could  i am thinking of a scheme to restore lord gayville to his senses without violence or injury to any one of the parties   sir clement let me hear it   clifford why the wench being cut short of marketing by word of mouth which she was doing in all due form when you came in desired me to write proposals i am inclined to do so we will show the answer to lord gayville and depend upon it there will be character enough displayed to cure him of the sentimental part of his attachment   sir clement i like your idea  sit down and put it into execution immediately  clifford writes   sir clement to himself he is quick at invention  has a pretty turn at profession  a proud and peremptory show of honor that

long life   enter blandish lady emily blandish i am horridly peevish have you any thing diverting in news or flattery   blandish in the latter madam nothing my admiration has all the dullness of truth but show me what you think a flaw and i will try without flattery to convince you it is a beauty   lady emily tolerably expressed  but the idea of a faultless woman is false in point of encomium she would be respectable aweful and unattracting odd as it may seem a woman to charm requires a little dash of harmless imperfection i know i have a thousand amiable faults that i would not part with for the world so try again something more new and refined   blandish examine my heart lady emily and you will find both the novelty of disinterested passion and refinement acquired by the study of you   lady emily rather better but that does not please me much the less perhaps as it is rather out of your way and more in that of my friend your sister who i observe always put a compliment in full view  yours generally come more forcibly by affording us the pleasure of finding them out  it is the excellency of a brilliant to play in the dark   blandish allow yourself to be the brilliant and attend to another allusion with trembling ambition i confess that not content with admiring the jewel i would wear it   lady emily wear it   blandish as an appendage to my heart  conscious of it is value proud of its display and devoted to its preservation   lady emily riddles mr blandish  but so let them remain  i assure you this hour is very inauspicious for explanation   blandish i fear so for in an hour when clifford proves treacherous who can escape suspicion   lady emily clifford for what purpose is he introduced in this conversation   blandish you asked me for intelligence the latest is that clifford has been detected in a clandestine intercourse with the object of lord gayvilles secret passion that he has betrayed the confidence of his friend and patron and actually carried her off aside which gayville knows by this time with all its aggravations or prompt has not been as active as he used to be   lady emily with emotion blandish this is a poor project clifford treacherous to his friend you might as soon make me believe gayville dispassionate my uncle charitable or you ingenuous   blandish his conduct does not rest upon opinion but proof and when you know it you must think of him with aversion   lady emily must i then dont let me hear a word more  i have aversions enough already  peevishly   blandish it is impossible you can apply that word to one whose only offense is to adore you kisses her hand   enter clifford clifford aside surprised blandish so favored   lady emily aside perverse accident what mistakes now will he make   blandish aside the enemy has surprised me  but the only remedy in such emergencies is to show a good countenance   clifford i fear i have been guilty of an unpardonable intrusion   blandish mr clifford never can intrude but though you had not come so apropos yourself  lady emily will bear testimony i have not spared my pains to remove any prejudices she might have entertained   lady emily had you not better repeat in your own words mr blandish all the obliging things you have said of this gentleman   clifford it is not necessary madam  if without robbing you of moments that i perceive are precious    lady emily sir   clifford i might obtain a short audience looking at blandish   blandish aside he is devilish impudent  but he cannot soon get over facts and i will take care the conference shall not be long to lady emily  lady emily hear mr clifford and judge if i have misrepresented him  to clifford when you want a friend you know where to find him   exit lady emily this is an interview mr clifford that i desire not to be understood to have authorized it is not to me you are accountable for your actions  i have no personal interest in them   clifford i know it too well   lady emily peevishly do not run away with the notion neither that i am therefore interested in any other persons  you have among you vexed and disconcerted me but there is not a grain of partiality in all my embarrassment  if you have any eyes you may see there is not   clifford happy blandish your triumph is evident   lady emily blandish the odious creature  he is my abhorrence  you are hardly worse yourself in my bad opinion though you have done so much more to deserve it   clifford how cruel are the circumstances that compel me to leave you under these impressions  nay more  at such a time to urge a request that during your most favorable thoughts of me would have appeared strange if not presumptuous this is the key of my apartment it contains a secret that the exigency of the hour obliged me against inclination or propriety to lodge there should sir clement return before me i implore you to prevent his discovery and give to what you find within your confidence and protection lord gayville  but i shall go too far  the most anxious event of my life presses on me i conjure you to comply by all the compassion and tenderness nature has treasured in your heart  not for me  but for occasions worthy their display gives the key which she receives with some reluctance and exit   lady emily heigho  its well he is gone without insisting on my answer i was in a sad flutter of indecision what mysterious means he takes to engage me in a confidence which i could not directly accept  i am to find a letter i  the story of his heart  its errors and defense  my brothers name also  to furnish me with a new interest in the secret and one i might avow  one may dislike this art but must be sensible of his delicacy  ah when those two qualities unite in a man i am afraid he is an overmatch for the wisest of us  hark  sure that is the sound of my uncles coach  looks out of the window it is he  and now for the secret  curiosity  curiosity innate irresistible principle in womankind be my excuse before i dare question my mind upon other motives exit   scene iv another apartment enter lady emily oh lud i could hardly tremble more at opening this mans apartment were there a possibility of finding him within side how do people find courage to do a wrong thing when an innocent discovery cannot be prosecuted without such timidity  approaches the door timidly and unlocks it enter miss alton lady emily amazement miss alton what brought you here   miss alton madam i was brought here for an hours concealment who i really am i would not if possible to avoid it divulge in this house when you saw me last you honored me with a favorable opinion  my story not explained at full might subject me to doubts that would shake your candor the circumstances in which i am involved are strange and have succeeded with the rapidity and confusion of a dream  suffer me to recover for a moment my disordered spirits and i will satisfy you farther   lady emily what shall i do  she is pale and ready to faint  i cannot let her be exposed in such a situation  retire  you may rely upon me for present security  you know best your pretensions to my future opinion  hearing sir clement begone or you are discovered  shuts her in and locks cliffords door   enter sir clement sir clement oh the triumph of honor oh the sincerity of friendship how my opinions are ratified  how my system is proved   lady emily oh spirits spirits forsake me not  oh for a moments dissimulation   sir clement there are some now who would feed moroseness and misanthropy with such events to me they give delight as convictions and warnings to mankind   lady emily of how superior a quality my good uncle must be to the benevolence you possess it rises with the progress of mischief and is gratified upon principles of general good by finding confidence abused and esteem misplaced am i not right in attributing your joy at present so that sort of refinement   sir clement hah and to what sensations my good niece shall be attributed the present state of your spirits to the disgust you took to clifford almost at first sight it will not be with indifference but pleasure you will hear of his turning out the veriest rascal the most complete impostor the most abandoned  but hold hold  i must not wrong him by superlatives   he is matched too   lady emily really  i congratulate you upon such a check of charity   sir clement and i wish you joy my pretty pert one upon the credit your sex has acquired in producing this other chefdouvre  such a composition of the highest vices and the lowest    lady emily i know it will be in vain to oppose the pleasure you take in coloring by my want of taste to enjoy it but you may spare your preparatory shading and come to the points with which i am not acquainted   sir clement and pray my incurious niece with what points are you acquainted   lady emily that before mr clifford went abroad it is suspected his passions betrayed him into a fault that must be shocking to your morality and that i am sure it is not my intention to justify he ought to have resisted it is a shame we have not more examples of young men correcting the frailties of womankind  i dare say he neglected a fair opportunity of becoming a prodigy   sir clement i protest you have a pretty way of dressing up an apology for the venial faults of youth  and it comes with a peculiar grace from a delicate lady of twenty   lady emily come sir no more of your sarcasms i can treat wrong actions with levity and yet consider them with detestation prudes and pretenders condemn with austerity to the collection of suspicions you are master of let me add one  in a young lady of the delicacy  and age you have described always suspect the virtue that does not wear a smile   sir clement and the sincerity that wears one aukwardly  if you would know the history of clifford ask but your brother if of the precious adventurer he has carried off enquire of miss alscrip  we shall come up with her yet  woe be to any one who harbors her   enter prompt hastily prompt joy to your honor i see you have caught her   sir clement her  who   prompt lady emily turning i ask your ladyships pardon  having only the glimpse of a petticoat and knowing the object of my chase was in this house i confess i mistook you   sir clement in this house   prompt as sure as we are  she came in thorough the garden under mr cliffords arm  up the other stairs i suppose  if my lady had been hereabouts  she must have seen her   lady emily in confusion yes but unluckily i was quite out of the way   sir clement such audaciousness passes credibility  emily what do you think of him   lady emily that he is a monster aside how my dilemmas multiply   sir clement what to my house to his apartment here i wonder he did not ask for protection in yours  what should you have said   lady emily i dont know but had i been so imposed upon as to receive her i should scorn to betray even the criminal i had engaged to protect   sir clement tries at the door finds it locked emily my dear do ring the bell to know if the housekeeper has a second key to this lock   lady emily what shall i do   prompt she is certainly there sir and cannot escape where can she better remain till you can assemble all parties confront them face to face and bring every thing that has passed to a full explanation   sir clement with all my heart send and collect every body concerned as fast as possible  how i long for so complicated an exhibition of the purity of the human heart  come with me emily and help to digest my plan  friends and lovers what a scene shall we show you takes lady emily under the arm exeunt   end of the fourth act act v scene i enter clifford and mr rightly clifford your knowledge in the profession mr rightly is as questionless as your integrity but there is something so surprising in the discovery of the charlton estate   rightly it is so strange that i will not pronounce a positive opinion till i have read again the collateral papers and considered fully the descents in your family your grandfather i think was deceived in supposing he had a right to sell that part of the charlton estate which alscrip proposes for his daughters portion the strength of this old settlement must have escaped my brother lawyer or he was mad when he put it into my hands   clifford if you knew too how the value of the acquisition is enhanced by the opportune moment in which it presents itself  i am in too much emotion to thank you as i ought   rightly sir i want neither compliment nor acknowledgement for revealing what i should be a party to dishonesty to conceal  but that duty done would it be an abuse of benevolence unworthy as some of the parties may be to preserve the peace of all concerned   clifford in what manner   rightly sir clement flint will renounce the alscrip alliance at the first appearance of this defalcation and if i am well informed lord gayville will not lament the loss of his intended bride the young lady is therefore free and still possessed of a great inheritance   clifford i do not yet perceive what you aim at   rightly she has the faults that wealth and a false education create but they are not incurable marry her yourself by sinking the claim in the union with his family you command the fathers approbation and the daughter must be of a strange mould indeed if the same obligation does not become a corrective of her pride and an excitement to her gratitude smiling i give some token of my friendship when as a lawyer i propose you a wife instead of a suit in chancery   clifford i feel all the kindness of your suggestion but if my claim is precarious it is as repugnant to my delicacy as to my inclination to realize it upon such terms if it is substantial i have such a disposition to make  you have a right to all my thoughts but i have an appointment to obey that admits no time for explanation favor me for a moment with your pencil rightly takes out a pencil and pocketbook and a blank page in that memorandum book   clifford writes rightly my life on it his head is turned upon some girl not worth a shilling   there is an amiable defect but a very observable one in the nature of some men a good head and heart operate as effectually as vice or folly could do to make them improvident   clifford mr rightly i confide to your hands a new secret relative to the charlton estate do not read it till you return home gives the book aside and going there gayville is one reply to your challenge  and now for another   rightly one moment sir  i engage for no secrecy that my own judgment shall not warrant   clifford and the benevolence of your heart approve  those are my conditions    exeunt on opposite sides scene ii hydepark enter lord gayville impetuously looking at his watch not here i am sure i marked the hour as well as the place precisely in my note walks about had i been told three days ago that i should have been the appellant in a premeditated duel i should have thought it an insult upon my principles  that clifford should be the cause of my transgressing the legal and sacred duties we have ever both maintained  oh it would have seemed a visionary impossibility  but he comes to cut reflection short   enter clifford lord gayville i waited for you sir   clifford bows in silence   lord gayville that ceremonial would grace an encounter of punctilio but applies ill to the terms upon which i have called you here   clifford what terms are those my lord   lord gayville vengeance ample final vengeance draw sir   clifford no my lord my sword is reserved for more becoming purposes it is not the instrument of passion and has yet been untried in a dispute with my friend   lord gayville but why is it not ready for a different trial the vindication of perfidy the blackest species of perfidy that ever the malignant enemy of mankind infused into the human breast  perfidy to the friend who loved and trusted you and in the nearest interests of his heart   clifford take care my lord should my blood boil like yours and it is rising fast you know not the punishment that awaits you i came temperate your gross provocation and thirst of blood make temperance appear disgrace  i am tempted to take a revenge    lord gayville draws the means are ready come sir you are to give an example of qualities generally held incompatible  bravery and dishonor   clifford another such word and by heaven  how have i deserved this opinion   lord gayville ask your conscience  under the mask of friendship you have held a secret intercourse with the woman i adore you have supplanted me in her affections you have robbed me of the very charm of my life  can you deny it   clifford i avow it all   lord gayville unparalleled insolence of guilt   clifford are you sure there is nothing within the scope of possibility that would excuse or atone    lord gayville death  death only  no abject submission  no compromise for infamy  choose instantly  and save yourself from the only stretch of baseness left  the invention of a falsehood to palliate    clifford in the utmost agitation and drawing his sword falsehood  you shall have no other explanation after a struggle within himself clifford drops the point and exposes his breast   lord gavyville stand upon your defense sir  what do you mean   clifford you said nothing but my life would satisfy you take it and remember me   lord gayville i say so still  but upon an equal pledge  i am no assassin   clifford with great emotion if to strike at the heart of your friend more deeply than that poor instrument in your hand could do makes an assassin you have been one already   lord gayville that look that tone how like to innocence had he not avowed such abominable practices    clifford i avow them again i have rivaled you in the love of the woman you adore  her affections are rivetted to me i have removed her from your sight secured her from your recovery    lord gayville damnation   clifford i have done it to save unguarded beauty to save unprotected innocence to save a sister   lord gayville a sister   clifford with exultation vengeance ample final vengeance a pause it is accomplished  over him  and over myself  my victory is complete   lord gayville where shall i hide my shame   clifford well share it and forget it here   embraces lord gayville why did you keep the secret from me   clifford i knew it not myself till the strange concurrence of circumstances to which you were in part witness a few hours since brought it to light i meant to impart to you the discovery when my temper took fire  let us bury our mutual errors in the thought that we now for life are friends   lord gayville brothers clifford  let us interchange that title and doubly doubly ratify it unite me to your charming sister accept the hand of lady emily in return  her heart i have discovered to be yours  well leave the world to the sordid and the tasteless let an alscrip or a sir clement flint wander after the fantom of happiness we shall find her real retreat and hold her by the bonds she covets virtue love and friendship   clifford not a word more my lord the bars against your proposal are insuperable   lord gayville what bars   clifford honor propriety  and pride   lord gayville pride clifford   clifford yes my lord harriet clifford shall not steal the hand of a prince nor will i  though doting on lady emily with a passion like your own bear the idea of a clandestine union in a family to whom i am bound by obligation and trust indeed my lord without sir clements consent you must think no more of my sister   lord gayville stern stoic but i will and not clandestinely i will instantly to sir clement   clifford do not be rash  fortune or some better agent is working in wonders  meet me presently at your uncles in the mean while promise not to stir in this business   lord gayville what hope from delay   clifford promise    lord gayville i am in a state to catch at shadows  i will try to obey you   clifford farewell  exeunt   scene iii sir clements house enter miss alscrip in great spirits followed by mrs blandish miss alscrip i am delighted at this summons from sir clement blandish poor old clearsight i hope he has projected a reconciliation   mrs blandish how i rejoice to see those smiles returned to the face that was made for them   miss alscrip returned blandish i desire you will not insinuate it ever was without them  why sure you would not have the world imagine the temper of an heiress of my class was to be ruffled by the loss of a paltry earl  i have been highly diverted with what has passed from beginning to end   mrs blandish well if good humor can be a fault sure the excess you carry it to must be the example   miss alscrip i desire it may be made known in all companies that i have done nothing but laugh  nay it is true too   mrs blandish my dear creature of what consequence is the truth when you are charging me with the execution of your desires   miss alscrip could any thing be more diverting than my lords intriguing with my chambermaid before marriage that must be your cue   mrs blandish excellent   miss alscrip the design was in rule and founded upon the best precedents  only the time in the newspaper phrase was premature he he he   mrs blandish he he he   miss alscrip and then the airs of the moppet  could any thing be more ridiculous   mrs blandish the rivalship you mean  rival miss alscrip  he he he half laugh   miss alscrip yes but when you take this tone in public laugh a little louder   mrs blandish rival miss alscrip ha ha ha   both ha ha ha ha ha ha   mrs blandish wiping her eyes as not quite recovered from her laugh for mirths sake what is become of the rival  who will you choose she shall have run away with   miss alscrip leave it in doubt as it is fixing circumstances confines the curiosity to one story which may be disproved uncertainty leaves it open to an hundred and makes them all probable but i hear some of the company upon the stairs now blandish  you shall be witness to the temper and dignity with which a woman of my consequence can discard a quality courtship that offends her  having sufficiently mortified the uncle and nephew with a triumphant raillery all my own i shall request lady emily to set the paphian mimp upon the family disappointment and leave them together to the exercise of the patience that usually attends the loss of a hundred thousand pounds   mrs blandish sweet tempered soul   enter sir clement flint sir clement miss alscrip your    as he is beginning to say your humble servant enter blandish out of breath blandish the duels over and the combatants in whole skins  never ran so fast since i was born    sir clement  to be too late by some minutes in your intelligence i know you feel the disappointment from the sincere affection you bear all parties   miss alscrip duel  pray let us hear the particulars  as there is no mischief i shall not faint   ironically sir clement i guess it has been of the common place kind  hats over the brows  glum silence  thrust  parry  and riposte  explain and shake hands your man of honor never sets his friend right till he has exchanged a shot  or a thrust oh a little essence of steel or gunpowder is a morning whet to the temper it carries off all qualms and leaves the digestion free for any thing that is presented to it   miss alscrip dear how fortunate considering the pills some folks have to swallow   sir clement blandish see if the door of cliffords room is yet unlocked there is a person within you little expect to find and that it may be proper for this lady and me to interrogate together  i dont know what to call her  inexplicability in petticoats  the door opens and   enter lady emily blandish lady emily   sir clement inexplicable with a vengeance   miss alscrip aside lady emily shut up in cliffords apartment beyond my expectation indeed with a malicious air   lady emily seems pleased sir clement dryly lady emily i know you were always cautious whom you visited and never gave a better proof of your discernment   lady emily never  oh my poor dear uncle you little think what is going to befall you   sir clement not a disappointment in love i hope   lady emily no but in something much nearer your heart  your system is threatened with a blow that i think and from my soul i hope it never will recover would you guess that the sagacious observations of your whole life are upon the point of being confounded by the production    sir clement of what   lady emily a woman of ingenuous discretion and a man of unaffected intregrity   sir clement hah   mrs blandish what can she mean   miss alscrip nothing good  she looks so pleasant   lady emily come forth my injured friend our personal acquaintance has been short but our hearts were intimate from the first sight presenting her your prisoner sir is miss harriot clifford   sir clement cliffords sister   miss alscrip what the runaway alton turned into a sprig of quality   lady emily disdainfully to miss alscrip the humble dependant of alscrips house  the wanton  the paragon of fraud  the only female that can equal clifford tauntingly to sir clement she is indeed with emphasis and affection   blandish aside oh rot the source of the family fondness  i see i have no card left in my favor  but the heiress goes to her and pays court during this conversation aside lady emily seems encouraging miss clifford  sir clement musing and by turns examining her   sir clement to himselfingenuous discretion   enter clifford and runs to his sister clifford my dearest harriot the joy i purposed in presenting you here is anticipated but my blameless fugitive relate the tale of your distresses and my pride in you will not be a wonder   miss clifford they have been short  and are overpaid by your indulgence insulted by the family i lived with made more wretched by a detested pursuit which my uncles violence enforced and confident of your being returned i fled to london for an asylum   sir clement which has been admirably chosen in my house   clifford sir i really think so lady emilys generosity your justice and my sisters honor make it sacred while clifford is speaking   enter lord gayville starts at seeing miss clifford sir clement perceiving lord gayville and peculiarly secure against the visits of this deteste pursuer   lord gayville with rapture her persecutor and her convert her virtues which no humility could conceal and every trial made more resplendant discovered disgraced and reclaimed a libertine   miss clifford how am i distressed  what ought i to answer   lord gayville impressed sentiment upon desire gave honor to passion and drew from my soul a vow which heaven chastise me when i violate to obtain her by a legal sacred claim or renounce fortune family and friends and become a selfdevoted outcast of the world   miss clifford oh brother interpose   sir clement my lord your fortune family and friends are much obliged to you your part is perfect  mr clifford you are called upon miss in strict propriety throws the business upon her relations  come finish the comedy join one of her hands to the gallants while with the other she covers her blushes  and he in rapture delivers the moral all for love or the world well lost miss clifford still appears agitated   clifford be patient my harriot this is the school for prejudice and the lesson of its shame is near   miss alscrip i vow these singular circumstances give me quite a confusion of pleasure the astonishing good fortune of my late protegee in finding so impassioned a friendship in her brothers bedchamber the captivating eloquence of lord gayville in winding up an eclaircissement which i admire  not for the first time  to day  and the superlative joy sir clement must feel at an union ounded upon the purity of the passions are subjects of such different congratulation that i hardly know where to begin   lady emily aside charming  her insolence will justify what so seldom occurs to one  a severe retort without a possible sense of compunction   miss alscrip but in point of fortune  dont imagine sir clement i would insinuate that the lady is destitute  oh lord far from it her musical talents are a portion  i cannot say i have yet seen a countess open a concert for her own benefit but there can be no reason why a woman of the first quality should not be directress of the opera  indeed after all that has happened it is the best chance i see for a good administration there   alscrip and rightly without alscrip why stop a moment  mr rightly death after chasing you all over the town dont be so impatient the instant i overtake you   sir clement what have we here  the lawyers in dispute   alscrip entering you have not heard my last word yet   rightly entering you have heard mine sir   alscrip whispering i will make the five thousand i offered ten   rightly millions would not bribe me  coming forward when i detect wrong and vindicate the sufferer i feel the spirit of the law of england and the pride of a practitioner   alscrip lucifer confound such practices in this part of the scene sir clement lord gayville lady emily clifford and miss clifford form one groupe   rightly opens a deed and points out a part of it to sir clement mr and miss alscrip carry on the following speeches on the side at which alscrip has entered and mr and mrs blandish are farther back observing alscrip that cursed cursed flaw    miss alscrip flaw who has dared to talk of one not in my reputation sir   alscrip no but in my estate which is a damned deal worse   miss alscrip how what  when  where  the estate that was to be settled upon me   alscrip yes but that me turned topsy turvey  when me broke into my room this morning and the devil followed to fly away with all my faculties at once  i am ruined  let us see what you will settle upon your poor father   miss alscrip i settle upon you   mrs blandish this is an embarrassing accident   miss alscrip yes and a pretty help you are with a drop chin like a frontispiece to the lamentations   rightly coming forward with sir clement i stated this with some doubt this morning but now my credit as a lawyer upon the issue  the heiress falls short of the terms in your treaty by two thousand pounds a year  which this deed lately and providentially discovered entails upon the heirs of sir william charlton and consequently in right of his mother upon this gentleman   lady emily how   lord gayville happy disappointment   sir clement aside two thousand a year to clifford it is pity for the parade of disinterestedness that he opened his designs upon emily before he knew his pretensions   lady emily aside now if there were twenty ceilings and as many floors could not i find a spot to settle my silly looks upon sir clement observes her with his usual shyness then turning toward alscrip palm a false title upon me i should have thought the attempt beyond the collective assurance of westminster hall  and he takes the loss as much to heart as if he bought the estate with his own money   alscrip with hesitation sir clement  what think you  of an amicable adjustment of all these businesses   sir clement ironically nothing can be more reasonable the value of miss alscrips amiable disposition placed against the abatement of her fortune is a matter of the most easy computation and to decide the portion mr clifford ought to relinquish of his acquisition  lady emily  will you be a referee   lady emily aside yes the lynx has me  i thought i should not escape  to him no sir my poor abilities only extend to an amicable endeavor here to miss alscrip and really miss alscrip i see no reason for your being dispirited there may be many ready made titles at market within the reach of your purse or why should not a woman of your consequence originate her own splendor there is an old admirer of mine  he would make a very pretty lord  and indeed would contribute something on his own part to ease the purchase  the blandish family is well with all administrations and a new coronet is always as big again as an old one i dont see how you could lay out part of your independency to more advantage   blandish aside yes but since flaws are in fashion i shall look a little into things before i agree to the bargain   lady emily and if you replace this part of your family pointing to miss clifford by making an humble companion of your old gentleman i protest i do not see any great alteration in your affairs   miss alscrip aside i will die before i will discover my vexation  and yet half crying no title  no place   lady emily depend upon it miss alscrip your place will be found exactly where it ought to be the public eye in this country is never long deceived  believe me  and cherish obscurity  title may bring forward merits but it also places our defects in horrid relief   miss clifford you seem to expect something from me miss alscrip  be in no pain for any thing that has passed between us  my pity has entirely overpowered my resentment   alscrip molly the sooner we get out of court the better  we have damnably the worst of this cause so come along molly taking her under the arm  and farewell to berkleysquare whoever wants alscrips house will find it in the neighborhood of furnivalsinn with the noble title of scrivener in capitals  blank bonds at the windows and a brass knocker at the door pulling her come along molly   miss alscrip half crying aside oh the barbarous metamorphosis  but his flusterums for a week will serve my temper as a regimen i will then take the management of my affairs into my own hands and break from my cloud anew and you shall find to the company there are those without a coronet that can be as saucy and as loud and stop the way in all public places as well as the best of you lady emily laughs yes madam and without borrowing your ladyships airs   alscrip pulling her come along molly   miss alscrip oh you have been a jewel of a father the company laugh   exeunt mr and miss alscrip mr and mrs blandish stay behind blandish aside what a cursed turn things have taken my schemes evaporate like inflammable air and down drops poor adventurer   lady emily mrs blandish sure you do not leave your friend miss alscrip in distress   mrs blandish well not disturb the ashes of the dead  my sweet lady emily    blandish none of your flourishes my dear sister  they already think you a walking dedication  when we cannot escape a situation the only way is to brave it  so let them tell us we are sycophants  be it so  then we are the best friends society has flattery is the diet of good humor and not one of you can live without it and when you quarrel with the family of blandish you leave refined cookery to be fed upon scraps by a poor cousin or a led captain  taking his sister under his arm   mrs blandish as she goes off oh the two charming pair exit with blandish   lord gayville precious groupe fare ye well to sir clement and now sir whatever may be your determinations toward me  here are pretensions you may patronize without breach of discretion the estate which devolves to my friend    rightly to prevent errors is not his to bestow   sir clement what now  more flaws   rightly the estate was his beyond the reach of controversy but before he was truly sure of it on his way to hydepark did this spendthrift by a stroke of his pen divest himself of every shilling  here is the covenant by which he binds himself to execute proper conveyances as soon as the necessary forms can be gone through   lord gayville and in favor of whom is this desperate act   rightly of a most dangerous seducer  a little mercenary that when she gets hold of the heart does not leave an atom of it our own   all how   rightly with feeling and there she stands pointing to miss clifford with a look and an emotion that wou d condemn her before any court in the universe   lady emily glorious  matchless clifford   miss clifford brother this must not be   clifford your pardon my dear harriet it is done sir clement my sisters fortune is still far short of what you expected with miss alscrip for that deficiency i have only to offer the virtues lord gayville has proved and the affection she found it easier to control than to coneeal if you will receive her thus circumstanced into your family mine has been an acquisition indeed   lady emily coming up to sir clement now sir where is suspicion where is now the ruling principle that governs mankind through what perspective by what trial will you find selfinterest here what not one pithy word to mock my credulity  alas poor yorick  quite chopfallen  forgive me sir i own i am agitated to extravagance  you thought me disconcerted at the first discovery i am delighted at the last there is a problem in my disposition worthy your solving   sir clement who has been profoundly thought full mr rightly favor me with that paper in your hand   rightly mr cliffords engagement sir gives the paper sir clement looks it over and tears it what do you mean sir   sir clement to cancel
