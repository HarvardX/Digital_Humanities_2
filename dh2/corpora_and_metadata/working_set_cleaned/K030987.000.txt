an appendix to john bull still in his senses or law is a bottomlesspit  printed from a manuscript found in the cabinet of the famous sir humphry polesworth and published as well as the three former parts by the author of the new atalantis  london printed for john morphew ner stationershall      price   d  an appendix to john bull still in his senses etc chap i the apprehending examination and imprisonment of jack for suspicion of poisoning the attentive reader cannot have forgot that in my last part the story of yan ptschirnsookers powder was interrupted by a message from frog i have a natural compassion for curiosity being much troubled with the distemper my self therefore to gratify that uneasy itching sensation in my reader i have procured the following account of that matter  yan ptschirnsooker came off as rogues usually do upon such occasions by peaching his partner and being extremely forward to bring him to the gallows jack was accused as the contriver of all the roguery and indeed it happened unfortunately for the poor fellow that he was known to bear a most inveterate spite against the old gentlewoman and consequently that never any ill accident happened to her but he was suspected to be at the bottom of it if she pricked her finger jack to be sure laid the pin in the way if some noise in the street disturbed her rest who could it be but jack in some of his nocturnal rambles if a servant run away jack had debauched him every idle tittletattle that went about jack was always suspected for the author of it however all was nothing to this last affair of the temperating moderating powder the hue and cry went after jack to apprehend him dead or alive wherever he could be found the constables looked out for him in all his usual haunts but to no purpose where do you think did they find him at last even smoking his pipe very quietly at his brother martins from whence he was carried with a vast mob at his heels before the worshipful mr justice overdo several of his neighbors made oath that of late the prisoner had been observed to lead a very dissolute life renouncing even his usual hypocrisy and pretenses to sobriety that he frequented taverns and eatinghouses and had been often guilty of drunkenness and gluttony at my lordmayors table that he had been seen in the company of lewd women that he had transferred his usual religious care of the engrossed copy of his fathers will to bank bills orders for tallies and debentures tale of the tub these he now affirmed with more literal truth to be meat drink and cloth the philosophers stone and the universal medicine that he was so far from showing his customary reverence to the will that he kept company with those that called his father a cheating rogue and his will a forgery that he not only sat quietly and heard his father railed at but often chimd in with the discourse and hugged the authors as his bosom friends tale of the tub that instead of asking for blows at the corners of the streets he now bestowed them as plentifully as he begged them before in short that he was grown a mere rake and had nothing left in him of old jack except his spite to john bulls mother  another witness made oath that jack had been overheard bragging of a trick he had found out to manage the old formal jade as he used to call her damn this numbdskull of mine quoth he that i could not light on it sooner as long as i go in this ragged tattered coat i am so well known that i am hunted away from the old womans door by every barking curr about the house they bid me defiance there is no doing mischief as an open enemy i must find some way or another of getting within doors and then i shall have better opportunities of playing my pranks besides the benefit of good keeping  two witnesses swore that several years ago there came to their mistrisss door a young fellow in a tattered coat that went by the name of timothy trim whom they did in their conscience believe to be the very prisoner resembling him in shape stature and the features of his countenance that the said timothy trim being taken into the family clapped their mistrisss livery over his own tattered coat that the said timothy was extremely officious about their mistrisss person endeavoring by flattery and talebearing to set her against the rest of the servants no body was so ready to fetch any thing that was wanted or reach what was dropped that he used to shove and elbow his fellow servants to get near his mistress especially when money was a paying or receiving then he was never out of the way that he was extremely diligent about every bodies business but his own that the said timothy while he was in the family used to be playing roguish tricks when his mistresss back was turned he would loll out his tongue make mouths and laugh at her walking behind her like a harlequin ridiculing her motions and gestures if his mistress looked about he put on a grave demure countenance as he had been in a fit of devotion that he used often to trip up stairs so smoothly that you could not hear him tread and put all things out of order that he would pinch the children and servants when he met them in the dark so hard that he left the print of his forefingers and his thumb in black and blue and then slink into a corner as if no body had done it out of the same malicious design he used to lay chairs and jointstools in their way that they might break their noses by falling over them the more young and unexperienced he used to teach to talk saucily and call names during his stay in the family there was much plate missing that being caught with a couple of silver spoons in his pocket with their handles wrenchd off he said he was only going to carry them to the goldsmiths to be mended that the said timothy was hated by all the honest servants for his illconditiond splenetick tricks but especially for his slanderous tongue traducing them to their mistress as drunkards thieves and whoremasters that the said timothy by lying stories used to set all the family together by the ears taking delight to make them fight and quarrel particularly one day sitting at table he spoke words to this effect i am of opinion quoth he that little short fellows such as we are have better hearts and could beat the tall fellows i wish it came to a fair trial i believe these long fellows as sightly as they are should find their jackets well thwackd a parcel of tall fellows who thought themselves affronted by this discourse took up the quarrel and to it they went the tall men and the low men which continues still a faction in the family to the great disorder of our mistresss affairs that the said timothy carried this frolic so far that he proposed to his mistress that she should entertain no servant that was above four foot seven inches high and for that purpose had prepared a gage by which they were to be measured that the good old gentlewoman was not so simple as to go into his projects she began to smell a rat this trim quoth she is an odd sort of a fellow methinks he makes a strange figure with that ragged tattered coar appearing under his livery cannot he go spruce and clean like the rest of the servants the fellow has a roguish leer with him which i dont like by any means besides he has such a twang in his discourse and an ungraceful way of speaking through the nose that one can hardly understand him i wish the fellow be not tainted with some bad disease the witnesses farther made oath that the said timothy lay out a nights and went abroad often at unseasonable hours that it was credibly reported he did business in another family that he pretended to have a squeamish stomach and could not eat at table with the rest of the servants though this was but a pretense to provide some nice bit for himself that he refused to dine upon saltfish only to have an opportunity to eat a calves head his favorite dish in private that for all his tender stomach when he was got by himself he would devour capons turkeys and sirloins of beef like a cormorant  two other witnesses gave the following evidence that in his officious attendance upon his mistress he had tried to slip in a powder into her drink and that once he was caught endeavoring to stifle her with a pillow as she was a sleep that he and ptschirnsooker were often in close conference and that they used to drink together at the rose where it seems he was well enough known by the true name of jack  the prisoner had little to say in his defense he endeavored to prove himself alibi so that the trial turned upon this single question whether the said timothy trim and jack were the same person which was proved by such plain tokens and particularly by a mole under the left pap that there was no withstanding the evidence therefore the worshipful mr justice committed him in order to his trial  chap ii how jacks friends came to visit him in prison and what advice they gave him jack hitherto had passed in the world for a poor simple wellmeaning halfwitted crackdbraind fellow people were strangely surpised to find him in such a roguery that he should disguise himself under a false name hire himself out for a servant to an old gentlewoman only for an opportunity to poison her they said that it was more generous to profess open enmity than under a profound dissimulation to be guilty of such a scandalous breach of trust and of the sacred rights of hospitality in short the action was universally condemned by his best friends they told him in plain terms that this was come as a judgment upon him for his loose life his gluttony drunkenness and avarice laying aside his fathers will in an old moldy trunk and turning stockjobber newsmonger and busiebody meddling with other peoples affairs shaking off his old serious friends and keeping company with buffoons and pickpockets his fathers sworn enemies that he had best throw himself upon the mercy of the court repent and change his manners to say truth jack heard these discourses with some compunction however he resolved to try what his new acquaintance would do for him they sent habakkuk slyboots who delivered him the following message as the peremptory commands of his trusty companions  habakkuk dear jack i am sorry for thy misfortune matters have not been carried on with due secrecy however we must make the best of a bad bargain thou art in the utmost jeopardy that is certain hang draw and quarter are the gentlest things they talk of however thy faithful friends ever watchful for thy security bid me tell thee that they have one infallible expedient left to save thy life thou must know we have got into some understanding with the enemy by the means of don diego dismallo he assures us there is no mercy for thee and that there is only one way left to escape it is indeed somewhat out of the common road however be assured it is the result of most mature deliberation   jack prithee tell me quickly for my heart is sunk down into the very bottom of my belly   hab it is the unanimous opinion of your friends that you make as if you hanged your self that they will give it out that you are quite dead and convey your body out of prison in a beir and that john bull being busied with his lawsuit will not enquire further into the matter   jack how do you mean make as if i had hanged my self   hab nay you must really hang your self up in a true genuine rope that there may appear no trick in it and leave the rest to your friends   jack truly this is a matter of some concern and my friends i hope will not take it ill if i enquire a little into the means by which they intend to deliver me a rope and a noose are no jesting matters   hab why so mistrustful have thou ever found us false to thee i tell thee there is one ready to cut thee down   jack may i presume to ask who it is that is entrusted with that important office   hab is there no end of thy how is and thy whys that is a secret   jack a secret perhaps that i may be safely trusted with for i am not like to tell it again i tell you plainly it is no strange thing for a man before he hangs himself up to enquire who is to cut him down   hab thou suspicious creature if thou must needs know it i tell thee it is sir roger he has been in tears ever since thy misfortune don diego and we have laid it so that he is to be in the next room and before the rope is well about thy neck rest satisfied he will break in and cut thee down fear not old boy well do it i will warrant thee   jack so i must hang my self up upon hopes that sir roger will cut me down and all this upon the credit of don diego a fine stratagem indeed to save my life that depends upon hanging don diego and sir roger   hab i tell thee there is a mystery in all this my friend a piece of profound policy if thou knew what good this will do to the common cause thy heart would leap for joy i am sure thou would not delay the experiment one moment   jack this is to the tune of all for the better what is your cause to me when i am hanged   hab refractory mortal if thou will not trust thy friends take what follows know assuredly before next full moon that thou will be hung up in chains or thy quarters perching upon the most conspicuous places of the kingdom nay i dont believe they will be contented with hanging they talk of empaling or breaking on the wheel and thou chusest that before a gentle suspending of thy self for one minute hanging is not so painful a thing as thou imagines i have spoke with several that have undergone it they all agree it is no manner of uneasiness be sure thou take good notice of the symptoms the relation will be curious it is but a kick or two with thy heels and a wry mouth or so sir roger will be with thee in the twinkling of an eye   jack but what if sir roger should not come will my friends be there to succor me   hab doubt it not i will provide every thing against to morrow morning do thou keep thy own secret say nothing i tell thee it is absolutely necessary for the common good that thou should go through this operation   chap iii how jack hanged himself up by the persuasion of his friends who broke their word and left his neck in the noose jack was a professed enemy to implicit faith and yet i dare say it was never more strongly exerted nor more basely abused than upon this occasion he was now with his old friends in the state of a poor disbanded officer after a peace or rather a wounded soldier after a battle like an old favorite of a cunning minister after the jobb is over or a decayed beauty to a cloyed lover in quest of new game or like an hundred such things that one sees every day there were new intrigues new views new projects on foot jacks life was the purchase of diegos friendship much good may it do them the interest of hocus and sir williams crawly which was now more at heart made this operation upon poor jack absolutely necessary you may easily guess that his rest that night was but small and much disturbed however the remaining part of his time he did not employ as his custom was formerly in prayer meditation or singing a double verse of a psalm but amused himself with disposing of his bankstock many a doubt many a qualm overspread his clouded imagination must i then quoth he hang up my own personal natural individual self with these two hands durus sermo what if i should be cut down as my friends tell me there is something infamous in the very attempt the world will conclude i had a guilty conscience is it possible that good man sir roger can have so much pity upon an unfortunate scoundrel that has persecuted him so many years no it cannot be i dont love favors that pass through don diegos hands on the other side my blood chills about my heart at the thought of these rogues with their bloody hands grabbling in my guts and pulling out my very entrails hang it for once i will trust my friends so jack resolved but he had done more wisely to have put himself upon the trial of his country made his defense in form many things happen between the cup and the lip witnesses might have been bribed juries managed or prosecution stopped but so it was jack for this time had a sufficient stock of implicit faith which led him to his ruin as the sequel of the story shows and now the fatal day was come in which he was to try this hanging experiment his friends did not fail him at the appointed hour to see it put in practice habakkuk brought him a smooth strong tough rope made of many a ply of wholesome scandinavian hemp compactly twisted together with a noose that slipped as glib as a birdcatchers gin jack shrunk and grew pale at first sight of it he handled it measured it stretched it fixed it against the ironbar of the window to try its strength but no familiarity could reconcile him to it he found fault with the length the thickness and the twist nay the very color did not please him will nothing less thn hanging serve quoth jack will not my enemies take bail for my good behavior will they accept of a fine or be satisfied with the pillory and imprisonment a good round whipping or burning in the cheek  habakkuk nothing but your blood will appease their rage make haste else we shall be discovered there is nothing like surprising the rogues how they will be disappointed when they hear that thou have have prevented their revenge and hanged thine own self   jack that is true but what if i should do it in effigies is there never an old pope or pretender to hang up in my stead we are not so unlike but it may pass   hab that can never be put upon sir roger   jack are you sure he is in the next room have you provided a very sharp knife in case of the worst   hab do take me for a common liar be satisfied no damage can happen to your person your friends will take care of that   jack may not i quilt my rope it galls my neck strangely besides i dont like this running knot it holds too tight i may be stifled all of a sudden   hab thou have so many ifs and ands prithee dispatch it might have been over before this time   jack but now i think on it i would fain settle some affairs for fear of the worst have a little patience   hab there is no having patience thou art such a faintling silly creature   jack o thou most detestable abominable passive obedience did i ever imagine i should become thy votary in so pregnant an instance how will my brother martin laugh at this story to see himself out done in his own calling he has taken the doctrine and left me the practice no sooner had he uttered these words but like a man of true courage he tied the fatal cord to the beam fitted the noose and mounted upon the bottom of a tub the inside of which he had often graced in his prosperous days this footstool habakkuk kicked away and left poor jack swinging like the pendulum of pauls clock the fatal noose performed its office and with most strict ligature squeezed the blood into his face till it assumed a purple dye while the poor man heaved from the very bottom of his belly for breath habakuk walked with great deliberation into both the upper and lower room to acquaint his friends who received the news with great temper and with geers and scoffs instead of pity jack has hanged himself quoth they let us go and see how the poor rogue swings then they called sir roger sir roger quoth habakkuk jack has hanged himself make haste and cut him down sir roger turned first one ear and then the other not understanding what he said   hab i tell you jack has hanged himself up   sir roger who is hanged   hab jack   sir roger i thought this had not been hanging day   hab but the poor fellow has hanged himself   sir roger then let him hang i dont wonder at it the fellow has been mad these twenty years with this he slunk away   then jacks friends began to hunch and push one another why dont you go and cut the poor fellow down why dont you and why dont you not i quoth one not i quoth another not i quoth a third he may hang till doomsday before i relieve him nay it is credibly reported that they were so far from succouring their poor friend in this his dismal circumstance that ptschirnsooker and several of his companions went in and pulled him by the legs and thumpd him on the breast then they began to rail at him for the very thing which they had both advised and justified before viz his getting into the old gentlewomans family and putting on her livery the keeper who performed the last office coming up found jack swinging with no life in him he took down the body gently and laid it on a bulk and brought out the rope to the company this gentlemen is the rope that hanged jack what must be done with it upon which they ordered it to be laid among the curiosities of gresham college and it is called jacks rope to this very day however jack after all had some small tokens of life in him but lies at this time past hopes of a total recovery with his head hanging on one shoulder without speech or motion the coroners inquest supposing him dead brought him in non compos  chap iv the conference between don diego dismallo and john bull during the time of the foregoing transaction don diego was entertaining john bull  d diego i hope sir this days proceeding will convince you of the sincerity of your old friend diego and the treachery of sir roger   j bull what is the matter now   d diego you have been endeavoring for several years to have justice done upon that rogue jack but what through the remissness of constables justices and packed juries he has always found the means to escape   j bull what then   d diego consider then who is your best friend he that would have brought him to condign punishment or he that has saved him by my persuasion jack had hanged himself if sir roger had not cut him down   j bull who told you that sir roger has done so   d diego you seem to receive me coldly methinks my services deserve a better return   j bull since you value your self upon hanging this poor scoundrel i tell you when i have any more hangingwork i will send for thee i have some better employment for sir roger in the mean time i desire the poor fellow may be looked after when he first came out of the northcountry into my family under the pretended name of timothy trim the fellow seemed to mind his loom and his spinningwheel till some body turned his head then he grew so pragmatical that he took upon him the government of my whole family i could never order any thing within or without doors but he must be always giving his counsel sorsooth nevertheless tell him i will forgive what is past and if he would mind his business for the future and not meddle out of his own sphere he will find that john bull is not of a cruel disposition   d diego yet all your skilful physicians say that nothing can recover your mother but a piece of jacks liver boiled in her soup   j bull those are quacks my mother abhors such canibals food she is in perfect helth at present i would have given many a good pound to have had her so well some time ago there are indeed two or three troublesome old nurses that because they believe i am tenderhearted will never let me have a
