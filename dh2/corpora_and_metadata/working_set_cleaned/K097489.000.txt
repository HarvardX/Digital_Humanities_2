the way to be rich and respectable  addressed to men of small fortune  in this pamphlet is given  an estimate showing that a gentleman with a wife four children and five servants may residing in the country with a few acres of land live as well as and make an appearance in life equal to a man of  000l a year and yet not expend  00l including the rent both of house and land and still be able in the course of  0 years to lay by   00l  the plan of living in this estimate is not ideal only but has been absolutely pursued by the author many years  such as are fond of farming will here find the expenses attending and the profits arising from the cultivation of land feeding of sheep etc etc  the second edition  london printed for the author and sold by r baldwin paternoster row and all booksellers in town and country  price  s  d  the way to be rich and respectable addressed to men of small fortune the great degree of luxury to which this country has arrived within a few years is not only astonishing but almost dreadful to think of time was when those articles of indulgence which now every mechanic aims at the possession of were enjoyed only by the lord or baron of a district men were then happy to be the vassals or dependants of that lord and prided themselves in little but their submission and allegiance this was the state of things during feudal government but as on the increase of trade riches increased men began to feel new wants they became gradually less hardy and robust grew effeminate as their property accumulated and sighed for indulgences they never dreamed of before  methods of conveying these indulgencies from one part of the kingdom to another were then studied roads were made passable and carriages invented  for many ages coaches were so great a luxury that none but old families were seen in them and if they attempted once in a dozen years to travel a few miles in one perhaps in the course of the journey a whole village with their teams were called in aid to drag the heavy vehicle out of the clay and set it on its wheels again  riding on horseback being the only means of visiting a neighbor beyond the reach of a walk and that only in the summertime and it is but a very few years since that ladies went about from place to place upon a pillion made roads were then unknown and so little desire had the people to stir beyond the bounds of their parish that even mending them was never thought of  on the establishment of posts a general communication was opened between all parts of the kingdom and people received intelligence of every little improvement that was made a desire to inspect those improvements gave men an excentric turn they were eager to see what was doing at some distance from home and rambled wide for that purpose the inconvenience and indeed impossibility of traveling but at certain seasons of the year led the way to the making of roads making of roads drew thousands abroad and a wish to be thought opulent by those whom they visited led them into luxury of dress the homespun garb then gave way to more costly attire and respectable plainness was soon transformed into laughable frippery  in a few years refinements took place in manners and well had it been were they merely refinements but the misfortune is they soon spread into extravagancies and from being commendable became objects of censure in the reign of charles i luxuries were every where seen and though the civil wars for some time smothered them they broke out afresh in the reign of charles ii wealth then poured in upon the nation gentlemen vied with each in the appearance they made many by these means were ruined estates changed their possessors a fluctuation of property began and every succeeding year gave birth to fresh wants and new expenses luxury however had not then gained its present footing it is true the profligacy of the capital made some inroads upon the country but the inhabitants of the country looked on it with dread and astonishment some of the nobility and principal gentry at this time spent part of their winter in london but the rest of the year they lived amongst their tenants with their usual hospitality the expenses of this age were confined to the education of their children to their houses their buildings their furniture their attendants and their entertainments and their tenants and neighbors were considerably the better for it the more they circulated their property within their own estates the richer their estates became and the more powerful and respectable they grew effeminacy of manners was then seen only in cities balls and assemblies were scarcely known and equipages far from being general  matters however rested not here things gazed at with astonishment quickly grew familiar the infection of the first class soon spread among the second and what they formerly censured they presently approved gentlemen of small estates began annually to visit the capital they gradually made their visits longer and longer till at last it became the fashion to reside only in the country when the heat made it intolerable in town stagecoaches were established the communication between london and the country became more and more open a taste for elegancies spread itself through all ranks and degrees of men and an equipage was considered as a necessary of life  what is the case now are things otherwise than they were no expenses are yet increasing and we are still refining upon luxuries the several cities and large towns of this island catch the manners of the metropolis and are vicious and extravagant in proportion to the wealth and number of their inhabitants scarce a town now of any magnitude but has its theater royal its concerts its balls and its cardparties the notions of splendor and amusement that prevail in the capital are eagerly adopted the various changes of the fashion exactly copied and the whole manner of life studiously imitated flys and machines pass from city to city great towns become the winter residence of those whom slenderness of fortune will not carry to london and the country is every where deserted  if i might presume to dictate to the world i would venture to say that a man of landed property is never so respectable as when refident on his estate when improving his lands and enriching his tenants when his beneficence may be read in the looks of the poor when his house is open not with the stiffness of a public day that tells the neighborhood he would not be perplexed at another time but with all the hospitality of an ancient baron  gentlemen of very extensive property may act as they please the dissipation and expenses of a capital can no other ways injure them than in the opinion of their neighbors but as to men of small fortune the less they see of london the better look round among the families we know and we can easily trace the infection of the metropolis the more they pay their visits there and the longer they continue the more visible are their follies and not only their follies but their failings and their vices the honest frankness of the country gentleman is obliterated by the equivocal politeness of the courtier and the open sincerity of the good neighbor lost in the artifice and deceit of the man of fashion  for many years a country squire has been an object of ridicule but why no other reason can be given but that want of polish that too often characterizes the fops of the age if we divest ourselves of prejudice he will not appear in so contemptible a light it is true he may want taste and politeness but he may possess qualities infinitely superior honest unadorned freedom is preferable to studied and fashionable deceit the country squire lives upon his estate spends his patrimony among his tenants and his neighbors which form as it were but one family around him and a spirit of hospitality opens his doors to every comer while the fine gentleman visits his domain perhaps but once in the summer stays there as little as he can help disdains any familiarity with his neighbors neglects his grounds and leaves his tenants at the mercy of his steward in short an effeminate life emasculates the fine gentleman and renders him unfit for any thing but sipping of tea and dealing the cards whilst the robust and manly exercises of the squire keep him healthy and hardy and inured to hunger danger and fatigue enable him when called upon in the public cause to be of real service to his country  but it is to be lamented that the true country gentleman is seldom to be found the luxuries and effeminacies of the age have softened down the hardy roughness of former times and the country like the capital is one scene of dissipation if there be any economy in their expenses it is merely the saving of necessaries to waste on superfluities the private gentleman with three or four hundred pounds a year must have his horses his dogs his pictures his carriages his parties of pleasure equally with him of five times his fortune dress show and entertainment engross his attention his lands are unimproved debts accumulate upon him he mortgages his estate and when he has lived to the end of his fortune he either puts a dreadful period to his existence or wears out the remainder of his life a beggar  however alarming this picture may be it is nevertheless a just one as i take it the happiness of life consists in health ease and competency which is as much within the reach of a gentleman of three hundred pounds a year as one of three thousand if the articles of living are dearer than they were some few years back and they certainly are a hundred per cent it ought to quicken the industry of every one to increase his income if possible or reduce his expense in proportion to his fortune  it is not in the power of men who have the income only of a small estate to support them to increase their revenues but they may decrease their expenses or lay out their money to advantage frugality and economy have put many upon a footing with men of larger fortunes and often made them far more respectable  nothing gives superiority in life but independency whilst we are at the command of another we are in a state of subordination it is being master of ones self only that makes a man free and it is independency that makes him great  now be our fortune as great as it will we are never independent whilst we are in debt and can a man be said to be free while it is in the power of his tailor or his shoemaker to confine him a mistaken notion that a reduction in our way of living is disgraceful has led many a man to his ruin retrenching our expenses when we have lived too fast is a proof of good sense it declares an abhorrence of our follies and a determination to be in future free it is highly degrading to make a figure at the expense of others villains of every denomination have done it an honest man therefore will despise the thought and if his connections have insensibly led him on from one expense to another till he finds himself involved he will pursue the earliest and the readiest means to discharge his debts and set himself at liberty  such is the absurdity in life that men are rated in worth according to the appearance they make keep up appearances  said a dissipated poet keep up appearances there lies the test the world will give thee credit for the rest   this idle notion has brought on the destruction of thousands in this luxurious age wealth is the only object of admiration and to wear the appearance of wealth we become expensive and extravagant in our manner of living thus we go on till we exhaust the little property we possess and when we can keep ourselves no longer afloat on what is called credit we sink into beggary and contempt  he who lives within his income may be truly called a rich man it is this that gives the hollanders the reputation of being wealthy they never live to the extent of their fortunes and of course are able to do a deal of good a family estate with them is seldom put up to sale whereas with us inheritances are ever at market a dutchman contributes as largely and as cheerfully to the exigencies of the state or to the erection of a public building as he would to the repairs of his house or the decoration of his garden  to be respectable it is not necessary to live in a certain line of life  every man may be considered as the center of a circle some of a larger some of a smaller and in this light he is of greater or of less importance according to the character he bears  he who has fewest wants and is most able to live within himself is not only the happiest but the richest man and if he does not abound in what the world calls wealth he does in independency  though he may not be a peer of his own country he is a lord of the creation may fill his station equal to the first of men and look down with pity and contempt on the tinselled sycophant though covered with an ermined robe and parading with a ducal coronet  i will allow it is rather mortifying to see a neighbor of less pretensions than ourselves living in a degree of splendor which we cannot reach if his fortune be large enough to admit of it it is well if not he is an object of contempt but be it as it may whilst we have sufficient to command the necessaries and indulgencies of life wanting the superfluities and do absolutely enjoy them we are in a situation equal to any man and if we keep but a pair of horses and pay for that pair we are far more respectable in the eyes of sensible people than he who is drawn in a coach and six but his gate everlastingly crowded with importunate creditors  persons with circumscribed fortunes or whose family increases upon them would do well to retrench their expenses in time or retire from towns and lay out their money with economy it is wonderful to think what an appearance in life a person may make for a little money who resides wholly in the country and makes the most of what he possesses i speak not to persons in trade as the scheme may be impracticable with them but to gentlemen of small fortune who in a rural retreat with a few acres of land may live as well on three or four hundred pounds a year as many do on three times the sum the occupier of a middling farm enjoys all the necessaries and conveniences of life and many of its superfluities where shall we meet with better health than where temperance and exercise enliven our minds invigorate our bodies and give a constant flow of spirits a country life is commonly a cheerful one we there meet few of those rubs that embitter the hours of other men and are the too constant attendants on ambition and vanity it is there only that true happiness and independency can be found where honesty and the best of manners mark the man and where employment exempts from the ill effects of luxury  the following then is an estimate whereby a gentleman with a wife four children and five servants living in the country may with frugality save   00l in the course of twenty years keep two of his children at a boardingschool drink wine every day at his table

observations n b the crops on the lands should be changed every year but this will not alter the real product  in cultivating these    acres of land the horses will be employed only about    days in the year which on an average is only one day in the week of course your farming servant will often be at liberty to thresh your corn and do many other things this will save much of the money i have charged for labor  i have allowed a fourth horse in this estimate as should the gentleman be fond of riding he may keep one for that purpose the other three i would recommend should match in color and size and should have nag tails as should one fall lame another is ready to supply its place besides they may occasionally be used as saddlehorses or were the whole four to match with a very little extraexpence in the harness and an additional jacket to lay by they might all be put to the carriage at times  no   the meatestimate twelve porkers should be killed yearly that is about one amonth and   hogs for bacon thus twelve porkers at   stone each or    lb give of meat     lb four hogs one sow is sufficient to supply the family with sixteen hogs yearly for bacon at    stone each or  00 lb gives  00 lb            lb of meat is about    lb weekly equal to four days provision for   persons lest living on swines fresh four days in a week should be thought improper it may be observed that your butcher will occasionally take a side of pork and give other meat in exchange thus you need eat pork only two days in the week and the other two bacon or ham with poultry and  fowls ducks turkeys pigeons and geese will give the fifth days provision for the same number  the expense of the above is included in the farm all that is necessary then to be paid for meat is the provision of a days thus l s d   lb beef or mutton at   d 0       lb fish salt fish bought of a wholesale dealer will not cost more than   d per lb which will allow more to be paid for fresh fish besides if near a river some kinds of fish may be caught occasionally at   d 0     per week 0     or per year l      0  no   the horseestimate horses may be turned out to grass from about may  0 to october  0 they then should be taken into the stable and strawfed with corn till about february  0 after this they should be fed with hay and corn till may  0 again  now it will require of grass to feed   horses through the summer with the addition of lattermath and turning into stubble   acres when fed with hay each horse will eat about   trusses per week brought on but i allow   trusses to afford for hay cut into chaff this amounts to about two loads for each horse   for the four   acres if a pair of these horses are used often in the carriage they should never be kept upon straw of course while the other two are fed on straw these will eat about   loads more of hay this with the   loads reckoned above will be the produce of   acres     i allow each horse half a peck of oats a day from oct  0 to may  0 that is   quarters   bushels   peck which for the four is about    quarters but it may be necessary to give the carriage horses the same quantity all the summer which in the whole consumes    quarters and a half the other two horses need no corn in the summer unless very hard worked  nb to save grass and oats green clover might be given to horses in the stable till near the middle of october for while they feed on this corn is not necessary  l s d horses should have as much chaff as they will cat besides the chaff of the corn give each a bushel of cut chaff daily hay and straw mixed which will cost a halfpenny per bushel cutting and that for the time he is in the stable will be   0 bushels etc 0     shoeing once in six weeks at  s and  0d per set the price paid by farmers 0      physic

decline in value of   horses annually   0 0    0 0  no   the cowestimate acres supposing a cow to be dry three months in the year during which time she may be fed upon straw there will require only   months good feed now one acre and a half of grass will feed her well from the time you lay your pastures up for hay suppose from the middle of april to the middle of october six months with the occasionally turning them on the common and into the stubbles the spring grass of those pastures before laid up for hay will keep her from the middle of february to the middle of april one month so that there are but two months to feed her on hay and she will in three months allowing a little for waste eat about two loads that is at the rate of  0 lb per day thus the three cows will eat six loads the produce of   acres and also the grass in summer of      a cow with this keeping will yield milk and cream for the family and on an average about     lb of butter and     lb of cheese but in order to this they must be young cows  three cows then will yield annually     lb or about   lb and a half per week enough for the family  also     lb of cheese annually that is about    lb per week enough for the family  the skimmed milk will go a great way toward keeping the pigs and three calves annually will serve to meet other little expenses not thought of care must be taken to have two of these cows always in milk  l s d the decline in value of these cows will be annually about    0 0  if a gentlemen by way of amusement or lessening his expenses will add about fifty acres of land more to his thirtyfive he may with the same number of servants excepting a little assistance at harvest reap the following advantages with this difference only that it will require a little more of his own attention and leave his men and horses less at leisure to wait upon him he must then send the produce of his farm to market and instead of keeping a horse merely for the saddle he must admit him to draw occasionally but even here he may have his horses for his pleasure on an average two or three days in the week  these fifty acres i will suppose to be arable and as land will produce more one

the eighth year should lie fallow to renew the ground therefore deduct the rent etc and wear and tear etc of this year  0  0 0      0        l  0 s left profit in eight years is at the rate of   0 l  0 s per year this deducted from     l the amount of the family expenses page    leaves  0  l  0 s the total expenses of keeping the family etc  observations all lands will not yield the same course of crops but the produce in seven years will be nearly the same  i have supposed the ground to be tolerably good and a particular attention to be paid in keeping it clean well dressed and in good tilth for this purpose no straw is to be sold off the farm but wheat straw it is all to be converted into fodder and dung  if the farming servant can be spared at times he may thresh much of the grain himself this will be a saving and there are still many advantages to be reaped if a man will enter into the spirit of farming from a neighboring common in breeding sheep bringing up heifers etc and keeping geese  in short a tolerable good farm will upon an average produce with good management  0 s or  0 s per acre free of all expenses  the price that corn bears will often make an alteration in the profits of a farm but i have set it a medium price  if you wish to keep dogs i will suppose the game you kill to pay the expense of them  to such as wish to keep a few sheep the following estimate will be acceptable  fine large ewes with lamb may be bought in at michaelmas at about    s each which in the july following will sell again for l s d     0 the lamb will then sell for     0 the wool of the two shorn before sold will sell for about 0            deduct the first cost     0 leaves profit    0    observations it will take about an acre of grass to fatten five sheep but where grass is not plentiful they may be fed on stubble till christmas then on turnips till may day next on rye and then on clover till sold no meadows will do for sheep in the winter that are wet enough to let them sink up to the first joint of their legs it will rot them  note an acre of turnips will feed  00 for the space of ten days or about eight sheep from christmas day to may day  n b dung of sheep when folded upon land for the richness of the manure is equal in value to the profits arising from the sale of them  the principle implements necessary for a small farm are a wagon and a harness for ditto a broadwheeled cart and a harness for ditto a plough a pair of large harrows ditto smaller a roller a winnow a seed kit   shovels rakes measures sacks sieves etc and the whole may be bought new for about  0 l  if a gentleman does not understand farming he may soon acquire the knowledge from a clever servant  the following estimate will serve to show into what expenses some persons run for want of produce and economy expending that on a carriage which would maintain a family comfortably and elegantly  the expense of keeping a postcoach and four in a gentlemans own stable if he is obliged to

no allowance is here made for the occasional death of a horse nor for waste of hay and corn  n b there are turnpikes and sundry charges when out that ought to be considered also as part of the expense of keeping a carriage  finis
