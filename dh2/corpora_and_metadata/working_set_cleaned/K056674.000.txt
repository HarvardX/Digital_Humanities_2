a view of the real dangers of the succession from the peace with france being a sober enquiry into the securities proposed in the articles of peace and whether they are such as the nation ought to be satisfied with or no  london printed for j baker at the blackboy in paternoster row      price sixpence  a view of the real dangers of the succession from the peace with france etc the protestant succession is a thing of that consequence to this nation and upon which the peace and prosperity of the people does so entirely depend as from its nature and consequences very much justifies the anxieties of our minds about it this is the reason of most of that uneasiness in the several public transactions which many people express for fear lest that security for this succession which we have so much depended upon should suffer be lessened invaded or any way made precarious  these fears have been very much increased among us and the common people rendered very jealous by the public reports so frequent and so warmly spread among us of the increase of the pretenders interest the concert between the friends of the pretender at home and their confederates abroad particularly the terrible accounts of the french power which are now represented to us not only as formidable but as also firmly engaged to assist and reinstate the interest and title and person of the pretender  those have been the reasons why many people have been so warm against the treaty of peace with france and indeed whatever may have been objected by the friends of the ministry against those fears and uneasinesses of the people about the peace this must be owned that if all that has been said on the other side be true those fears and uneasinessess may be very rational no one can reasonably blame people for dislikeing the peace if that peace is calculated for bringing in the pretender and by consequence for overthrowing our protestant settlement on which our religion properties liberties trade and general peace do entirely depend  as the discontents on one hand have been fomented or increased upon those suppositions as abovesaid viz that the peace was ill made that there was no security in it for the protestant succession that the french king was strengthened by it to such a degree as to make him more dangerous than ever and that he was not discouraged by it from the jacobite interest so on the other hand it was confronted at first by little or nothing of argument founded upon fact but in general assuring the people that it was not so that the succession was confirmed the power of france reduced the pretender banished the succession recognized and the like but nothing appearing on either side the people remained fluctuating between various uncertainties influenced as to hopes and fears as their parties their instructers or rather deceivers on both sides prevailed and as the insinuations they offered worked upon their passions in this unfixd posture of mens minds it is no wonder if the generallity of the people fall into the worst for fear of evil is so easily capable to prevail above the hope of good having natural propensity always ready to fall into the scale with it that it is not to be wondered at if the reasoning part was overcome and we began universally to distrust that the pretender was hid in the secret of the peace and that the treaty was but a french mask to deceive the people  while the treaty remained an embrio imperfect and unfinished it could not be expected that this uncertainty on both sides could be mastered or that satisfactory arguments could be given either by one party or other to confirm what they had alleged before and gain the people one way or other  that difficulty is now over the treaty is finished the peace made the ratifications exchanged and the articles made public it has been the received opinion that the end and design of publications in such cases is allowed to be in order to general satisfaction and we are thereby tacitly admitted to reason upon debate and explain to one another the substance and meaning of the treaty that we may know what it is we have obtained by the war what confirmed gained and established by the peace and upon what foundation of security our liberties religion and estates stand for the time to come to do this calmly and impartially is the design of this work and the end is the more just in that two things of great consequence are proposed to be included in the design of doing it   if any difficulties should offer as private bystanding judgments may sometimes give hints to public transactions which even the persons acting however wise might not foresee it may not be too late to obtain such provision against them or against the consequences of them as may make up the deficiencies if any such were in the first part of the conduct that so the evil may be anticipated and the dissatisfactions which attend such things prevented   that if there are no difficulties but that all things are provided for sufficiently established and the peace liberty and religion of the nation secured by all the needful and due provision which was possible being made for the safety and certainty of the protestant succession people may be made duly sensible of it their doubts fears jealousies and apprehensions be removed and the real securities of their state placed in such a true light that they may no more be capable of being made uneasy by misrepresentations and suggestions of persons wickedly disposed   there are diverse other good ends and purposes contained in a design so useful as this of discusing the articles of peace which perhaps may in the following work be hinted at particularly the stating and examining into the real power and capacity of the french king to impose upon europe after this peace the validity of the renunciations of the spanish king and the probability which there is or is not before us that these treaties shall be kept sacred by the french as they are like to be by us in brief the great question of the validity of a treaty as such with the french may be examined as it respects not his honor and faith only which some people in matters of peace and war have been very free with but as it respects the power and influence the british court may hereafter have in the world to enforce the treaty and to do the nation justice on the agressors in any contraventions that may happen  in doing this an entire impartiallity is necessary neither on the one hand adhering too warmly to those opinions who give up the securities of this treaty as entirely void and insignificant with respect to the faith and honor of the parties we have treated with and run down as ridiculous and absurd the notion of britains holding the balance or being able to enforce the performance in time to come and on the other hand not altogether supposing that there is nothing of danger either in the will or abillity of the french court to make unjust improvements and advantages in breach of the treaty hereafter  in order to come directly to the case it is necessary to give the reader an abstract of what provisions are really made in the treaty with france for the security of the protestant succession in great britain for that many who may perhaps see this tract may not have seen the treaty itself or may not have the articles by them to refer to  i will take no advantage here of what however i do really believe viz that the treaty is very surprising to some people who having been made to believe that there was no care taken in it for the protestant succession did not expect to find two such articles as the fourth and fifth to be incerted in it and that they should be worded in such a manner and therefore before we proceed to animadvert on that opinion or to examine whether that surprise is just or whether the objections others make against the security of those articles are sufficient to continue the general dissatisfactions it will be necessary to place the articles themselves in view as follows iv furthermore for adding a greater strength to the peace which is restored and to the faithful friendship which is never to be violated and for cutting off all occasions of distrust which might at any time arise from the established right and order of the hereditary succession to the crown of great britain and the limitation thereof by the laws of great britain made and enacted in the reigns of the late king william the third of glorious memory and of the present queen to the issue of the abovesaid queen and in default thereof to the most serene princess sophia dowager of brunswickhanover and her heirs in the protestant line of hanover that therefore the said succession may remain safe and secure the most christian king sincerely and solemnly acknowledges the abovesaid limitation of the succession to the kingdom of great britain and on the faith and word of a king on the pledge of his own and his successors honor he does declare and engage that he accepts and approves the same and that his heirs and successors do and shall accept and approve the same for ever and under the same obligation of the word and honor of a king the most christian king promises that no one besides the queen her self and her successors according to the series of the said limitation shall ever by him or by his heirs or successors be acknowledged or reputed to be king or queen of great britain and for adding more ample credit to the said acknowledgment and promises the most christian king does engage that whereas the person who in the lifetime of the late king james the second did take upon him the title of prince of wales and since his decease that of king of great britain is lately gone of his own accord out of the kingdom of france to reside in some other place he the aforesaid most christian king his heirs and successors will take all possible care that he shall not at any time hereafter or under any pretense whatsoever return into the kingdom of france or any the dominions thereof  v moreover the most christian king promises as well in his own name as in that of his heirs and successors that they will at no time whatever disturb or give any molestation to the queen of great britain her heirs and successors descended from the aforesaid protestant line who possess the crown of great britain and the dominions belonging thereunto neither will the aforesaid most christian king or any one of his heirs give at any time any aid succor favor or council directly or indirectly by land or by sea in money arms ammunition warlike provision ships soldiers seamen or any other way to any person or persons whosoever they be who for any cause or under any pretext whatsoever should hereafter endeavor to oppose the said succession either by open war or by fomenting seditions and forming conspiracies against such prince or princes who are in possession of the throne of great britain by virtue of the acts of parliament aforementioned or against that prince or princess to whom the succession to the crown of great britain shall be open according to the said acts of parliament    immediately after these two articles follows the formal renunciations of the king of spain which as they are not within the compass of our present considerations so it will be needless to repeat them here neither will the narrow compass of this tract admit of it but it may not nevertheless be amiss to set down a few words of the introduction to those renunciations as they seem to lay down the foundation upon which the whole treaty stands and upon which much of the present peace and security of europe depends the words are these vi whereas the most destructive flame of war which is to be extinguished by this peace arose chiefly from thence that the security and liberties of europe could by no means bear the union of the kingdoms of france and spain under one and the same king and whereas it has at length been brought to pass by the assistance of the divine power upon the most earnest instances of her sacred royal majesty of great britain and with the consent both of the most christian and of the catholic king that this evil should in all times to come be obviated by means of renunciations drawn in the most effectual form and executed in the most solemn manner  but to begin with the protestant succession as the main thing upon which our eyes are fixed in this treaty and without which the whole is of very little consequence to us and here it is necessary to lay down a short view of the reasons and foundation of the war which without doubt are to be also some part of the reason and foundation of the peace or else the war will be no more to be justified than the peace or the peace to be thought adequate to the necessity of the war the reasons and foundation of the war are abundantly expressed in the several declarations made as well by the queen and the late king william as by the several princes and states their confederates in which if the safety of the protestant interest is laid down as the thing most at heart among the confederates the same ought to be also the main design or at least most regarded in the making a peace for no peace can be supposed to be effectual but such as answers the ends of the war such as are squared to the purposes which in the said declarations of the war are laid down to be the just reason for the breach at the beginning  in the declaration of war against france published in england by king william and queen mary may the  th      among diverse other reasons for the same it is expressed in these words and lastly as the said king of france has for diverse years past endeavored by insinuations and promises of assistance to overthrow the government of england and in the preamble to the said declaration it is thus expressed to the utmost to promote the welfare of our people by preventing the miseries which threaten them from abroad  in the second declaration of war against france entered into by her present majesty and published may the  th   0  the reasons and causes of the war are thus enumerated   the exorbitant power of france which must be reduced   the alliances which great britain stands engaged in particularly the grand alliance and that those allies ought to have reasonable satisfaction   and especially the following particulars the french king has not only proceeded to farther violence but has added thereunto a great affront and indignity to us and our kingdoms in taking upon him to declare the pretended prince of wales king of england scotland and ireland and has also influenced spain to concur in the same affront and indignity as well as in other oppressions wherafore we find our selves obliged for maintaining the public faith for vindication of the honor of our crown and to prevent the mischiefs which all europe is threatened with to declare war etc vide the declaration   these being the proposed reasons and the just occasions of the present war there seems several arguments to occur here which i shall mention previous to the ensuing discourse   if the french kings owning and receiving the prince of wales as king of england etc was a just ground of the war the revoking that acknowledgment disowning him as such recognizing her majestys rightful and lawful title to the crown and securing as much as could be required of him that title and her majestys quiet possession thereof ought to be a capital consideration of the peace otherwise the end for which the war was begun was not sufficiently answered the repose of europe not atall obtained by the treaty the queens honor sufficiently repaired or the affront given made amends for   if the french kings bare owning and receiving the pretender as king of great britain was made a sufficient foundation of the war though he had then made no effort for his establishment or had any way attempted to place him on the throne then the said french king retracting the said owning and recieving etc and promising as by the treaty of peace article the  th he does on the faith and word of a king etc never to receive him again or any way to aid or assist him etc in disturbing her majesty or her successors in the line of hanover is as much security as could be asked of the french king and may be taken in full satisfaction of that particular till france makes some visible infraction of that engagement   for the first of these that the king of france revoking etc the acknowledgment he had made of the pretender and recognizing etc the queen and the succession ought to be a capital consideration of the peace there seems to be no occasion to enter into any debate about it especially since the king of france has yielded to the justice of it in expressions so full and to the utmost extent of all that could be desired as appears by the fourth article but it is chiefly mentioned here as matter of wonder that any among us should object against the measures taken at the beginning and indeed through the progress of this treaty as if the most solemn recognitions of her majestys title to the crown and of the established succession in the protestant line of hanover could be forgotten  and first the objection as it was formerly made against the six proposals of france called however mistakenly preliminaries viz that the french king did not sufficiently acknowledge the queens rightful and lawful title to the crown this i think ought to be answered in the same manner that the germans at this time reply to the proposals of peace made by france to the emperor where the french king offers it as an article that he will acknowledge the emperor as such i say it ought to be answered in the same manner viz with contempt signifying that the imperial crown having not the least dependence upon the vote suffrage or acknowledgment of the king of france they can by no means make his acknowledging or not acknowledging the election of the person of his imperial majesty to that crown to be an article of a treaty or accept of such his acknowledgment as any condition of peace but that his bare treating of peace with his imperial majesty as it is necessarily attended with such acknowledgment so his imperial majesty cannot be treated with under any other title figure or denomination for example that it would be absurd to treat with an archduke of austria in the affairs and properties of the imperial crown or with the empire in the matter of the rights and succession of the house of austria  thus in the case of her majestys rightful possession of the regal titles and sovereign authority of great britain there was no need to capitulate with the french king to acknowledge her majesty in the usual forms for that the crowns of great britain and ireland and the succession of her majesty having no manner of dependence upon the french king or the french government or upon any vote suffrage or recognition on the part of france to be made it would derogate from the honor of the british nation from the personal right of her majesty and the authority of parliament to accept of any such recognition of the queens title from the king of france as any condition article or preliminary to an article in any treaty whatsoever but that in the very act of treating such recognition is so effectually supplied and contained that nothing can be more complete since the french king cannot commence any treaty but in the name of her majesty and with her majesty in person as represented by her plenipotentiaries clothed with all the royal style and dignity titles and appellations which attend the persons of the kings and queens of great britain which names style titles appellations and dignities are of mere course and by the usage and custom of all treaties always expressed in the very first powers produced by the ministers and ambassadors of each prince or sovereign so treating and accepted by the other and after that are again necessarily repeated in the very title and introduction to such treaty or agreement which shall afterward be made and as is for example in the several treaties as well of peace as of commerce now under consideration in these words in latin and in english tractatus pacis and amicitiae inter serenissimam ac potentissimam principem annam dei gratia magnae britanniae franciae and hiberniae reginam in inglish thus a treaty of peace and friendship between the most serene and most potent princess anne by the grace of god queen of great britain france and ireland  mark the king of france here owns her majesty to be queen of great britain etc and that she is so by the grace of god not atall supposing her title depended upon his recognition or received any confirmation thereby  having then acknowledged her majesty to be rightful and lawful queen of great britain the french king could make no scruple of coming into the rest viz to acknowledge the succession of the house of hanover which is a consequence of the revolution upon which as the occasion her present majestys right of possession is built and which is settled upon the basis of parliamentary limitation which parliamentary authority is the rightful and lawful power among others from which her majestys right of claim immediately proceeds  having also acknowledged the protestant succession recognized the authority that established it and owned the protestant race of hanover to be the only rightful and lawful heir to the british crown the rest fell in as natural consequences viz first that he should expunge disown and banish from his dominions the person of the pretender engaging never to admit him to come again into his kingdoms and secondly that he should in the solemnest manner possible engage never to aid or assist him or any one for him directly or indirectly in making any claim to the crown of great britain or in offering any disturbance either to her majestys possession or to the hanover succession as it is established by the british parliament  let us then enquire how this is done and in what manner expressed that the great question may afterward come to be clearly discussed viz what security this is to the protestant succession  the words of the article are as strongly expressed and as full as can be devised and i hear many people express themselves with an agreeable surprise that it is so for though all that is alleged of the perfidy and disingenuous principles of the french king were to be acknowledged yet since verbal assurances are sometimes to be taken and perhaps no other can be obtained in some things of which this is one it is as satisfactory as the nature of the thing will allow that those verbal assurances be full and complete  the nature of treaties is now such and the conduct of princes abroad is allowed such a latitude that in some respect it may be said of all treaties nothing is to be depended on but what either you have power to enforce or the other gives sufficient security to perform  thus where security could be obtained in this affair of the treaty her majesty made a demand of such security that she might be in a condition to enforce the execution as for example the french king offers on a peace to demolish dunkirk how shall i be sure of that says her majesty will you put it into my hands immediately that i may have power to see that promise put in execution the french king consents so that now the queen of great britain demolishes dunkirk not the french king that is she holds it in possession till it is done and her forces are to encamp in the neighborhood to see the execution  it is but too well known a truth that there are some people besides the jacobites who are surpised and illpleased to see this affair so remarkably settled by the treaty and that the french king has thereby stooped to such declarations and protestations against the interest of the pretender and these are those who for other ends had much rather have been furnished from the articles themselves with sufficient grounds of complaint that the protestant succession had been neglected and the interest of the pretender had not been sufficiently weakened and discouraged such a complaint being in its nature very essential to the public good and to the establishment of things in this nation would have been very popular and would have been capable of many ways of improvement to the advantage of those who study to keep the people uneasy and distempered about the public management of affairs and to whom nothing has contributed so much as the notion of the danger of the pretender  the complaints of these people have been so loud that no one could have thought but that they really knew what france was acting in this affair and that even in the articles themselves there had appeared more foundation for their dissatisfactions it was no more questioned by those who supposed all those complaints were well grounded i say it was no more questioned but that when the articles came to be made public it would appear that the succession of hanover was very slightly taken notice of and that room was left for the interest of the pretender to be carried on so that the french king might at any time after the queen was deceased concern himself in that matter without any damage to his honor and faith and any branch of his treaty with the queen to the contrary in anywise notwithstanding  but i do not find upon a serious revising the articles but that these people the first movers of those complaints only excepted are under very great disappointments upon the articles first appearing in public nay the most angry have not yet been able to find the least fault in the recognitions and provisions made either on the part of the french or on our part for the security of the house of hanover or to say what they could have demanded of the french king more than is granted by the treaty with respect to that particular the truth of the case being this that the french king was not able to do more or was it honorable for the british plenipotentiaries to ask more of him in that particular  it might be thought some testimonial to the validity of these articles that the jacobites in great britain are so universally thunderstruck with them that there is so profound a silence through the whole nation among them nothing is heard from them of the usual boasts they have for some time made of their growing interest and of the great assistance their prince should receive upon any occasion for the establishing him on the throne of great britain whereas now nothing is heard among them but very secret and private reproaches and reflections upon the french king for suffering himself to yield to such severe conditions and so effectually to bind himself against the interest of their prince as they call him as never to assist him after the queens death and never to admit him to return into france again  these complaints i say are very secretly and softly expressed among them too for they cannot without manifest ingratitude complain of any one step the french king has taken they cannot deny without the reproaches of the whole world but that the french king has gone a greater length for the propagation of the jacobite interest in great britain than any prince in the world could have done and has done more for them than all the popish powers in the world would have done the hazard of a ruinous war undertaken for the restoring king james ii and carried with no other view through innumerable disasters to the peace of ryswick the undertaking this second war under that disadvantageous step to france of acknowledging the present pretender as king of great britain which justly enflamed and provoked this nation to such a degree as to make all the parts of the island address the late king william to renew the war which otherwise the nation at that time were not much inclined to these things attempted by the king of france for the jacobite interest leave the friends of the pretender no room to exclaim against him as otherwise they would have done as a man abandoning his friend  on the contrary to reckon the diverse attempts hazards losses and expense the french king has been at in behalf of the pretender and of king james ii would be to write the greatest panegyric upon the friendship constancy and generosity of the king of france that could possibly be written in which the armies sent into ireland to his relief the loss of his fleet at la hogue the attempt upon scotland the constant expense of supporting the court of st germans and all its hangers on and dependencies for above twenty four years must come to be reckoned up all which being considered it is but in silent murmurs that the jacobites can complain of the french king for giving up the cause of the pretender as he has done  on the other hand his own circumstances tell them plainly that he has espoused their cause as long as he was able to support himself and that his affairs were reduced to that extremity that he could no longer carry on the war with safety nor could he make any peace without relinquishing entirely a prince and an interest which he was not able to support  these things stop their mouths i say as to complaint and therefore they testify their surprise and despair by a profound silence which silence also tacitly acknowledges that they look upon the acknowledgments and recognitions made by the french king of the hanover succession to be too effectual a blow to their interest in britain which on the other hand is an argument to us to look upon it as some security to the said succession  with the silence of the jacobites party and as a consequence thereof the fears and apprehensions of honest and wellminded people abate also i mean of such people who being guided by no partyinterest kept their eyes only upon the public good yet were made uneasy and alarmed by the continued suggestions of others that the ministry and even the queen herself were in the interest of the pretender it might take up some room here to convince you that such people were made uneasy and by what method on what account by whom and for what reason but i am willing to forget those things the remembrance whereof serve only to promote that which will help to divide us and to make us yet uneasy to one another  that many good people were alarmed with the notion of the pretender being at hand and possessed with a belief that the ministry and the french king were in concert for the restoring him in these kingdoms this is what needs no evidence the very insolence of the jacobites as it was given for a reason of their apprehensions so it was a confirmation of the arguments others had used for the raising those jealousies and apprehensions in the people  they were told that the ministry encouraged and employed none but jacobites that the professed friends of the pretender had distinguishing marks of favor showed them that even the dialect spoken at court was different from what used to be the language in the case of the succession that addresses were presented in which not only the house of hanover was not mentioned but in which the interest of the pretender was expresslly recommended and that yet such addresses were equally accepted and received equally graciously with others that the greatest insolences of several persons upon the name of hanover and the protestant succession were left unpunished and the like  the business of the hanover memorial was in the next place mentioned and the resentments expressed by the queen and ministry at the publication thereof with several other things which were called to mind to confirm the suspicions and to persuade the people here that the same affection which promoted the settlement of the crown upon that house was not now to be found among us etc  while the treaty of peace was in agitation these suspicions increased and it was expected by some that the interest of the pretender was in immediate agitation that the french influence having a governing power among us would not fail to attempt that by treaty which they had so often and so long attempted in the field by the sword  it was a happy surprise then to such people as these to find the aforesaid articles incerted in the treaty of peace where the most they could expect in favor of the succession was that nothing expressly on the other side should be incerted and that the french king should be prevailed with to leave the pretender to his own fortunes and to say nothing of him nay some people would have thought this a great deal and would even have compounded with us for such a thing as a favor to the succession of hanover which they had scarce reason to expect  what then could such people say when they found the utmost care taken and the strongest engagements entered into with the french king for the protestant succession and the recognizing upon all occasions the house of hanover as the rightful and lawful successor to the crown  what could they say but acknowledge themselves surpised satisfied and pleased as also that they had been imposed upon before when they found the french king brought to compliment the queen of great britain with the solemn and declared expulsion of the person of the pretender from not the succession of britain only but even from the dominions of france and engaging to make that expulsion perpetual and that he shall never be admitted to set his foot within the kingdom of france again  would any man have thought that the king of france who had formerly acted so avowedly in the interest of the pretender and had voluntarily brought down upon his kingdom so heavy a war by the mere declaring him by the titles of britain who had made such efforts for him and had promised never to forsake his interest till he had established him on the throne would be brought so entirely to give him up so effectually to relinquish his interest and concerns as to engage never to own him again by those titles which he himself had before acknowledged to him  these things having been so openly declared against before by the french king it was the more rational to expect that the party here might have been prevailed upon and influenced by the french to have countenanced that interest or at least to have contented themselves with very moderate provisions against him and till the contrary appeared there was too much force in their reasoning the other way not to take with the people whose minds were already prejudiced as abovesaid  but when the articles appear these people seemed surpised began to exclaim at the injustice done the present ministry and to approve of what was done in behalf of the hanover succession till they met with new scruples and suggestions in order to keep up the temper of complaint and to bring the notions of the danger of the pretender into play again and these were the ill opinions which common fame had deeply imprinted in the minds of the people of the french king being to the last degree perfidious that he made no scruple of breaking in upon the most sacred engagement when ever his ambition avarice superstition of especially thirst of glory prompted that he made no farther use of treaties and postulations articles and solemn conventions than to amuse and separate the conjunction and confederacies of his enemies and made it his constant avowed practice or maxim to keep the most sacred engagements of treaties no longer than till he had the opportunity to break them to his advantage and much more to this purpose  from these things they ask us now what signify all the treaties and engagements which the french king has made in the affair of the protestant succession and what dependence can we or ought we to have upon them  now it is a mistake if any reader expects to find this tract attempting to take off any of the above reproaches cast upon the honor and character of the french king his regard to his word or holding sacred the engagements he has entered into  not at all this shall be no part of my task let it go let it be taken all for granted if they please or not taken for granted as you shall please but the two questions to be asked here and which contains the whole of the case are these   what more could be done by the french king to secure us against him or give us satisfaction in his future conduct with relation to the pretender   how with safety to the honor and reputation of our arms could we aledge that our safety against the pretender was not sufficiently secured by this   what more could be done by the french king to secure us against him or give us satisfaction in his future conduct with relation to the pretender   this question has been asked before now and so many abrupt and absurd answers have been given to it that even the persons who have given those answers desire not to have the question repeated and are willing to hear as little of it as they can some have answered the french king should have delivered him up to us but this is liable to many exceptions and to speak in general only the best friends of the house of hanover have declared they did not desire to have that method taken as a dangerous experiment for many reasons some of them fitter to be guessed at than expressed some have suggested that the french king should have caused him to be made away privately rather than to have suffered himself to be brought to so dishonorable a submission as to forsake and abandon a person who had from his infancy been sheltered under his protection but this was too barbarous and unhospitable for even the worst enemies of the pretender if they were christians to approve of and no one could maintain it without horror even at the same time that they were for entirely expelling him from hence others suggested that we should have procured him to be confined in the pierre encise in france where prisoners for life are generally sent near lions and that he should be suffered there to end his days quietly but this was liable to the same objections of the french kings breaking his word that the present articles are liable too since he might cause the gates to be opened when ever he thought fit and might let him out from thence with the same ease that he may now recall him into his dominions  what then can we propose that the king of france could have done in respect to the disposing the person of the pretender more than first having caused him or desired him  call it as you please voluntarily to withdraw out of his dominions to engage in the solemnest manner not to admit him to return thither any more and no more to own him for ever hereafter under the titles of king of england scotland and ireland king of great britain or in short any of her majestys titles and royal style as he did before  it is true the french king may break his word may renounce the faith and honor of a king pledged to her majesty and the faith and honor of the very throne of france which he has engaged as far as in him lies in the name of all his successors and there is no helping this but i do not see what farther could be done what more could have been asked of the king of france or what more he could have granted to have made us more safe  pledges of towns possession of frontiers and cautionary garrisons could be of no signification here neither did ever any one of the other opinion say what town or city they would accept as a sufficient caution or pledge for the security of his performance nor indeed could any thing the french king possesses have given us the least security in such a case on the contrary had any of the possessions of the kingdom of france been made over in a way of security or as a preliminary for the performance of this negative and to assure us that he never would assist or entertain this pretender again this would even itself have been a most forcible motive to the french king to have broke that very engagement and to have made the attempt that having set him up here and obtained the possession of the english or british crown for him he the pretender should clear him the french king of those engagements and restore to him those pledges  nor in such a case would there have lain so much of the charge of a breach of honor or a charge of perfidiousness since he that takes security is supposed not to depend upon the promise or engagement but relinquishing the honor of the person takes the equivalent viz the pledge for his satisfaction  what then any ambassador or plenipotentiaries could have asked more than the present treaty has taken or indeed what could have been proposed farther to the french king to have done for our security and satisfaction in this case remains for any to set down that knows for i do not pretend to it    how with safety to the honor and reputation of our arms could we aledge that our safety against the pretender was not sufficiently secured by this the safety of britain must be esteemed by us to be very weakly defended and our establishment to be in a very precarious condition if we may suppose it to depend so entirely upon the french kings performance of his engagements as that without it we are given up and lost to the pretender those who are thus phlegmatic in the case of the protestant succession very much dishonor their own country and the confidence they have either in the power or unanimity of the people of great britain that they should think we should be so much at the mercy of the french king that when ever he pleases to break his engagements we are to be subdued to the interest of the pretender  it is true the interest of the pretender backed by the power of the french king is not to be despised nor the danger of it to be made light of and therefore every thing that is reasonable and practicable ought to be done to keep that apprehension off and the treaty has made so much provision that whether it be sufficient or no it seems to be all that the nature of the case would admit of and all that was really practicable in the thing to be phlegmatic and dismayed now would suggest to us that our own power is of no weight in this case that we must depend entirely upon the conduct of the french king to preserve the succession and that we are to be happy or miserable just as he is or is not pleased to be faithful to his engagement  this i must acknowledge i think is complimenting the french king too much at our own expense and placing the british strength at so low an ebb as no reason can be given for  britain or the people of britain no doubt were we hearty and unanimous in the interest of the nation are able to keep up the resolutions already taken in the affair of the succession and are able to support our own laws and constitution against the whole world and though it is highly reasonable that on a treaty the french king should engage as he has done to relinquish the pretender and acknowledge the successor yet our safety is very far from depending entirely on the performance of that engagement and we ought to be in very little concern whether the french king will perform his promises or not  the question therefore does not so much rest upon this point whether the french king will perform the treaty he has made or no but whether any thing farther could have been done for our security or no in a treaty whether with the french king or anybody else what the french king could have granted farther or what we could honorably to our selves have demanded farther that we may see if the people that mady the treaty have been faithful or no  i shall readily grant that if our security depends upon the french kings performance of his promises and engagements the protestant succession may be a very precarious thing the faith and honor of the best princes in the world being too weak a basis to build a thing of that consequence upon especially while according to the present practices the faith and honor of treaties are always interpreted by princes their own way when they have any pretensions to make or find it for their convenience to break in upon their word given  and for this reason those people who lay so great a stress upon our treaty with france and place so much weight there as if the whole and only security of our protestant settlement depended upon this treaty not only dishonor our own nation but really weaken the succession itself do such people know or consider that the protestant succession is our fundamental security for the peace prosperity liberty property religion posterity of this nation and all that is or can be dear to us or them now and for ever what a condition should we be all in if these things of so much consequence to us depended for their safety upon the veracity faith and honor of the french king aye or any king upon earth such people have too mean an opinion of our constitution and of our power to maintain it it is no doubt convenient and safe for us to tie up the hands of those who are enemies to the succession as far as possible and it seems to be as much done that way as it was possible could be done in the treaty but when all that is over we hope the security of our establishment has better foundations than any that could be furnished from foreign contracts or provided in a treaty with france  as far as treaty could provide as far as could either be offered by the french king or proposed by us in a treaty seems to be obtained and settled by this treaty and it is yet unknown what those people who complain of the insufficiency of this treaty do propose either as what might have been done or as what would have been sufficient if it had been done in the treaty i mean as it relates to the protestant succession  if then nothing can be thought of farther for the security of the protestant succession which either was in the power of the french king to grant or which we ought to have accepted from him or proposed to him then the present treaty is as sufficient a security to the succession as it was possible to make it be or as a treaty could admit  the same thing might be said in the case of the spanish renunciations which lay it down as a foundation that france and spain ought to be joined together in the same person since then the possessor king philip was not driven out and that yet it appeared necessary to make a treaty of peace on all sides nothing more effectual could be devised or proposed than those renunciations and however invalid renunciations have been in like cases through the accidents that may have happened yet upon a due examination it will appear that such formal proceedings are not esteemed so very insufficient as we now make them or so appointed to be broken as that they cannot be kept and in the prosecution of this argument there shall be shown in due time   that the present renunciations are of a different kind from all that ever were proposed in an affair of the like nature as far as history can instruct us in the case   that there is something in the nature of the thing that makes these valid and that though all the former contracts of the like nature in the world have or had proved ineffectual yet that these cannot do so   that king william accepted of renunciations in cases of like nature as the only method to bind princes in cases where other obligations could not be taken or given   but these things are reserved to a treatise of the renunciations which may be published by
