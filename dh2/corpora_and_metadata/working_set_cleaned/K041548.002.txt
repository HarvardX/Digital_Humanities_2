italy as he himself informs us on the close of the civil war he has addressed a little treatise containing a critique on the elder historians to his friend cnaeus pompeius whom the french critics suppose to be pompey the great but reiske the last editor of dionysius has sunk him into a petty greek grammarian the client or freedman of that illustrious roman  in this treatise of dionysius and in one still longer on the character of thucydides there are some excellent historical precepts which mr spelman has judiciously thrown together in the preface to his admirable translation of the roman antiquities  he introduces them by the following observation which may serve perhaps to recommend the subject of the present poem  so much has been said both by the ancients and the moderns in praise of the advantages resulting from the study of history particularly by diodorus siculus among the former in the noble preface to his historical collections and by the late lord bolingbroke among the moderns in his admirable letter on that subject that i am astonished no treatise has ever yet appeared in any age or any language professedly written to prescribe rules for writing history a work allowed to be of the greatest advantage of all others to mankind the repository of truth fraught with lessons both of public and private virtue and enforced by stronger motives than precepts  by examples rules for poetry and rhetoric have been written by many authors both ancient and modern as if delight and eloquence were of greater consequence than instruction however rhetoric was a part of history as treated by the ancients not the principal part indeed but subservient to the principal and calculated to apply the facts exhibited by the narration i know it may be said that many ancient histories are still preserved and that these models are sufficient guides for modern historians without particular rules so had the greeks poets of all denominations in their hands and yet aristotle thought it necessary to prescribe particular rules to his countrymen for applying those examples to every branch of poetry i wish he had done the same in history if he had it is very probable that his precepts would have rendered the best of our modern histories more perfect and the worst less abominable  since the resurrection of letters the want of such a guide has been complained of by many authors and particularly by rapin in the preface to his history of england  spelman page     but this ingenious and learned writer speaks a little too strongly in saying no treatise has ever appeared in any age or language containing rules for history there is one in latin by the celebrated vossius entitled ars historica another by hubertus folieta an elegant latin writer of the   th century on whom thuanus bestows the highest commendation and mascardi an italian critic patronised by cardinal mazarine has written also dell art historica the curious reader may find a singular anecdote relating to the publication of this work in bail under the article mascardi  but to return to dionysius in comparing herodotus and thucydides he censures the latter with a degree of severity unwarranted by truth and reason indeed this severity appeared so striking to the learned fabricius that he seems to consider it as a kind of proof that the critical works of dionysius were composed in the hasty fervor of youth they are however in general to use the words of the same ingenious author eximia and lectu digna and a valuable critic of our own country who resembles dionysius in elegance

is related at large in the first book of diodorus siculus and as the passage is curious the following free translation of it may afford entertainment to the english reader  those who prepare to bury a relation give notice of the day intended for the ceremony to the judges and to all the friends of the deceased informing them that the body will pass over the lake of that district to which the dead belonged when on the judges being assembled to the number of more than forty and ranging themselves in a semicircle on the farther side of the lake the vessel is set afloat which those who superintend the funeral have prepared for this purpose this vessel is managed by a pilot called in the egyptian language charon and hence they say that orpheus traveling in old times into egypt and seeing this ceremony formed his fable of the infernal regions partly from what he saw and partly from invention the vessel being launched on the lake before the coffin which contains the body is put on board the law permits all who are so inclined to produce an accusation against it  if any one steps forth and proves that the deceased has led an evil life the judges pronounce sentence and the body is precluded from burial but if the accuser is convicted of injustice in his charge he falls himself under a considerable penalty when no accuser appears or when the accuser is proved to be an unfair one the relations who are assembled change their expressions of sorrow into encomiums on the dead yet they do not like the greeks speak in honor of his family because they consider all egyptians as equally wellborn but they set forth the education and manners of his youth his piety and justice in maturer life his moderation and every virtue by which he was distinguished and they supplicate the infernal deities to receive him as an associate among the blessed the multitude join their acclamations of applause in this celebration of the dead whom they consider as going to pass an eternity among the just below diodor siculi lib i  etc   such is the description which diodorus gives of this funereal judicature to which even the kings of egypt were subject the same author asserts that many sovereigns had been thus judicially deprived of the honors of burial by the indignation of their people and that the terrors of such a fate had a most salutary influence on the virtue of their kings

all nations unite in confirming it the oldest compositions among the arabs are in rythm or rude verse and are often cited as proofs of the truth of their subsequent history the accounts we have of the peruvian story confirm the same fact for garcilasso tells us that he compiled a part of his commentaries from the ancient songs of the country  nay all the american tribes who have any compositions

have adopted from the very learned mr bryant part of whose ingenious observation upon them i shall here present to the reader   one great purpose in all eminent and expensive structures is to please the stranger and traveller and to win their admiration this is effected sometimes by a mixture of magnificence and beauty at other times solely by immensity and grandeur the latter seems to have been the object in the erecting of those celebrated buildings in egypt and they certainly have answered the design for not only the vastness of their structure and the area which they occupy but the ages they have endured and the very uncertainty of their history which runs so far back into the depths of antiquity produce all together a wonderful veneration to which buildings more exquisite and embellished are seldom entitled many have supposed that they were designed for places of sepulture and it has been affirmed by herodotus and other ancient writers but they spoke by guess and i have shown by many instances how usual it was for the grecians to mistake temples for tombs if the chief pyramid were designed for a place of burial what occasion was there for a well and for passages of communication which led to other buildings near the pyramids are apartments of a wonderful fabric which extend in length one thousand four hundred feet and about thirty in depth they have been cut out of the hard rock and brought to a perpendicular by the artists chizel and through dint of labor fashioned as they now appear they were undoubtedly designed for the reception of priests and consequently were not appendages to a tomb but to a temple of the deity the priests of egypt delighted in obscurity and they probably came by the subterraneous passages of the building to the dark chambers within where they performed their lustrations and other nocturnal rites many of the ancient temples in this country were caverns in the rock enlarged by art and cut out into numberless dreary apartments for no nation upon earth was so addicted to gloom and melancholy as the egyptians  bryants analysis vol iii page      the royal geographer abulfeda seems to confirm the idea of this

observing that our language has been greatly enriched in the course of the present century by such translations of these authors as do great honor to our country and are at least equal to any which other nations have produced  in the chief roman historians we seem to have been less fortunate but from the specimen which mr aikin has lately given the public in the smaller pieces of tacitus we may hope to see an excellent version of that valuable author who has been hitherto ill treated in our language and among all the ancients there is none perhaps whom it is more difficult to translate with

celebrated by the name of the horti sallustiani  he died in the  0th year of his age four years before the battle of actium and    before the christian era his enmity to cicero is well known and perhaps it had some influence on the peculiarity of his diction  personal animosity might make him endeavor to form a style as remote as possible from the redundant language of the immortal orator whose turbulent wife terentia he is said to have married after her divorce this extraordinary woman is reported to have lived to the age of  0  to have married messala her third husband and vibius rufus her fourth  the latter boasted with the joy of an antiquarian that he possessed two of the greatest curiosities in the world namely terentia who had been ciceros wife and the chair in which

his life i shall present to the reader in the words of plinys most elegant translator  do you remember to have read of a certain inhabitant of the city of cadiz who was so struck with the illustrious character of livy that he traveled to rome on purpose to see that great genius and as soon as he had satisfied his curiosity returned home again  melmoths pliny vol i page     a veneration still more

latinis this singular anecdote is also related in bail under the article panormita  learning perhaps never sustained a greater loss in any single author than by the destruction of the latter and more

is unknown but he is said to have lived happily to an advanced age with his wife the amiable daughter of the virtuous agricola whose life he has so beautifully written by this lady he is supposed to have left children and the emperor tacitus is conjectured to have been a remote descendant from the historian to whose works and memory he paid the highest regard  it is reported by sidonius apollinaris that tacitus recommended the province of writing history to pliny the younger and that he did not himself engage in that employment till his friend had declined it this is not mentioned indeed in any of the beautiful letters still remaining from pliny to tacitus but it is an instance of delicacy not unparalled among the ancients as will appear from the following remark by one of the most elegant and liberal of modern critics  the roman poet who was not more eminent by his genius than amiable in his moral character affords perhaps the most remarkable instance that any where occurs of the concessions which a mind strongly impregnated with sentiments of genuine amity is capable of making virgils superior talents rendered him qualified to excel in all the nobler species of poetical composition nevertheless from the most uncommon delicacy of friendship he sacrificed to his intimacy with horace the unrivaled reputation he might have acquired by indulging his lyric vein as from the same refined motive he forbore to exercise his dramatic powers that he might not obscure the glory of his friend varius aurum et opes et rura frequens donabit amicus qui velit ingenio cedere rarus erit mart viii    melmoths remarks on laelius page      as to tacitus it is clear i think from the letters of pliny as well as from his own most pleasing life of agricola that he possessed all the refined and affectionate feelings of the heart in a very high degree though the general cast of his historical works might lead us to imagine that austerity was his chief characteristic  it would be easy to fill a volume in transcribing the great encomiums and the violent censures which have been lavished by modern writers of almost every country on this profound historian  the last critic of eminence who has written against him in britain is i believe the learned author of the origin and progress of language who in his  d volume of that work has made many curious remarks on the composition of the ancient historians and is particularly severe on the diction of tacitus he represents him as the defective model from which modern writers have copied what he is pleased to call

adrian  in the  th year of whose reign he is supposed to have died at the age of  0 he was married to a most amiable woman of his own native town chaeronea whose name was timoxena and to whose sense and virtue he has borne the most affectionate testimony in his moral works of which it may be regretted that we have no elegant translation indeed even the lives of plutarch the most popular of all

death are unknown  bail has an article on marcellinus in which he observes that he has introduced a most bitter invective against the practitioners of law into his history  he should have added that

this passage lib xxx cap    note xxii verse  0  and with comnenas royal name impressed anna comnena was the eldest daughter of the emperor alexius comnenus and the empress irene born  0    she wrote the history of her father in    books first published very imperfectly by haeschelius in    0 and since printed in the collection of the byzantine historians with a diffuse and incorrect latin version by the jesuit possinus but with excellent notes by the learned du fresne  considering the miseries of the time in which she lived and the merits of her work  which some critics have declared superior to every other in that voluminous collection  this lady may be justly regarded as a singular phenomenon in the literary world and as this mention of her may possibly excite the curiosity of my fair readers i shall close the notes to this epistle with presenting to them a translation of the preface to her history as i believe no part of her works have yet appeared in any modern language i found that i could not abridge it without injuring its beauty and though long i flatter myself it will escape the censure of being tedious as she feelingly displays in it the misfortunes of her life and the character of her mind  the preface of the princess anna comnena from the greek prefixed to her alexiad or history of her father the emperor alexius time which flows irresistibly ever encroaching and stealing something from human life seems to bear away all that is mortal into a gulf of darkness sometimes destroying such things as deserve not utterly to be forgotten and sometimes such as are most noble and most worthy of remembrance now to use the words of the tragic poet sophocles  discovering things invisible and now sweeping each present object from our sight but history forms the strongest barrier against this tide of time it withstands in some measure the violence of the torrent and by collecting and cementing such things as appear worthy of preservation while they are hurried along the stream it allows them not to sink into the abyss of oblivion  on this consideration i anna the daughter of the emperor alexius and his consort irene born and educated in imperial splendour  not utterly void of literature and solicitous to distinguish myself by that grecian characteristic  as i have already applied myself to rhetoric and having thoroughly studied the principles of aristotle and the dialogues of plato have endeavored to adorn my mind with the astrology geometry arithmetic and music four usual branches of education for i think it incumbent on me even at the risque of appearing vain to declare what qualifications for the present task i have received from nature or gained by application what providence has bestowed upon me or time and opportunity supplied on these accounts i am desirous of commemorating in my present work the actions of my father as they deserve not to be buried in silence or to be plunged as it were by the tide of time into the ocean of oblivion both those actions which he performed after he obtained the diadem and those before that period while he was himself a subject of other princes i engage in this narration not so much to display any little talent for composition as to prevent transactions of such importance from perishing unrecorded since even the brightest of human achievements if not consigned to memory under the guard of writing are extinguished as it were by the darkness of silence  my father was a man who knew both how to govern and to pay to governors a becoming obedience but in choosing his actions for my subject i am apprehensive in the very outset of my work lest i may be censured as the panegyrist of my own family for writing of my father that if i speak of him with admiration my whole history will be considered as a false and flattering encomium and if any circumstance i may have occasion to mention leads me as it were by force to disapprove some part even of his conduct i am apprehensive on the other hand not from the character of my father but from the very nature of things that some malignant censurers may compare me to cham the son of noah since there are many whom envy and malevolence will not suffer to form a fair judgment and who to speak in the words of homer are keen to censure where no blame is due for whoever engages in the province of history is bound to forget all sentiments both of favor and aversion and often to adorn his enemies with the highest commendations when their actions are entitled to such reward and often to censure his most intimate friends when the failings of their life and manners require it  these are duties equally incumbent on the historian which he cannot decline as to myself with regard to those who may be affected either by my censure or my praise i would wish to assure them that i speak both of them and their conduct according to the evidence of their actions themselves or the report of those who beheld them for either the fathers or the grandfathers of many persons now living were ocular witnesses of what i shall record i have been chiefly led to engage in this history of my father by the following circumstance  it was my fortune to marry caesar nicephorus of the bryennian family a man far superior to all his cotemporaries not only in personal beauty but in sublimity of understanding and all the charms of eloquence for he was equally the admiration of those who saw and those who heard him but that my discourse may not wander from its present purpose let me proceed in my narration  he was then among all men the most distinguished and when he marched with the emperor john comnenus my brother on his expedition against antioch and other places in possession of the barbarians still unable to abstain from literary pursuits even in those scenes of labor and fatigue he wrote various compositions worthy of remembrance and of honor but he chiefly applied himself to the writing an account of what related to my father alexius emperor of the romans at the request of the empress reducing into proper form the transactions of his reign whenever the times would allow him to devote short intervals of leisure from arms and battle to works of literature and the labor of composition in forming this history he deduced his accounts from an early period being directed in this point also by the instruction of our royal mistress beginning from the emperor diogenes and descending to the person whom he had chosen for the hero of his drama  for this season first showed my father to be a youth of expectation before this period he was a mere infant and of course performed nothing worthy of being recorded unless even the occurrences of his childhood should be thought a fit subject for history such then was the design and scope of caesars composition but he failed in the hope he had entertained of bringing his history to its conclusion for having brought it to the times of the emperor nicephorus botoniates he there broke off having no future opportunity allowed him of continuing his narration a circumstance which has proved a severe loss to literature and robbed his readers of delight  on this account i have undertaken to record the actions of my father that such achievements may not escape posterity what degree of harmony and grace the writings of caesar possessed all persons know who have been fortunate enough to see his compositions but having executed his work to the period i have mentioned in the midst of hurry and fatigue and bringing it to us half finished from his expedition he brought home alas at the same time a disorder that proved mortal contracted perhaps from the hardships of his passage or perhaps from that harrassing scene of perpetual action and possibly indeed from his infinite anxiety on my account for anxiety was natural to his affectionate heart and his labors were without intermission moreover the change and badness of climates might prepare for him this draught of death for notwithstanding the dreadful state of his health he persevered in the campaign against the syrians and cilicians till at length he was conveyed out of syria in a most infirm state and was brought through cilicia pamphilia lydia and bithynia home to the metropolis of the empire and to his family but his vitals were now affected by his infinite fatigue  even in this state of weakness he was desirous of displaying the events of his expedition but this his disorder rendered him unable to execute and indeed we enjoined him not to attempt it lest by the effort of such a narration he should burst open his wound  but in the recollection of these things my whole soul is darkened and my eyes are covered with a flood of tears  o what a director of the roman counsels was then torn from us o what an end was there to all the treasures of clear of various and of useful knowledge which he had collected from observation and experience both in regard to foreign affairs and the internal business of the empire  o what a form was then destroyed  beauty that seemed not only entitled to dominion but bearing even the semblance of divinity  i indeed have been conversant with every calamity and have found even from the imperial cradle an unpropitious fortune some perhaps might esteem that fortune not unpropitious which seemed to smile upon my birth in giving me sovereigns for my parents and nursing me in the imperial purple but for the other circumstances of my life alas what tempests alas what perturbations the melody of orpheus affected even inanimate nature and timotheus in playing the orthic song to alexander made the macedon start to arms  the relation of my miseries would not indeed produce such effects but it would move every auditor to tears it would force not only beings endued with sensibility but even inanimate nature to sympathize in my sorrow  this remembrance of caesar and his unexpected death tears open the deepest wound of my soul indeed i consider all my former misfortunes if compared to this immeasureable calamity but as a drop of water to the atlantic sea or rather my earlier afflictions were a kind of prelude to this they first involved me as it were like a smoke preceding this raging fire they were a kind of heat that portended a conflagration which no words can describe o thou fire that blazest without fuel preying on my heart without destroying its existence piercing through my very bones and shrinking up my soul  but i perceive myself hurried away from my subject this mention of caesar and what i suffer in his loss has led me into the prolixity of grief wiping therefore the tear from my eyes and restraining myself from this indulgence of sorrow i will proceed in order yet as the tragic poet euripides   says still adding tear to tear as recollecting misfortune after misfortune for the entering on the history of such a king so eminent for his virtues revives in my mind all the wonders he performed which move me to fresh tears and these i share in common with all the world for the remembrance of him and the recital of his reign supplies to me a new subject of lamentation and must remind others of the loss they have sustained  but let me at length begin the history of my father from the period most proper  now the most proper period is that which will give to my narration the clearest and most historical appearance     end of the notes to the first epistle notes to the second epistle note i verse    how sainted kings renounce with holy dread the chaste endearments of their marriage bed it

his military reputation  the turbulent state of his country prevented his establishment in his hereditary dominion till the year   0 when the possession of it was secured to him by the assistance of al malec al naser sultan of egypt from whom he afterward received the highest honors of which his gratitude has left the following particular description inserted by the learned schultens in his preface to the life of saladin as it gives great luster to the character of our royal historian  hamata degressum equis veredariis sine ullo jumento instrumentove itineris prolixissima gratia cumulavit sultanus atque munificentiam suam summo gradu erga me explicuit mittendis variis vestibus equis vectabulis eduliis mihique peculiare tabernaculum statuendo quod copiose adornatum erat vest

title of sultan abulfeda returned in all his splendour to his paternal dominion where he closed an honorable life at the age of sixty in     thirteen years after this magnificent ceremony  he is said to have been highly skilled in medicine philosophy and poetry but his fame as an author is chiefly founded on his historical and geographical productions and these notwithstanding their acknowledged merit have appeared only in selected fragments so pitiful and precarious has been the encouragement which the most liberal nations of europe have bestowed on oriental literature that designs of publishing a complete edition of abulfedas geography have been suffered to fail both in france and england the honor of doing justice to this illustrious author seems to be reserved for germany where the learned michaelis has lately published his description of egypt and intimates an intention of printing the other parts of this author of his general history which he brought down to the latter years of his own life different portions have been given to the public by different editors  his account of mahomet by gagnier printed at oxford in folio      his history of the arabian caliphs to the year of the hegira  0  by reiske printed at leipsic       and his narrative of all the circumstances relating to the great saladin has been very properly annexed by schultens to bohaddins life of that monarch abulfeda in this portion of his history seems to dwell on the great character of saladin with that ingenuous pride which a generous mind must naturally feel in speaking of so noble an ancestor he relates some anecdotes of that prince not mentioned by his biographer highly expressive of his animated and affectionate spirit particularly a letter written immediately after the severe defeat which obliged him to fly from ascalon into the deserts of egypt it was addressed to his brother who commanded at damascus and opened with a quotation from an arabian poet to this effect my soul remembers thee with fond delight amidst the horrors of the adverse fight when hostile larces drink the gory flood and satiate in our veins their thirst of blood in his account of the gentle disposition and refined manners of saladin he perfectly agrees with the biographer of that monarch  the generous abulfeda so liberal in commemorating the merit of others has not himself wanted an encomiast for according to herbelot his eulogy is contained in the works of an oriental poet whose name is nobatah and whose compositions may be found in the king of frances library  note ix verse     and with that victims blood his sabre stain who dared to write the annals of his reign i am unable to discover the name of this inhuman prince or that of his unfortunate historian but the fact is related on the authority of an arabic writer named nouari by m cardonne in the preface to his histoire de lafrique et de lespagne sous la domination des arabes his words are  nouari rapporte que les sultans de la dynastie des almohades defendirent sous peine de la vie d ecrire les annals de leur regne et quun prince de cette maison fit perir un auteur pour avoir enfraint cette loi as the princes of this dynasty exerted their power both in africa and spain this singular execution might happen in either country  i have ventured to suppose it in spain for poetical reasons which will occur to the reader  note x verse     there corduba in hours of happier fate sublimely rose in academic state the university of corduba was founded by all hakem the second who died in the    th year of the hegira after a reign of fifteen years and five months he was the son and successor of the magnificent abdelrahman the third who in a long and prosperous life had given stability and splendour to the moorish empire in spain it is remarkable that many of these arab princes were not only protectors of literature but often distinguished themselves by poetical composition nor were the moorish ladies less eager to cultivate the most elegant of mental accomplishments valada or valadata the daughter of the prince who founded the university was no less celebrated for her poetical talents than for her singular beauty and exalted birth she bestowed her protection on that seat of learning which owed its rise to the liberality of her father and the principal poets of the time are said to have formed her favorite society  the bibliotheca arabicohispana of casiri from whence i have drawn these particulars contains also a list of many female poets who reflected honor on their native city of corduba one of the most eminent among these was a lady distinguished by the name of aischa bent whose compositions both in prose and verse were publicly recited in the academy with universal applause and who closed says my author a single and chaste life in the year of the hegira  00 leaving many monuments of her own genius as well as a rich and wellchosen library  note xi verse     thy warm bohaddin with that generous zeal which no base sons of adulation feel bohaddin or bohadin for his name is variously written is conjectured by schultens his learned translator to have been an assyrian by birth and a native of mosula the metropolis of mesopotamia from whence before he entered into the service of saladin he was sent ambassador as he himself relates to the caliph of bagdad  he seems to have been principally indebted to his talents as an historian for the protection and favor of that engaging hero whose confidence he afterward obtained and whose splendid character he has so warmly celebrated for as he was returning from mecca to mosula he embraced an opportunity of presenting to saladin an account of the holy war as he terms it which he had drawn up as he stopped at damascus in the course of his pilgrimage and in which he had described the administration and discipline of that monarch he affirms that the sultan perused his work with infinite satisfaction and expressed the most eager desire to engage him in his service the grateful historian was no less inclined to devote himself to his generous and enthusiastic patron  from this period he seems to have been a favorite companion of his warlike master to have shared many of his dangers as well as his most secret counsels and to have served him with a most zealous and affectionate attachment to the hour of his death  an event of which he speaks with the affecting simplicity of real sorrow in mentioning the oriental custom of washing the body of the deceased he records the name of the minister who performed the ceremony and adds that he had himself engaged in this mournful office but was obliged to retire on feeling himself unequal to so painful a scene  the work of this interesting biographer is divided into two parts the first exhibits a general character of the hero with particular examples of his various virtues and endowments the second gives a chronological account of his adventures from his first expedition into egypt to the close of his life but passing lightly over his other exploits dwells chiefly on the transactions of the holy war and discovers such marks of religious zeal that schultens very shrewdly supposes the author to have been a priest from the manner in which he lavishes his maledictions it is just however to observe that he speaks very liberally on the martial merit of his christian enemies and there is one passage in his history in which he pays a very pleasing and pathetic compliment to the universal philanthropy of the sultan it is in relating an anecdote which affords so interesting a picture that i cannot help presenting it to my reader  in the army of saladin there were some dexterous robbers who used to penetrate by night into the camp of the christians and present to the sultan on their return such booty as they had been able to bring off which he bestowed upon them as a reward of their valor in one of their nightly excursions they happened to seize an infant of three months the mother robbed of her little one spent the night in the most bitter lamentations and related her misfortune to the christian leaders they answered the sultan is compassionate and we therefore give you permission to depart and petition him for your child which he will certainly restore  approaching our guard she relates her story and implores their assistance they give her access to the sultan to whom as he was riding attended by myself and others she presented herself bathed in tears and prostrate in the dust he enquires the cause of her affliction  she repeats her story  the sultan is moved even to tears and orders the child to be produced on finding that it had been publicly sold he commands it to be redeemed and rested not till he saw the infant delivered to its mother receiving it with a profusion of tears she pressed it to her bosom  the surrounding spectators and i happened to be among them wept with her  she then gave her breast to the infant after which the sultan directed her to be seated on horseback with her little one and safely escorted to her own quarters consider exclaims the affectionate and religious historian this example of universal benevolence such o god have thou created this merciful sovereign to appear most worthy of thy own infinite mercy  consider this testimony which even his enemies have borne of his compassionate and generous disposition bohad schultens page      note xii verse     a faithful chronicler in plain froissart john froissart canon and treasurer of the collegiate church of chimay in henault was born at valenciennes a city of that province in      according to the conjecture of that elaborate and ingenious antiquarian mr de st palaye who has amply illustrated the life and writings of this engaging historian in a series of dissertations among the memoirs of the french academy vol x xiii xiv  st palaye imagines from a passage in the ms poems of froissart that his father was a painter of armories  and it is certain the historian discovers a passion for all the pomp and all the minutiae of heraldry it was indeed the favorite study of that martial age and froissart more the priest of gallantry than of religion devoted himself entirely to the celebration of love and war  at the age of  0 he began to write history at the request de son cher seigneur and maitre messire robert de namur chevalier seigneur de beaufort  the anguish of unsuccessful love drove him early into england and his first voyage seems a kind of emblem of his future life for he sailed hither in a storm yet continued writing a rondeau in spite of the tempest till he found himself on that coast ou lon aim mieux la guerre que la paix and ou les estrangers sont tres bien venus as he said of our country in his verses and happily experienced in his kind reception at court where philippa of henault the queen of edward the third and a patroness of learning distinguished the young historian her countryman by the kindest protection and finding that love had rendered him unhappy supplied him with money and with horses that he might present himself with every advantage before the object of his passion  love soon escorted him to his mistress  but his addresses were again unsuccessful and taking a second voyage to england he became secretary to his royal patroness philippa in      after having presented to her some portion of his history  he continued five years in her service entertaining her majesty de beaux dictiez and traictez amoureux in this period he paid a visit to scotland and was entertained    days by william earl douglas  in      when edward the black prince was preparing for the war in spain froissart was with him in gascony and hoped to attend him during the whole course of that important expedition  but the prince sent him back to the queen his mother  he continued not long in england as he visited many of the italian courts in the following year and during his travels sustained the irreparable loss of that patroness to whose bounty he had been so much indebted  philippa died      and froissart is reported to have written the life of his amiable protectress but of this performance the researches of st palaye could discover no trace  after this event he retired to his own country and obtained the benefice of lestines in the diocese of cambray  but the cure of souls was an office little suited to the gay and gallant froissart  his genius led him still to travel from castle to castle and from court to court to use the words of mr warton who has made occasional mention of our author in his elegant history of english poetry  froissart now entered into the service of the duke of brabant and as that prince was himself a poet froissart collected all the compositions of his master and adding some of his own formed a kind of romance which he calls un livre de meliador le chevalier au soleil dor and of which in one of his later poems he gives the following account dedans ce romant sont encloses toutes les chancons que jadis dont lame soit en paradis que fit le bon duc de braibant wincelaus dont on parla tant car un prince fu amorous gracious and chevalerous et le livre me fit ja fair par tres grant amoureus a fair coment quil ne le veist oncques   the duke died in      before this work was completed and froissart soon found a new patron in guy earl of blois on the marriage of whose son he wrote a pastoral entitled le temple dhonneur  the earl having requested him to resume his history he traveled for that purpose to the celebrated court of gaston earl of foix whose high reputation for every knightly virtue attracted to his residence at orlaix those martial adventurers from whose mouth it was the delight of froissart to collect the materials of his history  the courteous gaston gave him the most flattering reception he said to him with a smile and en bon francois quil le connoissoit bien quoyquil ne leust jamais veu mais quil avoit bien oui parler de luy and le retint de son hostel  it became a favorite amusement of the earl to hear froissart read his romance of meliador after supper  he attended in the castle every night at    when the earl sat down to table listened to him with extreme attention and never dismissed him till he had made him vuider tout ce qui estoit rest du vin de sa bouche  froissart gained much information here not only from his patron who was himself very communicative but from various knights of arragon and england in the retinue of the duke of lancaster who then resided at bourdeaux  after a long residence in this brilliant court and after receiving a present from the liberal gaston which he mentions in the following verses  je pris conge and li bons contes me fit par sa chamber des comptes delivrer quatrevins florins darragon tous pesans and fins et mon livre quil mot laisse  froissart departed in the train of the countess of boulogne related to the arl of foix and just leaving him to join her new husband the duke of berry  in this expedition our historian was robbed near avignon and laments the unlucky adventure in a very long poem from which mr de st palaye has drawn many particulars of his life the groundwork of this poem which is not in the list of our authors poetical pieces that mr warton has given us from pasquier seems to have a strong vein of humor  it is a dialogue between the poet and the single florin that he has left out of the many which he had either spent or been obliged to surrender to the robbers  he represents himself as a man of the most expensive turn in    years he had squandered two thousand franks besides his ecclesiastical revenues the composition of his works had cost him  00 but he regretted not this sum as he expected to be amply repaid for it by the praise of posterity  after having attended all the festivals on the marriage of the duke of berry having traversed many parts of france and paid a visit to zeland he returned to his own country in    0 to continue his history from the various materials he had collected  but not satisfied with the relations he had heard of the war in spain he went to middlebourgh in zeland in pursuit of a portuguese knight jean ferrand portelet vaillant homme and sage and du conseil du roy de portugal from this accomplished soldier froissart expected the most perfect information as an ocular witness of those scenes which he now wished to record  the courteous portelet received our indefatigable historian with all the kindness which his enthusiasm deserved and in six days which they passed together gave him all the intelligence he desired  froissart now returned home and finished the third book of his history  many years had past since he had bid adieu to england taking advantage of the truce then established between france and that country he paid it another visit in      with letters of recommendation to the king and his uncles  from dover he proceeded to canterbury to pay his devoirs at the shrine of thomas of becket and to the memory of the black prince  here he happened to find the son of that hero the young king richard whom devotion had also brought to make his offerings to the fashionable saint and return thanks to heaven for his successes in ireland  froissart speaks of this adventure and his own feelings on the great change of scene that had taken place since his last visit to england in the following natural and lively terms  le roy vint a trez grant arroy et bien accompaigne de seigneurs de dames et demoiselles et me mis enter eulx and enter else et tout me sembla nouvel ne je ny congnoissoye person car le tems estoit bien change en angleterre depuis le tems de vingt and huyt ans et en la compagnie du roy navoit nuls de ses oncles si fus du premier ainsi que tout esbahy though froissart was thus embarrassed in not finding one of his old friends in the retinue of the king he soon gained a new patron in thomas percy master of the household who offered to present him and his letters to richard but this offer happening on the eve of the kings departure it proved too late for the ceremony  le roy estoit retrait pour aller dormir  and on the morrow when the impatient historian attended early at the archbishops palace where the king slept his friend percy advised him to wait a more convenient season for being introduced to richard  froissart acquiesced in this advice and was consoled for his disappointment by falling into company with an english knight who had attended the king in ireland and was very willing to gratify the curiosity of the historian by a relation of his adventures  this was william de lisle who entertained him as they rode along together with the marvels of st patricks cave in which he assured him he had passed a night and seen wonderful visions  though our honest chronicler is commonly accused of a passion for the mavelous with an excess of credulity he says very sensibly on this occasion de cette matiere je ne luy parlay plus avaunt et men cessay car voulentiers je luy eusse demand du voyage dirlande et luy eu voulaye parler et mettre en voye  it appears plainly from this passage that our historian was more anxious to gain information concerning the scenes of real action than to listen to the extravagant fictions of a popular legend  but here he was again disappointed  new companions joined them on the road and their historical conference was thus interrupted  these mortifications were soon repaid by the kind reception he met with from the duke of york who said to him when he received the recommendatory letter from the earl of henault maistre jehan tenez vous toujours deles nous and nos gens nous vous ferons tout amor and courtoisie nous y sommes tenus pour lamour du tems pass and de notre dame de mere a qui vous futes nous en avons bien la souvenance  with these flattering marks of remembrance and favor the duke presented him to the king lequel me receut joyeusement et doulcement continues froissart et ne did que je fusse le bien venus et si javoye este de lhostel du roy son ayeul and de madame son ayeule encores estoys je de lhostel dangleterre  some time however elapsed before he had an opportunity of presenting his romance of meliador which he had prepared for the king  the duke of york and his other friends at length obtained for him this honor he gives the following curious and particular account of the ceremony et voulut veoir le roy mon livre que je luy avoye apporte si le vit en sa chamber car tout pourveu je lavoye et luy mis fur son lict et lors il louvrit et regarda dedans et luy pleut tres grandement et plaire bien luy devoit car il estoit enlumine escrit et history and couvert de vermeil veloux a dix cloux dargent dorez dor et roses dor ou meillieu a deux gros fermaulx dorez et richement ouvrez ou meillieu rosiers dor adonc me demanda le roy de quoy il traictoit et je luy dis damours de ceste responce fut tout resjouy et regarda dedans le livre en plusieurs lieux et y lysit car moult bien parloit et lysoit francoys et puis le fist prendre par ung sien chevalier qui se nomme messire richard credon et porter en sa chamber de retrait dont il me fist bonne chere  after passing three months in this court froissart took his leave of the munificent but illfated richard in the last chapter of his history where he mentions the unfortunate end of this monarch he speaks with an honest and affecting gratitude of the liberal present he received from him on his departure from england  it was a goblet of silver gilt weighing two marks and filled with a hundred nobles  on leaving england he retired to his own country and is supposed to have ended his days at his benefice of chimay but the year of his death is uncertain  there is an ancient tradition in the country says mr de saint palaye that he was buried in the chapel of st anne belonging to his own church  that ingenious antiquarian produces an extract from its archives in which the death of froissart is recorded but without naming the year in the most honorable terms  his obit bears the date of october and is followed by  0 latin verses from which i select such as appear to me the most worth transcribing gallorum sublimis honos and fama tuorum hic froissarde jaces si modo sort jaces historiae vivus studuisti reddere

satisfactory account of froissarts life in our language i have been tempted to swell this note to an inordinate length yet it seems to me still necessary to add a few lines more concerning the character both of the historian and the poet  a long series of french critics to whom even the judicious bail has been tempted to give credit have severely censured froissart as the venal partizan of the english and they have accused his last editor sauvage of mutilating his author because they could find in his edition no proofs of their charge  the amiable st palaye has defended le bon froissart as he is called by honest montaigne from this unjust accusation and done full justice at the same time to the injured reputation of his exact and laborious editor  it may serve as a kind of memento mori to poetical vanity to reflect that froissart is hardly known as a poet though his fertile pen produced  0000 verses which were once the delight of princes and the favorite study of the gallant and the fair  how far he deserved the oblivion into which his poetical compositions have fallen the reader may conceive from the following judgment of his french critic with whose ingenious reflection on the imperfections attending the early state both of poetry and painting i shall terminate this note  on peut dire en general au sujet des poesies de froissart que linvention pour les sujets lui

de reformatione reipublicae florentinae his famous political essay entitled the prince was published in      and dedicated to the nephew of that pontiff the various judgments that have been passed on this singular performance are a striking proof of the incertitude of human opinion  in england it has received applause from the great names of bacon and clarendon who suppose it intended to promote the interest of liberty and virtue in italy after many years of approbation it was publicly condemned by clement the viiith at the instigation of a jesuit who had not read the book in france it has even been supposed instrumental to the horrid massacre of st bartholomew as the favorite study of catherine of medicis and her sons and as teaching the bloody lessons of extirpation which they so fatally put in practice yet one of his french translators has gone so far as to say that machiavel who passes among all the world for a teacher of tyranny detested it more than any man of the age in which he lived it must however be owned that there is a great mixture of good and evil in his political precepts for the latter many plausible apologies have been made and it should be remembered to his honor that his great aim was to promote the welfare of his country in exciting the house of medicis to deliver italy from the invasion of foreigners  he is said to have been made historiographer of florence as a reward for having suffered the torture on suspicion of conspiring against the government of that city having supported the severe trial with unfailing resolution his history of that republic he wrote at the request of clement the viith as we are informed in his dedication of it to that pontiff the style of this work is much celebrated and the first book may be regarded as a model

ecclesiastical forces and being governor of romagna and lastly of bologna in which city he is said to have received the most flattering compliments from the emperor charles v  having gained much reputation both civil and military in various scenes of active life he passed his latter days in retirement at his villa near florence where he died soon after completing his history in the   th year of his age    0 notwithstanding the high reputation of guicciardin his history has been violently attacked both as to matter and style  the honest montaigne inveighs with great warmth against the malignant turn of its author and his own countryman boccalini in whose whimsical but lively work there are many excellent remarks on history and historians supposes a lacedaemonian thrown into agonies

family but his general veracity is confirmed by the great authority of the first duke of epernon who to use the words of lord bolingbroke had been an actor and a principal actor too in many of the scenes that davila recites girard secretary to this duke and no contemptible biographer relates that this history came down to the place where the old man resided in gascony a little before his death

son of francesco sarpi a merchant of venice and born in that city      he took the religious habit in the monastery of the servites      after receiving priests orders in      he passed four years in mantua being appointed to read lectures on divinity and canon law by the bishop of that diocese and in this early part of his life he is conjectured to have conceived the first idea of writing his celebrated history as he formed an intimate friendship during his residence in mantua with camillo doliva who had been secretary to cardinal gonzaga at the council of trent and excited the learned venetian to the arduous task which he so happily accomplished in a future period he was recalled from mantua to read lectures on philosophy in his own convent at venice which he did with great reputation during the years           and       he went to rome as procurator general in       passing from thence to naples he there formed an acquaintance with the famous baptista porta who has left

there is hardly any science which escaped his active mind his discoveries in optics and anatomy would be alone sufficient to immortalize his name had he not gained immortality by a still nobler exertion of his mental powers in defending the liberties of his country against the tyranny of rome on the first attack of pope paul v on two laws of venice very wisely framed to correct the abuses of the clergy father paul arose as the literary champion of the republic and defended its cause with great spirit and temper in various compositions though he is said not to be author of the treatise generally ascribed to him on the occasion and entitled the rights of sovereigns etc  his chief performance on the subject was considerazioni sopra le censure di paolo v  the venetians showed a just admiration of the sublime virtue of a monk who defended so nobly the civil rights of his country against the separate interest of the church in   0  the council passed a decree in his favor which i shall transcribe in this note because it is not found in the common lives of father paul and because there is hardly any object more pleasing to the mind than the contemplation of a free state

enemy whom his virtue had provoked in   0  after venice had adjusted her disputes with rome by the mediation of france the first attack was made on the life of father paul he was beset near his convent in the evening by five assassins who stabbed him in many places and left him for dead he recovered under the care of the celebrated acquapendente appointed to attend him at the public charge to whom as he was speaking on the depth of the principal wound his patient said pleasantly that the world imputed it stylo romanae curiae  the crime is generally supposed to have proceeded from the jesuits but the secret authors of it were never clearly discovered though the five ruffians were traced by the venetian ambassador in rome where they are said to have been well received at first but failing afterward in their expected reward to have perished in misery and want the senate of venice paid such attention to father paul as expressed the highest sense of his merit and the most affectionate solicitude for his safety they not only doubled his stipend a second time but entreated him to choose a public residence for the greater security of his person the munificence and care of the republic was equalled by the modesty and fortitude of their servant he chose not to relinquish his cell and though warned of various machinations against his life he continued to serve his country with unabating zeal discovering in his private letters to his friends the most heroic calmness of mind and saying in answer to their admonitions that no man lives well who is too anxious for the preservation of life  yet the apprehensions of his friends had too just a foundation in   0  another conspiracy was formed to murder him in his sleep by some persons of his own convent but their treachery was happily discovered  from this time he lived in more cautious retirement still devoting himself to the service of the republic on various occasions and acquiring new reputation by many compositions at length the world was surprised by his history of the council of trent first published at london      with the fictitious name of pietro soave polano and dedicated to james the is it by antonio de dominis the celebrated archbishop of spalatro who speaks of the concealed author as his intimate friend who had entrusted him with a manuscript on which his modesty set a trifling value but which it seemed proper to bestow upon the world even without his consent  the mystery concerning the publication of this noble work has never been thoroughly cleared up and various falsities concerning it have been reported by authors of considerable reputation  it has even been said that james the is it had some share in the composition of the book if he had it was probably in forming the name pietro soave polano which is an anagram of paolo sarpi veneziano and the only part of the book which bears any relation to the style or taste of that monarch  father paul was soon supposed to be the real author of the work in question the prince of conde on a visit to his cloister expressly asked him if he was so  to which he modestly replied that at rome it was well known who had written it  he enjoyed not many years the reputation arising from this masterly production  in      a fever occasioned his death which was even more exemplary and sublime than his life itself  he prepared himself for approaching dissolution with the most devout composure and as the liberty of his country was the darling object of his exalted mind he prayed for its preservation with his last breath in the two celebrated words esto perpetua  there is a singular beauty in the character of father paul which is not only uncommon in his profession but is rarely found in human nature  though he passed a long life in controversy of the most exasperating kind and was continually attacked in every manner that malignity could suggest both his writings and his heart appeared perfectly free from a vindictive spirit devoting all the powers of his mind to the defense of the public cause he seemed entirely to forget the injuries that were perpetually offered to his own person and reputation  his constitution was extremely delicate and his intense application exposed him to very frequent and violent disorders these he greatly remedied by his singular temperance living chiefly on bread fruits and water  this imperfect account of a character deserving the noblest elogium is principally extracted from an octavo volume entitled memoire anedote spettanti a f paolo da francesco griselini veneziano etc edit  d    0 the author of this elaborate work has pointed out several mistakes in the french and english accounts of father paul particularly in the anecdotes related of him by burnet in his life of bishop bedell and by mr brent the son of his english translator  some of these had indeed been observed before by writers of our own  see the general dictionary under the article father paul  for the length and for the deficiencies of this note i am tempted to apologize with a sentence borrowed from the great historian who is the subject of it  chi mi osservera in alcuni tempi

phrase jerome osorius was born of a noble family at lisbon   0  he was educated at the university of salamanca and afterward studied at paris and bologna on his return to portugal he gradually rose to the bishopric of sylves to which he was appointed by catherine of austria regent of the kingdom in the minority of sebastian at the request of cardinal henry of portugal he wrote his history of king emanuel and the expedition of gama  which his great contemporary camoens made at the same time the subject of his immortal lusiad a poem which has at length appeared with due luster in our language being translated with great spirit and elegance by mr mickle it is remarkable that the history of osorius and the epic poem of camoens were published in the same year      but the fate of these two great authors was very different the poet was suffered to perish in poverty under the reign of that henry who patronized the historian yet allowing for the difference of their professions i am inclined to think they possessed a similarity of mind there appear many traces of that high heroic spirit even in the priest osorius which animated the soldier camoens particularly in the pleasure with which he seems to describe the martial manners of his countrymen under the of emanuel  illius aetate says the historian in the close of his manly work inopia in exilium pulsa videbatur moestitiae locus non erat querimoniae silebant omnia choreis and cantibus personabant ejusmodi ludis aula regia frequenter oblectabatur nobiles adolescentes cum virginibus regiis in aula sine ulla libidinis

effecisset pueris enim nobilibus qui in aula regia versabantur non erat licitum pallium virile sumere antequam in africam trajicerent and aliquod inde decus egregium reportarent et his quidem moribus erat illius temporis nobilitas instituta ut multi ex illius domo viri omni laud cumulati prodirent  this is a striking picture of the manners of chivalry to which portugal owed much of its glory in that splendid period there is one particular in the character of osorius which considering his age and country deserves the highest encomium i mean his tolerating spirit in the first book of his history he speaks of emanuels cruel persecution of the jews in the following generous and exalted language  fuit quidem hoc nec ex lege nec ex religione factum quid enim tu rebels animos nullaque ad id suscepta religione constrictos adigas ad credendum ea quae summa contentione aspernantur and respuunt idque tibi assumas ut libertatem voluntatis impedias and vincula mentibus effraenatis injicias at id neque fieri potest neque christi sanctissimum numen approbat voluntarium enim sacrificium non vi et malo coactum ab hominibus expetit neque vim mentibus inferri sed voluntates ad studium verae religionis allici and invitari jubet postremo quis non videt et ita religionem per religionis simulationem indignissime violari  osorius is said to have used many arguments to dissuade sebastian from his unfortunate expedition into africa and to have felt so deeply the miseries which befell the portuguese after that fatal event that his grief was supposed to accelerate his death  he expired in    0 happy says de thou who celebrates him as a model of christian virtue that he died just before the spanish army entered portugal and thus escaped being a witness to the desolation of his country  his various works were published at rome in      by his nephew osorius in four volumes folio with a life of their author among these are two remarkable productions the first an admonition to our queen elizabeth exhorting her to return into the church of rome the second an essay on glory written with such classical purity as to give birth to a report that it was not the composition of osorius but the lost work of cicero on that subject  in the lucubrationes of walter haddon the curious reader may find a very spirited answer to the invective against the reformation which the zeal of the portuguese bishop led him to address to elizabeth  the english civilian defends the cause of his nation and his queen with great energy  he justifies the dissolution of the monasteries by representing their abuses in the most glowing colors and he ventures to affirm in vindicating the character of his royal mistress that her majesty of england was as great a theologian as the bishop of sylves himself  sacras scripturas multum lectitat interpretes optimos inter se comparat doctissimorum theologorum undique sententias colligit scientia linguarum per se ipsa excellit ingenio est prompto et

talavera a town in the diocese of toledo as he himself informs us in his famous essay de rege which opens with a beautiful romantic description of a sequestered spot in that neighborhood where he enjoyed the pleasures of literary retirement with his friend calderon a minister of toledo whose death he mentions in the same essay commemorating his learning and his virtues in the most pleasing terms of affectionate admiration  mariana was admitted into the order of jesuits at the age of    he traveled afterward into italy and france and returning into spain in      settled at toledo and died there in the   th year of his age       hearing it frequently regretted in the course of his travels that there was no general history of his country he engaged in that great work on his return and published it in latin at toledo      with a dedication to philip the iid where he speaks of his own performance with modesty and manly freedom and perhaps with as little flattery as ever appeared in any address of that nature to a monarch continually fed with the grossest adulation  this elaborate work he translated into spanish but as he himself declares with all the freedom of an original author he published his version in   0  with an address to philip the iiid in which he laments the decline of learning in his country and declares he had himself executed that work from his apprehension of its being mangled by an ignorant translator he had closed his history which begins with the first peopling of spain with the death of ferdinand in      but in a subsequent edition in      he added to it a short summary of events to the year      but in the year before he first published the spanish version of his history he addressed also to the young monarch philip the iiid his famous essay which i have mentioned and which was publicly burnt at paris about  0 years after its publication on the supposition that it had excited ravaillac to the murder of henry the ivth though it was asserted with great probability by the jesuits that the assassin had never seen the book it is true indeed that mariana in this essay occasionally defends clement the monk who stabbed henry the iiid and it is very remarkable that he grounds this defense not on the bigoted tenets of a priest who thinks every thing lawful for the interest of his church but on those sublime principles of civil liberty with which an ancient roman would have vindicated the dagger of brutus indeed this essay contains some passages on government which would not have dishonored even cicero himself but it must be owned they are grievously disgraced by the last chapter of the work which breathes a furious spirit of ecclesiastical intolerance and yet closes with these mild and modest expressions  nostrum de regno et regis institutione judicium fortasse non omnibus placeat qui volet sequatur aut suo potius stet si potioribus argumentis nitatur de quibus rebus tantopere asseveravi in his libris eas nunquam veriores quam alienam sententiam affirmabo potest enim non solum mihi aliud aliud aliis videri sed et mihi ipsi alio tempore suam quisque sententiam per me sequatur et qui nostra leget memor conditionis humanae si quid erratum est pio studio rempublicam juvandi veniam benignus concedat et facilis  this is not the only work of mariana which fell under a public proscription he was himself persecuted and suffered a years imprisonment for a treatise which seems to have been dictated by the purest love to his country it was against the pernicious practice of debasing the public coin and as it was supposed to reflect on the duke of lerma called the sejanus of spain it exposed the author about the year   0  to the persecution of that vindictive minister from which it does not appear how he escaped  indeed the accounts of marianas life are very imperfect bail whom i have chiefly followed mentions a life of him by de vargas which he could not procure i have sought after this biographer with the same ill success as i wished to give a more perfect account of this great author whose personal history is little known among us though it is far from being unworthy of attention  note xix verse     the fervid grotius to her glory raised a column splendid as the feats he praised hugo grotius was the eldest child of john de groot curator in the university of leyden and born at delft on the  0th of april       his infancy gave the fairest promise of those great and universal talents which were so amply unfolded in his subsequent life at the age of eleven he was celebrated as a prodigy of learning  when barnevelt was sent ambassador to henry the ivth of france in      he took the young grotius in his train and presented him to that monarch who honored the little scholar by graciously giving him his picture and a chain of gold one circumstance was yet wanting to complete the joy of grotius in this expedition and he was obliged to quit france without obtaining the great object of his wishes a personal acquaintance with the president de thou  he afterward expressed his mortification on this subject in a letter to that great man which gave rise to a friendly correspondence between these congenial characters highly honorable to both  on his return to holland grotius devoted himself to the practice of the law and in      pleaded his first cause at delft in the exercise of this laborious profession he found sufficient time to cultivate polite literature in      he published his edition of martianus capella at the request of scaliger it was followed in the succeeding year by the phenomenon of aratus and in   0  he printed his first tragedy of adamus exful a composition which might possibly give birth to the divine performance of milton though its author esteemed it so little as to exclude it from a collection of his poems grotius indeed was remarkably modest in estimating his own poetical talents  few persons have written so many verses and thought so humbly of their merit  the public proofs which he had now given of his various erudition procured him an honor from his country the more flattering as it was unsolicited the united provinces justly proud of having vindicated their liberty against the tyranny of spain and desirous of commemorating so noble an event appointed grotius their historiographer a nomination so honorable to a youth for such he was led him to collect materials for that history which many accidents conspired to prevent his publishing during the whole course of his busy and vexatious life  from his success at the bar he was promoted to the post of advocate general and in   0  he married maria reigesberg a lady of a respectable family in zealand and a wife as his biographer observes truly worthy of such a husband in      he became pensionary of rotterdam an office which gave him a seat in the assembly of the states he was soon afterward employed in a commission to england to settle some national disputes concerning the greenland fishery  the greatest pleasure and advantage which he derived from this expedition was the intimacy which he contracted in england with the celebrated casaubon soon after his return to holland the fatal spirit of religious controversy produced those unfortunate and wellknown distractions in his country which led to the infamous execution of the great and virtuous barnevelt grotius who was affectionately attached to that upright minister and joined with him in every measure to counteract the usurping ambition of prince maurice was thus exposed to the oppression of that vindictive hero  after the vain ceremony of an iniquitous trial he was condemned to perpetual imprisonment and conducted on the  th of june      to the fortress of louvestein in south holland at the point of the island formed by the vahal and the meuse  his tender and faithful wife who had been cruelly debarred from attending him even in sickness during his confinement at the hague was now admitted to share his prison on the hard condition of forfeiting that privilege if she ever ventured from louvestein she afterward obtained leave to come abroad twice a week  with the spirit of a roman matron she refused the allowance which the government had assigned for the maintenance of her husband  continued for almost two years the constant attendant on his captivity  and at length became the glorious instrument of his deliverance grotius who happily experienced that love and literature are unfailing resources under the most galling calamity of human life had pursued his studies in prison with his usual ardour he composed there among other works the first sketch of his essay on the truth of christianity in a poetical form and in his native language  reports were spread by his enemies that he had formed a plan for his escape and his prison was rigorously examined but notwithstanding the vigilance of his oppressors the affectionate ingenuity of his wife restored him to freedom by the following expedient  he had been allowed to borrow books from his friends and it was usual with him to send such as he had read in a chest that went regularly with his linen to the neighboring town of gorcum the guards were at first very scrupulous in their examination of this chest but having long found in it only books and linen they were now accustomed to let it pass unopened  the circumstance suggested to the attentive wife of grotius the possibility of her husbands escape and she persuaded him to attempt it by this singular conveyance the incidents attending the adventure were highly calculated to increase the agitation of her heart and must indeed have occasioned the failure of her design had she not taken the most ingenious precautions to ensure its success  the soldiers who carried the chest in which grotius was enclosed were alarmed by its weight and cried out in the proverbial language of their country that it must contain an arminian  she replied with great presence of mind that it was indeed loaded with arminian books the soldiers were still unsatisfied and went to the wife of their commanding officer who was absent to express their suspicion  she replied that she had been assured it contained only books and bade them carry it to the boat a female servant in the secret attended the chest and saw it safely conveyed to the house of dazelaer a friend of grotius in gorcum from whence he passed in disguise into brabant the generous contriver of his escape now triumphed in the success of her project being assured that her husband was safe by the return of her servant she avowed what she had done and was more closely confined by the offended commandant of louvestein but she soon obtained her liberty on presenting a petition to the states general though some wretches were found in that assembly brutal enough to express a desire of punishing a woman for an act of heroism which in athens or in rome would have almost rendered her an object of idolatry  her merit however has been justly celebrated by the poets of her country but the most pleasing memorial of it appears in a poem of grotius addressed to the unfortunate son of the president de thou the passage does honor both to the gratitude and the genius of our author and i shall therefore insert it as an advantageous specimen of his latin poetry  in addressing his young friend on the virtues of his venerable father he breaks out into the following encomium on connubial affection ah quantum placido mitique in pectore regnat illa

this passage his continued adversity few literary characters have been so repeatedly exposed to all the various and mortifying anxieties of public life  after his escape from prison in      he took refuge in france he received indeed the most flattering marks of regard from many eminent characters of that kingdom and a pension of three thousand livres from lewis the xiiith but the payment of this gratuity so honorable to the monarch who bestowed it was soon rendered irregular and precarious by the artifices of richelieu and grotius was at length obliged to seek a more independent asylum merely because he was of too firm and noble a character to become the servile instrument of that imperious minister  he had passed however ten years and composed one of his most celebrated works in that country  his treatise de jure belli and pacis was begun in      at balagui a seat of the president de meme in the neighborhood of senlis and he published it at paris in      the great and extensive reputation which his writings had obtained did not induce holland to atone for the injustice which she had exercised against one of the most eminent and virtuous of her citizens the death of his enemy prince maurice had tempted grotius to hope that he might return with safety and honor to his native country but on making the experiment in      he met with much more ingratitude than he expected and retired in the next year to hamburgh  he there contracted an intimacy with salvius the vice chancellor of sweden who sent a favorable account of his new friend to oxenstiern the great minister who so well supplied the loss of his heroic master gustavus grotius was soon invited to franckfort by that penetrating genius who introduced him into the council of the young christina and appointed him her ambassador to the court of france  it is said however that grotius owed his connection with sweden to the high sentiments which gustavus himself had entertained of his merit and to orders given by that monarch for the employment of the celebrated exile whose treatise de jure belli was found in his tent after the fatal victory of lutzen which he purchased with his life however this may be grotius appeared at paris in the character of ambassador from sweden      and continued no less than ten years in a situation equally splendid and vexatious  engaged in the delicate business of negotiating subsidies which were paid with reluctance harrassed by the hostile intrigues of his ungrateful country and alternately insulted and flattered by the ministers of france he maintained himself with integrity and honor in a difficult and important station from which his various and powerful enemies were perpetually endeavoring to effect his removal  after a series of public mortifications he at length solicited his own recall he obtained a passport through holland was treated with great honor at amsterdam and arriving at stockholm was flattered with great promises by the queen christina who pressed him to settle with his family in sweden from this however he excused himself and pleaded the tender health of his wife as unequal to so cold a climate having obtained after some delays the queens permission to retire and a vessel to carry him to lubeck he was unfortunately shipwrecked on the coast of pomerania from whence he traveled sixty miles in an open wagon to the town of rostock where after languishing a few days he expired on the   th of august       for my very imperfect account of this great and amiable man i am chiefly indebted to mr burigny whose life of grotius deserves a distinguished rank among biographical writings as it contains a very luminous display of much intricate matter and a just delineation of a character which deserves to be minutely studied for what nation can produce a more singular and excelling compound of science and virtue of genius and piety  as an historian he shares with thucydides the uncommon merit of celebrating the splendid actions of his personal enemies and of a country which treated him with the most ungenerous ingratitude it appears from one of his letters to de thou that he had made some advances in the plan at least of his history at so early a period as      for after complimenting the great historian of france on his immortal work he adds ego quoque impar sane oneri sed magno patriae amore accensus simile opus molior tanto autem minus tuo quanto minor est batavia non dicam gallia vestra sed toto orb sed nec adhuc varo videor neque dicere cinna digna prematur itaque immaturus labor donec aetas cum judicio tempus quoque emendandi dederit aut potius exurgat alius qui res scitu per se non indignas dictione commendet ut eo libentius discant posteri quid batavi fecerint  we learn also from a letter to his brother in      that the work was then finished and that he thought proper to delay its publication though it seems to have been his favorite performance he had never the satisfaction of seeing it in print  it did not appear till twelve years after his death when his sons cornelius and peter addressed it to the states of holland and west friesland in a dedication that does honor both to their father and themselves  the work itself under the double name of annals and history gives a complete account of the most interesting period from the year      to the truce with spain in   0   the letters of grotius are not less valuable than his history as they contain much miscellaneous intelligence and abound with literary anecdotes  his amiable wife survived him and died at the hague  of their six children peter became the most eminent  he was sent by his country as her ambassador to france and seems to have inherited both the talents and the virtues of his father  it may yet be proper to add to this long note the noble encomium of grotius on scaliger to which i have alluded and which as dr johnson observes seems to have been imitated by cowley in the close of his elegy on sir henry wooton in mortem scaligeri unica lux saecli genitoris gloria nemo quem puerum nemo credidit esse senem tam sibi par semper quam cunctis celsior unus et

city      his own memoirs give a pleasing account of the early activity of his mind  as his health during his childhood was so tender and infirm that his parents rather restrained him from the usual studies of his age he devoted much of his time to drawing and copied with a pen the engravings of albert durer before he was ten years old at that age he was settled in the college of burgundy but this plan of his education was soon interrupted by a fever in which his life was despaired of and in which the mother of his future friend the duke of montpensier watched him with an attention singularly happy after his physicians and his parents had considered him as dead in a few years after his recovery he repaired to orleans to study the civil law from thence he was drawn to valence in dauphiny by the reputation of cujacius who was then reading lectures there on his road he embraced an opportunity of hearing hotoman the celebrated author of francogallia who was reading lectures also at bourges  during his residence at valence he contracted a friendship with joseph scaliger which he cultivated through life  in      his father recalled him to paris just before the massacre of st bartholomew  he mentions in his memoirs the horrors which he felt in seeing a very small part of that bloody scene  he resided in the house of his uncle nicholas de thou promoted to the bishopric of chartres he was then designed himself for the church and beginning to collect his celebrated library applied himself particularly to the civil law and to grecian literature  he traveled into italy in      with paul de foix going on an embassy to the pope and the italian princes of de foix he gives the most engaging character and speaks with great pleasure of the literary entertainment and advantages which he derived from this expedition he returned to paris and devoted himself again to his studies in the following year  on the dissentions in the court of france in      he was employed to negociate with the marshall montmorency and engage him to interpose his good offices to prevent the civil war which he for some time effected  the same year he visited the low countries and on his return was appointed to a public office on which he entered with that extreme diffidence which is so natural to a delicate mind  in      he traveled again with his elder brother who was sent by his physicians to the baths of plombieres in lorrain from hence he made a short excursion into germany and was received there with the jovial hospitality of that country which he describes in a very lively manner  but affection soon recalled him to plombieres to attend his infirm brother to paris who died there in a few months after their return  in    0 on the plagues appearing in the capital our historian retired into touraine and after visiting the principal places in normandy returned to paris in the winter in the following year he was of the number chosen from the parliament of paris to administer justice in guienne as two ecclesiastics were included in that commission  in this expedition he embraced every opportunity of preparing the materials of his history seeking as he ever did the society of all persons eminent for their talents or capable of giving him any useful information he speaks with great pleasure of a visit which he paid at this time to the celebrated montaigne whom he calls a man of a most liberal mind and totally uninfected with the spirit of party  after various excursions he was now returning to paris when he received the unexpected news of his fathers death an event which affected him most deeply as filial affection was one of the striking characteristics of his amiable mind he consoled himself under the affliction of having been unable to pay his duty to his dying parent by erecting a magnificent monument to his memory expressive of the high veneration in which he ever held his virtues  he engaged again in public business devoting his intervals of leisure to mathematical studies and to the composition of latin verse which seems to have been his favorite amusement  in      he published his poem de re accipitraria which though much celebrated by the critics of his age has fallen like the subject of which it treats into universal neglect  in      he bid adieu to the court on finding himself treated with such a degree of coldness as his ingenuous nature could not submit to and being eager to advance in his great work which he had already brought down to the reign of francis ii  in      having been often pressed to marry by his family and being absolved from his ecclesiastical engagements for that purpose he made choice of marie barbanson of an ancient and noble family but as her parents were suspected of a secret inclination to the reformed religion it was thought proper that the lady should undergo a kind of expiation in a private conference with two catholic divines a circumstance of which the great historian speaks with an air of triumph in his memoirs as a proof of his own inviolable attachment to the faith of his fathers in      he lost his affectionate mother who is described by her son as meeting death with the same gentleness and tranquillity of mind by which her life was distinguished  when the violence of the league had reduced henry the iiid to abandon paris our historian was sent into normandy to confirm the magistrates of that province in their adherence to the king he afterward met henry at blois and while he was receiving from him in private some commissions to execute at paris the king pressed his hand and seemed preparing to impart to him some important secret but after a long pause dismissed him without revealing it this secret was afterward supposed to have been the projected assassination of the duke of guise the supposition is probable and it is also probable that if henry had then revealed his design the manly virtue and eloquence of de thou might have led him to relinquish that infamous and fatal measure  he was however so far from suspecting the intended crime of the king that when he first heard at paris that guise was assassinated he believed it a false rumor only spread by that faction to introduce what he supposed had really happened the murder of the king  in the commotions which the death of guise produced in paris many insults were offered to the family of de thou his wife was imprisoned for a day in the bastile but obtaining her liberty she escaped from the city in a mean habit attended by her husband disguised also in the dress of a soldier  having sent his wife in safety into picardy he repaired to the king who was almost deserted at blois and was greatly instrumental in persuading his master to his coalition with henry of navarre  the king determined to establish a parliament at tours and de thou was considered as the most proper person to be the president of this assembly but with his usual modesty he declined this honor and chose rather to engage with his friend mr de schomberg in an expedition to germany for the service of the king  he was at first designed for the embassy to elizabeth but at the request of schomberg declined the appointment and accompanied his friend  he first received intelligence of the kings death at venice where he had formed an intimacy with the celebrated arnauld dossat at that time secretary to the cardinal joyeuse  in consequence of their conversation on this event and the calamities of france de thou addressed a latin poem to his friend which he afterward printed at tours  in leaving italy he passed a few days at padua with his friend vicenzio pinelli from whom he collected many particulars concerning the most eminent italian and spanish authors whom he determined to celebrate in his history in the hope as he honestly confesses that his liberal attention to foreign merit might entitle his own works to the favor both of italy and spain but he was disappointed in this fair expectation and laments the ingratitude which he experienced from both  on his return to france he was graciously received by henry the ivth and in giving that prince an account of italy suggested to him the idea of a connection with mary of medicis after the battle of ivry he complimented the king in a short poem which closes with the following lines auspiciis vulgo peraguntur praelia regum perque duces illis gloria multa venit tu vincis virtute tua nec militis haec est ista tibi propria laurea parta manu as he was traveling soon afterward with his wife and family which he designed to settle at tours his party was intercepted by the enemy and he was obliged to abandon his wife and her attendants being prevailed on by their entreaties to secure his own escape by the swiftness of his horse  he repaired to the king at gisors and soon obtained the restitution of his family  on the death of amyot bishop of auxerre well known by his various translations from the greek language the king appointed de thou his principal librarian in      our historian was very near falling a victim to the plague but happily struggled through that dangerous distemper by the assistance of two skilful physicians who attended him at tours  in      he began the most important part of his history and under this year he introduces in his memoirs a long and spirited poem addressed to posterity in which he enters into a justification of himself against the malignant attacks which the manly and virtuous freedom of his writings had drawn upon him it concludes with the following animated appeal to the spirit of his father vos o majorum cineres teque optime longis soliciti genitor defuncte laboribus aevi testor pro patria nullas regnique salute vitavisse vices vestra virtute meaque indignum nil fecisse et si fata tulissent prodessem ut patriae patriae succurrere livor absistat pietate mea meruisse petenti pura ad vos anima atque hodiernae nescia culpae descendam quandoque novissima venerit hora nostraque sub tacitos ibit fama integra manes   in      he succeeded his uncle augustine as president a mortier  in      he lost his valuable and learned friend pithou who first solicited him to undertake his history and had greatly assisted him in the prosecution of that laborious work how deeply the affectionate mind of de thou was wounded by this event appears from his long letter to casaubon on the occasion  in      he began to be engaged in those negotiations which happily terminated in the famous edict of nantes  it may be proper to observe here that de thou was accused of being a calvinist in consequence of the part he acted in this business as well as from the moderate tenor of his history and it is remarkable that sully seems in his memoirs to countenance the accusation  in   0  our historian suffered a severe domestic affliction in the loss of his wife he celebrated her virtues and his own connubial affection in a latin poem with this and a greek epitaph on the same lady written by casaubon he terminates the commentary of his own life of which the preceding account is an imperfect abridgment  his first wife leaving him no children he married in   0  gasparde de la chastre an accomplished lady of a noble family who having brought him three sons and three daughters died at the age of          there is a fine letter of daniel heinsius addressed to our author on this occasion exhorting him to fortitude but this unexpected domestic calamity and the miseries which befell his country on the murder of henry the great are said to have wounded his feeling mind so deeply as to occasion his death which happened in may       under the regency of mary of medicis he had been one of the directors general of the finances maintaining the same reputation for integrity in that department which he had ever preserved in his judicial capacity  the first part of his history appeared in   0  with a preface addressed to henry iv justly celebrated for its liberal and manly spirit but i must observe that the following compliment to the king  quicquid de ea statueris jusserisve pro divinae vocis oraeulo mihi erit  was more than even that most amiable of monarchs deserved as he ungratefully deserted the cause of our historian in suffering his work to be proscribed by the public censure of rome in   0  as de thou plainly intimates in the following passage from one of his letters written in       publicata prima part historiae meae immane quam commoti sunt plerique sive invidi sive factiosi qui mox proceres quosdam qui per se in talibus rebus nihil vident per calumnias artificiose confictas ut scis in me concitaverunt remque e vestigio roman detulerunt et auctore malign exagitato facile pervicerunt ut morosi illi censores

se tulissent ita in aula omni open destitutus facile romae oppressus sum  de thou was preparing a new edition of his history at the time of his death  his passion for latin verse appears never to have forsaken him as the latest effusion of his pen was a little poem descriptive of his last illness and an epitaph in which he draws the following just character of himself mihi veritatis cura vitae commodis antiquiorque charitatibus fuit nullique facto voce nulli injurius injurias patienter aliorum tuli tu quisquis es qualisque quantusque o bone si cura very est ulla si pietas movet a me meisque injuriam quaeso abstine   the pious paternal prayer in the last line was very far from being crowned with success francis the eldest son of de thou fell a victim to the resentment which cardinal richelieu is said to have conceived against him from a passage in the great historian reflecting on the richelieu family he was beheaded at lions      for having been privy to a conspiracy against the cardinal  voltaire with his usual philanthropy and spirit inveighs against the iniquity of this execution in his melanges tom iii  the curious reader may find a particular account of this tragical event in the last volume of that noble edition of thuanus which was published under the auspices of dr mead and does great honor to our country  i shall close this note by transcribing from it the following spirited epitaph on the unfortunate victim historiam quisquis vult scribere scribere veram nunc vetat exitium magne thuane tuum richeliae stirpis proavos laesisse paterni crimen erat calami

  thy wits o france as even thy critics own support not historys majestic tone to avoid every appearance of national prejudice i shall quote on this occasion some passages from a very liberal french critic who has passed the same judgment on the historians of his country the marquis dargenson in a memoir read before the french academy      not only confesses that the french writers have failed in history but even ventures to explain the cause of their ill success  nous avons says he quelques morceaux ou lon trouve tout a la fois la fidelite le gout et le vrai ton de lhistoire mais outre quils

third epistle note i verse  0 and shake the affrighted world with dire portents there is a curious treatise of dr warburtons on this subject which is become very scarce it is entitled a critical and philosophical enquiry into the causes of prodigies and miracles as related by historians with an essay toward restoring a method and purity in history it contains like most of the compositions of this dogmatical writer a strange mixture of judicious criticism and entertaining absurdity in a style so extraordinary that i think the following specimens of it may amuse a reader who has not happened to meet with this singular book  having celebrated rawleigh and hyde as writers of true historic genius he adds almost all the rest of our histories want life soul shape and body a mere hodgepodge of abortive embryos and rotten carcases kept in an unnatural ferment which the vulgar mistake for real life by the rank leven of prodigies and portents which cannot but afford good diversion to the critic while he observes how naturally one of their own fables is here mythologizd and explained of a churchyard carcass raised and set a strutting by the inflation of some hellish succubus within he then passes a heavy censure on the antiquarian publications of thomas hearne in the close of which he exclaims  wonder not reader at the view of these extravagancies the historic muse after much vain longing for a vigorous adorer is now fallen under that indisposition of her sex so well known by a depraved appetite for trash and cinders  having quoted two passages from this singular critic in which his metaphorical language is exceedingly gross candor obliges me to transcribe another which is no less remarkable for elegance and beauty of expression in describing sallust at one time the loud advocate of public spirit and afterward sharing in the robberies of caesar he expresses this variation of character by the following imagery  no sooner did the warm aspect of good fortune shine out again but all those exalted ideas of virtue and honor raised like a beautiful kind of frostwork in the cold season of adversity dissolved and disappeared enquiry etc london      p     note ii verse    on francio now the gallic page is mute and british story drops the name of brute the origin of the french nation was ascribed by one of the monkish historians to francio a son of priam mr warton who mentions this circumstance in his dissertation on the origin of romantic fiction in europe supposes that the revival of virgils aeneid about the sixth or seventh century inspired many nations with this chimerical idea of tracing their descent from the family of priam there is a very remarkable proof in the historian matthew of westminster how fond the english were of considering themselves as the descendants of the trojan brutus in a letter from edward the first to pope boniface concerning the affairs of scotland the king boasts of his trojan predecessor in the following terms  sub temporibus itaque ely and samuelis prophetarum vir quidam strenuus et insignis brutus nomine de genere trojanorum post excidium urbis trojanae cum multis nobilibus trojanorum applicuit in

invidiously on the failings of this immortal genius but it may be useful to remark that no historical work though executed by a man of the highest mental abilities can obtain a lasting reputation if it be planned and written with a servility of spirit  this was evidently the case in bacons history of henry the viith it was the first work he engaged in after his disgrace and laid as a peace offering at the feet of his master the despicable james who affected to consider his great grandfather the abject and avaricious henry as the model of a king it was therefore the aim of the unfortunate historian to flatter this phantasy of the royal pedant for whom he wrote and he accordingly formed a colossal statue to represent a pigmy  it is matter of astonishment that lord bolingbroke who in his political works has written on the vices of this very king with a force and beauty so superior to the history in question should speak of it as a work possessing merit sufficient to bear a comparison with the ancients on the contrary the extreme awkwardness of the task which the historian imposed upon himself gave a weakness and embarrassment to his style which in his nobler works is clear nervous and manly this will particularly appear from a few lines in his character of henry  this king to speak of him in terms equal to his deserving was one of the best sort of wonders a wonder for wise men he had parts both in his virtues and his fortune not so fit for a commonplace as for observation his worth may bear a tale or two that may put upon him somewhat that may seem divine  he then relates a dream of henrys mother the lady margaret but the quotations i have made may be sufficient to justify my remark and as dr johnson says happily of milton what englishman can take delight in transcribing passages which if they lessen the reputation of bacon diminish in some degree the honor of our country  note iv verse    and of that mountain make the

relating to this celebrated conqueror in a very elaborate and spirited dissertation entitled examen critique des historiens dalexandre paris  to      but there is great probability in his conjecture that the name of aristobulus has slipped into the story by some mistake and that the sycophant so justly reprimanded was onesicritus who attended the hero of macedon in quality of historiographer and is censured by the judicious strabo as the most fabulous of all the writers who have engaged in his history for the reasons which support this conjecture see the book i have mentioned page     note vi verse     in dedications quietly inurnd they take more lying praise than ammon spurned as history is the composition most frequently addressed to princes modern historians have been peculiarly tempted to this kind of adulation indeed dedications in general are but too commonly a disgrace to letters  perhaps a concise history of this species of writing and the fate of some remarkable dedicators might have a good influence toward correcting that prostitution of talents which is so often observed in productions of this nature and such a work might be very amusing to the lovers of literary anecdote  the two most unfortunate dedications that occur to my remembrance were written by joshua barnes and dr pearce late bishop of rochester the first dedicated his history of edward the iiid to james the iid and unluckily compared that monarch to the most valiant of his predecessors just before his timidity led him to abdicate the throne the second dedicated his edition of tully de oratore to lord macclesfield and as unluckily celebrated his patron as a model of public virtue not many years before he was impeached in parliament and fined l 0000 for the iniquity of his conduct in the office of chancellor  note vii verse     still can herrera mourning over his urn his dying pangs to blissful rapture turn antonio de herrera a spanish historian of great reputation describes the death

this author in obscurity but the remoteness and barbarity of the people whose story he relates it seldom happens that all circumstances concur to happiness or fame the nation which produced this great historian has the grief of seeing his genius employed upon a foreign and uninteresting subject and that writer who might have secured perpetuity to his name by a history of his own country has exposed

this passion in fitzosbornes letters  but i must content myself with barely referring my reader to that amiable moralist as i fear i have already extended these notes to such a length as will expose me to the severity of criticism i shall close them with a list of modern treatises on the composition of history  the earliest work of this kind which has fallen under my observation is the methodus ad facilem historiarum cognitionem published at paris in      by jean bodin a lawyer of eminence from whom montesquieu is supposed to have borrowed his fanciful and fallacious system on the influence of climate  italy the parent of many great historians produced also about the same period an elegant latin dissertation de scribenda historia the author john antony viperani was bishop of giovenazzo in      and died    0  a spanish essay on the same subject was printed in      by luis cabrera de cordoa but his performance has been eclipsed by the ater production of his celebrated countryman feyjoo whose entertaining essays on history were translated into english in       holland produced in      the ars historica of vossius and soon afterward his more voluminous and valuable work on the greek and roman historians  the french language so fertile in miscellaneous criticism affords us many works that relate to historical composition the most extraordinary of these is a very late publication by the abbe mably de la maniere decrire l histoire as this insolent and dogmatical author has grossly insulted our country by vilifying our most eminent writers of history i had thoughts of chastising his presumption by a full display of his various absurdities but as this unpleasant office has been in some measure performed by one of his own countrymen under the title of a supplement to his work i shall only make a few remarks on the illiberal terms in which he speaks of my friend mr gibbon  as the abbe had only read a translated extract from the accomplished historian he certainly could not be a competent judge of the spirit and beauty of his immortal work no matter he had a private pique against the author and was therefore determined to decry his composition in the blindness and precipitancy that usually belong to base anger he attributes the defect of dullness to a book more universally read than any modern performance of equal magnitude  the abbe talks loudly of the literary virtues that become an historian but he seems to have forgot that there are literary vices which may render even a learned and ingenious critic contemptible no productions of the press are more disgraceful to literature than those in which a dissertation on any art is made the vehicle of personal malignity yet as this is the most plausible and insinuating method of giving vent to malice it is perhaps the most common in the end however this species of literary slander defeats its own purpose for if the envious are pleased to echo it for a time to more candid and generous readers it endears the merit it traduces they lament the hard destiny of superior talents and recollect with a sigh of affectionate indignation the just and spirited remark of monsieur d alembert que les grands genies sont toujours de chires par des gens qui ne sont pas dignes de les lire  end of the second volume
