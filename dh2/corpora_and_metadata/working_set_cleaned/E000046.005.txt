correspondence     –         thomas jefferson jan         monsieur de meusnier answers to questions propounded by m de meusnier  j mss jan           on the original establishment of the several states the civil code of england from whence they had emigrated was adopted this of course could extend only to general laws and not to those which were particular to certain places in england only the circumstances of the new states oblige them to add some new laws which their special situation required and even to change some of the general laws of england in cases which did not suit their circumstances or ways of thinking the law of descents for instance was changed in several states on the late revolution the changes which their new form of government rendered necessary were easily made it was only necessary to say that the powers of legislation the judiciary  the executive powers heretofore exercised by persons of such and   such descriptions shall henceforth be exercised by persons to be appointed in such and such manners this was what their constitutions did virginia thought it might be necessary to examine the whole code of law to reform such parts of it as had been calculated to produce a devotion to monarchy and to reduce into smaller volumes such useful parts as had become too diffuse a committee was appointed to execute this work they did it and the assembly began in octob      the examination of it in order to change such parts of the report as might not meet with their approbation and to establish what they should approve we may expect to hear the result of their deliberations about the last of february next i have heard that connecticut undertook a like work but i am not sure of this nor do i know whether any other of the states have or have not done the same   the constitution of new hampshire established in      having been expressly made to continue only during the contest with great britain they proceeded after the close of that to form and establish a permanent one which they did the convention of virginia which organized their new government had been chosen before a separation from gr britain had been thought of in their state they had therefore none but the ordinary powers of legislation this leaves their act for organizing the government subject to be altered by every legislative assembly and tho no general change in it has been made yet its effect has been controulled   in several special cases it is therefore thought that that state will appoint a convention for the special purpose of forming a stable constitution i think no change has been made in any other of the states   the following is a rough estimate of the particular debts of some of the states as they existed in the year       dollars new hampshire     00000 rhode island      0000 massachusetts  000000 connecticut     0  ⅔ virginia   00000    united states principal of foreign debt nearly    000000 the principal of the domestic debt is somewhere between   ½ millions    ½ millions call it therefore      00000    ——————     00000 the other states not named here are probably indebted in the same proportion to their abilities if so  we estimate their abilities by the rule of quotaing them those   states will owe about    millions  consequently the particular debts of all the states will amount to    or    millions of dollars   a particular answer to this question would lead to very minute details one general idea however may be applied to all the states each having their separate debt and a determinate proportion of the federal debt they endeavour to lay taxes sufficient to pay the interest of both of these and to support their own  the federal government these taxes are generally about one or one  a half per cent on the value of property  from  ½ to     per cent on foreign merchandise imported but the paiment of this interest regularly is not accomplished in many of the states the people are as yet not recovered from the depredations of the war when that ended their houses were in ruin their farms waste themselves distressed for clothing and necessaries for their household they cannot as yet therefore bear heavy taxes for the paiment of the principal no final measures are yet taken some states will have land for sale the produce of which may pay the principal debt some will endeavor to have an exceeding of their taxes to be applied as a sinking fund and all of them look forward to the increase of population  of course an increase of productiveness in their present taxes to enable them to be sinking their debt this is a general view some of the states have not yet made even just efforts for satisfying either the principal or interest of their public debt   by the close of the year      there had probably passed over about  0000 emigrants most of these were irish the greatest number of the residue were germans philadelphia receives most of them and next to that baltimore  new york   nothing is decided as to vermont the four northernmost states wish it to be received into the union the middle  southern states are rather opposed to it but the great difficulty arises with new york which claims that territory in the beginning every individual of that state revolted at the idea of giving them up congress therefore only interfered from time to time to prevent the   two parties from coming to an open rupture in the meanwhile the minds of the new yorkers have been familiarizing to the idea of a separation  i think it will not be long before they will consent to it in that case the southern  middle states will doubtless acquiesce and vermont will be received into the union lemaine a part of the government of massachusetts but detached from it the state of n hampshire lying between begins to desire to be separated they are very weak in numbers as yet but whenever they shall obtain a certain degree of population there are circumstances which render it highly probable they will be allowed to become a separate member of the union   it is believed that the state of virginia has by this time made a second cession of lands to congress comprehending all those between the meridian of the mouth of the great kanhaway the ohio mississippi  carolina boundary within this lies kentucky i believe that their numbers are sufficient already to entitle them to come into congress and that their reception there will only incur the delay necessary for taking the consent of the several assemblies there is no other new state as yet approaching the time of its reception  0 the number of royalists which left new york south carolina  georgia when they were evacuated by the british army was considerable but i am absolutely unable to conjecture their numbers from all the other states i suppose perhaps two thousand may have gone      the confederation is a wonderfully perfect instrument considering the circumstances under which it was formed there are however some alterations which experience proves to be wanting these are principally three   to establish a general rule for the admission of new states into the union by the confederation no new state except canada can be permitted to have a vote in congress without first obtaining the consent of all the thirteen legislatures it becomes necessary to agree what districts may be established into separate states and at what period of their population they may come into congress the act of congress of april         has pointed out what ought to be agreed on to say also what number of votes must concur when the number of voters shall be thus enlarged   the confederation in its eighth article decides that the quota of money to be contributed by the several states shall be proportioned to the value of landed property in the state experience has shown it impracticable to come at this value congress have therefore recommended to the states to agree that their quotas shall be in proportion to the number of their inhabitants counting   slaves however but as equal to   free inhabitants i believe all the states have agreed to this alteration except rhode island   the confederation forbids the states individually to enter into treaties of commerce or of any other nature with foreign nations and it authorizes congress to establish such treaties with two reservations however viz that they shall agree to no treaty which would   restrain the   legislatures from imposing such duties on foreigners as natives are subjected to or   from prohibiting the exportation or importation of any species of commodities congress may therefore be said to have a power to regulate commerce so far as it can be effected by conventions with other nations  by conventions which do not infringe the two fundamental reservations before mentioned but this is too imperfect because till a convention be made with any particular nation the commerce of any one of our states with that nation may be regulated by the state itself and even when a convention is made the regulation of the commerce is taken out of the hands of the several states only so far as it is covered or provided for by that convention or treaty but treaties are made in such general terms that the greater part of the regulations would still result to the legislatures let us illustrate these observations by observing how far the commerce of france  of england can be affected by the state legislatures as to england any one of the legislatures may impose on her goods double the duties which are paid other nations may prohibit their goods altogether may refuse them the usual facilities for recovering their debts or withdrawing their property may refuse to receive their consuls or to give those consuls any jurisdiction but with france whose commerce is protected by a treaty no state can give any molestation to that commerce which is defended by the treaty thus tho a state may exclude the importation of all wines because one of the reservations aforesaid is that  0 they may prohibit the importation of any species of commodities yet they cannot prohibit the importation of french wines particularly while they allow wines to be brought in from other countries they cannot impose heavier duties on french commodities than on those of other nations they cannot throw peculiar obstacles in the way of their recovery of debts due them c c because those things are provided for by treaty treaties however are very imperfect machines for regulating commerce in the detail the principal objects in the regulation of our commerce would be   to lay such duties restrictions or prohibitions on the goods of any particular nation as might oblige that nation to concur in just  equal arrangements of commerce   to lay such uniform duties on the articles of commerce throughout all the states as may avail them of that fund for assisting to bear the burthen of public expenses now this cannot be done by the states separately because they will not separately pursue the same plan new hampshire cannot lay a given duty on a particular article unless massachusetts will do the same because it will turn the importation of that article from her ports into those of massachusetts from whence they will be smuggled into new hampshire by land but tho massachusetts were willing to concur with n hampshire in laying the same duty yet she cannot do it for the same reason unless rhode island will also nor can rhode island without connecticut nor connecticut without n york nor n york without n jersey  so on quite to georgia it is visible    therefore that the commerce of the states cannot be regulated to the best advantage but by a single body and no body so proper as congress many of the states have agreed to add an article to the confederation for allowing to congress the regulation of their commerce only providing that the revenues to be raised on it shall belong to the state in which they are levied yet it is believed that rhode island will prevent this also an everlasting recurrence to this same obstacle will occasion a question to be asked how happens it that rhode island is opposed to every useful proposition her geography accounts for it with the aid of one or two observations the cultivators of the earth are the most virtuous citizens and possess most of the amor patriæ merchants are the least virtuous and possess the least of the amor patriæ the latter reside principally in the seaport towns the former in the interior country now it happened that of the territory constituting rhode island  connecticut the part containing the seaports was erected into a state by itself  called rhode island  that containing the interior country was erected into another state called connecticut for tho it has a little seacoast there are no good ports in it hence it happens that there is scarcely one merchant in the whole state of connecticut while there is not a single man in rhode island who is not a merchant of some sort their whole territory is but a thousand square miles and what of that is in use is laid out in grass farms almost entirely hence they have scarcely any body employed in agriculture all    exercise some species of commerce this circumstance has decided the characters of these two states the remedies to this evil are hazardous one would be to consolidate the two states into one another would be to banish rhode island from the union a third to compel her submission to the will of the other twelve a fourth for the other twelve to govern themselves according to the new propositions and to let rhode island go on by herself according to the antient articles but the dangers  difficulties attending all these remedies are obvious these are the only alterations proposed to the confederation and the last of them is the only additional power which congress is thought to need    congress have not yet ultimately decided at what rates they will redeem the paper money in the hands of the holders but a resolution of      has established the principal so that there can be little doubt but that the holders of paper money shall receive as much real money as the paper was actually worth at the time they received it and an interest of   per cent from the time they received it its worth will be found in the depreciation table of the state wherein it was received these depreciation tables having been formed according to the market prices of the paper money at different epochs    those who talk of the bankruptcy of the u s are of two descriptions   strangers who do not understand the nature  history of our paper money   holders of that papermoney who do not wish that the world should understand it thus when    in march    0 the paper money being so far depreciated that  0 dollars of it would purchase only   silver dollar congress endeavored to arrest the progress of that depreciation by declaring they would emit no more and would redeem what was in circulation at the rate of one dollar of silver for  0 of paper this was called by the brokers in paper money a bankruptcy yet these very people had only given one dollars worth of provisions of manufactures or perhaps of silver for their forty dollars  were displeased that they could not in a moment multiply their silver into  0 if it were decided that the u s should pay a silver dollar for every paper dollar they emitted i am of opinion conjecturing from loose data of my memory only as to the amount  true worth of the sums emitted by congress and by the several states that a debt which in its just amount is not more perhaps than   millions of dollars would amount up to  00 millions and instead of assessing every inhabitant with a debt of about   dollars would fix on him thirty guineas which is considerably more than the national debt of england affixes on each of its inhabitants and would make a bankruptcy where there is none the real just debts of the u s which were stated under the  d query will be easily paid by the sale of their lands which were ceded on the fundamental condition of being applied as a sinking fund for this purpose    la canne à sucre est un erreur du traducteur de m filson le mot anglois cane vent dire arundo en latin et roseau ou canne en françois    le traducteur en a fait la canne du sucre probablement que le caffier est une erreur semblable    the whole army of the united states was disbanded at the close of the war a few guards only were engaged for their magazines lately they have enlisted some two or three regiments to garrison the posts along the northern boundary of the u s       the u s do not own at present a single vessel of war nor has congress entered into any resolution on that subject    i conjecture there are   0000 negroes in the five southernmost states and not  0000 in the rest in most of these latter effectual measures have been taken for their future emancipation in the former nothing is done towards that the disposition to emancipate them is strongest in virginia those who desire it form as yet the minority of the whole state but it bears a respectable proportion to the whole in numbers  weight of character  it is continually recruiting by the addition of nearly the whole of the young men as fast as they come into public life i flatter myself it will take place there at some period of time not very distant in maryland  n carolina a very few are disposed to emancipate in s carolina  georgia not the smallest symptoms of it but on the contrary these two states  n carolina continue importations of negroes these have been long prohibited in all the other states    in virginia where a great proportion of the legislature consider the constitution but as other acts of legislation laws have been frequently passed    which controulled its effects i have not heard that in the other states they have ever infringed their constitution  i suppose they have not done it as the judges would consider any law as void which was contrary to the constitution pennsylvania is divided into two parties very nearly equal the one desiring to change the constitution the other opposing a change in virginia there is a part of the state which considers the act for organizing their government as a constitution  are content to let it remain there is another part which considers it only as an ordinary act of the legislature who therefore wish to form a real constitution amending some defects which have been observed in the acts now in force most of the young people as they come into office arrange themselves on this side and i think they will prevail ere long but there are no heats on this account i do not know that any of the other states propose to change their constitution  0 i have heard of no malversations in office which have been of any consequence unless we consider as such some factious transactions in the pennsylvania assembly or some acts of the virginia assembly which have been contrary to their constitution the causes of these were explained in the preceding article    broils among the states may happen in the following way   a state may be embroiled with the other twelve by not complying with the lawful requisitions of congress   two states may differ about their boundaries but the method of settling these is fixed by the confederation and most of the    states which have any differences of this kind are submitting them to this mode of determination and there is no danger of opposition to the decree by any state the individuals interested may complain but this can produce no difficulty   other contestations may arise between two states such as pecuniary demands affrays among their citizens  whatever else may arise between any two nations with respect to these there are two opinions one that they are to be decided according to the  th article of the confederation which says that congress shall be the last resort in all differences between two or more states concerning boundary jurisdiction or any other cause whatever and prescribes the mode of decision and the weight of reason is undoubtedly in favor of this opinion yet there are some who question it it has been often said that the decisions of congress are impotent because the confederation provides no compulsory power but when two or more nations enter into compact it is not usual for them to say what shall be done to the party who infringes it decency forbids this and it is unnecessary as indecent because the right of compulsion naturally results to the party injured by the breach when any one state in the american union refuses obedience to the confederation by which they have bound themselves the rest have a natural right to compel them to obedience congress would probably exercise long patience before they would recur to force but if the case ultimately required it they would use that recurrence should this case ever arise    they will probably coerce by a naval force as being more easy less dangerous to liberty  less likely to produce much bloodshed it has been said too that our governments both federal and particular want energy that it is difficult to restrain both individuals  states from committing wrong this is true  it is an inconvenience on the other hand that energy which absolute governments derive from an armed force which is the effect of the bayonet constantly held at the breast of every citizen and which resembles very much the stillness of the grave must be admitted also to have its inconveniences we weigh the two together and like best to submit to the former compare the number of wrongs committed with impunity by citizens among us with those committed by the sovereign in other countries and the last will be found most numerous most oppressive on the mind and most degrading of the dignity of man    the states differed very much in their proceedings as to british property and i am unable to give the details in virginia the sums sequestered in the treasury remain precisely as they did at the conclusion of the peace the british having refused to make satisfaction for the slaves they carried away contrary to the treaty of peace and to deliver up the posts within our limits the execution of that treaty is in some degree suspended individuals however are paying off their debts to british subjects and the laws even permit the latter to recover them judicially but as the amount of    these debts are  0 or  0 times the amount of all the money in circulation in that state the same laws permit the debtor to pay his debts in seven equal  annual payments thomas jefferson monsieur de meusnier additional questions of m de meusnier and answers j mss   what has led congress to determine that the concurrence of seven votes is requisite in questions which by the confederation are submitted to the decision of a majority of the u s in congress assembled the ixth article of confederation §   evidently establishes three orders of questions in congress   the greater ones which relate to making peace or war alliances coinage requisitions for money raising military force or appointing its commanderinchief   the lesser ones which comprehend all other matters submitted by the confederation to the federal head   the single question of adjourning from day to day this graduation of questions is distinctly characterized by the article in proportion to the magnitude of these questions a greater concurrence of the voices composing the union was thought necessary three degrees of concurrence well distinguished by substantial circumstances offered themselves to notice   a concurrence of a majority of the people of the union it was thought that this would be ensured by requiring the voices of nine states because according to the loose estimates which had been made of the inhabitants  the proportion of them which were free it was believed that even the nine smallest    would include a majority of the free citizens of the union the voices therefore of nine states were required in the greater questions   a concurrence of the majority of the states seven constitute that majority this number therefore was required in the lesser questions   a concurrence of the majority of congress that is to say of the states actually present in it as there is no congress when there are not seven states present this concurrence could never be of less than four states but these might happen to be the four smallest which would not include one ninth part of the free citizens of the union this kind of majority therefore was intrusted with nothing but the power of adjourning themselves from day to day here then are three kind of majorities   of the people   of the states   of the congress each of which is entrusted to a certain length tho the paragraph in question be clumsily expressed yet it strictly ennounces its own intentions it defines with precision the greater questions for which nine votes shall be requisite to the lesser questions it then requires a majority of the u s in congress assembled a term indeed which will apply either to the number seven as being a majority of the states or to the number four as being a majority of congress which of the two kinds of majority was meant clearly that which would leave a still smaller kind for the decision of the question of adjournment the contrary would be absurd this paragraph therefore should be understood as if it had been expressed in the following terms  0 the united states in congress assembled shall never engage in war c but with the consent of nine states nor determine any other question but with the consent of a majority of the whole states except the question of adjournment from day to day which may be determined by a majority of the states actually present in congress   how far is it permitted to bring on the reconsideration of a question which congress has once determined the first congress which met being composed mostly of persons who had been members of the legislatures of their respective states it was natural for them to adopt those rules in their proceedings to which they had been accustomed in their legislative houses and the more so as these happened to be nearly the same as having been copied from the same original the british parliament one of those rules of proceeding was that a question once determined cannot be proposed a second time in the same session congress during their first session in the autumn of      observed this rule strictly but before their meeting in the spring of the following year the war had broke out they found themselves at the head of that war in an executive as well as legislative capacity they found that a rule wise and necessary for a legislative body did not suit an executive one which being governed by events must change their purposes as those change besides their session was likely then to become of equal duration with the war and a rule which should render their legislation immutable during    all that period could not be submitted to they therefore renounced it in practice and have ever since continued to reconsider their questions freely the only restraint as yet provided against the abuse of this permission to reconsider is that when a question has been decided it cannot be proposed for reconsideration but by some one who voted in favor of the former decision  declares that he has since changed his opinion i do not recollect accurately enough whether it be necessary that his vote should have decided that of his state and the vote of his state have decided that of congress perhaps it might have been better when they were forming the federal constitution to have assimilated it as much as possible to the particular constitutions of the states all of these have distributed the legislative executive  judiciary powers into different departments in the federal constitution the judiciary powers are separated from the others but the legislative and executive are both exercised by congress a means of amending this defect has been thought of congress having a power to establish what committees of their own body they please and to arrange among them the distribution of their business they might on the first day of their annual meeting appoint an executive committee consisting of a member from each state and refer to them all executive business which should occur during their session confining themselves to what is of a legislative nature that is to say to the heads described in the  th article as of the competence of   states only and to such other questions as should lead to    the establishment of general rules the journal of this committee of the preceding day might be read the next morning in congress  considered as approved unless a vote was demanded on a particular article  that article changed the sessions of congress would then be short  when they separated the confederation authorizes the appointment of a committee of the states which would naturally succeed to the business of the executive committee the legislative business would be better done because the attention of the members would not be interrupted by the details of execution and the executive business would be better done because business of this nature is better adapted to small than great bodies a monarchical head should confide the execution of its will to departments consisting each of a plurality of hands who would warp that will as much as possible towards wisdom  moderation the two qualities it generally wants but a republican head founding its decrees originally in these two qualities should commit them to a single hand for execution giving them thereby a promptitude which republican proceedings generally want congress could not indeed confide their executive business to a smaller number than a committee consisting of a member from each state this is necessary to ensure the confidence of the union but it would be gaining a great deal to reduce the executive head to thirteen and to debarrass themselves of those details this however has as yet been the subject of private conversations only   calculating the federal debts by the interest    they pay their principal would be much more than is stated under the  d of the former queries the reason for this is that there is a part of the money put into the loan office which was borrowed under a special contract that whatever depreciation might take place on the principal the interest should be paid in hard money on the nominal amount congress only reserving to itself the right whenever they should pay off the principal to pay it according to its true value without regard to its nominal one the amount of this part of the debt is      00 dollars from the best documents in my possession i estimate the capital of the federal debt as follows   dollars spanish loan           ♯  farmers general of france

estimate supposed    000000    ——————                 whole debt foreign and domestic             the result as to the foreign debt is considerably more than in the estimate i made before that was taken on the state of the dutch loans as known to congress in      the new estimate of      however lately come to hand shews those loans to be completed up to   millions of florins which is much more than their amount in the preceding statements the domestic debt too is made somewhat higher than in the preceding answer to the  d query i had in that taken the statement of      for my basis and had endeavored to correct that by the subsequent liquidation of            on considering more maturely those means of correction i apprehend they will be more likely to lead to error and that upon the whole the statement of      is the surest we can have recourse to i have therefore adopted it literally   a succinct account of paper money previous to the late revolution most of the states were in the habit whenever they had occasion for more money than could be raised immediately by taxes to issue paper notes or bills in the name of the state wherein they promised to pay the bearer the sum named in the note or bill in some of the states no time of paiment was fixed nor tax laid to enable paiment in these the bills depreciated but others of the states named in the bill the day when it should be paid laid taxes to bring in money enough for that purpose  paid the bills punctually on or before the day named in these states paper money was in as high estimation as gold  silver on the    commencement of the late revolution congress had no money the external commerce of the states being suppressed the farmer could not sell his produce  of course could not pay a tax congress had no resource then but in paper money not being able to lay a tax for its redemption they could only promise that taxes should be laid for that purpose so as to redeem the bills by a certain day they did not foresee the long continuance of the war the almost total suppression of their exports and other events which rendered the performance of their engagement impossible the paper money continued for a twelvemonth equal to gold  silver but the quantities which they were obliged to emit for the purpose of the war exceeded what had been the usual quantity of the circulating medium it began therefore to become cheaper or as we expressed it it depreciated as gold  silver would have done had they been thrown into circulation in equal quantities but not having like them an intrinsic value its depreciation was more rapid  greater than could ever have happened with them in two years it had fallen to two dollars of paper for one of silver in three years to   for   in   months more it fell to  0 for   and in the six months following that is to say by sep      it had fallen to  0 for   congress alarmed at the consequences which were to be apprehended should they lose this resource altogether thought it necessary to make a vigorous effort to stop its further depreciation they therefore determined in the first place that their emissions should not exceed     00 millions of dollars to which term they were then nearly arrived and tho they knew that twenty dollars of what they were then issuing would buy no more for their army than one silver dollar would buy yet they thought it would be worth while to submit to the sacrifice of    out of  0 dollars if they could thereby stop further depreciation they therefore published an address to their constituents in which they renewed their original declarations that this paper money should be redeemed at dollar for dollar they proved the ability of the states to do this and that their liberty would be cheaply bought at that price the declaration was ineffectual no man received the money at a better rate on the contrary in   months more that is by march    0 it had fallen to  0 for   congress then tried an experiment of a different kind considering their former offers to redeem this money at par as relinquished by the general refusal to take it but in progressive depreciation they required the whole to be brought in declared it should be redeemed at its present value of  0 for   and that they would give to the holders new bills reduced in their denomination to the sum of gold or silver which was actually to be paid for them this would reduce the nominal sum of the mass in circulation to the present worth of that mass which was   millions a sum not too great for the circulation of the states and which they therefore hoped would not depreciate further as they continued firm in their purpose of emitting no more this effort was as unavailing as the former very little of the money was    brought in it continued to circulate  to depreciate till the end of    0 when it had fallen to    for one and the money circulated from the french army being by that time sensible in all the states north of the patowmac the paper ceased its circulation altogether in those states in virginia  n carolina it continued a year longer within which time it fell to  000 for   and then expired as it had done in the other states without a single groan not a murmur was heard on this occasion among the people on the contrary universal congratulations took place on their seeing this gigantic mass whose dissolution had threatened convulsions which should shake their infant confederacy to its centre quietly interred in its grave foreigners indeed who do not like the natives feel indulgence for its memory as of a being which has vindicated their liberties and fallen in the moment of victory have been loud  still are loud a few of them have reason but the most noisy are not the best of them they are persons who have become bankrupt by unskilful attempts at commerce with america that they may have some pretext to offer to their creditors they have bought up great masses of this dead money in america where it is to be had at  000 for    they show the certificates of their paper possessions as if they had all died in their hands and had been the cause of their bankruptcy justice will be done to all by paying to all persons what this money actually cost them with an interest of   per cent from the time they received it if difficulties present themselves in the ascertaining    the epoch of the receipt it has been thought better that the state should lose by admitting easy proofs than that individuals  especially foreigners should by being held to such as would be difficult perhaps impossible   virginia certainly owed two millions sterling to great britain at the conclusion of the war some have conjectured the debt as high as three millions i think that state owed near as much as all the rest put together this is to be ascribed to peculiarities in the tobacco trade the advantages made by the british merchants on the tobaccos consigned to them were so enormous that they spared no means of increasing those consignments a powerful engine for this purpose was the giving good prices  credit to the planter till they got him more immersed in debt than he could pay without selling his lands or slaves they then reduced the prices given for his tobacco so that let his shipments be ever so great and his demand of necessaries ever so economical they never permitted him to clear off his debt these debts had become hereditary from father to son for many generations so that the planters were a species of property annexed to certain mercantile houses in london   the members of congress are differently paid by different states some are on fixed allowances from   to   dollars a day others have their expenses paid  a surplus for their time this surplus is of two three or four dollars a day   i do not believe there has ever been a moment when a single whig in any one state would not have    shuddered at the very idea of a separation of their state from the confederacy the tories would at all times have been glad to see the confederacy dissolved even by particles at a time in hopes of their attaching themselves again to great britain   the   th article of confederation admits canada to accede to the confederation at its own will but adds that no other colony shall be admitted to the same unless such admission be agreed to by nine states when the plan of april      for establishing new states was on the carpet the committee who framed the report of that plan had inserted this clause provided nine states agree to such admission according to the reservation of the   th of the articles of confederation it was objected   that the words of the confederation no other colony could only refer to the residuary possessions of gr britain as the two floridas nova scotia c not being already parts of the union that the law for admitting a new member into the union could not be applied to a territory which was already in the union as making part of a state which was a member of it   that it would be improper to allow nine states to receive a new member because the same reasons which rendered that number proper now would render a greater one proper when the number composing the union should be increased they therefore struck out this paragraph and inserted a proviso that the consent of so many states in congress shall be first obtained as may at the time be competent thus leaving the question whether the   th article applies  0 to the admission of new states to be decided when that admission shall be asked see the journ of congress of apr  0      another doubt was started in this debate viz whether the agreement of the nine states required by the confederation was to be made by their legislatures or by their delegates in congress the expression adopted viz so many states in congress is first obtained shew what was their sense in this matter if it be agreed that the   th article of the confederation is not to be applied to the admission of these new states then it is contended that their admission comes within the   th article which forbids any alteration unless agreed to in a congress of the u s and afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every state the independence of the new states of kentucké and frankland will soon bring on the ultimate decision of all these questions   particular instances whereby the general assembly of virginia have shewn that they considered the ordinance called their constitution as every other ordinance or act of the legislature subject to be altered by the legislature for the time being the convention which formed that constitution declared themselves to be the house of delegates during the term for which they were originally elected and in the autumn of the year met the senate elected under the new constitution  did legislative business with them at this time there were malefactors in the public jail and there was as yet no court established for their trial they passed a law appointing certain members by name    who were then members of the executive council to be a court for the trial of these malefactors tho the constitution had said in its first clause that no person should exercise the powers of more than one of the three departments legislative executive  judiciary at the same time this proves that the very men who had made that constitution understood that it would be alterable by the general assembly this court was only for that occasion when the next general assembly met after the election of the ensuing year there was a new set of malefactors in the jail  no court to try them this assembly passed a similar law to the former appointing certain members of the executive council to be an occasional court for this particular case not having the journals of assembly by me i am unable to say whether this measure was repealed afterwards however they are instances of executive  judiciary powers exercised by the same persons under the authority of a law made in contradiction to the constitution   there was a process depending in the ordinary courts of justice between two individuals of the name of robinson  fauntleroy who were relations of different descriptions to one robinson a british subject lately dead each party claimed a right to inherit the lands of the decedent according to the laws their right should by the constitution have been decided by the judiciary courts and it was actually depending before them one of the parties petitioned the assembly i think it was in the year      who passed a law deciding the right in his favor in the    following year a frenchman master of a vessel entered into port without complying with the laws established in such cases whereby he incurred the forfeitures of the law to any person who would sue for them an individual instituted a legal process to recover these forfeitures according to the law of the land the frenchman petitioned the assembly who passed a law deciding the question of forfeiture in his favor these acts are occasional repeals of that part of the constitution which forbids the same person to exercise legislative  judiciary powers at the same time   the assembly is in the habitual exercise during their sessions of directing the executive what to do there are few pages of their journals which do not show proofs of this  consequently instances of the legislative  executive powers exercised by the same persons at the same time these things prove that it has been the uninterrupted opinion of every assembly from that which passed the ordinance called the constitution down to the present day that their acts may controul that ordinance  of course that the state of virginia has no fixed constitution at all thomas jefferson june         m meusnier observations on the article étatsunis prepared for the encyclopédie  j mss june           ii       pa   the malefactors sent to america were not sufficient in number to merit    enumeration as one class out of three which peopled america it was at a late period of their history that this practice began i have no book by me which enables me to point out the date of its commencement but i do not think the whole number sent would amount to  000  being principally men eaten up with disease they married seldom  propagated little i do not suppose that themselves  their descendants are at present  000 which is little more than one thousandth part of the whole inhabitants indented servants formed a considerable supply these were poor europeans who went to america to settle themselves if they could pay their passage it was well if not they must find means of paying it they were at liberty therefore to make an agreement with any person they chose to serve him such a length of time as they agreed on on condition that he would repay to the master of the vessel the expenses of their passage if being foreigners unable to speak the language they did not know how to make a bargain for themselves the captain of the vessel contracted for them with such persons as he could this contract was by deed indented which occasioned them to be called indented servants sometimes they were called redemptioners because by their agreement with the master of the vessel they could redeem themselves from his power by paying their passage which they frequently    effected by hiring themselves on their arrival as is before mentioned in some states i know that these people had a right of marrying themselves without their masters leave  i did suppose they had that right everywhere i did not know that in any of the states they demanded so much as a week for every days absence without leave i suspect this must have been at a very early period while the governments were in the hands of the first emigrants who being mostly labourers were narrowminded and severe i know that in virginia the laws allowed their servitude to be protracted only two days for every one they were absent without leave so mild was this kind of servitude that it was very frequent for foreigners who carried to america money enough not only to pay their passage but to buy themselves a farm it was common i say for them to indent themselves to a master for three years for a certain sum of money with a view to learn the husbandry of the country i will here make a general observation so desirous are the poor of europe to get to america where they may better their condition that being unable to pay their passage they will agree to serve two or three years on their arrival there rather than not go during the time of that service they are better fed better clothed and have lighter labour than while in europe continuing to work for hire a few years longer they buy a farm marry and enjoy all the sweets of a domestic society of their own the american governments are censured for permitting this species of servitude which lays the    foundation of the happiness of these people but what should these governments do pay the passage of all those who chuse to go into their country they are not able nor were they able do they think the purchase worth the price should they exclude these people from their shores those who know their situations in europe  america would not say that this is the alternative which humanity dictates it is said that these people are deceived by those who carry them over but this is done in europe how can the american governments prevent it should they punish the deceiver it seems more incumbent on the european government where the act is done and where a public injury is sustained from it however it is only in europe that this deception is heard of the individuals are generally satisfied in america with their adventure and very few of them wish not to have made it i must add that the congress have nothing to do with this matter it belongs to the legislatures of the several states p     une puissance en effet devoit statuer en dernier resort sur les relations que pouvoient suvire ou servir au sien general c the account of the settlement of the colonies which precedes this paragraph shows that that settlement was not made by public authority or at the public expence of england but by the exertions  at the expence of individuals hence it happened that their constitutions were not formed systematically but according    to the circumstances which happened to exist in each hence too the principles of the political connection between the old  new countries were never settled that it would have been advantageous to have settled them is certain and particularly to have provided a body which should decide in the last resort all cases wherein both parties were interested but it is not certain that that right would have been given or ought to have been given to the parliament much less that it resulted to the parliament without having been given to it expressly why was it necessary that there should have been a body to decide in the last resort because it would have been for the good of both parties but this reason shews it ought not to have been the parliament because that would have exercised it for the good of one party only page  0  as to the change of the  th article

of them every one thro whose hands a bill passed lost on that bill what it lost in value during the time it was in his hands this was a real tax on him  in this way the people of the united states

accordingly made but in      they did not propose to make any purchase the money desired in       000 dollars was probably to pay agents residing among the indians or balances of the purchase of      these purchases will not be made every year but only at distant intervals as our settlements are extended and it may be taken for a certainty that not a foot of land will ever be taken from the indians without their own consent the sacredness of their right is felt by all thinking persons in america as much as in europe pa   0 virginia was quotaed the highest of any state in the union but during the war several states appear to have paid more because they were free from the enemy whilst virginia was cruelly ravaged the requisition of      was so quotaed on the several states as to bring up their arrearages so that when they should have paid the sums then demanded all would be on equal footing it is necessary to give a further explanation of this requisition the requisitions of   00000 dollars of   millions    millions had been made during the war as an experiment to see whether in that situation the states could furnish the necessary supplies it was found they could not the money was thereupon obtained by loans in europe  congress meant by their requisition of      to abandon the requisitions of   00000  of   millions and also one half of the   millions but as all the states    almost had made some paiments in part of that requisition they were obliged to retain such a proportion of it as would enable them to call for equal contributions from all the others pa   0

sacredness of their debts in their just  real amount who are able within a reasonable time to pay them  who are actually proceeding in that paiment that they furnish actually the supplies necessary

impetuous passions ib l    malaisé d indiquer la nuance precise c in forming a scale of crimes  punishments two considerations have principal weight   the atrocity of the crime   the peculiar circumstances of a country which furnish greater temptations to commit it or greater facilities for escaping detection the punishment must be heavier to counterbalance this was the first the only consideration all nations would form the same scale but as the circumstances of a country have influence on the punishment and no two countries exist precisely under the same circumstances no two countries will form the same scale of crimes  punishments for example in america the inhabitants let their horses go at large in the uninclosed lands which are so extensive as to maintain them altogether it is easy therefore to steal them  easy to escape therefore the laws are obliged to oppose these temptations with a heavier degree of punishment for this reason the stealing of a horse in america is punished more severely than stealing the    same value in any other form in europe where horses are confined so securely that it is impossible to steal them that species of theft need not be punished more severely than any other in some countries of europe stealing fruit from trees is punished capitally the reason is that it being impossible to lock fruit trees up in coffers as we do our money it is impossible to oppose physical bars to this species of theft moral ones are therefore opposed by the laws this to an unreflecting american appears the most enormous of all the abuses of power because he has been used to see fruits hanging in such quantities that if not taken by men they would rot he has been used to consider it therefore of no value as not furnishing materials for the commission of a crime this must serve as an apology for the arrangements of crimes  punishments in the scale under our consideration a different one would be formed here  still different ones in

hazard alone could therefore give them but rare  partial occasions of seeing each other they were of course to abandon altogether the hope of ever meeting again or to devise some occasion which might bring them together and why not come together on purpose at stated times would not the trouble of such a journey be greatly overpaid by the pleasure of seeing each other again by the sweetest of all consolations the talking over the scenes of difficulty  of endearment they had gone through this too would enable them to know who of them should succeed in the world who should be unsuccessful and to open the purses of all to every labouring brother this idea was too soothing not to be cherished in conversation it was improved into that of a regular association with an organized administration with periodical meetings general  particular fixed contributions for those who should be in distress  a badge by    which not only those who had not had occasion to become personally known should be able to recognize one another but which should be worn by their descendants to perpetuate among them the friendships which had bound their ancestors together genl washington was at that moment oppressed with the operation of disbanding an army which was not paid and the difficulty of this operation was increased by some two or three of the states having expressed sentiments which did not indicate a sufficient attention to their paiment he was sometimes present when his officers were fashioning in their conversations their newly proposed society he saw the innocence of its origin  foresaw no effects less innocent he was at that time writing his valedictory letter to the states which has been so deservedly applauded by the world far from thinking it a moment to multiply the causes of irritation by thwarting a proposition which had absolutely no other basis but of benevolence  friendship he was rather satisfied to find himself aided in his difficulties by this new incident which occupied  at the time soothed the minds of the officers he thought too that this institution would be one instrument the more for strengthening the federal bond  for promoting federal ideas the institution was formed they incorporated into it the officers of the french army  navy by whose sides they had fought and with whose aid they had finally prevailed extending it to such grades as they were told might be permitted to enter into it they sent an officer to france to make the proposition to them     to procure the badges which they had devised for their order the moment of disbanding the army having come on before they could have a full meeting to appoint their president the general was prayed to act in that office till their first general meeting which was to be held at philadelphia in the month of may following the laws of the society were published men who read them in their closets unwarmed by those sentiments of friendship which had produced them inattentive to those pains which an approaching separation had excited in the minds of the institutors politicians who see in everything only the dangers with which it threatens civil society in fine the labouring people who shielded by equal laws had never seen any difference between man and man but had read of terrible oppressions which people of their description experience in other countries from those who are distinguished by titles  badges began to be alarmed at this new institution a remarkable silence however was observed their sollicitudes were long confined within the circles of private conversation at length however a mr burke chief justice of south carolina broke that silence he wrote against the new institution foreboding its dangers very imperfectly indeed because he had nothing but his imagination to aid him an american could do no more for to detail the real evils of aristocracy they must be seen in europe burkes fears were thought exaggerations in america while in europe it is known that even mirabeau has but faintly sketched the curses of hereditary aristocracy as they are experienced    here and as they would have followed in america had this institution remained the epigraph of burkes pamphlet was blow ye the trumpet in zion its effect corresponded with its epigraph this institution became first the subject of general conversation next it was made the subject of deliberation in the legislative assemblies of some of the states the governor of south carolina censured it in an address to his assembly the assemblies of massachusetts rhode island and pennsylvania condemned its principles no circumstance indeed brought the consideration of it expressly before congress yet it had sunk deep into their minds an offer having been made to them on the part of the polish order of divine providence to receive some of their distinguished citizens into that order they made that an occasion to declare that these distinctions were contrary to the principles of their confederation the uneasiness excited by this institution had very early caught the notice of general washington still recollecting all the purity of the motives which gave it birth he became sensible that it might produce political evils which the warmth of these motives had masked add to this that it was disapproved by the mass of citizens of the union this alone was reason strong enough in a country where the will of the majority is the law  ought to be the law he saw that the objects of the institution were too light to be opposed to considerations as serious as these and that it was become necessary to annihilate it absolutely on this therefore he was decided the first annual    meeting at philadelphia was now at hand he went to that determined to exert all his influence for its suppression he proposed it to his fellow officers and urged it with all his powers it met an opposition which was observed to cloud his face with an anxiety that the most distressful scenes of the war had scarcely ever produced it was canvassed for several days  at length it was no more a doubt what would be its ultimate fate the order was on the point of receiving its annihilation by the vote of a very great majority of its members in this moment their envoy arrived from france charged with letters from the french officers accepting with cordiality the proposed badges of union with sollicitations from others to be received into the order  with notice that their respectable sovereign had been pleased to recognize it  permit his officers to wear its badges the prospect now changed the question assumed a new form after the offer made by them  accepted by their friends in what words could they clothe a proposition to retract it which would not cover themselves with the reproaches of levity  ingratitude which would not appear an insult to those whom they loved federal principles popular discontent were considerations whose weight was known  felt by themselves but would foreigners know  feel them equally would they so far acknowledge their cogency as to permit without any indignation the eagle  ribbon to be torn from their breasts by the very hands which had placed them there the idea revolted the whole society they found it necessary then to preserve    so much of their institution as might continue to support this foreign branch while they should prune off every other which would give offence to their fellow citizens thus sacrificing on each hand to their friends  to their country the society was to retain its existence its name its meetings  its charitable funds but these last were to be deposited with their respective legislatures the order was to be no longer hereditary a reformation which had been pressed even from this side of the atlantic it was to be communicated to no new members the general meetings instead of annual were to be triennial only the eagle  ribbon indeed were retained because they were worn  they wished them to be worn by their friends who were in a country where they would not be objects of offence but themselves never wore them they laid them up in their bureaus with the medals of american independance with those of the trophies they had taken  the battles they had won but through all the united states no officer is seen to offend the public eye with the display of this badge these changes have tranquillized the american states their citizens do justice to the circumstances which prevented a total annihilation of the order they feel too much interest in the reputation of their officers and value too much whatever may serve to recall to the memory of their allies the moments wherein they formed but one people tho they are obliged by a prudent foresight to keep out everything from among themselves which might pretend to divide them into orders and to degrade one description of    men below another yet they hear with pleasure that their allies whom circumstances have already placed under these distinctions are willing to consider it as one to have aided them in the establishment of their liberties  to wear a badge which may recall to their remembrance and it would be an extreme affliction to them if the domestic reformation which has been found necessary if the censures of individual writers or if any other circumstance should discourage the wearing their badge or lessen its reputation this short but true history of the order of the cincinnati taken from the mouths of persons on the spot who were privy to its origin  progress  who knew its present state is the best apology which can be made for an institution which appeared to be  was really so heterogeneous to the governments in which it was erected it should be further considered that in america no other distinction between man  man had ever been known but that of persons in office exercising powers by authority of the laws and private individuals among these last the poorest labourer stood on equal ground with the wealthiest millionnaire  generally on a more favoured one whenever their rights seem to jar it has been seen that a shoemaker or other artisan removed by the voice of his country from his work bench into a chair of office has instantly commanded all the respect and obedience which the laws ascribe to his office but of distinction by birth or badge they had no more idea than they had of the mode of existence in the    moon or planets they had heard only that there were such  knew that they must be wrong a due horror of the evils which flow from these distinctions could be excited in europe only where the dignity of man is lost in arbitrary distinctions where the human species is classed into several stages of degradation where the many are crushed under the weight of the few  where the order established can present to the contemplation of a thinking being no other picture than that of god almighty  his angels trampling under foot the hosts of the damned no wonder then that the institution of the cincinnati should be innocently conceived by one order of american citizens could raise in the other orders only a slow temperate  rational opposition and could be viewed in europe as a detestable parricide the  d   d branches of this subject no body can better execute than m de meusnier perhaps it may be curious to him to see how they strike an american mind at present he shall therefore have the ideas of one who was an enemy to the institution from the first moment of its conception but who was always sensible that the officers neither foresaw nor intended the injury they were doing to their country as to the question then whether any evil can proceed from the institution as it stands at present i am of opinion there may   from the meetings these will keep the officers formed into a body will continue a distinction between the civil  military which it would be for the good of the whole to    obliterate as soon as possible  the military assemblies will not only keep alive the jealousies  the fears of the civil government but give ground for these fears  jealousies for when men meet together they will make business if they have none they will collate their grievances some real some imaginary all highly painted they will communicate to each other the sparks of discontent  this may engender a flame which will consume their particular as well as the general happiness   the charitable part of the institution is still more likely to do mischief as it perpetuates the dangers apprehended in the preceding clause for here is a fund provided of permanent existence to whom will it belong to the descendants of american officers of a certain description these descendants then will form a body having sufficient interest to keep up an attention to their description to continue meetings  perhaps in some moment when the political eye shall be slumbering or the firmness of their fellowcitizens realized to replace the insignia of the order  revive all its pretensions what good can the officers propose which may weigh against these possible evils the securing their descendants against want why afraid to trust them to the same fertile soil  the same genial climate which will secure from want the descendants of their other fellow citizens are they afraid they will be reduced to labour the earth for their sustenance they will be rendered thereby both honester and happier an industrious farmer occupies a more dignified place in the scale of beings whether moral or political    than a lazy lounger valuing himself on his family too proud to work  drawing out a miserable existence by eating on that surplus of other mens labour which is the sacred fund of the helpless poor a pitiful annuity will only prevent them from exerting that industry  those talents which would soon lead them to better fortune how are these evils to be prevented   at their first general meeting let them distribute the funds on hand to the existing objects of their destination  discontinue all further contributions   let them declare at the same time that their meetings general  particular shall henceforth cease   let them melt up their eagles  add the mass to the distributable fund that their descendants may have no temptation to hang them in their button holes these reflections are not proposed as worthy the notice of m de meusnier he will be so good as to treat the subject in his own way  no body has a better i will only pray him to avail us of his forcible manner to evince that there is evil to be apprehended even from the ashes of this institution  to exhort the society in america to make their reformation complete bearing in mind that we must keep the passions of men on our side even when we are persuading them to do what they ought to do pa     et en effet la population c   0 plus de confiance to this we answer that no such census of the numbers was ever given out by congress nor ever presented to them and further that congress never has at any time declared by their vote the number  0 of inhabitants in their respective states on the   d of june      they first resolved to remit paper money the sum resolved on was   millions of dollars they declared then that the    confederate colonies for georgia had not yet joined them should be pledged for the redemption of these bills to ascertain in what proportion each state should be bound the members from each were desired to say as nearly as they could what was the number of the inhabitants of their respective states they were very much unprepared for such a declaration they guessed however as well as they could the following are the numbers as they conjectured them  the subsequent apportionment of the   millions of dollars  inhabitants  new hampshire       00000              massachusetts        0000             rhode island          000              connecticut       00000             new york       00000             new jersey        0000       0

00000              —————— ——————        000    000000 georgia having not yet acceded to the measures of the other states was not quotaed but their numbers were generally estimated at about  0000  so would have made the whole     000 persons of every condition but it is to be observed that    tho congress made this census the basis of their apportionment yet they did not even give it a place on their journals much less publish it to the world with their sanction the way it got abroad was this as the members declared from their seats the number of inhabitants which they conjectured to be in their state the secretary of congress wrote them on a piece of paper calculated the portion of   millions of dollars accordingly  entered the sum only in the journals the members however for their own satisfaction and the information of their states took copies of this enumeration  sent them to their states from thence they got into the public papers and when the english newswriters found it answered their purpose to compare this with the numeration of      as their principle is to lie boldly that they may not be suspected of lying they made it amount to      0  and ascribed its publication to congress itself in april      congress being to call on the states to raise a million  a half of dollars annually for    years it was necessary to apportion this among them the states had never furnished them with their exact numbers it was agreed too that in this apportionment   slaves should be counted as   freemen only the preparation of this business was in the hands of a committee they applied to the members for the best information they could give them of the numbers of their states some of the states had taken pains to discover their numbers others had done nothing in that way  of course were now where they were in      when their    members were first called on to declare their numbers under these circumstances  on the principle of counting threefifths only of the slaves the committee apportioned the money among the states  reported their work to congress in this they had assessed s carolina as having   0000 inhabitants the delegate for that state however prevailed on congress to assess them on the footing of   0000 only in consideration of the state of total devastation in which the enemy had left their country the difference was then laid on the other states and the following was the result  inhabitants dollars new hampshire           00           0  massachusetts        0000             rhode island         0 00              connecticut

refused to give the numeration the sanction of a place on their journals because it was not formed on such evidence as a strict attention to accuracy  truth required they used it from necessity because they could get no better rule and they entered on their journals only the apportionment of money the members however    as before took copies of the numeration which was the groundwork of the apportionment sent them to their states  thus this second numeration got into the public papers  was by the english ascribed to congress as their declaration of the present numbers to get at the real numbers which this numeration supposes we must add  0000 to the number on which s carolina was quotæed we must consider that  00000 slaves are counted but as   0000 persons  add on that account   0000 this will give us a total of      00 inhabitants of every condition in the    states being     00 more than the numeration of      instead of     0  loss which the english papers asserted to be the diminution of numbers in the united states according to the confession of congress itself pa     comportera peut etre une population de thirty millions the territories of the united states contain about a million of square miles english there is in them a greater proportion of fertile lands than in the british dominions in europe suppose the territory of the u s then to attain an equal degree of population with the british european dominions they will have an hundred millions of inhabitants let us extend our views to what may be the population of the two continents of north  south america supposing them divided at the narrowest part of the isthmus of panama between this line and that of  0° of north latitude the northern continent contains about   millions of square miles and south of this line of division the southern continent    contains about   millions of square miles i do not pass the  0th degree of northern latitude in my reckoning because we must draw a line somewhere  considering the soil  climate beyond that i would only avail my calculation of it as a make weight to make good what the colder regions within that line may be supposed to fall short in their future population here are    millions of square miles then which at the rate of population before assumed will nourish   00 millions of inhabitants a number greater than the present population of the whole globe is supposed to amount to if those who propose medals for the resolution of questions about which nobody makes any question those who have invited discussions on the pretended problem whether the discovery of america was for the good of mankind if they i say would have viewed it only as doubling the numbers of mankind  of course the quantum of existence  happiness they might have saved the money  the reputation which their proposition has cost them the present population of the inhabited parts of the u s is of about  0 to the square mile  experience has shown us that wherever we reach that the inhabitants become uneasy as too much compressed and go off in great numbers to search for vacant country within  0 years the whole territory will be peopled at that rate we may fix that then as the term beyond which the people of those states will not be restrained within their present limits we may fix it too as the term of population which they will not exceed till the whole of those two continents are    filled up to that mark that is to say till they shall contain   0 millions of inhabitants the soil of the country on the western side of the mississippi its climate  its vicinity to the u s point it out as the first which will receive population from that nest the present occupiers will just have force enough to repress  restrain the emigrations to a certain degree of consistence we have seen lately a single person go  decide on a settlement in kentucky many hundred miles from any white inhabitant remove thither with his family and a few neighbors  though perpetually harassed by the indians that settlement in the course of  0 years has acquired  0000 inhabitants its numbers are increasing while we are writing and the state of which it formerly made a part has offered it independance pa   0 line five huit des onze etats c say there were ten states present   voted unanimously for it   against it and one was divided and seven votes being requisite to decide the proposition affirmatively it was lost the voice of a single individual of the state which was divided or of one of those which were of the negative would have prevented this abominable crime from spreading itself over the new country thus we see the fate of millions unborn hanging on the tongue of one man  heaven was silent in that awful moment but it is to be hoped it will not always be silent  that the friends to the rights of human nature will in the end prevail on the   th of march      it was moved in congress that the same proposition should be referred to a committee

between the k of prussia  the united states in the negociation with the minister of portugal at london the latter objected to the   th article the observations which were made in answer to his objections mr jefferson incloses they are a commentary on the   th article mr de meusnier will be so good as to return the sheet on which these observations are as mr jefferson does not retain a copy of it if m de meusnier proposes to mention the facts of cruelty of which he  mr jefferson spoke yesterday the   th article will introduce them properly because they produced a sense of the necessity of that article these facts are   the death of upwards of   000 americans in one prison ship the jersey and in the space of   years   general howes permitting our prisoners taken at the battle of germantown and placed under a guard in the    yard of the statehouse of philadelphia to be so long without any food furnished them that many perished with hunger where the bodies laid it was seen that they had eaten all the grass round them within their reach after they had lost the power of rising or moving from their place   the  d fact was the act of a commandg officer the  st of several commanding officers  for so long a time as must suppose the approbation of government but the following was the act of government itself during the periods that our affairs seemed unfavourable  theirs successful that is to say after the evacuation of new york and again after the taking of charlestown in south carolina they regularly sent our prisoners taken on the seas  carried to england to the e indies this is so certain that in the month of novemb or decemb      mr adams having officially demanded a delivery of the american prisoners sent to the east indies ld cærmarthen answered officially that orders were issued immediately for their discharge m de meusnier is at liberty to quote this fact   a fact not only of the government but of the parliament who passed an act for that purpose in the beginning of the war was the obliging our prisoners taken at sea to join them and fight against their countrymen this they effected by starving  whipping them the insult on capt stanhope which happened at boston last year was a consequence of this two persons dunbar  lorthrope whom stanhope had treated in this manner having particularly inflicted    lashes on dunbar  0 meeting him at boston attempted to beat him but the people interposed  saved him the fact is referred to in that paragraph of the declaration of independence which sais he has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high seas to bear arms against their country to become the executioners of their friends  brethern or to fall themselves by their hands this was the most afflicting to our prisoners of all the cruelties exercised on them the others affected the body only but this the mind—they were haunted by the horror of having perhaps themselves shot the ball by which a father or a brother fell some of them had constancy enough to hold out against half allowance of food  repeated whippings these were generally sent to england  from thence to the east indies one of these escaped from the east indies and got back to paris where he gave an account of his sufferings to mr adams who happened to be then at paris m de meusnier where he mentions that the slavelaw has been passed in virginia without the clause of emancipation is pleased to mention that neither mr wythe nor mr jefferson were present to make the proposition they had meditated from which people who do not give themselves the trouble to reflect or enquire might conclude hastily that their absence was the cause why the proposition was not made  of course that there were not in the assembly persons of virtue  firmness enough to propose the clause for emancipation this supposition would not be true there were persons    there who wanted neither the virtue to propose nor talents to enforce the proposition had they seen that the disposition of the legislature was ripe for it these worthy characters would feel themselves wounded degraded  discouraged by this idea mr jefferson would therefore be obliged to m de meusnier to mention it in some such manner as this of the two commissioners who had concerted the amendatory clause for the gradual emancipation of slaves mr wythe could not be present as being a member of the judiciary department and mr jefferson was absent on the legation to france but there wanted not in that assembly men of virtue enough to propose  talents to vindicate this clause but they saw that the moment of doing it with success was not yet arrived and that an unsuccessful effort as often happens would only rivet still closer the claims of bondage and retard the moment of delivery to this oppressed description of men what a stupendous what an incomprehensible machine is man who can endure toil famine stripes imprisonment  death itself in vindication of his own liberty and the next moment be deaf to all those motives whose power supported him thro his trial and inflict on his fellow men a bondage one hour of which is fraught with more misery than ages of that which he rose in rebellion to oppose but we must await with patience the workings of an overruling providence  hope that that is preparing the deliverance of these our suffering brethren when the measure of their tears shall be full when their groans shall have    involved heaven itself in darkness doubtless a god of justice will awaken to their distress and by diffusing light  liberality among their oppressors or at length by his exterminating thunder manifest his attention to the things of this world and that they are not left to the guidance of a blind fatality thomas jefferson jan         paris john jay to john jay j mss paris    jan      dear sir —i received on the   th instant your private favor of dec   and thank you for the confidence you are so good as to repose in me of which that communication is a proof as such it is a gratification to me because it meets the esteem i have ever borne you but nothing was needed to keep my mind right on that subject and i believe i may say the public mind here the sentiments entertained of you in this place are too respectful to be easily shaken the person of whom you speak in your letter arrived here on the   th and departed for warsaw  on the   d it is really to be lamented that after a public servant has passed a life in important and faithful services after having given the most plenary satisfaction in every station it should yet be in the power of every individual to disturb his quiet by arraigning him in a gazette and by obliging him to act as if he needed a defence an obligation imposed on him by unthinking minds which never give themselves the trouble of seeking a reflection    unless it be presented to them however it is a part of the price we pay for our liberty which cannot be guarded but by the freedom of the press nor that be limited without danger of losing it to the loss of time of labour of money then must be added that of quiet to which those must offer themselves who are capable of serving the public and all this is better than european bondage your quiet may have suffered for a moment on this occasion but you have the strongest of all supports that of the public esteem it is unnecessary to add assurances of that with which i have the honor to be dear sir your most obedient and most humble servt thomas jefferson jan         paris archibald stuart to archibald stuart  paris jan         dear sir —i have received your favor of the   th of october which though you mention as the third you have written me is the first which has come to hand i sincerely thank you for the communications it contains nothing is so grateful to me at this distance as details both great  small of what is passing in my own country of the latter we receive little here because they either escape my correspondents or are thought unworthy notice this however is a very mistaken opinion as every one may observe by recollecting that when he has been long absent from his neighborhood the small news of that is the    most pleasing and occupies his first attention either when he meets with a person from thence or returns thither himself i shall hope therefore that the letter in which you have been so good as to give me the minute occurrences in the neighborhood of monticello may yet come to hand and i venture to rely on the many proofs of friendship i have received from you for a continuance of your favors this will be the most meritorious as i have nothing to give you in exchange the quiet of europe at this moment furnishes little which can attract your notice nor will that quiet be soon disturbed at least for the current year perhaps it hangs on the life of the k of prussia and that hangs by a very slender thread american reputation in europe is not such as to be flattering to its citizens two circumstances are particularly objected to us the nonpaiment of our debts and the want of energy in our government these discourage a connection with us i own it to be my opinion that good will arise from the destruction of our credit i see nothing else which can restrain our disposition to luxury and the loss of those manners which alone can preserve republican government as it is impossible to prevent credit the best way would be to cure its ill effects by giving an instantaneous recovery to the creditor this would be reducing purchases on credit to purchases for ready money a man would then see a poison painted on everything he wished but had not ready money to pay for i fear from an expression in your letter that the people of kentucké think of separating not only from virginia in which they are right but also from    the confederacy i own i should think this a most calametous event and such an one as every good citizen on both sides should set himself against our present federal limits are not too large for good government nor will the increase of votes in congress produce any ill effect on the contrary it will drown the little divisions at present existing there our confederacy must be viewed as the nest from which all america north  south is to be peopled we should take care too not to think it for the interests of that great continent to press too soon on the spaniards those countries cannot be in better hands my fear is that they are too feeble to hold them till our population can be sufficiently advanced to gain it from them piece by piece the navigation of the mississippi we must have this is all we are as yet ready to receive i have made acquaintance with a very sensible candid gentleman here who was in south america during the revolt which took place there while our revolution was working he says that those disturbances of which we scarcely heard anything cost on both sides an hundred thousand lives—i have made a particular acquaintance here with monsieur de buffon and have a great desire to give him the best idea i can of our elk perhaps your situation may enable you to aid me in this were it possible you could not oblige me more than by sending me the horns skeleton  skin of an elk the most desirable form of receiving them would be to have the skin slit from the under paw along the belly to the tail  down the thighs to the knee to take the animal out leaving the legs and hoofs the    bones of the head  the horns attached to the skin by sewing up the belly  shipping the skin it would present the form of the animal however as an opportunity of doing this is scarcely expected i shall be glad to receive them detached packed in a box  sent to richmond to the care of doctor currie every thing of this kind is precious here and to prevent my adding to your trouble i must close my letter with assurances of the esteem  attachment with which i am dr sir your friend  servt p s i must add a prayer for some

—i was honoured some time ago with a letter from you of dec   inclosing two for america which i forwarded by the first occasion on the   th of this month i received a letter from his excellency the count de vergennes expressing the interest which he takes in your welfare and recommending you to congress this i had an opportunity of forwarding from hence on the   th of jan under cover to mr jay yesterday i was gratified with the receipt of your favor of jan    containing a copy of the resolution of congress of oct    in your favor and which i    wish had been more so with respect to the paiment of the arrearages two things are necessary first an order from the treasury and secondly money to comply with it mr grand wrote to me this morning that he had not now as much left to pay a bill of mr carmichaels for   00 livres just presented i shall forward your letter to mr jay the next week with a request that the necessary measures may be taken for the paiment of your arrearages and interest in the mean time i think you would do well to write a line for the same purpose to mr jay or to the commissioners of the treasury i do not mean that what i have said above should prevent your drawing in due time for the salary of the current quarter i will honour that draught from a private fund with which i can take that liberty i thank you for what you say of the notes on virginia it is much more than they deserve tho the various matters they touch on would have been beyond the information of any one person whatever to have treated fully and infinitely beyond mine yet had i at the time of writing them had anything more in view than the satisfying a single individual they should have been more attended to both in form and matter poor as they are they have been thought worthy of a surreptitious translation here with the appearance of which very soon i have been threatened this has induced me to yield to a friendly proposition from the abbé morellet to translate and publish them himself submitting the sheets previously to my inspection as a translation by so able a hand will lessen the faults of the original instead of their being multiplied by a    hireling translator i shall add to it a map and such other advantages as may prevent the mortification of my seeing it appear in the injurious form threatened i shall with great pleasure send a copy of the original to you by the first opportunity praying your acceptance of it thomas jefferson feb        paris james madison to james madison j mss paris feb        dear sir —my last letters have been of the  st   0th of

williamsburgh  for the attorney which i will pray you to forward i thank you for the communication of the remonstrance against the assessment mazzei who is now in holland promised me to have it published in the leyden gazette it will do us great honour i wish it may be as much approved by our assembly as by the wisest part of europe i have heard with great pleasure that our assembly have come to the resolution of giving the regulation of their commerce to the federal head i will venture to assert that there is not one of its opposers who placed on this ground would not see the wisdom of this measure the politics of europe render it indispensably necessary that with respect to everything external we be one nation only firmly hooped together interior government is what each    state should keep to itself if it could be seen in europe that all our states could be brought to concur in what the virginia assembly has done it would produce a total revolution in their opinion of us and respect for us and it should ever be held in mind that insult  war are the consequences of a want of respectability in the national character as long as the states exercise separately those acts of power which respect foreign nations so long will there continue to be irregularities committing by some one or other of them which will constantly keep us on an ill footing with foreign nations i thank you for your information as to my notes the copies i have remaining shall be sent over to be given to some of my friends and to select subjects in the college i have been unfortunate here with this trifle i gave out a few copies only  to confidential persons writing in every copy a restraint against its publication among others i gave a copy to a mr williamos he died i immediately took every precaution i could to recover this copy but by some means or other a bookseller had got hold of it he employed a hireling translator and was about publishing it in the most injurious form possible an abbé morellet a man of letters here to whom i had given a copy got notice of this he had translated some passages for a particular purpose and he compounded with the bookseller to translate  give him the whole on his declining the first publication i found it necessary to confirm this and it will be published in french still mutilated however in its freest parts i am now at a loss what to do as to  0 england everything good or bad is thought worth publishing there and i apprehend a translation back from the french and a publication there i rather believe it will be most eligible to let the original come out in that country but am not yet decided i have purchased little for you in the book way since i sent the catalogue of my former purchases i wish first to have your answer to that and your information what parts of those purchases went out of your plan you can easily say buy more of this kind less of that c my wish is to conform myself to yours i can get for you the original paris edition in folio of the encyclopedie for   0 livres    vols a good edn in    vols  to for   0♯ and a good one in    vols  vo for   0♯ the new one will be superior in far the greater number of articles but not in all and the possession of the ancient one has moreover the advantage of supplying present use i have bought one for myself but wait your orders as to you i remember your purchase of a watch in philadelphia if it should not have proved good you can probably sell her in that case i can get for you here one made as perfect as human art can make it for about    louis i have had such a one made by the best  most faithful hand in paris it has a second hand but no repeating no day of the month nor other useless thing to impede and injure the movements which are necessary for    louis more you can have in the same cover but on the back side  absolutely unconnected with the movements of the watch a pedometer which shall render you an exact    account of the distances you walk your pleasure hereon shall be awaited houdon is returned he called on me the other day to remonstrate against the inscription proposed for genl ws statue he says it is too long to be put on the pedestal i told him i was not at liberty to permit any alteration but i would represent his objection to a friend who could judge of its validity and whether a change could be authorized this has been the subject of conversations here and various devices  inscriptions have been suggested the one which has appeared best to me may be translated as follows behold reader the form of george washington for his worth ask history that will tell it when this stone shall have yielded to the decays of time his country erects this monument houdon makes it this for one side on the  d represent the evacuation of boston with the motto hostibus primum fugatis on the  d the capture of the hessians with hostibus iterum devictis on the  th the surrender of york with hostibus ultimum debellatis this is seizing the three most brilliant actions of his military life by giving out here a wish of receiving mottos for this statue we might have thousands offered of which still better might be chosen the artist made the same objection of length to the inscription for the bust of the m de la fayette an alteration of that might come in time still if an alteration was wished however i am not certain that it is desirable in either case the state of georgia has given  0000 acres of land to the count d estaing this gift is considered    here as very honourable to him and it has gratified him much i am persuaded that a gift of lands by the state of virginia to the marquis de la fayette would give a good opinion here of our character and would reflect honour on the marquis nor am i sure that the day will not come when it might be an useful asylum to him the time of life at which he visited america was too well adapted to receive good  lasting impressions to permit him ever to accommodate himself to the principles of monarchical government and it will need all his own prudence  that of his friends to make this country a safe residence for him how glorious how comfortable in reflection will it be to have prepared a refuge for him in case of a reverse in the meantime he could settle it with tenants from the freest part of this country bretagny i have never suggested the smallest idea of this kind to him because the execution of it should convey the first notice if the state has not a right to give him lands with their own officers they could buy up at cheap prices the shares of others i am not certain however whether in the public or private opinion a similar gift to count rochambeau could be dispensed with if the state could give to both it would be better but in any event i think they should to the marquis c rochambeau too has really deserved more attention than he has received why not set up his bust that of gates green franklin in your new capitol a propos of the capitol do my dear friend exert yourself to get the plan begun on set aside  that adopted which was drawn here it was taken from a model which has been the admiration of       centuries which has been the object of as many pilgrimages as the tomb of mahomet which will give unrivalled honour to our state and furnish a model whereon to form the taste of our young men it will cost much less too than the one begun because it does not cover one half the area ask if you please a sight of my letter of jan    to messrs buchanan  hay which will spare me repeating its substance here everything is quiet in europe i recollect but one new invention in the arts which is worth mentioning it is a mixture of the arts of engraving  printing rendering both cheaper write or draw anything on a plate of brass with the ink of the inventor and in half an hour he gives you engraved copies of it so perfectly like the original that they could not be suspected to be copies his types for printing a whole page are all in one solid piece an author therefore only prints a few copies of his work from time to time as they are called for this saves the loss of printing more copies than may possibly be sold and prevents an edition from being ever exhausted i am with a lively esteem dear sir your sincere friend  servant p s could you procure  send me an hundred or two nuts of the peccan

jefferson feb  0      paris marquis de la fayette to the marquis de la fayette j mss paris feb  0      dear sir —i forgot last night a very material circumstance in my calculation the farmers general are by their bail obliged to keep a certain provision of tobacco and snuff always on hand i believe it is three years consumption however for fear of error i will call it two years because were the bail silent on this head they would certainly have always on hand one years stock ready for manufacture and one years stock manufactured there is no extensive manufacture which does not find that it has on hand generally two years stock of goods as the farmers buy their tobacco for ready money and i know they even advance money they lay out of their money two years this interest must therefore be added and the estimate will stand thus             ♯    millions of pounds weight of tobacco at   sous cost    00000 the cost of manufacture is   sou the pound          00 guards c to prevent contraband    000000 revenue paid annually to the king   000000 interest on the whole for   years    pr cent        00  —————— whole cost of annual purchase of tobacco then is      000 they sell annually but lbsover    0000 which at shrover —italsover 0 brings them    0 000  —————— they lose annually then by the farm of tobacco       000 thus according to their own shewing the king should in favor to them discontinue the bail and they cannot ask its continuance without acknowledging they have given in a false state of quantities  sums    thomas jefferson mar         london john jay to the secretary for foreign affairs john jay j mss london mar         dear sir —the date of a letter from london will doubtless be as unexpected to you as it was unforeseen by myself a few days ago on the   th of the last month colo smith arrived in paris with a letter from mr adams informing me that there was at this place a minister from tripoli having general powers to enter into treaties on behalf of his state and with whom it was possible we might do something in our commission to that power and that he gave reason to believe he could also take arrangements with us for tunis he further added that the minister of portugal here had received ultimate instructions from his court and that probably that treaty might be concluded in the space of three weeks were we all on the spot together he therefore pressed me to come over immediately the first of these objects had some weight in my mind because as we had sent no person to tripoli or tunis i thought if we could meet a minister from them on this ground our arrangements would be settled much sooner  at less expence but what principally decided with me was the desire of bringing matters to a conclusion with portugal before the term of our commission should expire or any new turn in the negotiations of france  england should abate their willingness to fix a connection with us a third motive had also its weight i hoped that my attendance here and the necessity of shortening it might be made use of to force a    decisive answer from this court i therefore concluded to comply with mr adamss request i went immediately to versailles and apprised the count de vergennes that circumstances of public duty called me hither for three or four weeks arranged with him some matters and set out with colo smith for this place where we arrived last night which was as early as the excessive rigour of the weather admitted i saw mr adams immediately  again today he informs me that the minister of portugal was taken ill five or six days ago has been very much so but is now somewhat better it would be very mortifying indeed should this accident with the shortness of the term to which i limit my stay here defeat what was the principal object of my journey and that without which i should hardly have undertaken it with respect to this country i had no doubt but that every consideration had been urged by mr adams which was proper to be urged nothing remains undone in this way but we shall avail ourselves of our journey here as if made on purpose just before the expiration of our commission to form our report to congress on the execution of that commission which report they may be given to know cannot be formed without decisive information of the ultimate determination of their court there is no doubt what that determination will be but it will be useful to have it as it may put an end to all further expectations on our side of the water and shew that the time is come for doing whatever is to be done by us for counteracting the unjust  greedy designs of this country we shall have the honour before i leave this place to    inform you of the result of the several matters which have brought me to it a day or two before my departure from paris i received your letter of jan the question therein proposed how far france considers herself as bound to insist on the delivery of the posts would infallibly produce another how far we consider ourselves as guarantees of their american possessions  bound to enter into any future war in which these may be attacked the words of the treaty of alliance seems to be without ambiguity on either head yet i should be afraid to commit congress by answering without authority i will endeavor on my return to sound the opinion of the minister if possible without exposing myself to the other question should anything forcible be meditated on those posts it would possibly be thought prudent previously to ask the good offices of france to obtain their delivery in this case they would probably say we must first execute the treaty on our part by repealing all acts which have contravened it now this measure if there be any candour in the court of london would suffice to obtain a delivery of the posts from them without the mediation of any third power however if this mediation should be finally needed i see no reason to doubt our obtaining it and still less to question its omnipotent influence on the british court    thomas jefferson apr         london alexander mccaul to alexander mccaul london apr         dear sir —your favor of mar  0 came to hand some days ago and renewed the recollection of a friendship among the earliest i formed in life and which neither time nor events have weakened at any moment since i wish it were in my power to inform you that arrangements were at length taken between the two nations for carrying into complete execution the late treaty of peace and for settling those conditions which are essential to the continuance of a commerce between them i suppose all arrangement is thought unnecessary here as the subject has not been deemed worthy of a conference both nations are left to pursue their own measures and it is not easy to foresee what these will be each has complaints on the subject of the late treaty we that but one post out of six or eight within our limits has yet been evacuated by the british troops and that a great number slaves were brought away contrary to stipulation on the other part it is urged that we have thrown obstructions in the way of the recovery of the debts due to the merchants of this country there are two circumstances of difficulty in the paiment of these debts to speak of the particular state with which you  i are best acquainted we know that its debt is ten times the amount of its circulating cash to pay that debt at once then is a physical impossibility time is requisite were all the creditors to rush to judgment together a mass of two millions of property would be brought to market where there is but the tenth of that sum of money in    circulation to purchase it both debtor and creditor would be ruined as debts would be thus rendered desperate which are in themselves good of this truth i find the merchants here sufficiently sensible  i have no doubt we should have arranged the article of time to mutual satisfaction allowing judgment to pass immediately  dividing the execution into instalments there was another point on which we should have differed it is a general sentiment in america that the principal of these debts should be paid  that that alone is stipulated by the treaty but they think the interest also which arose before  since the war is justly due they think it would be as unjust to demand interest during the war they urge that during that time they could not pay the debt for that of the remittances attempted two thirds on an average were taken by the nation to whom they were due that during that period they had no use of the money as from the same circumstance of capturing their produce on the sea tobacco sold at   the hundred which was not sufficient to bear the expences of the estate that they paid the taxes and other charges on the property during that period and stood its insurers in the ultimate event of the war they admit indeed that such individual creditors as were not engaged in privateering against them have lost this interest but that it was the fault of their own nation and that this is the case where both parties having lost each may justifiably endeavor to save himself setting aside this portion of the interest i am persuaded the debts in america are generally good and that there is an  0 honest intention to pay them the improvident and indolent may delay the commencement of that duty but they do not think certainly to avoid it after the war ceased the first profits of their plantations would be applied to get supplies of clothing to rebuild their houses fences barns c where they were burned or decayed and to repair the other ravages of the war this might reasonably take two or three years but it is now time that they should begin the paiment of their old debts with respect to myself i acknowledge to you that i do not think an interest justly demandeable during the war whatever i owed with interest previous  subsequent to the war i have taken measures for paying as speedily as possible my chief debts are to yourself  to mr jones of bristol in the year      before there was a shilling of paper money issued i sold land for £  00 to pay these two debts i did not receive the money till it was not worth oak leaves i have lost the principal and interest of these debts once then in attempting to pay them besides this ld cornwallis army took off  0 of my slaves burnt one years crop of tobacco in my houses  destroyed another in the fields with other damages to the amount of three or four thousand pounds still i am renewing my efforts to pay what i justly ought and i hope these will be more successful my whole estate is left in the hands of mr lewis of albemarle and mr eppes of chesterfield to apply its whole profits to the paiment of my debts some had been necessarily contracted during the war they write me word that these will be cleared off this year    there will remain then only yours  mr joness toward which the labour of  00 slaves will be annually applied till the paiment is effected for till that i shall not draw one shilling from the estate nor resume its possession i do not know the exact amount of either of these debts but i propose that the profits of my estate shall be annually divided in proportion to them i think it very possible that you will not concur with me in opinion as to the intermediate interest and that so far i shall meet your censure both parties are liable to feel too strongly the arguments which tend to justify their endeavors to avoid this loss yet after making allowances for this prejudice it seems to me impossible but that the hardships are infinitely greater on our side than on yours you have lost the interest but it is not we who have gained it we deem your nation the aggressors they took those profits which arose from your property in our hands and inflicted on us immeasurable losses besides i urge these considerations because while they decide my own opinion i wish them to weigh so much as to preserve me yours which i highly esteem and should be afflicted were i to lose it i have thus stated to you my views of things both public  private according to the wish expressed in your letters and i rely on your justice that you make use of the information for your own purposes only without committing me i shall at all times be happy to hear from you being

you desired me to send you one of the new lamps i tried at every probable place in paris and could not get a tolerable one i have been glad of it since i came here as i find them much better made here i now deliver one with this letter into the hands of mr fulwar skipwith a merchant from virginia settled here who promises to send it to you with one for mr c thomson of this be pleased to accept from me it is now found that they may be used with almost any oil i expect to leave this place in about three days our public letters joint and separate will inform you what has been done and what could not be done here with respect to a commercial treaty with this country be assured that the government not only has it not in contemplation at present to make any but that they do not conceive that any circumstances will arise which shall render it expedient for them to have any political connection with us they think we shall be glad of their commerce on their own terms there is no party in our favor here either in power or out of power even the opposition concur with the ministry  the nation in this i can scarcely consider as a party the marquis of lansdowne and a half dozen characters about him such as dr price c who are impressed with the utility of a friendly connection with us the former does not venture this sentiment in parliament and the latter are not in situations to be heard the marquis of lansdowne    spoke to me affectionately of your brother doctr lee and desired his respects to him which i beg leave to communicate through you were he to come into the ministry of which there is not the most distant prospect he must adopt the kings system or go out again as he did before for daring to depart from it when we see that through all the changes of ministry which have taken place during the present reign there has never been a change of system with respect to america we cannot reasonably doubt that this is the system of the king himself his obstinacy of character we know his hostility we have known and it is embittered by ill success if ever this nation during his life enters into arrangements with us it must be in consequence of events of which they do not at present see a possibility the object of the present ministry is to buoy up the nation with flattering calculations of their present prosperity and to make them believe they are better without us than with us this they seriously believe for what is it men cannot be made to believe i dined the other day in a company of the ministerial party a general clark sat next to me a scotchman  ministerialist he introduced the subject of american affairs and in the course of the conversation told me that were america to petition parliament to be again received on their former footing the petition would be very generally rejected he was serious in this  i think it was the sentiment of the company and is the sentiment perhaps of the nation in this they are wise but for a foolish reason they think they lost more by suffering us to participate    of their commercial privileges at home  abroad than they lose by our political severance the true reason however why such an application should be rejected is that in a very short time we should oblige them to add another hundred millions to their debt in unsuccessful attempts to retain the subjection offered to them they are at present in a frenzy and will not be recovered from it till they shall have leaped the precipice they are now so boldly advancing to writing from england i write you nothing but english news the continent at present furnishes nothing interesting i shall hope the favor of your letters at times the proceedings  views of congress  of the assemblies the opinions and dispositions of our people in

mss london apr         sir —in another letter of this day i stated to you what had passed with public characters since my arrival here conversations with private individuals i thought it best not to mingle with the contents of that letter yet as some have taken place which relate to matters within our instructions and with persons whose opinions deserve to have some weight i will take the liberty of stating them in a conversation with an antient and respectable merchant of this place such a view of the true state of the commercial connection of america  great britain was presented to him as induced him to acknolege they had been mistaken in their opinions and to ask that    mr adams and myself would permit the chairman of the committee of american merchants to call on us he observed that the same person happened to be chairman of the committee of the whole body of british merchants and that such was the respect paid to his person  office that we might consider what came from him as coming from the committees themselves he called on us at an appointed hour he was a mr duncan campbell formerly much concerned in the american trade we entered on the subject of the nonexecution of the late treaty of peace alleged on both sides we observed that the refusal to deliver the western posts and the withdrawing american property contrary to express stipulation having preceded what they considered as breaches on our part were to be considered as the causes of our proceedings the obstructions thrown by our legislatures in the way of recovery of their debts were insisted on by him we observed to him that the great amount of the debt from america to great britain and the little circulating coin in the former country rendered an immediate paiment impossible that time was necessary that we had been authorized to enter into explanatory arrangements on this subject that we had made overtures for the purpose which had not been attended to and that the states had therefore been obliged to modify the article for themselves he acknowledged the impossibility of immediate paiment the propriety of an explanatory convention and said that they were disposed to allow a reasonable time we mentioned the term of five years including the present but that    judgments might be allowed immediately only dividing the execution into equal  annual parts so that the last should be levied by the close of the year    0 this seemed to be quite agreeable to him and to be as short a term as would be insisted on by them proceeding to the sum to be demanded we agreed that the principal with the interest incurring before and after the war should be paid but as to that incurring during the war we differed from him he urged its justice with respect to themselves who had laid out of the use of their money during that period this was his only topic we opposed to it all those which circumstances both public  private gave rise to he appeared to feel their weight but said the renunciation of this interest was a bitter pill and such an one as the merchants here could not swallow he wished that no declaration should be made as to this article but we observed that if we entered into explanatory declarations of the points unfavourable to us we should expect as a consideration for this corresponding declarations on the parts in our favour in fact we supposed his view to be to leave this part of the interest to stand on the general expressions of the treaty that they might avail themselves in individual cases of the favourable dispositions of debtors or of juries we proceeded to the necessity of arrangements of our future commerce were it only as a means of enabling our country to pay its debts that they had been contracted while certain modes of remittance had existed here and had been an inducement to us to contract these debts he said he was not authorized    to speak on the subject of the future commerce he appeared really  feelingly anxious that arrangements should be stipulated as to the paiment of the old debts said he would proceed in that moment to lord caermarthens and discuss the subject with him and that we might expect to hear from him he took leave and we never since heard from him or any other person on the subject congress will judge how far these conversations should influence their future proceedings or those of the states i have the honour to be with the highest respect  esteem sir your most obedient humble servt thomas jefferson may        paris john page to john page j mss paris may        dear sir —your two favours of mar    and aug

friendship for you which is as old almost as we are ourselves mazzei brought me your favor of apr    i thank you much for your communications nothing    can be more grateful at such a distance it is

hope you will be so good as to continue your friendly information the proceedings of our public bodies the progress of the public mind on interesting questions the casualties which happen among our

knowledge to wit how far westward from fort pitt does the western boundary of pennsylvania pass and where does it strike the ohio the proposition you mention from mr anderson on the purchase of tobacco i would have made use of but that i have engaged the abuses of the tobacco trade on a more general scale i confess their redress does not appear with any certainty but till i see all hope of removing the evil by the roots i cannot propose to prune its branches i returned but three or four days ago from a two months trip to england i traversed that country much and own both town  country fell short of my expectations comparing it with this i found a much greater proportion of barrens a soil in other parts not naturally so good as this not better cultivated but better manured  therefore more productive this proceeds from the practice of long leases there and short ones here the labouring people  00 here are poorer than in england they pay about one half their produce in rent the english in general about a third the gardening in that country is the article in which it surpasses all the earth i mean their pleasure gardening this indeed went far beyond my ideas the city of london tho handsomer than paris is not so handsome as philadelphia their architecture is in the most wretched stile i ever saw not meaning to except america where it is bad nor even virginia where it is worse than in any other part of america which i have seen the mechanical arts in london are carried to a wonderful perfection but of these i need not speak because of them my countrymen have unfortunately too many samples before their eyes i consider the extravagance which has seized them as a more baneful evil than toryism was during the war it is the more so as the example is set by the best and most amiable characters among us would that a missionary appear who would make frugality the basis of his religious system and go thro the land preaching it up as the only road to salvation i would join his school tho not generally disposed to seek my religion out of the dictates of my own reason  feelings of my own heart these things have been more deeply impressed on my mind by what i have heard  seen in england that nation hates us their ministers hate us and their king more than all other men they have the impudence to avow this tho they acknolege our trade important to them but they say we cannot prevent our countrymen from bringing that into their laps a conviction of this determines them to make no  0  terms of commerce with us they say they will pocket our carrying trade as well as their own our overtures of commercial arrangement have been treated with a derision which shows their firm persuasion that we shall never unite to suppress their commerce or even to impede it i think their hostility towards us is much more deeply rooted at present than during the war in the arts the most striking thing i saw there new was the application of the principle of the steamengine to grist mills i saw   pr of stones which are worked by steam and they are to set up  0 pair in the same house a hundred bushels of coal a day are consumed at present i do not know in what proportion the consumption will be increased by the additional geer be so good as to present my respects to mrs page  your family to w lewis f willis  their families and to accept yourself assurances of the sincere regard with which i am dr sir your affectionate friend  servt p s mazzei is still here and will publish soon a book on the subject of america thomas jefferson may        paris james ross to james ross j mss paris may        dear sir —i have duly received your favor of octob    and am much gratified by the communications therein made it has given me details which do not enter into the views of my ordinary correspondents and which are very entertaining i experience great satisfaction at seeing my country  0  proceed to facilitate the intercommunications of its several parts by opening rivers canals  roads how much more rational is this disposal of public money than that of waging war before the receipt of your letter morriss contract for  0000 hhds of tob was concluded with the farmers general i have been for some time occupied in endeavouring to destroy the root of the evils which the tobacco trade encounters in this country by making the ministers sensible that merchants will not bring a commodity to a market where but one person is allowed to buy it and that so long as that single purchaser is obliged to go to foreign markets for it he must pay for it in coin  not in commodities these truths have made their way to the minds of the ministry insomuch as to have delayed the execution of the new lease of the farms six months it is renewed however for three years but so as not to render impossible a reformation of this great evil they are sensible of the evil but it is so interwoven with their fiscal system that they find it hazardous to disentangle the temporary distress too of the revenue they are not prepared to meet my hopes therefore are weak though not quite desperate when they become so it will remain to look about for the best palliative this monopoly can bear my present idea is that it will be found in a prohibition to the farmers general to purchase tobacco anywhere but in france you will perceive by this that my object is to strengthen the connection between this country  my own in all useful points i am of opinion that   000 hhds of tobacco the annual consumption of  0  this country do not exceed the amount of those commodities which it is more advantageous to us to buy here than in england or elsewhere and such a commerce would powerfully reinforce the motives for a friendship from this country towards ours this friendship we ought to cultivate closely considering the present dispositions of england towards us i am lately returned from a visit to that country it appears to me to be more hostile than during the war this spirit of hostility has always existed in the mind of the king but it has now extended itself thro the whole mass of people and the majority in the public councils in a country where the voice of the people influences so much the measures of administration and where it coincides with the private temper of the king there is no pronouncing on future events it is true they have nothing to gain  much to lose by a war with us but interest is not the strongest passion in the human breast there are difficult points too still unsettled between us they have not withdrawn their armies out of our country nor given satisfaction for the property they brought off on our part we have not paid our debts and it will take time to pay them in conferences with some distinguished mercantile characters i found them sensible of the impossibility of our paying these debts at once and that an endeavor to force universal  immediate paiment would render debts desperate which are good in themselves i think we should not have differed in the term necessary we differed essentially in the article of interest for while the principal and interest preceding   0  subsequent to the war seems justly due from us that which incurred during the war does not interest is a compensation for the use of money their money in our hands was in the form of lands  negroes tobacco the produce of these lands and negroes or as i may call it the interest of them being almost impossible of conveyance to the markets of consumption because taken by themselves in its way there sold during the war at   or   the hundred this did not pay tools taxes  other plantation charges a man who should have attempted to remit to his creditor tobacco for either principal or interest must have remitted it three times before one would have arrived safe and this from the depredations of their own nation and often of the creditor himself for some of the merchants entered deeply into the privateering business the individuals who did not say they have lost this interest the debtor replies that he has not gained  that it is a case where a loss having incurred every one tries to shift it from himself the known bias of the human mind from motives of interest should lessen the confidence of each party in the justice of their reasoning but it is difficult to say which of them should make the sacrifice both of reason  interest our conferences were intended as preparatory to some arrangement it is incertain how far we should have been able to accommodate our opinions but the absolute aversion of the government to enter into any arrangement prevented the object from being pursued each country is left to do justice to itself  to the other according to its own ideas as to what is past and to  0  scramble for the future as well as they can to regulate their commerce by duties and prohibitions and perhaps by cannons  mortars in which event we must abandon the ocean where we are weak leaving to neutral nations the carriage of our commodities  measure with them on land where they alone can lose farewell then all our useful improvements of canals roads reformations of laws  other rational emploiments i really doubt whether there is temper enough on either side to prevent this issue of our present hatred europe is at this moment without the appearance of a cloud the death of the k of prussia daily expected may raise one my paper admonishes me that after asking a continuance of your favors it is time for me to conclude with assurances of the esteem with which i am dr sir your friend  servt thomas jefferson may  0      paris james monroe to james monroe j mss paris may  0      dear sir —my last to you was of jan    since that i have received yours of jan    information from other quarters gives me reasons to suspect you have in negotiation a very important change in your situation you will carry into the execution all my wishes for your happiness i hope it will not detach you from a settlement in your own country i had even entertained hopes of your settling in my neighborhood but these were determined by your desiring a plan of a house for richmond however reluctantly i relinquish this prospect i shall not the  0  less readily obey your commands by sending you a plan having been much engaged since my return from england in answering the letters  despatching other business which had accumulated during my absence  being still much engaged perhaps i may not be able to send the plan by this conveyance if i do not send it now i will surely by the first conveiance after this your encyclopedie containing    livraisons went off last night for havre from whence it will go in a vessel bound to n york it will be under the care of m la croix a passenger who if he does not find you in n york will carry it to virginia i send it to richmond another copy in a separate box goes for currie i pay here all charges to n york what may occur afterwards i desire him to ask either of you or currie as either will pay for the other or to draw on me for them my letters to mr jay will inform you of the objects which carried me to england and that the principal one the treaty with portugal has been accomplished tho we were unable to procure any special advantages in that yet we thought it of consequence to insure our trade against those particular checks and discouragements which it has heretofore met with there the information as to the barbary states which we obtained from abdrahaman the tripoline ambassador was also given to mr jay if it be right  the scale of proportion between those nations which we had settled be also right eight times the sum required by tripoli will be necessary to accomplish a peace with the whole that is to say about two hundred and fifty thousand guineas the continuance of this peace  0  will depend on their idea of our power to enforce it and on the life of the particular dey or other head of the government with whom it is contracted congress will no doubt weigh these circumstances against the expense  probable success of compelling a peace by arms count destaing having communicated to me verbally some information as to an experiment formerly made by this country i shall get him to put it into writing and i will forward it to congress as it will aid them in their choice of measures according to this a force which after the first outfit might cost about three thousand guineas a month sufficed in a short time however which plan is eligible can only be known to ourselves who are on the spot  have under your view all the difficulties of both there is a third measure that of abandoning the mediterranean carriage to other nations with respect to england no arrangements can be taken the merchants were certainly disposed to have consented to accommodation as to the article of debts i was not certain when i left england that they would relinquish the interest during the war a letter received since from the first character among the american merchants in scotland satisfies me they would have relinquished it to insure the capital  residue of interest would to heaven all the states therefore would settle on a uniform plan to open the courts to them so that they might obtain judgments to divide the executions into so many equal annual instalments as that the last might be paid in the year    0 to have the paiments in actual money and to include the capital  interest preceding  0   subsequent to the war would give satisfaction to the world and to the merchants in general since it is left for each nation to pursue their own measures in the execution of the late treaty may not congress with propriety recommend a mode of executing that article respecting the debts and send it to each state to be passed into law whether england gives up the posts or not these debts must be paid or our character stained with infamy among all nations  to all times as to the satisfaction for slaves carried off it is a bagatelle which if not made good before the last instalment becomes due may be secured out of that i formerly communicated the overtures for a treaty which had been made by the imperial ambassador the instructions from congress being in their favor and mr adamss opinion also i encouraged them he expected his full powers when i went to england yet i did not think nor did mr adams that this was of importance enough to weigh against the objects of that journey he received them soon after my departure  communicated it to me on my return asking a copy of our propositions i gave him one but observed our commission had then but a few days to run he desired i would propose to congress the giving new powers to go on with this and said that in the meantime he would arrange with us the plan in a commercial view no great good is to be gained by this but in a political one it may be expedient our national respect needs strengthening in europe it will certainly receive reinforcement by our being received into alliance by  0  the second power  what will shortly be the first character in europe he is at the head too of the other great european confederacy and may serve us with all the powers in that scale as the treaty would of course be in the terms of those of prussia  portugal it will give us but little additional embarrasment in any commercial regulations we may wish to establish the exceptions from these which the other treaties will require may take in the treaty with the emperor i should be glad to communicate some answer as soon as congress shall have made up their minds on it my information to congress on the subject of our commercial articles with this country has only come down to jan    whether i shall say anything on it in my letter to mr jay by this conveiance depends on its not being too early for an appointment i expect hourly word from the count de vergennes to meet him on this  other subjects my last information was that the lease was too far advanced to withdraw from it the article of tobacco but that a clause is inserted in it empowering the king to discontinue it at any time a discontinuance is therefore the only remaining object and as even this cannot be effected till the expiration of the old lease which is about the end of the present year i have wished only to stir the subject from time to time so as to keep it alive this idea led me into a measure proposed by the m de la fayette whose return from berlin found the matter in that point to which my former report to congress had conducted it i communicated to him what i had been engaged on what were my prospects and my   0 purpose of keeping the subject just open he offered his services with that zeal which commands them on every occasion respecting america he suggested to me the meeting two or three gentlemen well acquainted with this business we met they urged me to propose to the ct de vergennes the appointing a committee to take this matter into consideration i told them that decency would not permit me to point out to the ct de vergennes the mode by which he should conduct a negotiation but that i would press again the necessity of an arrangement if whilst that should be operating on his mind they would suggest the appointment of a committee the marquis offered his service for this purpose the consequence was the appointment of a committee  the marquis as a member of it i communicated to him my papers he collected other lights wherever he could  particularly from the gentlemen with whom he had before concerted and who had a good acquaintance with the subject the marquis became our champion in the committee and two of its members who were of the corps of farmers general entered the lists on the other side each gave in memorials the lease indeed was signed while i was gone to england but the discussions were  still are continued in the committee from which we derive two advantages   that of shewing that the object is not to be relinquished and   to enlighten government as to its true interest the ct de vergennes is absolutely for it but it is not in his department calonnes is his friend and in this instance his principle seems so be america veritas     sed magis amicus plato an additional hope is founded in the expectation of a change of the minister of finance the present one is under the absolute controul of the farmers general the committees views have been somewhat different from mine they despair of a suppression of the farm and therefore wish to obtain palliatives which would coincide with the particular good of this country i think that so long as the monopoly in the sale is kept up it is of no consequence to us how they modify the pill for their own internal relief but on the contrary the worse it remains the more necessary it will render a reformation any palliative would take from us all those arguments  friends who would be satisfied with accommodation the marquis tho differing in opinion from me in this point has however adhered to my principle of absolute liberty or nothing in this condition is the matter at this moment whether i say anything on the subject to mr jay will depend on my interview with ct de vergennes i doubt whether that will furnish anything worth communicating  whether it will be in time i therefore state this much to you that you may see the matter is not laid aside i must beg leave to recommend colo humphreys to your acquaintance  good offices he is an excellent man an able one  in need of some provision besides former applications to me in favor of dumas the rhingrave of salm the effective minister of the government of holland while their two ambassadors here are ostensible and who is conducting secret arrangements for them with this     court presses his interests on us it is evident the two governments make a point of it you ask why they do not provide for him themselves i am not able to answer the question but by a conjecture that dumass particular ambition prefers an appointment from us i know all the difficulty about this application which congress has to encounter i see the reasons against giving him the primary appointment at that court and the difficulty of his accommodating himself to a subordinate one yet i think something must be done in it to gratify this court of which we must be always asking favours in these countries personal favours weigh more than public interest the minister who has asked a gratification for dumas has embarked his own feelings  reputation in that demand i do not think it was discreet by any means but this reflection might perhaps aggravate a disappointment i know not really what you can do but yet hope something will be done adieu my dear sir  believe me to be yours affectionately thomas jefferson may         paris john jay to the secretary for foreign affairs john jay j mss paris may         sir —letters received from both madrid  algiers while i was in london having suggested that treaties with the states of barbary would be much facilitated by a previous one with the ottoman porte it was agreed between mr adams and myself     that on my return i should consult on this subject the count de vergennes whose long residence at constantinople rendered him the best judge of its expediency various circumstances have put it out of my power to consult him till today i stated to him the difficulties we were likely to meet with at algiers and asked his opinion what would be the probable expense of a diplomatic mission to constantinople  what its effect at algiers he said that the expense would be very great for that presents must be made at that court and every one would be gaping after them and that it would not procure us a peace at algiers one penny the cheaper he observed that the barbary states acknoleged a sort of vassalage to the porte  availed themselves of that relation when anything was to be gained by it but that whenever it subjected them to a demand from the porte they totally disregarded it that money was the sole agent at algiers except so far as fear could be induced also he cited the present example of spain which tho having a treaty with the porte would probably be obliged to buy a peace at algiers at the expense of upwards of six millions of livres i told him we had calculated from the demands  information of the tripoline ambassador at london that to make peace with the four barbary states would cost us between two  three hundred thousand guineas if bought with money the sum did not seem to exceed his expectations i mentioned to him that considering the incertainty of a peace when bought perhaps congress might think it more eligible to establish a cruise of frigates in the     mediterranean  even to blockade algiers he supposed it would require ten vessels great  small i observed to him that monsr de massiac had formerly done it with five he said it was true but that vessels of relief would be necessary i hinted to him that i thought the english capable of administering aid to the algerines he seemed to think it impossible on account of the scandal it would bring on them i asked him what had occasioned the blockade by mr de massiac he said an infraction of their treaty by the algerines i had a good deal of conversation with him also on the situation of affairs between england  the united states  particularly on their refusal to deliver up our posts i observed to him that the obstructions thrown in the way of the recovery of their debts were the effect  not the cause as they pretended of their refusal to deliver up the posts that the merchants interested in these debts shewed a great disposition to make arrangements with us that the article of time we could certainly have settled  probably that of the interest during the war but that the minister shewing no disposition to have these matters arranged i thought it a sufficient proof that this was not the true cause of their retaining the posts he concurred as to the justice of our requiring time for the paiment of our debts said nothing which shewed a difference of opinion as to the article of interest and seemed to believe fully that their object was to divert the channel of the fur trade before they delivered up the posts and expressed a strong sense of the importance of that commerce to us i told him i     really could not foresee what would be the event of this detention that the situation of the british funds  desire of their minister to begin to reduce the national debt seemed to indicate that they could not wish a war he thought so but that neither were we in a condition to go to war i told him i was yet uninformed what congress proposed to do on this subject but that we should certainly always count on the good offices of france and i was sure that the offer of them would suffice to induce gr britain to do us justice he said that surely we might always count on the friendship of france i added that by the treaty of alliance she was bound to guarantee our limits to us as they should be established at the moment of peace he said they were so mais quil nous etoit necessaire de les constater i told him there was no question what our boundaries were that the english themselves admitted they were clear beyond all question i feared however to press this any further lest a reciprocal question should be put to me  therefore diverted the conversation to another object this is a sketch only of a conference which was lengthy i have endeavored to give the substance  sometimes the expressions where they were material i supposed it would be agreeable to congress to have it communicated to them in the present undecided state in which these subjects are i should add that an explanation of the transaction of monsieur de massaic with the algerines before hinted at will be found in the enclosed letter from the count destaing to me wherein he gives also his own opinion     the whole is submitted to congress as i conceive it my duty to furnish them with whatever information i can gather which may throw any light on the subjects depending before them i have the honour to be with the most perfect esteem  respect sir your most obedient and most humble servt thomas jefferson may         paris john jay to the secretary of foreign affairs john jay j mss paris may         sir —in my letter of january   i had the honour of stating to you what had passed here on the subject of the commerciable articles between this country  the united states i beg leave now to resume that subject i therein informed you that this government had agreed to receive our fish oils on the footing on which they receive those of the hanseatic towns which gave us a reduction of duty from shrover  —sptover   on the barrique to shrover  —sptover  amounting to about shrover   on the english ton according to a statement by monsr sangrain inclosed in that letter this was true but there was another truth which neither that statement nor any other evidence i then had enabled me to discover and which it is but lately i could be ascertained of which is that there is another duty called the droit des huiles et savons to which the hans towns are subject as we are also of consequence this is of   deniers on the nett pound and  0 sous per livre on that amounting to shrover —sptover   on the nett hundred french weight or to shrover 0—sptover  —dptover      the english ton this with the reduced duty makes about shrover 0 —sptover  —dptover  or very nearly four guineas according to the present exchange on the english ton tho this be still advantageous when compared with the english duty of    guineas yet it is less so than we had expected and it will remain when we apply for a renewal of the indulgence to see whether we can obtain further reduction the fur trade is an object of desire in this country london is at present their market for furs they pay for them there in ready money could they draw their furs into their own ports from the u s they would pay us for them in productions nor should we lose by the change of market since tho the french pay the london merchants in cash those merchants pay us with manufactures a very wealthy  well connected company is proposing here to associate themselves with an american company each to possess half the interest  to carry on the fur trade between the two countries the company here expect to make the principal part of the advances they also are solliciting considerable indulgencies from this government from which the part of the company on our side of the water will reap half the advantage as no exclusive idea enters into this scheme it appears to me worthy of encouragement it is hoped the government here will interest themselves for its success if they do one of two things may happen either the english will be afraid to stop the vessels of a company consisting partly of french subjects  patronized by the court in which case the commerce will be laid open generally or if they     stop the vessels the french company which is strongly connected with men in power will complain in form to their government who may thus be interested as principals in the rectification of this abuse as yet however the proposition has not taken such a form as to assure us that it will be prosecuted to this length as to the article of tobacco which had become an important branch of remittance to almost all the states i had the honour of communicating to you my proposition to the court to abolish the monopoly of it in their farm that the ct de vergennes was i thought thoroughly sensible of the expediency of this proposition and disposed to befriend it that the renewal of the lease of the farms had been consequently suspended six months and was still in suspence but that so powerful were the farmers general and so tottering the tenure of the minister of finance in his office that i despaired of preventing the renewal of the farm at that time things were in this state when the m de la fayette returned from berlin on communicating to him what was on the carpet he proposed to me a conference with some persons well acquainted with the commercial system of this country we met they proposed the endeavoring to have a committee appointed to enquire into the subject the proposition was made to the ct de vergennes who befriended it  had the m de la fayette named a member of the committee he became of course the active and truly zealous member for the liberty of commerce others tho well disposed not chusing to oppose the farm openly     this committee has met from time to time it shewed an early and decisive conviction that the measure taken by the farm to put the purchase of their tobaccoes into monopoly on that side the water as the sale of them was on this tended to the annihilation of commerce between the two countries various palliatives were proposed from time to time i confess that i met them all with indifference my object being a radical cure of the evils by discontinuing the farm and not a mere assuagement of it for the present moment which rendering it more bearable might lessen the necessity of removing it totally  perhaps prevent that removal in the mean time the other branches of the farm rendered the renewal of the lease necessary and it being said to be too far advanced to have the article of tobacco separated from it  suspended it was signed in the month of march while i was in england with a clause which is usual that the king may discontinue when he pleases on certain conditions when i returned i found here a memorial from the merchants of lorient complaining of their having  000 hhds of tobo on hand and of the distresses they were under from the loss of this medium of remittance i enclosed it to the count de vergennes and asked his interference i saw him on the   d inst and spoke to him on the subject he told me there was to be a committee held the next day at berni the seat of the comptroller general  that he would attend it himself to have something done i asked him if i was to consider the expunging that article from the farm as desperate he said that the difficulty   0 of changing so antient an institution was immense that the king draws from it a revenue of    millions of livres that the interruption of this revenue at least if not a diminution would attend a change that their finances were not in a condition to bear even an interruption and in short that no minister could venture to take upon himself so hazardous an operation this was only saying explicitly what i had long been sensible of that the comptroller generals continuance in office was too much on a poise to permit him to shift this weight out of his own scale into that of his adversaries and that we must be contented to await the completion of the public expectation that there will be a change in this office which change may give us another chance for effecting this desirable reformation incidents enough will arise to keep this object in our view and to direct the attention to it as the only point on which the interests  harmony of the two countries so far as this article of their commerce may influence will ultimately find repose the committee met the next day the only question agitated was how best to relieve the trade under its double monopoly the committee found themselves supported by the presence and sentiments of the count de vergennes they therefore resolved that the contract with mr morris if executed on his part ought not to be annulled here but that no similar one should ever be made hereafter that so long as it continued the farmers should be obliged to purchase from twelve to   000 hhds of tobacco a year over and above what they should receive     from mr morris from such merchants as should bring it in french or american vessels on the same conditions contracted with mr morris providing however that where the cargo shall not be assorted the prices shall be   ♯   ♯    ♯ for the  st  d   d qualities of whichsoever the cargo may consist in case of dispute about the quality specimens are to be sent to the council who will appoint persons to examine and decide on it this is indeed the least bad of all the palliatives which have been proposed but it contains the seeds of perpetual trouble it is easy to foresee that the farmers will multiply difficulties and vexations on those who shall propose to sell to them by force and that these will be making perpetual complaints so that both parties will be kept on the fret if without fatiguing the friendly dispositions of the ministry this should give them just so much trouble as may induce them to look to the demolition of the monopoly as a desirable point of rest it may produce a permanent as well as temporary good this determination of the committee needs the kings order to be carried into effect i have been in hourly expectation of receiving official information that it is ultimately confirmed by him but as yet it is not come and the post will set out today should it arrive in time i will enclose it should it not arrive as i do not apprehend any danger of its being rejected or even altered materially seeing that m de vergennes approved of it  m de calonne acquiesced i have supposed you would wish to be apprized of its substance for a communication of which i am indebted to the m de la fayette     tho you cannot publish it formally till you know it is confirmed by the king yet an authoritative kind of notice may be given to the merchants to put them on their guard otherwise the merchants here having first knowledge of it may by their agents purchase up all the tabaccoes they have on hand at a low price  thus engross to themselves all the benefit in the same letter of january  d i mentioned that the rice of carolina compared with that of the mediterranean was better  dearer this was my own observation having examined both in the shops here where they are retailed further enquiries gave me reason to believe that the rice of carolina on its arrival is fouler  cheaper and that it is obliged to be cleaned here before it is saleable that this advances the price but at the same time the quality also beyond that of the mediterranean whether the trouble of this operation discourages the merchant or the price the consumer or whether the merchants of carolina have not yet learnt the way to this market i cannot tell i find in fact that but a small proportion of the rice consumed here is from the american market but the consumption of this article here is immense if the makers of american rice would endeavour to adapt the preparation of it to the taste of this country so as to give it over the mediterranean rice the advantage of which it seems susceptible it would very much increase the quantity for which they may find sale as far as i have been able to find it is received here on a favourable footing i shall reserve my letter open to the last moment in hopes of being able to put into it the     order of the king to the farmers general i have the honor of enclosing a copy of their contract with mr morris to which the resolution of the committee refers  to be with sentiments c c c thomas jefferson june        paris m la morleine to m la morleine j mss paris june        sir —it is six years since the paper money of new england has ceased to circulate as money it is considered at present as making a part of the national debt and that the holders of it will be entitled to receive from the public as much gold or silver as the paper money could have brought at the time it was received by the holder with an interest of   per cent per annum but as yet no precise arrangements have been taken for the paiment either of principal or interest most of the subjects of france having paper money have deposited it in the hands of the french minister or consul at new york that paiment may be demanded whenever it shall be provided by congress there are even speculators in america who will purchase it but they will give much less than it is worth as for myself i do not deal in it i am sir your very humble servt thomas jefferson june         paris baron stahe to the swedish ambassador at paris baron stahe j mss paris june         sir —in compliance with your excellencys desire i will throw on paper such considerations as occur to     me on the question how may the island of st bartholomews be rendered instrumental for promoting commerce between sweden and the united states they will be rapid undigested  incomplete but a desire of contributing to bind the two countries together in interest and a respect for your commands will induce me to hazard them i shall make the interests of sweden the basis of my theory because we have no right to expect her to depart from them in order to promote ours antient nations considered colonies principally as receptacles for a too numerous population and as natural  useful allies in times of war but modern nations viewing commerce as an object of first importance value colonies chiefly as instruments for the increase of that this is principally effected by their taking commodities from the mother state whether raised within herself or obtained elsewhere in the course of her trade  furnishing in return colonial productions necessary for her consumption or for her commerce of exchange with other nations in this way the colonies of spain portugal france and england have been chiefly subservient to the advantages of their mother country in this way too in a smaller degree has denmark derived utility from her american colonies and so also holland except as to the island of st eustatius this is by nature a rock barren and unproductive in itself but its owners became sensible that what nature had denied it policy could more than supply it was conveniently situated for carrying on contraband trade with both the continents  with the islands of     america they made it therefore an entrepot for all nations hither are brought the productions of every other part of america and the dutch give in exchange such articles as in the course of their commerce they can most advantageously gather up and it is a question on which they will not enable us to decide whether by furnishing american productions to the commerce of holland  by finding vent for such productions of the old world as the dutch merchants obtain to advantage the barren rock of saint eustatius does not give more activity to their commerce  leave with them greater profits than their more fertile possessions on the continent of south america the danes finding that their islands were capable of yielding but moderate advantages by their native productions have also laid them open to foreign commerce in order to draw thro them articles which they do not produce in themselves or not in great quantities but these nations only half emancipated from the fetters of commercial prejudicies have taken only half a step towards placing these institutions on their best footing both the dutch  danish free ports are under restrictions which discourage very much the operations of exchange in them the island of st bartholomew lately ceded to sweden is if i am rightly informed capable of furnishing little of its own productions to that country it remains then to make it the instrument for obtaining through its intermediation such american productions as sweden can consume or dispose of and for finding in return a vent for the native productions     of sweden let us suppose it then made a free port without a single restriction these consequences will follow   it will draw to itself that tide of commerce which at present sets towards the dutch and danish islands because vessels going to these are often obliged to negotiate a part of their cargoes at saint eustatius and to go to saint thomass to negotiate the residue whereas when they shall know that there is a port where all articles are free both for importation and exportation they will go to that port which enables them to perform by one voiage the exchanges which hitherto they could only effect by two   every species of american produce whether of the precious metals or commodities which sweden may want for its own consumption or as aliment for its own commerce with other nations will be collected either fairly or by contraband into the magazines of saint bartholomew   all the productions which sweden can furnish from within itself or obtain to advantage from other nations will in like manner be deposited in the magazines of st bartholomew and will be carried to the several ports of america in paiment for what shall be taken from them if it be objected that this unrestrained license will give opportunity to the subjects of other nations to carry on exchanges there in which sweden will be no ways interested i say   that there will be few of these operations into which the swedish merchants will not be taken in the beginning or in the long run   that there will be few of these exchanges into which swedish productions will not enter when productions of that nature are wanted in return   but     suppose neither swedish merchants nor productions enter into the operation what objections can sweden have to other peoples meeting in one of her ports to carry on their commercial exchanges on the contrary would not every enlightened nation be glad if all others would come to her as a common center for commercial operations if all the merchants who make the exchanges of commerce in amsterdam london lisbon leghorn etc would go by common consent to perform these operations in stockholm would that wise government obstruct such an assembly if all the exchanges now made in the several parts of the two continents  of the islands of america in philadelphia for instance charlestown st eustatius portobello rio janeiro were proposed to be transferred to the island of st bartholomew would that island be rendered thereby less able to promote the commerce of the mother country these general observations have anticipated the answer to our question how may the island of st bartholomew be rendered instrumental to the particular commerce between sweden and the united states the united states have much occasion for the productions of sweden particularly for its iron for a part of this they can furnish indigo rice tobacco and so far the exchange may be effected by the merchants of the two countries in the ports of the united states or of sweden the surplus of the want they cannot take at all unless sweden will administer to them the means of paying for it this she may do by receiving at st bartholomew whatever productions they will bring they will of     course send there flour saltfish  other things wanting in the other ports of america which by the swedish merchants at st bartholomew will run into those ports and exchanged for precious metals or commercial commodities or the american merchant taking on himself those operations will run his flour or salt fish into those ports himself take cash or such commercial articles as suit sweden  go with these to st bartholomew to pay for the iron he wants the interest of the united states then is that st bartholomew be made a port of unlimited freedom  such too is evidently the interest of sweden if it be freed by halves the freeports of other nations at present in possession of the commerce will retain it against any new port offering no superior advantages the situation of st bartholomew is very favorable to these views as it is among the most windward and therefore the most accessible of the west indian islands how far they may be seconded by the character of its port the government of sweden will best know as they have taken the necessary informations on that point unacquainted with the details of commerce i am able to present only general views of this subject they are such however as experience seems to have approved they may appear founded on a want of attention to the laws of society inconsistent with sound morality—but first let the line be drawn between the just and equal regulations of associated states and the partial and oppressive rescripts of metropolitan cupidity  we shall see whether the interloper or the legislator of chili  peru is on the     right side of that line they will need apology for another cause where it will be more difficult to be found that is as they offer nothing but what would have occurred  in a better form to yourself nobody is more sensible of this than myself and i can expect your indulgence only by praying you to consider them not as pretending to any information which you do not already possess but as the offerings of that perfect esteem  respect with which i have the honor to be your hble servt thomas jefferson june  0      paris william carmichael to william carmichael j mss paris june  0      dear sir —   i find that all the states had come into the impost except n york whose assembly were then sitting  it was thought would adopt it n hampshire massachusetts rho isld new jersey delaware  virginia have agreed to confer on congress the regulation of their trade  lest this disjointed method of proceeding should fail of its effect the latter has appointed commissioners  invited the other states to do the same to meet  settle an article of confederation for this purpose virginia has declared kentucky an independent state provided its inhabitants consent to it  congress will receive them into a union massachusetts has repealed so much of her navigation act as respected any foreign nation except gr britain contributions of money come slowly to the public treasury a committee of congress have drawn   0 a strong report on that subject which has produced a good effect in the states in a letter of mar  0 from dr franklin to me is this passage as to public affairs the congress has not been able to assemble more than   or   states during the whole winter so the treaty with prussia remains still unratified tho there is no doubt of its being done so soon as a full congress assembles which is expected next month the disposition to furnish congress with ample powers augments daily as people become more enlightened  i do not remember ever to have seen during my long life more signs of public felicity than appear at present throughout these states the cultivators of the earth who make the bulk of our nation have made good crops which are paid for at high prices with ready money the artisans too receive high wages  the value of all real estates is augmented greatly merchants  shopkeepers indeed complain that there is not business enough but this is evidently not owing to the fewness of buyers but to the too great number of sellers for the consumption of goods was never greater as appears by the dress furniture  manner of living of all ranks of the people his health is good except as to the stone which does not grow worse i thank you for your attention to my request about the books which mr barclay writes me he has forwarded from cadiz     thomas jefferson july        paris james monroe to james monroe j mss paris july        dear sir —i wrote you last on the  0th of may since which your favor of may    has come to hand the political world enjoys great quiet here the king of prussia is still living but like the snuff of a candle which sometimes seems out  then blazes up again some think that his death will not produce any immediate effect in europe his kingdom like a machine will go on for some time with the winding up he has given it the kings visit to cherbourg has made a great sensation in england  here it proves to the world that it is a serious object to this country and that the king commits himself for the accomplishment of it indeed so many cones have been sunk that no doubt remains of the practicability of it it will contain as is said  0 ships of the line be one of the best harbours in the world  by means of two entrances on different sides will admit vessels to come in and go out with every wind the effect of this in another war with england defies calculation having no news to communicate i will recur to the subjects of your letter of may    with respect to the new states were the question to stand simply in this form how may the ultramontane territory be disposed of so as to produce the greatest  most immediate benefit to the inhabitants of the maritime states of the union the plan would be more plausible of laying it off into two or three states only even on this view however there would still be something to be said against it which might render it at least doubtful but it is a question     which good faith forbids us to receive into discussion this requires us to state the question in its just form how may the territories of the union be disposed of so as to produce the greatest degree of happiness to their inhabitants with respect to the maritime states nothing or little remains to be done with respect then to the ultramontane states will their inhabitants be happiest divided into states of  0000 square miles not quite as large as pennsylvania or into states of   0000 square miles each that is to say three times as large as virginia within the alleghany they will not only be happier in states of a moderate size but it is the only way in which they can exist as a regular society considering the american character in general that of those people particularly and the energetic nature of our governments a state of such extent as   0000 square miles would soon crumble into little ones these are the circumstances which reduce the indians to such small societies they would produce an effect on our people similar to this they would not be broken into such small pieces because they are more habituated to subordination  value more a government of regular law but you would surely reverse the nature of things in making small states on the ocean  large ones beyond the mountains if we could in our consciences say that great states beyond the mountains will make the people happiest we must still ask whether they will be contented to be laid off into large states they certainly will not and if they decide to divide themselves we are not able to restrain them they will end by separating from our     confederacy  becoming its enemies we had better then look forward  see what will be the probable course of things this will surely be a division of that country into states of a small or at most of a moderate size if we lay them off into such they will acquiesce and we shall have the advantage of arranging them so as to produce the best combinations of interest what congress has already done in this matter is an argument the more in favour of the revolt of those states against a different arrangement and of their acquiescence under a continuance of that upon this plan we treat them as fellow citizens they will have a just share in their own government they will love us  pride themselves in an union with us upon the other we treat them as subjects we govern them  not they themselves they will abhor us as masters  break off from us in defiance i confess to you that i can see no other turn that these two plans would take but i respect your opinion and your knowledge of the country too much to be ever confident in my own i thank you sincerely for your communication that my not having sooner given notice of the arrets relative to fish gave discontent to some persons these are the most friendly offices you can do me because they enable me to justify myself if i am right or correct myself if wrong if those who thought i might have been remiss would have written to me on the subject i should have loved them for their candour  thanked them for it for i have no jealousies nor resentments at things of this kind where i have no reason to believe they have been excited     by a hostile spirit  i suspect no such spirit in a single member of congress you know there were two arrets the first of aug  0      the  d of the   th    th of september      as to the first it would be a sufficient justification of myself to say that it was in the time of my predecessor nine months before i came into office  that there was no more reason for my giving information of it when i did come into office than of all the other transactions which preceded that period but this would seem to lay a blame on dr franklin for not communicating it which i am conscious he did not deserve this government affects a secrecy in all its transactions whatsoever tho they be of a nature not to admit a perfect secrecy their arrets respecting the islands go to those islands and are unpublished  unknown in france except in the bureau where they are formed that of aug      would probably be communicated to the merchants of the seaport towns also but paris having no commercial connections with them if anything makes its way from a seaport town to paris it must be by accident we have indeed agents in these seaports but they value their offices so little that they do not trouble themselves to inform us of what is passing there as a proof that these things do not transpire here nor are easily got at recollect that mr adams dr franklin and myself were all here on the spot together from aug      to june      that is to say  0 months and yet not one of us knew of the arret of aug      september             the second was passed      here alone i became responsible i think it was about   weeks before i got notice of it that is in november on the  0th of that month writing to count de vergennes on another subject i took occasion to remonstrate to him on that but from early in november when the fitzhughs went to america i had never a confidential opportunity of writing to mr jay from hence directly for several months in a letter of dec    to mr jay i mentioned to him the want of opportunity to write to him confidentially which obliged me at that moment to write by post via london  on such things only as both post offices were welcome to see on the  d january mr bingham setting out for london i wrote to mr jay sending him a copy of my letter to ct de vergennes and stating something which had passed in conversation on the same subject i prayed mr bingham to take charge of the letter  either to send it by a safe hand or carry it himself as circumstances should render most advisable i believe he kept it to carry himself he did not sail from london till about the   th of march nor arrived in america till about the middle of may thus you see what causes had prevented a letter which i had written on the  0th of november from getting to america till the month of may no wonder then if notice of this arret came first to you by way of the w indies and in general i am confident that you will receive notice of the regulations of this country respecting their islands by the way of those islands before you will from hence nor can this be remedied but by a system of bribery which would end in the corruption of your     own ministers  produce no good adequate to the expense be so good as to communicate these circumstances to the persons who you think may have supposed me guilty of remissness on this occasion i will turn to a subject more pleasing to both and give you my sincere congratulations on your marriage your own dispositions and the inherent comforts of that state will insure you a great addition of happiness long may you live to enjoy it  enjoy it in full measure the interest i feel in

prussian treaty immediately as the time for exchange of ratifications is drawing to a close tell me what is to be done and how this exchange is to be made we may as well have this settled between us before the arrival of the ratification that no time may be lost after that i learn through the marechal de castries that he has information of new yorks having ceded the impost in the form desired by congress so as to close this business corrections in the acts of maryland pennsylvania c will come of course we have taken up again the affair of whale oil that they may know in time in america what is to be done in it i fear we shall not obtain any farther abatement of duties but the last abatement will be continued for three years the whole duties payable here are nearly  0  livres on the english ton which is an atom more than four guineas according to the present exchange the monopoly of the purchase of tobacco for this country which had been obtained by robert morris had thrown the commerce of that article in agonies he had been able to reduce the price in america from  0 to     lawful the hundred weight and all other merchants being deprived of that medium of remittance the commerce between america  that country so far as it depended on that article which was very capitally too was absolutely ceasing an order has been obtained obliging the farmers general to purchase from such other merchants as shall offer   000 hogsheads of tobacco at           livres     the hundred according to the quality and to grant to the sellers in other respects the same terms as they had granted to robert morris as this agreement with morris is the basis of this order i send you some copies of it which i will thank you to give to any american not british merchants in london who may be in that line during the year this contract has subsisted virginia  maryland have lost  00000£ by the reduction of the price of their tobacco i am meditating what step to take to provoke a

been honored with a letter from m delisle lt gl au bailliage de laën to which is annexed a postscript from yourself being unable to write in french so as to be sure of conveying my true meaning or perhaps any meaning at all i will beg of you to interpret what i have now the honor to write it is time that the united states generally  most of the separate states in particular are endeavoring to establish means to pay the interest of their public debts regularly  to sink its principal by degrees     but as yet their efforts have been confined to that part of their debts which is evidenced by certificates i do not think that any state has yet taken measures for paying their paper money debt the principle on which it shall be paid i take to be settled tho not directly yet virtually by the resolution of congress of june  d      that is that they will pay the holder or his representatives what the money was worth at the time he received it with an interest from that time of   per cent per annum it is not said in the letter whether the money received by barboutin was continental money or virginia money nor is it said at what time it was received but that m delisle may be enabled to judge what the      dollars were worth in hard money when barboutin received them i will state to you what was the worth of one hard dollar both in continental  virginia money through the whole of the year          0 within some part of which it was probably received continental money                 virginia money     —jan            00     —jan           0—jan                jan           00

have the honor to be dear sir your most obedient humble servt thomas jefferson july         paris marquis de la fayette to the marquis de la fayette j mss paris july         dear sir —i have now the honour of inclosing to you an estimate of the exports  imports of the united states calculations of this kind cannot pretend to accuracy where inattention and fraud combine to suppress their objects approximation is all that they can aim at neither care nor candour have been wanting on my part to bring them as near the truth as my skill and materials would enable me to do i have availed myself of the best documents from the custom houses which have been given to the public and have been able to rectify these in many instances by information collected by myself on the spot in many of the states still remember however that i call them but approximations and     that they must present some errors as considerable as they were unavoidable our commerce divides itself into european  west indian i have conformed my statement to this division on running over the catalogue of american imports france will naturally mark out those articles with which she could supply us to advantage  she may safely calculate that after a little time shall have enabled us to get rid of our present incumbrances and of some remains of attachment to the particular forms of manufacture to which we have been habituated we shall take those articles which she can furnish on as good terms as other nations to whatever extent she will enable us to pay for them it is her interest therefore as well as ours to multiply the means of paiment these must be found in the catalogue of our exports  among these will be seen neither gold nor silver we have no mines of either of these metals produce therefore is all we can offer some articles of our produce will be found very convenient to this country for her own consumption others will be convenient as being more commerciable in her hands than those she will give in exchange for them if there be any which she can neither consume nor dispose of by exchange she will not buy them of us and of course we shall not bring them to her if american produce can be brought into the ports of france the articles of exchange for it will be taken in those ports  the only means of drawing it hither is to let the merchant see that he can dispose of it on better terms here than anywhere     else if the market price of this country does not in itself offer this superiority it may be worthy of consideration whether it should be obtained by such abatements of duties and even by such other encouragements as the importance of the article may justify should some loss attend this in the beginning it can be discontinued when the trade shall be well established in this channel with respect to the west india commerce i must apprise you that this estimate does not present its present face no materials have enabled us to say how it stands since the war we can only shew what it was before that period new regulations have changed our situation there much for the worse this is most sensibly felt in the exports of fish and flour the surplus of the former which these regulations throw back on us is forced to europe where by increasing the quantity it lessens the price the surplus of the latter is sunk and to what other objects this portion of industry is turned or turning i am not able to discover the imports too of sugar  coffee are thrown under great difficulties these increase the price and being articles of food for the poorer class as you may be sensible on observing the quantities consumed a small increase of price places them above the reach of this class which being very numerous must occasion a great diminution of consumption it remains to see whether the american will endeavour to baffle these new restrictions in order to indulge his habits or will adapt his habits to other objects which may furnish emploiment to the surplus of industry formerly occupied in raising     that bread which no longer finds a vent in the west indian market if instead of either of these measures he should resolve to come to europe for coffee  sugar he must lessen equivalently his consumption of some other european articles in order to pay for his coffee  sugar the bread with which he formerly paid for them in the west indies not being demanded in the european market in fact the catalogue of imports offers several articles more dispensable than coffee  sugar of all these subjects the committee and yourself are the more competent judges to you therefore i trust them with every wish for their improvement  with sentiments of that perfect esteem  respect with which i have the honour to be dear sir your most obedient  most humble servt

to mrs john abigail adams j mss paris aug        dear madam —it is an age since i have had the honor of a letter from you and an age and a half since i presumed to address one to you i think my last was dated in the reign of king amri but under which of his successors you wrote i cannot recollect ocharias zoachar manahem or some such hard name at length it is resumed i am honoured with your favor of july    and i am at this moment writing an answer to it and first we will despatch business the shoes you ordered will be ready this day and will accompany the present letter but why send money for them you know the balance of trade was always against me you will observe by the inclosed account that it is i who am to export cash always tho the sum has been lessened by the bad bargains i have made for you  the good ones you     have made for me this is a gaining trade and therefore i shall continue it begging you will send no more money here be so good as to correct the inclosed that the errors of that may not add to your losses in this commerce—you were right in conjecturing that both the gentlemen might forget to communicate to me the intelligence about captn stanhope mr adams head was full of whale oil and colo smiths of german politics —but dont tell them this— so they left it to you to give me the news de tout mon coeur i had rather receive it from you than them this proposition about the exchange of a son for my daughter puzzles me i should be very glad to have your son but i cannot part with my daughter thus you see i have such a habit of gaining in trade with you that i always expect it we have a blind story here of somebody attempting to assassinate your king no man upon earth has my prayers for his continuance in life more sincerely than him he is truly the american messias the most precious life that ever god gave and may god continue it twenty long years has he been labouring to drive us to our good and he labours and will labour still for it if he can be spared we shall have need of him for twenty more the prince of wales on the throne lansdown  fox in the ministry  we are undone we become chained by our habits to the tails of those who hate  dispise us i repeat it then that my anxieties are all alive for the health and long life of the king he has not a friend on earth who would lament his loss as much  so long as i should—here we have singing dancing     laugh  merriment no assassinations no treasons rebellions nor other dark deeds when our king goes out they fall down and kiss the earth where he has trodden and then they go to kissing one another and this is the truest wisdom they have as much happiness in one year as an englishman in ten the presence of the queens sister enlivens the court still more the birth of the princess there are some little bickerings between the king  his parliament but they end with a sic volo sic jubes the bottom of my page tells me it is time for me to end with assurances of the affectionate esteem with which i have the honor to be dear madam your most obedient  most humble servant thomas jefferson aug         paris james monroe to james monroe  j mss paris aug         dear sir —i wrote you last on the  th of july  since that have received yours of the   th of june with the interesting intelligence it contained i was entirely in the dark as to the progress of that negotiation and concur entirely in the views you have taken of it  the difficulty on which it hangs is a sine qua non with us it would be to deceive them  ourselves to suppose that an amity can be preserved while this right is withheld such a supposition would argue not only an ignorance of the people to whom this is most interesting but an ignorance of     the nature of man or an inattention to it those who see but half way into our true interest will think that that concurs with the views of the other party but those who see it in all its extent will be sensible that our true interest will be best promoted by making all the just claims of our fellow citizens wherever situated our own by urging  enforcing them with the weight of our whole influence  by exercising in this as in every other instance a just government in their concerns  making common cause even where our separate interest would seem opposed to theirs no other conduct can attach us together  on this attachment depends our happiness the king of prussia still lives and is even said to be better europe is very quiet at present the only germ of dissension which shews itself at present is in the quarter of turkey the emperor the empress  the venetians seem all to be pecking at the turks it is not probable however that either of the two first will do anything to bring on an open rupture while the k of prussia lives you will perceive by the letters i inclose to mr jay that lambe under the pretext of ill health declines returning either to congress mr adams or myself this circumstance makes me fear some malversation the money appropriated to this object being in holland  having been always under the care of mr adams it was concerted between us that all the draughts should be on him i know not therefore what sums may have been advanced to lambe i hope however nothing great i am persuaded that an angel sent on this business  so much limited in his terms     could have done nothing but should congress propose to try the line of negotiation again i think they will perceive that lambe is not a proper agent i have written to mr adams on the subject of a settlement with lambe there is little prospect of accommodation between the algerines  the portuguese  neapolitans a very valuable capture too lately made by them on the empress of russia bids fair to draw her on them the probability is therefore that these three nations will be at war with them  the possibility that could we furnish a couple of frigates a convention might be formed with those powers establishing a perpetual cruise on the coast of algiers which would bring them to reason  such a convention being left open to all powers willing to come into it should have for its object a general peace to be guaranteed to each by the whole were only two or three to begin a confederacy of this kind i think every power in europe would soon fall into it except france england  perhaps spain  holland of these there is only england who would give any real aid to the algerines morocco you perceive will be at peace with us were the honour  advantage of establishing such a confederacy out of the question yet the necessity that the u s should have some marine force  the happiness of this as the ostensible cause for beginning it would decide on its propriety it will be said there is no money in the treasury there never will be money in the treasury till the confederacy shows its teeth the states must see the rod perhaps it must be felt by   0 some one of them i am persuaded all of them would rejoice to see every one obliged to furnish its contributions it is not the difficulty of furnishing them which beggars the treasury but the fear that others will not furnish as much every rational citizen must wish to see an effective instrument of coercion  should fear to see it on any other element but the water a naval force can never endanger our liberties nor occasion bloodshed a land force would do both it is not in the choice of the states whether they will pay money to cover their trade against the algerines if they obtain a peace by negotiation they must pay a great sum of money for it if they do nothing they must pay a great sum of money in the form of insurance and in either way as great a one  probably less effectual than in the way of force i look forward with anxiety to the approaching moment of your departure from congress besides the interest of the confederacy  of the state i have a personal interest in it i know not to whom i may venture confidential communications after you are gone lee i scarcely know grayson is lazy carrington is industrious but not always as discreet as wellmeaning yet on the whole i believe he would be the best if you find him disposed to the correspondence engage him to begin it i take the liberty of placing here my respects to mrs monroe and assurances of the sincere esteem with which i am dear sir your friend  servant     thomas jefferson aug         paris george wythe to george wythe j mss paris august         dear sir —your favors of jan  0  feb  0 came to hand on the  0th   d of may i availed myself of the first opportunity which occurred by a gentleman going to england of sending to mr joddrel a copy of the notes on our country with a line informing him that it was you who had emboldened me to take that liberty madison no doubt informed you of the reason why i had sent only a single copy to virginia being assured by him that they will not do the harm i had apprehended but on the contrary may do some good i propose to send thither the copies remaining on hand which are fewer than i had intended but of the numerous corrections they need there are one or two so essential that i must have them made by printing a few new leaves  substituting them for the old this will be done while they are engraving a map which i have constructed of the country from albemarle sound to lake erie  which will be inserted in the book a bad french translation which is getting out here will probably oblige me to publish the original more freely which it neither deserved nor was ever intended your wishes which are laws to me will justify my destining a copy for you otherwise i should as soon have thought of sending you a hornbook for there is no truth there that which is not familiar to you and its errors i should hardly have proposed to treat you with immediately on the receipt of your letter i wrote to a correspondent at florence to inquire after the     family of tagliaferro as you desired i received his answer two days ago a copy of which i now inclose the original shall be sent by some other occasion i will have the copperplate immediately engraved this may be ready within a few days but the probability is that i shall be long getting an opportunity of sending it to you as these rarely occur you do not mention the size of the plate but presuming it is intended for labels for the inside of books i shall have it made of a proper size for that i shall omit the word agisos according to the license you allow me because i think the beauty of a motto is to condense much matter in as few words as possible the word omitted will be supplied by every reader the european papers have announced that the assembly of virginia were occupied on the revisal of their code of laws this with some other similar intelligence has contributed much to convince the people of europe that what the english papers are constantly publishing of our anarchy is false as they are sensible that such a work is that of a people only who are in perfect tranquillity our act for freedom of religion is extremely applauded the ambassadors  ministers of the several nations of europe resident at this court have asked of me copies of it to send to their sovereigns and it is inserted at full length in several books now in the press among others in the new encyclopedie i think it will produce considerable good even in these countries where ignorance superstition poverty  oppression of body  mind in every form are so firmly settled on the mass of the people that their redemption from     them can never be hoped if the almighty had begotten a thousand sons instead of one they would not have sufficed for this task if all the sovereigns of europe were to set themselves to work to emancipate the minds of their subjects from their present ignorance  prejudices  that as zealously as they now endeavor the contrary a thousand years would not place them on that high ground on which our common people are now setting out ours could not have been so fairly put into the hands of their own common sense had they not been separated from their parent stock  kept from contamination either from them or the other people of the old world by the intervention of so wide an ocean to know the worth of this one must see the want of it here i think by far the most important bill in our whole code is that for the diffusion of knowlege among the people no other sure foundation can be devised for the preservation of freedom and happiness if anybody thinks that kings nobles or priests are good conservators of the public happiness send them here it is the best school in the universe to cure them of that folly they will see here with their own eyes that these descriptions of men are an abandoned confederacy against the happiness of the mass of the people the omnipotence of their effect cannot be better proved than in this country particularly where notwithstanding the finest soil upon earth the finest climate under heaven and a people of the most benevolent the most gay and amiable character of which the human form is susceptible where such a people i say surrounded by so many     blessings from nature are yet loaded with misery by kings nobles and priests and by them alone preach my dear sir a crusade against ignorance establish  improve the law for educating the common people let our countrymen know that the people alone can protect us against these evils and that the tax which will be paid for this purpose is not more than the thousandth part of what will be paid to kings priests  nobles who will rise up among us if we leave the people in ignorance the people of england i think are less oppressed than here but it needs but half an eye to see when among them that the foundation is laid in their dispositions for the establishment of a despotism nobility wealth  pomp are the objects of their adoration they are by no means the freeminded people we suppose them in america their learned men too are few in number and are less learned and infinitely less emancipated from prejudice than those of this country an event too seems to be preparing in the order of things which will probably decide the fate of that country it is no longer doubtful that the harbour of cherburg will be complete that it will be a most excellent one  capacious enough to hold the whole navy of france nothing has ever been wanting to enable this country to invade that but a naval force conveniently stationed to protect the transports this change of situation must oblige the english to keep up a great standing army and there is no king who with sufficient force is not always ready to make himself absolute my paper warns me it is time to recommend myself to the     friendly recollection of mrs wythe of colo tagliaferro  his family  particularly of mr r t and to assure you of the affectionate esteem with which i am dear sir your friend and servt thomas jefferson aug         paris francis hopkinson to francis hopkinson j mss paris aug         dear sir    after the present then i shall still be a letter in your debt one would think that this balance did not justify a scold the manner of curing the essence dorient is as you are apprised kept secret here there is no getting at it therefore openly a friend has undertaken to try whether it can be obtained either by proposing the partnership you mention or by finding out the process you shall have the result of these endeavors i think i sent you in january the  th   th volumes of the bibliotheque physicoeccononique which are the last published i have for yourself and dr franklin the   th    th livraisons of the encyclopedie  expect the   th will come out very soon these will form a respectable package  shall then be forwarded i will send as you propose copies of my notes to the philosophical society and the city library as soon as i shall have received a map which i have constructed for them  which is now engraving this will be a map of the country from albemarle sound to lake erie as exact as the materials hitherto published would enable me to make it  brought into a     single sheet i have with great impatience hoped to receive from some of my friends a particular description of the southern  western limits of pennsylvania perhaps it might still come in time if you could send it to me in the moment almost of your receiving this indeed it would be very desirable if you could only write me an answer to these two queries viz how far westward of f pitt does the western line of pennsylvania pass at what point of the river ohio does that line strike it should this arrive even after they shall have begun to strike off the map i can have the plate altered so as that the latter copies shall give that line right mr rittenhouse will have the goodness to furnish you answers to these queries could you prevail on him to answer this also when will the lunarium be done—i envy your wednesday evenings entertainments with him  dr franklin they would be more valued by me than the whole week at paris—will you be so good as to send me a copy of a botanical book  published by some person in the country not far from philadelphia whose name i have not heard it is a description of the plants of pennsylvania i have nothing new to communicate to you either in the arts or sciences our countryman trumbul is here a young painter of the most promising talents he brought with him his battle of bunkers hill  death of montgomery to have them engraved here  we may add to have them sold for like dr ramseys history they are too true to suit the english palate he returned last night from examining the     kings collection of paintings at versailles and acknoleges it surpassed not only every thing he had seen but every idea he had ever formed of this art i persuade him to fix himself here awhile  then proceed to rome my daughter is well and joins me in respects to her  your common mother to your lady  family also as well as to our friends of the other house meaning mr rittenhouses be assured yourself of the perfect esteem with which i am dear sir your friend and servant thomas jefferson aug         paris charles gravier comte de vergennes to the french minister of foreign relations charles gravier comte de vergennes j mss paris le    aoust      monsieur —dans lentretien dont votre excellence mhonora il y a quelques jours sur limportance détablir dés à present le commerce entre la france et lamérique sur le meillure pied possible entr autres objets de ce commerce le tabac fut cité comme susceptible dun plus grand encouragement  advantage pour les deux nations continuellement dans la necessité de rectifier ce que je dis dans une langue que je parle si imparfaitement je prierai v e de me permettre détablir en anglais la substance de ce que jeus lhonneur de lui observer en ajoutant quelques détails plus particuliers digne de son attention je trouve que la consommation du tabac en france est evaluée de    à  0 millions pésant lestimation la plus probable la fixe cependant à    millions qui à raison de   sols la livre rendu dans un port de     france selevent à     00000♯ jevalue a  s par livre le prix de main dœuvre des differents manufactures     00000  le revenu quen retire s m seleve à peu moins de  0000000   —————— ce qui en porte le prix total    00000  mais il est vendu aux consommateurs à raison de  ♯ la livre faisant   000000   —————— il reste donc pour les frais de levée    00000♯  —————— ce qui fait à un sixième près autant que le roi reçoit  porté à près dune moitié les frais de levée de lautre ce serait une presumption de ma part ètant etranger de supposer mes calculs parfaitement exacts je les ai tirés des meilleurs autorités  les plus désintéressées que jai pu trouver v e verra jusqua quel point ils peuvent être erronés  quelque considerable que soit lerreur je suis persuadé quaprès la plus stricte ratification elle trouvera que la levée de cette branche de revenu absorbe encore trop jespere que v e trouvera ma justification de faire ces remarques dans le desir que jai daméliorer le commerce entre les deux nations  dans les avantages que mon pays retirera de cette amélioration le monopole de lechat du tabac en france décourage également les négocians français  américains de ly apporter  de prendre en échange des objèts de manufactures  productions de france il nest pas moins contraire à lesprit du commerce     quaux dispositions des négocians de porter une denrée à un marché ou une seule personne a le droit de lacheter  y fixe consequemment un prix dont le vendeur est obligé de se contenter ou bien de remporter sa denrée en perdant son voyage daprès cela lexperience fait voir quils la portent à dautres marchés  quils reçoivent en échange des marchandises du pays ou ils la vendent je ne sais pas trop si la france na pas eté fournie par une nation voisine de quantités considerables de tabac depuis la paix  obligée de payer en argent ce qui auroit pu lêtre en objèts de manufactures si les negocians françois et américains avoient apporté le tabac directement ici je suppose aussi que les achats faits par les fermiers généraux en amérique sont payés pour la plupart grande partie en argent que cet argent est remis directement dici en angleterre  fait une partie essentielle de la balance de ce que a fourni par cette nation contra celleci quand mème pour satisfaire le gouvernement à cet égard les fermiers généraux soit par eux mêmes soit par la compagnie quils chargeraient de lemplette de ces tabacs en amérique exiguant lexportation proportionnée de marchandises de france pour donner en échange ce serait un expedient inutile  qui ne ferait que livrer au monopole les exportations ainsi que les importations entre la france  lamérique car assurés de ne point avoir de rivaux dans la vente des marchandises de france ils ne les vendraient vraisemblablement pas à des prix assez moderés pour en encourager la consommation  les mettres à même de soutenir la concurrence avec des articles semblables venant   0 dautres pays je suis persuadé quon peut éviter cette exportation dargent  y substituer celle des denrées en laissant les deux opérations aux negocians français  américains au lieu des fermiers généraux ils importeront une quantité suffisante de tabac si on leur accorde une parfaite liberté pour la vente  ils recevront en payement des vins des huiles des eaux de vie  des produits des manufactures au lieu dargent ils se forceront lun lautre par la concurrence à porter des tabacs de la meilleure qualité à donner aux manufacturiers français en entier equivalent de leurs marchandises  à les vendre aux consommateurs américains au plus bas prix quils pourront accorder en les encourageant ainsi à les consommer de préférence aux marchandises des autres pays il nest pas necessaire dencourager cet échange par aucun sacrifice des revenus du roi je nentends point avancer ici rien qui puisse nuire soit a s m soit à son peuple au contraire le moyen que jai lhonneur de proposer augmentera le revenu du roi en rendant meilleure la condition des vendeurs  des acheteurs il ne m apportient point de dire quel système de levée serait plus analogue à lorganisation de ce gouvernement ou si lon ne pourrait pas tirer quelques lumières utiles de la practique du pays qui à eté jusquici le principal entrepôt de cette denrée son système est simple  peu dispendieux celui qui importe y paye en entier le droit dû au roi  comme il serait incommode pour lui de le faire avant davoir vendu son tabac il lui est permis de le déposer dans les magasins du roi sous la garde des officers royaux aussitôt quil a vendu il va avec     lacheteur au magasin  largent est divisé entre le roi  lui chacun ce qui lui revient  lacheteur enleve le tabac le payement des droits du roi est ainsi assuré en argent comptant je ne scaurais dire quels çont les frais de levée mais certainement ils ne doivent pas exceder  ♯ par tonneau de  000♯ peasant le gouvernement y leve un plus fort droit sur le tabac quici cependant tel est lattrait et lavantage dune entière liberté pour la vente que le negociant porte lá son tabac  trouve son compte à ly porter si par une simplification de la levée des droits du roi sur le tabac on pouvait en reduire les frais même à   p  ou à un million  demi au lieu de    millions le prix pour le consommateur serait reduit de  ♯ à  ♯ la livre car voici comme je calcule prix frais de manufacture  revenu sur    millions pesant de tabac fixé comme cidessus    00000♯   p  sur  0000000♯ frais de levée     00000  —————— produit que payerait le consommateur à raison denviron  ♯ la livre    00000 mais il paye maintenant à  ♯ la livre   000000  —————— la difference est de    00000 au moyen de cette réduction dun tiers du prix il serait à la portée dune nouvelle  nombreuse classe du peuple qui ne peut maintenant se procurer cet objet de luxe  la consommation augmenterait probablement dans une proportion égale à la réduction du prix si non dans une plus grande cest à dire de    à    millions de livres et le roi continuant à recevoir   s par lb comme à présent recevrait    millions au lieu de  0 tandis que ses sujets ne payeraient     que  ♯ ce qui jusquici leur en a coûté   cu si par évenément la consommation naugmentait pas il ne leverait sur ses peuples que    millions au lieu de     laisserait dans leur bourses    millions soit pour y rester soit pour être levés dune autre manière si létat de ses revenus lexigeait il mettrait en même tems ses sujets à même de placer pour   à  0 millions de plus de leurs denrées  manufactures au lieu denvoyer annuellement à peu près cette somme en argent pour enrichir une nation voisine jai entendu faire deux objections à la suppression de ce monopole  ° que cela pourrait augmenter limportation de tabac en contrebande  ° que cela diminuerait les moyens des fermiersgénéraux pour les prêts dargent quils font occasionellement au trésor public ceux qui connoissent mieux que moi les détails  les circonstances de ce pays répondront sûrement mieux que je ne scaurais le faire à ces deux objections quant à la première je remarquerai cependant que la contrebande ne peut pas augmenter par la diminution de ses appas elle est presentement encouragée en ce que pouvant vendre  0s ce qui nen coûte que    elle offre un bénéfice de   s lorsque le prix sera reduit de  0s à  0s ce bénéfice ne sera plus que de   s cest à dire peu plus de la moitié de ce quil est actuellement la conséquence ne paroit donc pas naturelle que la contrebande doive augmenter par la réduction de près de moitié de ses profits quant à la seconde objection en supposant pour éclaircissement  sans prétendre la fixer la proportion     de la ferme sur le tabac à un huitième de la masse entière des fermes les moyens des fermiers généraux pour prêter seront reduits dun  me cest à dire quils ne pourront par la suite prêter que sept millions tandis que par le passé ils en prêtaient huit or il reste à considérer si ce  me ou telle autre proportion que ce soit mérite le sacrifice annuel de    millions ou si un sacrifice beaucoup moindre en faveur de quelqu autre capitaliste ne procurerait pas les mêmes prêts dargent par la voie ordinaire tandis quune augmentation de revenu pour la couronne une diminution dimpôt sur le peuple  un paiement en marchandises au lieu dargent sont les avantages que doivent vraisemblablement résulter pour la france de la suppression du monopole sur le tabac nous avons aussi lieu den espérer quelques avantages de nôtre côté  ce nest que cet espoir seul que pourroit me justifier dentrer dans les présents détails je ne mattends point quau nombre de ces avantages soit celui dune augmentation de prix les autres marchés deurope ont trop dinfluence sur cet article pour pouvoir se flater daucune augmentation sensible de prix mais le principal avantage que jen attends est une augmentation de consommation qui en nous ouvrant un plus grand débouché procurera en conséquence de lemploi à un plus grand nombre de cultivateurs  la même proportion daugmentation en notre faveur de cette denrée sera infailliblement celle du débouché additionel qui souvrira aux marchandises de france  à lemploi des bras qui les produisent jespère aussi quen attirant ici nos negocians ils pourront prendre     en échange plusieurs marchandises de meilleure qualité  a meilleur prix jajoute avec sincérité que mon cœur est vivement touché de lespoir ultérieur quen liant les deux nations dintérêts ce sera les lier plus étroitement encore damitié dans le vrai il nexiste pas deux pays plus propres aux échanges de commerce la france a besoin de riz de tabac de potasse de fourrures  de bois de construction nous avons besoin de vins dhuiles des eauxdevie  dobjets de manufactures il règne entre les deux peuples une affection qui les porter à se favoriser lun lautre s ils ne se rejoignent donc pas dans

read with very great satisfaction the sheets of your work on the commerce of france  the united states which you were so good as to put into my hands i think you treat the subject as far as these sheets go in an excellent manner were i to select any particular passages as giving me particular satisfaction it would be those wherein you prove to the united states that they will be more virtuous more free  more happy emploied in agriculture than as carriers or manufacturers it is a truth and a precious one for them if they could be persuaded of it i am also particularly pleased with your introduction you have properly observed that we can no longer be called angloamericans that appellation now describes only the inhabitants of nova scotia canada c i had applied that of federoamericans to our citizens as it would not be so decent for us to assume to ourselves the flattering appellation of freeamericans there are two passages in this work on which i am able to give information the first is in page    ils auront le coton quand ils voudront se livrer à ce genre de culture     and in the note lon voit dans la baie de massachusetts c the four southernmost states make a great deal of cotton their poor are almost entirely clothed in it in winter  summer in winter they wear shirts of it  outer clothing of cotton  wool mixed in summer their shirts are linnen but the outer clothing cotton the dress of the women is almost entirely of cotton manufactured by themselves except the richer class and even many of these wear a good deal of homespun cotton it is as well manufactured as the calicoes of europe these   states furnish a great deal of cotton to the states north of them who cannot make it as being too cold there is no neighborhood in any part of the united states without a watergristmill for grinding the corn of the neighborhood virginia maryland delaware pennsylvania new jersey new york abound with large manufacturing mills for the exportation of flour there are abundance of sawmills in all the states furnaces and forges of iron i believe in every state i know they are in the nine northernmost there are many mills for plating  slitting iron and i think there are many distilleries of rum from norfolk in virginia to portsmouth in new hampshire i mention these circumstances because your note seems to imply that these things are only in the particular states you mention the second passage is pages  0    0  where you speak of the ravages causés par l abus des eaux de vie which seems by the note in page  0  to be taken on authority of smith nothing can be less true than what that author says on this subject and     we may say in general that there are as many falsehoods as facts in his work i think drunkenness is much more common in all the american states than in france but it is less common there than in england you may form an idea from this of the state of it in america smith saw everything thro the medium of strong prejudice besides this he does not hesitate to write palpable lies which he was conscious were such when you proceed to form your table of american exports  imports i make no doubt you will consult the american traveller  the estimates in which are nearer the truth than those of ld sheffield  deane as far as my knowlege of the facts enables me to judge i must beg your pardon for having so long detained these sheets i did not finish my american dispatches till the night before last  was obliged yesterday to go to versailles i have the honour to be with very great respect sir your most obedient  most humble servant

highly the writings and talents of the count de mirabeau and his disposition to exert them for the good of mankind takes the     liberty of inclosing him the original and a translation of an act  of one of the legislatures of the american republics with which the count de mirabeau was probably not acquainted when he wrote the above paragraph it is part of that general reformation of their laws on which those republics have been occupied since the establishment of peace and independance among them the count de mirabeau will perhaps be able on some occasion to avail mankind of this example of emancipating human reason thomas jefferson aug         paris charles gysbert to charles gysbert count van hogendorp j mss paris august         sir —your favour of the  d instant has been duly received and i employ the first moment which has been at my disposal to answer it the author of the part of the new encyclopedie which relates to political economy having asked of me materials for the article etat unis stating a number of questions relative to them i answered them as minutely  exactly as was in my power he has from these compiled the greater part of that article i take the liberty of inclosing you one of them which will give you all the details to which your letter refers i can even refer you to the pages which answer your several questions   qu—what is the extent of the congress power in managing the affairs of the u states    the  th   th articles of the confederation will     explain these powers those which it is thought they still need you will find indicated in this pamphlet pa     0 and in page   –  their powers of coercion    qu—what are the expenses of congress    ans—pages   –  and   –     qu—which the revenues    ans—as yet they have no standing revenues they have asked standing revenues as shall be noted under a subsequent question in the meantime they call annually for the sums necessary for the federal government see pages          qu—in which way do the particular states contribute to the general expenses    ans—congress once a year calculate the sum necessary the succeeding year to pay the interest of their debt and to defray the expenses of the federal government this sum they then apportion on the several states according to the table page   a and the states then raise each its part by such taxes as they think proper    qu—are general duties to be levied by congress still expected to be acquiesced to by the states    ans—see page  0 a new york the only state which had not granted the impost of   per cent has done it at a late session but has reserved to herself the appointment of the collectors congress will not receive it upon that condition it is believed that new york will recede from this condition still a   0 difficulty will remain the impost of   per cent not being deemed sufficient to pay the interest of our whole debt foreign  domestic congress asked at the same time that is in      supplementary funds to make good the deficiency several of the states have not yet provided those supplementary funds some of those which have provided them have declared that the impost  supplementary fund shall commence only when all the states have granted both congress have desired those states to uncouple the grants so that each may come into force separately as soon as it is given by all the states pennsylvania has declined this saying that if the impost be granted alone as that will do little more than pay the interest of the foreign debt the other states will be less urgent to provide for the interest of the domestic debt she wishes therefore to avail herself of the general desire to provide for foreign creditors in order to enforce a just attention to the domestic ones the question is whether it will be more easy to prevail on pennsylvania to recede from this condition or the other states to comply with it the treaties with the indians have experienced a greater delay than was expected they are however completed and the surveyors are gone into that country to lay out the land in lots as soon as some progress is made in this the sale of lands will commence and i have a firm faith that they will in a short time absorb the whole of the certificates of the domestic debt  the philadelphia bank was incorporated by congress this is perhaps the only instance of their having done that which they had no power to do     necessity obliged them to give this institution the appearance of their countenance because in that moment they were without any other resource for money the legislature of pennsylvania however passed an act of incorporation for the bank  declared that the holders of stock should be responsible only to the amount of their stock lately that legislature has repealed their act the consequence is that the bank is now altogether a private institution and every holder is liable for its engagements in his whole property this has had a curious effect it has given those who deposit money in the bank a greater faith in it while it has rendered the holders very discontented as being more exposed to risk and has induced many to sell out so that i have heard i know not how truly that bank stock sells somewhat below par it has been said  ½ per cent but as the publication was from the enemies of the bank i do not give implicit faith to it with respect to the article etats unis of the encyclopedie now inclosed i am far from making myself responsible for the whole of the article the two first sections are taken chiefly from the abbé raynal  they are therefore wrong exactly in the same proportion the other sections are generally right even in them however there is here  there an error but on the whole it is good and the only thing as yet printed which gives a just idea of the american constitutions there will be another good work a very good one published here soon by mr mazzei who has been many years a resident of virginia is well informed and possessed of a masculine understanding     i should rather have said it will be published in holland for i believe it cannot be printed here i should be happy indeed in an opportunity of visiting holland but i know not when it will occur in the mean time it would give me great pleasure to see you here i think you would find both pleasure  use in such a trip i feel a sincere interest in the fate of your country and am disposed to wish well to either party only as i can see in their measures a tendency to bring on an amelioration of the condition of the people an increase in the mass of happiness but this is a subject for conversation my paper warns me that it is time to assure you of the esteem  respect with which i have the honour to be dear sir your most obedient humble servant thomas jefferson aug         paris mrs paradise to mrs paradise j mss paris aug         dear madam —i am honored with your letter of the   th inst by mr voss i concur with you in opinion that it is for mr paradises interest to go as soon as possible to america and also to turn all his debts into one which may be to mr gist or any other upon condition that the person giving him this credit shall be satisfied to receive annually his interest in money and shall not require consignments of tobacco this is the usual condition of the tobacco merchants no other law can be more oppressive to the mind or fortune and long experience has proved to us that there never was an instance     of a mans getting out of debt who was once in the hands of a tobacco merchant  bound to consign his tobacco to him it is the most delusive of all snares the merchant feeds the inclination of his customer to be credited till he gets the burthen of debt so increased that he cannot throw it off at once he then begins to give him less for his tobacco  ends with giving him what he pleases for it which is always so little that though the demands of the customer for necessaries be reduced ever so low in order to get himself out of debt the merchant lowers his price in the same proportion so as always to keep such a balance against his customer as will oblige him to continue his consignments of tobacco tobacco always sells better in virginia than in the hands of a london merchant the confidence which you have been pleased to place in me induces me to take the liberty of advising you to submit to any thing rather than to an obligation to ship your tobacco a mortgage of property the most usurious interest or any thing else will be preferable to this if mr paradise can get no single money lender to pay his debts perhaps those to whom he owes might be willing to wait on his placing in the hands of trustees in london whom they should approve certain parts of his property the profits of which should suffice to pay them within a reasonable time mr voss gives me hopes of seeing mr paradise here i shall not fail to give him such information as my knowledge of the country to which he is going may render useful nor of availing myself of every occasion of rendering him yourself  family every service     in my power having the honour to be with sentiments of the most perfect esteem  respect madam c thomas jefferson aug         paris thomas mann randolph jr to thomas mann randolph jr j mss paris aug         dear sir —i am honoured with your favour of the   th instant and desirous without delay of manifesting my wishes to be useful to you i shall venture to you some thoughts on the course of your studies which must be submitted to the better choice with which you are surrounded a longer race through life may have entitled me to seize some truths which have not yet been presented to your observation  more intimate knowledge of the country in which you are to live  of the circumstances in which you will be placed may enable me to point your attention to the branches of science which will administer the most to your happiness there the foundations which you have laid in languages and mathematics are proper for every superstructure the former exercises our memory while that and no other faculty is yet matured  prevents our acquiring habits of idleness the latter gives exercise to our reason as soon as that has acquired a certain degree of strength and stores the mind with truths which are useful in other branches of science at this moment then a second order of preparation is to commence i shall propose to you that it be extensive comprehending astronomy natural philosophy or physics natural     history anatomy botany  chemistry no inquisitive mind will be content to be ignorant of any of these branches but i would advise you to be contented with a course of lectures in most of them without attempting to make yourself master of the whole this is more than any genius joined to any length of life is equal to you will find among them some one study to which your mind will more particularly attach itself this then i would pursue  propose to attain eminence in your own country furnishes the most aliment for natural history botany  physics  as you express a fondness for the former you might make it your principal object endeavoring however to make yourself more acquainted with the two latter than with other branches likely to be less useful in fact you will find botany offering its charms to you at every step—during summer  physics in every season all these branches of science will be better attained by attending courses of lectures in them you are now in a place where the best courses upon earth are within your reach and being delivered in your native language—you lose no part of their benefit such an opportunity you will never again have i would therefore strongly press on you to fix no other limit to your stay in edinborough than your having got thro this whole course the omission of any one part of it will be an affliction  loss to you as long as you live beside the comfort of knowledge every science is auxiliary to every other while you are attending these courses you can proceed by yourself in a regular series of historical reading it would     be a waste of time to attend a professor of this it is to be acquired from books and if you pursue it by yourself you can accommodate it to your other reading so as to fill up those chasms of time not otherwise appropriated there are portions of the day too when the mind should be eased particularly after dinner it should be applied to lighter occupation history is of this kind it exercises principally the memory reflection also indeed is necessary but not generally in a laborious degree to conduct yourself in this branch of science you have only to consider what æras of it merit a grasp  what a particular attention  in each æra also to distinguish between the countries the knowledge of whose history will be useful  those where it suffices only to be not altogether ignorant having laid down your plan as to the branches of history you would pursue the order of time will be your sufficient guide after what you have read in antient history i should suppose millots digest would be useful  sufficient the histories of greece and rome are worthy a good degree of attention they should be read in the original authors the transition from antient to modern history will be best effected by reading gibbons then a general history of the principal states of europe but particular ones of england here too the original writers are to be preferred kennet published a considerable collection of these in   vols folio but there are some others not in his collection well worth being read after the history of england that of america will claim your attention here too original authors  not compilers are best an     author who writes of his own times or of times near his own presents in his own ideas  manner the best picture of the moment of which he writes history need not be hurried but may give way to the other sciences because history can be pursued after you shall have left your present situation as well as while you remain in it when you shall have got thro this second order of preparation the study of the law is to be begun this like history is to be acquired from books all the aid you will want will be a catalogue of the books to be read  the order in which they are to be read it being absolutely indifferent in what place you carry on this reading i should propose your doing it in france the advantages of this will be that you will at the same time acquire the habit of speaking french which is the object of a year or two you may be giving attention to such of the fine arts as your turn may lead you to  you will be forming an acquaintance with the individuals  characters of a nation with whom we must long remain in the closest intimacy  to whom we are bound by the strong ties of gratitude and policy a nation in short of the most amiable dispositions on earth the whole mass of which is penetrated with an affection for us you might before you return to your own country make a visit to italy also i should have performed the office of but half a friend were i to confine myself to the improvement of the mind only knowledge indeed is a desirable a lovely possession but i do not scruple to say that health is more so it is of little consequence to store     the mind with science if the body be permitted to become debilitated if the body be feeble the mind will not be strong—the sovereign invigorator of the body is exercise and of all exercises walking is best a horse gives but a kind of half exercise and a carriage is no better than a cradle no one knows till he tries how easily a habit of walking is acquired a person who never walked three miles will in the course of a month become able to walk    or  0 without fatigue i have known some great walkers  had particular accounts of many more and i never knew or heard of one who was not healthy  long lived this species of exercise therefore is much to be advised should you be disposed to try it as your health has been feeble it will be necessary for you to begin with a little  to increase it by degrees for the same reason you must probably at first ascribe to it the hours most precious for study i mean those about the middle of the day but when you shall find yourself strong you may venture to take your walks in the evening after the digestion of the dinner is pretty well over this is making a compromise between health  study the latter would be too much interrupted were you to take from it the early hours of the day and habit will soon render the evenings exercise as salutary as that of the morning i speak this from my own experience having from an attachment to study very early in life made this arrangement of my time having ever observed it  still observing it  always with perfect success not less than two hours a day should be devoted to exercise and the weather should be little     regarded a person not sick will not be injured by getting wet it is but taking a cold bath which never gives a cold to any one brute animals are the most healthy  they are exposed to all weather and of men those are healthiest who are the most exposed the recipe of those two descriptions of beings is simple diet exercise and the open air be its state what it will and we may venture to say that this recipe will give health  vigor to every other description—by this time i am sure you will think i have sermonized enough i have given you indeed a lengthy lecture i have been led through it by my zeal to serve you if in the whole you find one useful counsel that will be my reward  a sufficient one few persons in your own country have started from as advantageous ground as that whereon you will be placed nature and fortune have been liberal to you every thing honourable or profitable there is placed within your own reach and will depend on your own efforts if these are exerted with assiduity and guided by unswerving honesty your success is infallible and that it may be as great as you wish is the sincere desire of dear sir your most affectionate humble servant p s be so good as to present me affectionately to your brother  cousin thomas jefferson aug         paris john adams to john adams j mss paris aug         dear sir —your favour of july    was lately delivered me the papers inform me you are at the   0 hague and incertain what stay you may make there i send this by mr voss who is returned to london by the way of amsterdam i inclose you the last letters from mr barclay  mr carmichael by which we may hope our peace with morocco is signed thanks to the good offices of a nation which is honest if it is not wise this event with the naval cruises of portugal will i hope quiet the atlantic for us i am informed by authority to be depended on that insurance is made at lorient on american vessels sailing under their own flag against every event at the price usually paid for risks of the sea alone still however the most important of our marts the mediterranean is shut i wrote you a proposition to accept mr barclays offer of going to algiers i have no hope of its making peace but it may add to our information abate the ardor of those pyrates against us and shut the mouths of those who might impute our success at morocco  failure at algiers to a judicious appointment to the one place  an injudicious one at the other let me hear from you as soon as possible on this  if you accede to it send me all the necessary papers ready signed i inclose you the article etats unis of one of the volumes of the encyclopedie lately published the author m de meusnier was introduced to me by the d de la rochefoucault he asked of me information on the subject of our states  left with me a number of queries to answer knowing the importance of setting to rights a book so universally diffused  which will go down to late ages i answered his queries as fully as i was able went     into a great many calculations for him and offered to give further explanations when necessary he then put his work into my hands i read it and was led by that into a still greater number of details by way of correcting what he had at first written which was indeed a mass of errors and misconceptions from beginning to end i returned him his work  dry details but he did not communicate it to me after he had corrected it it has therefore come out with many errors which i would have advised him to correct  the rather as he was very well disposed he has still left in a great deal of the abbé raynal that is to say a great deal of falsehood and he has stated other things on bad information i am sorry i had not another correction of it he has paid me for my trouble in the true coin of the country most unmerciful compliment this with his other errors i should surely have struck out had he sent me the work as i expected before it went to the press i find in fact that he is happiest of whom the world sais least good or bad—i think if i had had a little more warning my desire to see holland as well as to meet again mrs adams  yourself would have tempted me to take a flying trip there i wish you may be tempted to take paris in your return you will find many very happy to see you here  none more so than dear sir your friend and servant thomas jefferson sep        paris ezra stiles to ezra stiles j mss paris sep        sir —i am honoured with your letter of may   that which you mention to have written in the     winter preceding never came to hand i return you my thanks for the communications relative to the western country when we reflect how long we have inhabited those parts of america which lie between the alleghaney  the ocean that no monument has ever been found in them which indicated the use of iron among its aboriginal inhabitants that they were as far advanced in arts at least as the inhabitants on the other side the alleghaney a good degree of infidelity may be excused as to the new discoveries which suppose regular fortifications of brickwork to have been in use among the indians on the waters of the ohio intrenchments of earth they might indeed make but brick is more difficult the art of making it may have preceded the use of iron but it would suppose a greater degree of industry than men in the hunter state usually possess i should like to know whether general parsons himself saw actual bricks among the remains of fortifications i suppose the settlement of our continent is of the most remote antiquity the similitude between its inhabitants  those of eastern parts of asia renders it probable that ours are descended from them or they from ours the latter is my opinion founded on this single fact among the red inhabitants of asia there are but a few languages radically different but among our indians the number of languages is infinite which are so radically different as to exhibit at present no appearance of their having been derived from a common source the time necessary for the generation of so many     languages must be immense a countryman of yours a mr lediard who was with capt cook on his last voiage proposes either to go to kamschatka cross from thence to the western side of america and penetrate through the continent to our side of it or to go to kentucke  thence penetrate westwardly to the south sea the vent from hence lately to london where if he finds a passage to kamschatka or the western coast of america he would avail himself of it otherwise he proposes to return to our side of america to attempt that route i think him well calculated for such an enterprise  wish he may undertake it another countryman of yours mr trumbul has paid us a visit here  brought with him two pictures which are the admiration of the connoisseurs his natural talents for this art seem almost unparalleled i send you the  th   th vols of the bibliotheque physico ecconomie erroneously lettered as the  th   th which are not yet come out i enclose with them the article etats unis of the new encyclopedie this article is recently published  a few copies have been printed separate for this twelvemonth past little new  excellent has appeared either in literature or the arts an abbé rochon has applied the metal called platina to the telescope instead of the mixed metal of which the specula were formerly composed it is insusceptible of rust as gold is and he thinks its reflective power equal to that of the mixed metal he has observed a very curious effect of the natural chrystals  especially of those of iceland which is that lenses made of them have two distinct     focuses and present you the object distinctly at two different distances this i have seen myself a new method of copying has been invented here i called on the inventor  he presented me a plate of copper a pen  ink i wrote a note on the plate and in about three quarters of an hour he brought me an hundred copies as perfect as the imagination can conceive had i written my name he could have put it to so many bonds so that i should have acknoleged the signature to be my own the copying of paintings in england is very conceivable any number may be taken which shall give you the true lineaments  colouring of the original without injuring that this is so like creation that had i not seen it i should have doubted it—the death of the k of prussia which happened on the   th inst will probably employ the pens if not the swords of politicians we had exchanged the ratifications of our treaty with him the articles of this which were intended to prevent or miticate wars by lessening their aliment are so much applauded in europe that i think the example will be followed i have the honour to be with very sincere esteem dear sir your most obedt humble servant thomas jefferson françois soulés answers to the queries of m soulés  i am unable to say what was the number of americans engaged in the affair of bunkers hill i am     able however to set right a gross falsehood of andrews he says that the americans there engaged were constantly relieved by fresh hands this is entirely untrue bunker hill or rather breeds hill whereon the action was is a peninsular joined to the main land by a neck of land almost level with the water a few paces wide  between one  two hundred toises long on one side of this neck lay a vessel of war  on the other several gun boats the body of our army was on the main land  only a detachment had been sent into the peninsular when the enemy determined to make the attack they sent the vessel of war  gun boats to take the position before mentioned to cut off all reinforcements which they effectually did not so much as a company could venture into the relief of the men engaged who therefore fought thro the whole action  at length were obliged to retire across the neck thro the cross fire of the vessels before mentioned single persons passed along the neck during the engagement particularly general putnam     on the fall of montgomery  his aids at quebec there were present colo campbell  major dubois campbell tho having the rank of colo was only of the staff dubois was of the line the usage of all nations therefore authorized the latter to take the command but it was a case for which congress had not yet provided campbell availed himself of this  believing on the sight of blood that all was lost ordered a retreat the speech to the indians in andrews page     is a little altered  abridged you will find the genuine one in the journal of congress of july      i do not distinctly enough recollect the anecdote of the old mans company related by andrews to affirm it in all its parts i think i recollect in general that there was such a company the questions relative to general thomas i could only have answered indistinctly from my own memory but fortunately there came to paris a few days ago  will yet continue there a few days a colonel blackden an american officer of good understanding  of truth  who was at the latter part of the affair of quebec he was at the surprise of ticonderoga by allen  continued with the army until      i have spoken with him on this subject and find he possesses treasures of details which will be precious to m soulés any day that m soulés will do me the honour to come  take a famille soupe with me after the   th inst if he will give me notice in the morning i will ask colo blackden to meet him here  will make them acquainted he is perfectly disposed to give all the information in his power to m     soulés  whatever he gives may be relied on to him then i shall refer m soulés for answers to his military questions  will wait his orders recommending despatch as colo blackden has not long to stay the stamp act was passed in feb      what powers the parliament might rightly exercise over us  whether any had never been declared either by them or us they had very early taken the gigantic step of passing the navigation act the colonies remonstrated violently against it and one of them virginia when she capitulated to the commonwealth of england expressly capitulated for a free trade see the articles in the notes on virginia p  0  this capitulation however was as little regarded as the original right restored by it had been the navigation act was reenacted by charles    was enforced and we had been so long in the habit of seeing them consider us merely as objects for the extension of their commerce  of submitting to every duty or regulation imposed with that view that we had ceased to complain of them but when they proposed to consider us as objects of taxation all the states took the alarm yet so little had we attended to this subject that our advocates did not at first know on what ground to take their stand mr dickenson a lawyer of more ingenuity than sound judgment and still more timid than ingenious not daring to question the authority to regulate commerce so as best to answer their own purpose to which we had so long submitted admitted that authority in its utmost extent he     acknoledged in his farmers to manufacture illegible that they could levy duties internal or external paiable in great britain or in the states he only required that these duties should be bonâ fide for the regulation of commerce  not to raise a solid revenue he admitted therefore that they might controul our commerce but not tax us this mysterious system took for a moment in america as well as in europe but sounder heads saw in the first moment that he who could put down the loom could stop the spinning wheel and he who could stop the spinning wheel could tie the hands which turned it they saw that this flimsey fabric could not be supported who were to be judges whether duties were imposed with a view to burthen  suppress a branch of manufacture or to raise a revenue if either party exclusively of the other it was plain where that would end if both parties it was plain where that would end also they saw therefore no sure clue to lead them out of their difficulties but reason  right they dared to follow them assured that they alone could lead them to defensible ground the first elements of reason showed that the members of parliament could have no power which the people of the several counties had not that these had naturally a power over their own farms and collectively over all england that if they had any power over counties out of england it must be founded on compact or force no compact could be shown  neither party chose to bottom their pretensions on force it was objected that this annihilated the navigation act true it does the     navigation act therefore becomes a proper subject of treaty between the two nations or if gr britain does not chuse to have its basis questioned let us go on as we have done let no new shackles be imposed  we will continue to submit to the old we will consider the restrictions on our commerce now actually existing as compensations yielded by us for the protections  privileges we actually enjoy only trusting that if great britain on a revisal of these restrictions is sensible that some of them are useless to her  oppressive to us she will repeal them but on this she shall be free place us in the condition we were when the king came to the throne let us rest so  we will be satisfied this was the ground on which all the states very soon found themselves rallied and that there was no other which could be defended i will now proceed with remarks on the history i do not find that m soulés mentioned the affair of the cedars which happened in april      this was an affair of no small importance a committee was appointed by congress to institute inquiries concerning it as may be seen by the journal of june         the report of that committee is inserted in the journal of july  0 and i can assure m soulés that the facts therein stated were proved incontestably to the committee by witnesses present at the transactions  who were on watch i have the originals of that inquiry in my possession in america the capt foster therein mentioned was afterwards taken with burgoynes army tho permitted to go at large on his parole he was not received into any   0 american company nor did the british officers his fellow prisoners chuse to be seen in company with him—so detestable had been the transaction c vol i pa     i have been very well informed that during all the latter part of the defence the garrison was obliged to return the cannon balls of the enemy with which indeed the ground was covered having none of their own left pa     il y eut un serjent c this particular truly related in andrews vol   pa   ils en vinrent le  0 de juin à cette resolution que ces colonies c see the journ of congr that it was on that day put off to the  st of july this was done at the instance of the members opposed to it the friends of the resolution objected that if it were not agreed to till the  st of july they would after that have to frame a declaration of independance  that more time would then be lost it was therefore agreed between the two that the resolution should be put off till the  st of july  that a committee should be immediately appointed to draw a declaration of independance conformable to the resolution should it be adopted a committee was accordingly appointed the next day on the  st of july the resolution was proposed  when ready for a vote a state required it to be put off till the next day it was done and was passed the next day  d of july the declaration of independance was debated during the  d  d   th days of july  on the last of these was passed  signed pa   a se retirerent ensuite du congres i do not remember that the delegates of maryland     retired from congress  i think i could not have forgotten such a fact on the contrary i find by the journals of congress that they were present  acting on the   th   th   th   th    th of june pa   a la plus grande partie it should rather be the most important parts pa     les etats unis ferrient encore aujourdhui partie de lempire britannique m soulés may be assured that the submission of the states could not have been effected but by a long course of disasters  such too as were irreparable in their nature their resources were great  their determination so rooted that they would have tried the last of them i am as satisfied as i can be of anything that the conjecture here stated would not have been verified by the event pa    provinces unis should not this always be etatsunis pa    mais quon pouvoir aussi les interpreter c his exact answer was that it was true the c might include anything but that might also include nothing pa    tant de confiance c their main confidence was in their own resources they considered foreign aid as probable  desirable but not essential i believe myself from the whole of what i have seen of our resources  perseverance   that had we never received any foreign aid we should not have obtained our independance but that we should have made a peace with great britain on any terms we pleased short of that which would have been a subjection to the same king an union of     force in war c   that had france supplied us plentifully with money suppose about   millions of guineas a year without entering into the war herself at all we should have established our independance but it would have cost more time  blood but less money   that france aiding us as she did with money  forces shortened much the time lessened the expense of blood but at a greater expense of money to her than would have otherwise been requisite pa    lextremité septentrional c i think the word çoté would be better adapted than extremité to the form of the island pa     000 hommes inquire of colo blackden perhaps the proposition of congress to the hessians may be worth mentioning see their journals      aug    i will make a general observation here on the events of long island new york c at this time the maxim laid down by congress to their generals was that not a foot of territory was to be ceded to their enemies where there was a possibility of defending it in consequence of these views and against his own judgment genl washington was obliged to fortify  attempt to defend the city of new york but that could not be defended without occupying the heights on long island which commanded the city of new york he was therefore obliged to establish a strong detachment in long island to defend those heights the moment that detachment was routed which he had much expected     his first object was to withdraw them  his second to evacuate new york—he did this therefore immediately and without waiting any movement of the enemy he brought off his whole baggage stores  other implements without leaving a single article except the very heaviest of his cannon  things of little value i well remember his letter to congress wherein he expresses his wonder that the enemy had given him this leisure as from the heights they had got possession of they might have compelled him to a very precipitate retreat this was one of the instances where our commanding officers were obliged to conform to popular views tho they foresaw certain loss from it had he proposed at first to abandon new york he might have been abandoned himself an obedience to popular will cost us an army in charlestown in the year      pa  0 une fuite precipitée it was a leisurely retreat as i have before observed pa    que je nai prie obtener que dun anglais colo blackden can probably give m soulés good intelligence on this affair i think i recollect the slaughter on kniphausens side to have been very great aug        vo lume   si dans son institution chaque individue avoit droit au gouvernement de letat a seulement ceux qui possedoient une certaine etendue de terre this is a luminous idea and worthy of being a little more developed it places the question between gr britain  america in the simplest form     possible no englishman will pretend that a right to participate in government can be derived from any other source than a personal right or a right of property the conclusion is inevitable that he who had neither his person nor property in america could not rightfully assume a participation in its government pa    the seeds of the war are here traced to their true source the tory education of the king was the first preparation for that change in the british government which that party never ceases to wish this naturally ensured tory administrations during his life at the moment he came to the throne and cleared his hands of his enemies by the peace of paris the assumptions of unwarrantable right over america commenced they were so signal and followed one another so close as to prove they were part of a system either to reduce it under absolute subjection  thereby make it an instrument for attempts on britain itself or to sever it from britain so that it might not be a weight in the whig scale this latter alternative however was not considered as the one which would take place they knew so little of america that they thought it unable to encounter the little finger of great britain m de soulés has well developed this subject he is best judge whether anything more need be said on this subject pa    se le ministere anglais avoit eu la patience dattendre que ces merchandises fussent consommé c having seen and intimately known the positions of the americans at that moment i am certain that this conjecture would not have been     verified the determined resolution with which they met every effort of the ministry whether made in the form of force fraud or persuasion gives us a moral certainty they would have been equally immoveable if tried in the way of privation here proposed pa    pour accorder quelque chose c the substitution of gage for hutchinson was not intended as a favor but by putting the civil government into military hands was meant to shew they would enforce their measures by arms see pa  0  where congress makes it one of their grievances pa    a grand jury cannot be fewer than    nor more than    some authors say it cannot be fewer than    nor more than    pa  0  plusieurs criminels c notwithstanding the laws the english made i think they never ventured to carry a single person to be tried in england they knew that reprisals would be made and probably on the person of the governor who ventured on the measure pa     the fact that the english commenced hostilities at lexington being proved beyond question by us  even acknowledged by the english justice requires it should be plainly asserted  left clear of doubt few of the facts which history asserts  relies on have been so well established pa   0 lhumanité des britons i doubt whether this is the character of the nation in general but this history and every one which is impartial must in its relation of this war shew in such repeated instances that they conducted it both in theory      practice on the most barbarous principles that the expression here cited will stand in contradiction to the rest of the work as examples of their theory recollect the act of parliament for constraining our prisoners taken on the sea to bear arms against their fathers brothers c for their practice recollect their exciting the savages against us insurrections of our slaves sending our prisoners to the east indies killing them in prison ships keeping them on half rations and of the most unwholesome qualities cruel murders of unarmed individuals of every sex massacres of those in arms after they had asked quarters c c pa   0 a cé que lon dit à  0000 hommes it was of   000 men i was in a situation to know the fact from genl washingtons own information     l   strike out ét probablement  insert mais veritablement i remember the fact well and the leading persons of connecticut and particularly their delegates in congress made no secret that their object was to overawe n york into its duty     il fut resolu de la reduire i e nouvelle york en cendre this was proposed and considered in congress but they refused to come to this resolution nor do i recollect that any other body resolved it     doctor franklin has been called by that title as early as    0 within my own knowledge i do not know how much longer his quality in france was that of minister plenipotentiary and not as ambassador we have never     appointed an ambassador france offered to receive one pa     the english set fire to charleston qu as to the number of their killed pa   0     gates was  still is an inhabitant of virginia he never lived in any other state pa   0 m arnold avoit formé une enterprise c i never understood that he formed this enterprise nor do i believe he did i heard and saw all general washingtons letters on this subject i do not think he mentioned arnold as author of the proposition yet he was always just in ascribing to every officer the merit of his own works and he was disposed particularly in favor of arnold this officer is entitled to great merit in the execution but to ascribe to him that of having formed the enterprise is probably to ascribe to him what belongs to genl washington or some other person  0  et qu il ne leur fut plus permis de lever la milice c they had formerly had a law on the subject of invasions  insurrections which was of a perpetual tenor they altered this law by one which was to be in force for a certain term of years only that term of years effluxed at this time the altering law expired  therefore the old one resumed its vigor it was very imperfect yet they chose to act under the colour of that rather than without any colour of law     dont elles se plaignerent this seems to be the proper place to rectify a small error in the arrangement of facts and to state the answer to the conciliatory proposition which was in truth the     first work of the assembly i have not here the journals of the assembly but there are certain circumstances which render it impossible for my memory to lead me astray i was under appointment to attend the general congress but knowing the importance of the answer to be given to the conciliatory proposition and that our leading whig characters were then with congress i determined to attend on the assembly  tho a young member to take on myself the carrying thro an answer to the proposition the assembly met the  st of june i drew and proposed the answer  carried it through the house with very little alteration against the opposition of our timid members who wish to speak a different language this was finished before the   th of june because on that day i set out from williamsburg to philadelphia and was the bearer of an authenticated copy of this instrument to congress the effect it had in fortifying their minds  in deciding their measures renders its true date important because only pennsylvania had as yet answered the proposition virginia was the second it was known how massachusetts would answer it and the example of these three principal colonies would determine the measures of all the others  of course the fate of the proposition congress received it therefore with much satisfaction the assembly of virginia did not deliver the answer to ld dunmore till late in the session they supposed it would bring on a dissolution of their body whenever they should deliver it to him and they wished previously to get some important acts passed for     this reason they kept it up i think that ld dunmore did not quit the metropolis till he knew that the answer framed by the house was a rejection of the proposition tho that answer was not yet communicated to him regularly pa     quelques certaines de blancs these were composed principally of scotch merchants  factors  some few english who had settled in the country i doubt whether there was a single native among them if m soulés could therefore characterise more particularly who they were who joined ld dunmore it would be an agreeable act of justice to the natives pa     les americains qui avoit joint milord dunmore the same observation applies to this pa     pendant leté le congres general avoit eté occupé à dresser un plan pour former une confederation it is necessary to set to rights here a fact which has been mistaken by every person who has written on this subject i will do it from a perfect recollection of facts but my memory does not enable me to state the date exactly i was absent from congress from the beginning of january      to the middle of may either just before i left congress or immediately on my return to it i rather think it was the former doctor franklin put into my hands the draught of a plan of confederation desiring me to read it  tell him what i thought of it i approved it highly he shewed it to others some thought as i did others were revolted at it we found it could not be passed and the proposing it to congress as the subject for any vote whatever  00 would startle many members so much that they would suspect we had lost sight of reconciliation with great britain  that we should lose much more ground than we should gain by the proposition yet that the idea that a more firm bond of union than the undefined one under which we then acted might be suggested  permitted to grow dr franklin informed congress that he had sketched the outlines of an instrument which might become necessary at a future day if the ministry continued pertinacious and would ask leave for it to lay on the table of congress that the members might in the meantime be turning the subject in their minds and have something more perfect prepared by the time it should become necessary this was agreed to by the timid members only on condition that no entry whatever should be made in the journals of congress relative to this instrument this was to continue in force only till a reconciliation with great britain this was all that ever was done or proposed in congress on the subject of a confederation before june      when the proposition was regularly made to congress a committee appointed to draw an instrument of confederation who accordingly drew one very considerably differing from the sketch of doctor franklin pa     il est á croire quil y avoit quelque convention it is well known there was such a convention it was never made a secret of on our part i do not exactly recollect its terms but i believe they were what m soulés states pa  0  la petite verole i have been informed  0  by officers who were on the spot  whom i believe myself that this disorder was sent into our army designedly by the commanding officer at quebec it conserved his purpose effectually thomas jefferson oct         paris maria cosway to mrs maria cosway j mss paris october         my dear madam —having performed the last sad office of handing you into your carriage at the pavillon de st denis and seen the wheels get actually into motion i turned on my heel  walked more dead than alive to the opposite door where my own was awaiting me mr danquerville was missing he was sought for found  dragged down stairs we were crammed into the carriage like recruits for the bastille  not having soul enough to give orders to the coachman he presumed paris our destination  drove off after a considerable interval silence was broke with a je suis vraiment afflige du depart de ces bons gens this was a signal for a mutual confession of distress we began immediately to talk of mr  mrs cosway of their goodness their talents their amiability  tho we spoke of nothing else we seemed hardly to have entered into matter when the coachman announced the rue st denis  that we were opposite mr danquervilles he insisted on descending there  traversing a short passage to his lodgings i was carried home seated by my fireside solitary  sad the following dialogue took place between my head  my heart  0  head well friend you seem to be in a pretty trim heart i am indeed the most wretched of all earthly beings overwhelmed with grief every fibre of my frame distended beyond its natural powers to bear i would willingly meet whatever catastrophe should leave me no more to feel or to fear head these are the eternal consequences of your warmth  precipitation this is one of the scrapes into which you are ever leading us you confess your follies indeed but still you hug  cherish them  no reformation can be hoped where there is no repentance heart oh my friend this is no moment to upbraid my foibles i am rent into fragments by the force of my grief if you have any balm pour it into my wounds if none do not harrow them by new torments spare me in this awful moment at any other i will attend with patience to your admonitions head on the contrary i never found that the moment of triumph with you was the moment of attention to my admonitions while suffering under your follies you may perhaps be made sensible of them but the paroxysm over you fancy it can never return harsh therefore as the medicine may be it is my office to administer it you will be pleased to remember that when our friend trumbull used to be telling us of the merits  talents of these good people i never ceased whispering to you that we had no occasion for new acquaintance that the greater their merits  talents the more dangerous their  0  friendship to our tranquillity because the regret at parting would be greater heart accordingly sir this acquaintance was not the consequence of my doings it was one of your projects which threw us in the way of it it was you remember  not i who desired the meeting at legrand  molinos i never trouble myself with domes nor arches the halle aux bleds might have rotted down before i should have gone to see it but you forsooth who are eternally getting us to sleep with your diagrams  crotchets must go  examine this wonderful piece of architecture and when you had seen it oh it was the most superb thing on earth what you had seen there was worth all you had yet seen in paris i thought so too but i meant it of the lady  gentleman to whom we had been presented  not of a parcel of sticks  chips put together in pens you then sir  not i have been the cause of the present distress head it would have been happy for you if my diagrams  crotchets had gotten you to sleep on that day as you are pleased to say they eternally do my visit to legrand  molinos had public utility for its object a market is to be built in richmond what a commodious plan is that of legrand  molinos especially if we put on it the noble dome of the halle aux bleds if such a bridge as they shewed us can be thrown across the schuylkill at philadelphia the floating bridges taken up  the navigation of that river opened what a copious resource will be added of wood  provisions to warm  feed the poor of that city while i was occupied  0  with these objects you were dilating with your new acquaintances  contriving how to prevent a separation from them every soul of you had an engagement for the day yet all these were to be sacrificed that you might dine together lying messengers were to be despatched into every quarter of the city with apologies for your breach of engagement you particularly had the effrontery to send word to the dutchess danville that on the moment we were setting out to dine with her despatches came to hand which required immediate attention you wanted me to invent a more ingenious excuse but i knew you were getting into a scrape  i would have nothing to do with it well after dinner to st cloud from st cloud to ruggieris from ruggieri to krumfoltz  if the day had been as long as a lapland summer day you would still have contrived means among you to have filled it heart oh my dear friend how you have revived me by recalling to my mind the transactions of that day how well i remember them all  that when i came home at night  looked back to the morning it seemed to have been a month agone go on then like a kind comforter  paint to me the day we went to st germains how beautiful was every object the port de reuilly the hills along the seine the rainbows of the machine of marly the terrace of st germains the chateaux the gardens the statues of marly the pavillon of lucienne recollect too madrid bagatelle the kings garden the dessert how grand the idea excited by the remains of such a column the spiral staircase too  0  was beautiful every moment was filled with something agreeable the wheels of time moved on with a rapidity of which those of our carriage gave but a faint idea and yet in the evening when one took a retrospect of the day what a mass of happiness had we travelled over retrace all those scenes to me my good companion  i will forgive the unkindness with which you were chiding me the day we went to st germains was a little too warm i think was it not head thou art the most incorrigible of all the beings that ever sinned i reminded you of the follies of the first day intending to deduce from thence some useful lessons for you but instead of listening to these you kindle at the recollection you retrace the whole series with a fondness which shews you want nothing but the opportunity to act it over again i often told you during its course that you were imprudently engaging your affections under circumstances that must have cost you a great deal of pain that the persons indeed were of the greatest merit possessing good sense good humour honest hearts honest manners  eminence in a lovely art that the lady had moreover qualities  accomplishments belonging to her sex which might form a chapter apart for her such as music modesty beauty  that softness of disposition which is the ornament of her sex  charm of ours but that all these considerations would increase the pang of separation that their stay here was to be short that you rack our whole system when you are parted from those you love complaining that such a separation  0  is worse than death inasmuch as this ends our sufferings whereas that only begins them  that the separation would in this instance be the more severe as you would probably never see them again heart but they told me they would come back again the next year head but in the meantime see what you suffer  their return too depends on so many circumstances that if you had a grain of prudence you would not count upon it upon the whole it is improbable  therefore you should abandon the idea of ever seeing them again heart may heaven abandon me if i do head very well suppose then they come back they are to stay two months  when these are expired what is to follow perhaps you flatter yourself they may come to america heart god only knows what is to happen i see nothing impossible in that supposition and i see things wonderfully contrived sometimes to make us happy where could they find such objects as in america for the exercise of their enchanting art especially the lady who paints landscapes so inimitably she wants only subjects worthy of immortality to render her pencil immortal the falling spring the cascade of niagara the passage of the potowmac through the blue mountains the natural bridge it is worth a voyage across the atlantic to see these objects much more to paint and make them  thereby ourselves known to all ages and our own dear monticello where has nature spread so rich a mantle under the eye mountains forests  0  rocks rivers with what majesty do we there ride above the storms how sublime to look down into the workhouse of nature to see her clouds hail snow rain thunder all fabricated at our feet and the glorious sun when rising as if out of a distant water just gilding the tops of the mountains  giving life to all nature i hope in god no circumstance may ever make either seek an asylum from grief with what sincere sympathy i would open every cell of my composition to receive the effusion of their woes i would pour my tears into their wounds  if a drop of balm could be found on the top of the cordilleras or at the remotest sources of the missouri i would go thither myself to seek  to bring it deeply practised in the school of affliction the human heart knows no joy which i have not lost no sorrow of which i have not drunk fortune can present no grief of unknown form to me who then can so softly bind up the wound of another as he who has felt the same wound himself but heaven forbid they should ever know a sorrow let us turn over another leaf for this has distracted me head well let us put this possibility to trial then on another point when you consider the character which is given of our country by the lying newspapers of london  their credulous copyers in other countries when you reflect that all europe is made to believe we are a lawless banditti in a state of absolute anarchy cutting one anothers throats  plundering without distinction how can you expect that any reasonable creature would venture among us  0  heart but you  i know that all this is false that there is not a country on earth where there is greater tranquillity where the laws are milder or better obeyed where every one is more attentive to his own business or meddles less with that of others where strangers are better received more hospitably treated  with a more sacred respect head true you  i know this but your friends do not know it heart but they are sensible people who think for themselves they will ask of impartial foreigners who have been among us whether they saw or heard on the spot any instances of anarchy they will judge too that a people occupied as we are in opening rivers digging navigable canals making roads building public schools establishing academies erecting busts  statues to our great men protecting religious freedom abolishing sanguinary punishments reforming  improving our laws in general they will judge i say for themselves whether these are not the occupations of a people at their ease whether this is not better evidence of our true state than a london newspaper hired to lie  from which no truth can ever be extracted but by reversing everything it says head i did not begin this lecture my friend with a view to learn from you what america is doing let us return then to our point i wished to make you sensible how imprudent it is to place your affections without reserve on objects you must so soon lose  whose loss when it comes must cost you such severe pangs remember the last night you knew your  0  friends were to leave paris today this was enough to throw you into agonies all night you tossed us from one side of the bed to the other no sleep no rest the poor crippled wrist too never left one moment in the same position now up now down now here now there was it to be wondered at if its pains returned the surgeon then was to be called  to be rated as an ignoramus because he could not divine the cause of this extraordinary change in fine my friend you must mend your manners this is not a world to live at random in as you do to avoid those eternal distresses to which you are forever exposing us you must learn to look forward before you take a step which may interest our peace everything in this world is a matter of calculation advance then with caution the balance in your hand put into one scale the pleasures which any object may offer but put fairly into the other the pains which are to follow  see which preponderates the making an acquaintance is not a matter of indifference when a new one is proposed to you view it all round consider what advantages it presents  to what inconveniences it may expose you do not bite at the bait of pleasure till you know there is no hook beneath it the art of life is the art of avoiding pain  he is the best pilot who steers clearest of the rocks  shoals with which he is beset pleasure is always before us but misfortune is at our side while running after that this arrests us the most effectual means of being secure against pain is to retire within ourselves  to suffice for our own happiness those which depend on ourselves   0 are the only pleasures a wise man will count on for nothing is ours which another may deprive us of hence the inestimable value of intellectual pleasures even in our power always leading us to something new never cloying we ride serene  sublime above the concerns of this mortal world contemplating truth  nature matter  motion the laws which bind up their existence  that eternal being who made  bound them up by those laws let this be our employ leave the bustle  tumult of society to those who have not talents to occupy themselves without them friendship is but another name for an alliance with the follies  the misfortunes of others our own share of miseries is sufficient why enter then as volunteers into those of another is there so little gall poured into our cup that we must needs help to drink that of our neighbor a friend dies or leaves us we feel as if a limb was cut off he is sick we must watch over him  participate of his pains his fortune is shipwrecked ours must be laid under contribution he loses a child a parent or a partner we must mourn the loss as if it were our own heart and what more sublime delight than to mingle tears with one whom the hand of heaven hath smitten to watch over the bed of sickness  to beguile its tedious  its painful moments to share our bread with one to whom misfortune has left none this world abounds indeed with misery to lighten its burthen we must divide it with one another but let us now try the virtues of your mathematical balance  as you have put into one scale the burthen     of friendship let me put its comforts into the other when languishing then under disease how grateful is the solace of our friends how are we penetrated with their assiduities  attentions how much are we supported by their encouragements  kind offices when heaven has taken from us some object of our love how sweet is it to have a bosom whereon to recline our heads  into which we may pour the torrent of our tears grief with such a comfort is almost a luxury in a life where we are perpetually exposed to want  accident yours is a wonderful proposition to insulate ourselves to retire from all aid  to wrap ourselves in the mantle of selfsufficiency for assuredly nobody will care for him who cares for nobody but friendship is precious not only in the shade but in the sunshine of life  thanks to a benevolent arrangement of things the greater part of life is sunshine i will recur for proof to the days we have lately passed on these indeed the sun shone brightly how gay did the face of nature appear hills valleys chateaux gardens rivers every object wore its liveliest hue whence did they borrow it from the presence of our charming companion they were pleasing because she seemed pleased alone the scene would have been dull  insipid the participation of it with her gave it relish let the gloomy monk sequestered from the world seek unsocial pleasures in the bottom of his cell let the sublimated philosopher grasp visionary happiness while pursuing phantoms dressed in the garb of truth their supreme wisdom is supreme folly  they mistake for happiness the     mere absence of pain had they ever felt the solid pleasure of one generous spasm of the heart they would exchange for it all the frigid speculations of their lives which you have been vaunting in such elevated terms believe me then my friend that there is a miserable arithmetic which could estimate friendship at nothing or at less than nothing respect for you has induced me to enter into this discussion  to hear principles uttered which i detest  abjure respect for myself now obliges me to recall you into the proper limits of your office when nature assigned us the same habitation she gave us over it a divided empire to you she allotted the field of science to me that of morals when the circle is to be squared or the orbit of a comet to be traced when the arch of greatest strength or the solid of least resistance is to be investigated take up the problem it is yours nature has given me no cognizance of it in like manner in denying to you the feelings of sympathy of benevolence of gratitude of justice of love of friendship she has excluded you from their controul to these she has adapted the mechanism of the heart morals were too essential to the happiness of man to be risked on the incertain combinations of the head she laid their foundation therefore in sentiment not in science that she gave to all as necessary to all this to a few only as sufficing with a few i know indeed that you pretend authority to the sovereign controul of our conduct in all its parts  a respect for your grave saws  maxims a desire to do what is right has sometimes induced me to conform to     your counsels a few facts however which i can readily recall to your memory will suffice to prove to you that nature has not organized you for our moral direction when the poor wearied souldier whom we overtook at chickahomony with his pack on his back begged us to let him get up behind our chariot you began to calculate that the road was full of souldiers  that if all should be taken up our horses would fail in their journey we drove on therefore but soon becoming sensible you had made me do wrong that tho we cannot relieve all the distressed we should relieve as many as we can i turned about to take up the souldier but he had entered a bye path  was no more to be found  from that moment to this i could never find him out to ask his forgiveness again when the poor woman came to ask a charity in philadelphia you whispered that she looked like a drunkard  that half a dollar was enough to give her for the alehouse those who want the dispositions to give easily find reasons why they ought not to give when i sought her out afterwards  did what i should have done at first you know that she employed the money immediately towards placing her child at school if our country when pressed with wrongs at the point of the bayonet had been governed by its heads instead of its hearts where should we have been now hanging on a gallows as high as hamans you began to calculate  to compare wealth and numbers we threw up a few pulsations of our warmest blood we supplied enthusiasm against wealth and numbers we put our existence to the hazard when the hazard     seemed against us and we saved our country justifying at the same time the ways of providence whose precept is to do always what is right and leave the issue to him in short my friend as far as my recollection serves me i do not know that i ever did a good thing on your suggestion or a dirty one without it i do forever then disclaim your interference in my province fill papers as you please with triangles  squares try how many ways you can hang  combine them together i shall never envy nor controul your sublime delights but leave me to decide when  where friendships are to be contracted you say i contract them at random so you said the woman at philadelphia was a drunkard i receive no one into my esteem till i know they are worthy of it wealth title office are no recommendations to my friendship on the contrary great good qualities are requisite to make amends for their having wealth title  office you confess that in the present case i could not have made a worthier choice you only object that i was so soon to lose them we are not immortal ourselves my friend how can we expect our enjoyments to be so we have no rose without its thorn no pleasure without alloy it is the law of our existence  we must acquiesce it is the condition annexed to all our pleasures not by us who receive but by him who gives them true this condition is pressing cruelly on me at this moment i feel more fit for death than life but when i look back on the pleasures of which it is the consequence i am conscious they were worth the price i am paying notwithstanding     your endeavours too to damp my hopes i comfort myself with expectations of their promised return hope is sweeter than despair  they were too good to mean to deceive me in the summer said the gentleman but in the spring said the lady  i should love her forever were it only for that know then my friend that i have taken these good people into my bosom that i have lodged them in the warmest cell i could find that i love them  will continue to love them through life that if fortune should dispose them on one side the globe  me on the other my affections shall pervade its whole mass to reach them knowing then my determination attempt not to disturb it if you can at any time furnish matter for their amusement it will be the office of a good neighbor to do it i will in like manner seize any occasion which may offer to do the like good turn for you with condorcet rittenhouse madison la cretelle or any other of those worthy sons of science whom you so justly prize i thought this a favorable proposition whereon to rest the issue of the dialogue so i put an end to it by calling for my nightcap methinks i hear you wish to heaven i had called a little sooner  so spared you the ennui of such a sermon i did not interrupt them sooner because i was in a mood for hearing sermons you too were the subject  on such a thesis i never think the theme long not even if i am to write it and that slowly  awkwardly as now with the left hand but that you may not be discouraged from a correspondence which begins so     formidably i promise you on my honour that my future letters shall be of a reasonable length i will even agree to express but half my esteem for you for fear of cloying you with too full a dose but on your part no curtailing if your letters are as long as the bible they will appear short to me only let them be brimful of affection i shall read them with the dispositions with which arlequin in les deux billets spelt the words je taime and wished that the whole alphabet had entered into their composition we have had incessant rains since your departure these make me fear for your health as well as that you had an uncomfortable journey the same cause has prevented me from being able to give you any account of your friends here this voyage to fontainebleau will probably send the count de moustier  the marquise de brehan to america danquerville promised to visit me but has not done it as yet de la tude comes sometimes to take family soup with me  entertains me with anecdotes of his five  thirty years imprisonment how fertile is the mind of man which can make the bastile  dungeon of vincennes yield interesting anecdotes you know this was for making four verses on mme de pompadour but i think you told me you did not know the verses they were these sans esprit sans sentiment sans etre belle ni neuve en france on peut avoir le premier amant pompadour en est l epreuve i have read the memoir of his three escapes as to myself my health is good except my wrist which mends slowly  my mind which mends not at all     but broods constantly over your departure the lateness of the season obliges me to decline my journey into the south of france present me in the most friendly terms to mr cosway  receive me into your own recollection with a partiality  a warmth proportioned not to my own poor merit but to the sentiments of sincere affection  esteem with which i have the honour to be my dear madam your most obedient humble servant thomas jefferson oct         paris mrs maria cosway to mrs maria cosway j mss paris octob         my dear madam —just as i had sealed the enclosed i received a letter of a good length dated antwerp with your name at the bottom i prepared myself for a feast i read two or three sentences looked again at the signature to see if i had not mistaken it it was visibly yours read a sentence or two more diable spelt your name distinctly there was not a letter of it omitted began to read again in fine after reading a little  examining the signature alternately half a dozen times i found that your name was to four lines only instead of four pages i thank you for the four lines however because they prove you think of me little indeed but better a little than none to shew how much i think of you i send you the enclosed letter of three sheets of paper being a history of the evening i parted with you but how expect you should read a letter of three mortal sheets of paper i will tell     you divide it into six doses of half a sheet each and every day when the toilette begins take a dose that is to say read half a sheet by this means it will have the only merit its length  dulness can aspire to that of assisting your coiffeuse to procure you six good naps of sleep i will even allow you twelve days to get through it holding you rigorously to one condition only that is that at whatever hour you receive this you do not break the seal of the enclosed till the next toilette of this injunction i require a sacred execution i rest it on your friendship  that in your first letter you tell me honestly whether you have honestly performed it i send you the song i promised bring me in return its subject jours heureux were i a songster i should sing it all to these words dans ces lieux quelle tarde a se rendre learn it i pray you  sing it with feeling my right hand presents its devoirs to and sees with great indignation the left supplanting it in a correspondence so much valued you will know the first moment it can resume its rights the first exercise of them shall be addressed to you as you had the first essay of its rival it will yet however be many a day present my esteem to mr cosway  believe me to be yours very affectionately thomas

one of those follies from which good cannot come     but ill may as yet i have no use of that hand  as the other is an awkward scribe i must be sententious  not waste words yours of sep         oct      have been duly received as have been also the books from lackington  stockdale  the second parcel from dilly the harness is at the douane of paris not yet delivered to me dillys first parcel of books  the first copying press are arrived at rouen you see how much reason i have to say well done thou good and faithful servant with chastelluxs voiages  latrés map i took a great deal more trouble than was necessary such as going myself to the book shop when a servant might as well have gone etc merely from a desire to do something in return for you  that i might feel as if i have done something you desire to know whether the  d order for copying paper  ink was meant to be additional to the former it was but i had now rather not receive the paper because i have found a better kind here the ink i shall be glad of the twelve sheet map i shall send by the first good opportunity  hope ere long to receive the plate of mine from mr neele i will trouble you to have the inclosed note to jones delivered will you undertake to prevail on mr adams to set for his picture  on mr brown to draw it for me i wish to add to those of other principal american characters which i have or shall have  i had rather it should be original than a copy we saw a picture of sr w raleigh at birmingham  i do not know whether it was of mr adams or yourself i asked the favor to get it for me i must pray your taylor to send me a buff casimir   0 waistcoat  breeches with those of cotton  of my shoemaker to send me two pr of thin waxed leather slippers things of this kind come better by private hands if any such should be coming within any reasonable time the accident to my wrist has defected my views of visiting the south of france this fall present me very affectionately to mrs adams and mrs smith i hope the former is very well  that the latter is or has been very sick otherwise i would observe to you that it is high time adieu thomas jefferson nov         paris george washington to george washington j mss paris nov         sir —the house of le coulteux which for some centuries has been the wealthiest of this place has it in contemplation to establish a great company for the fur trade they propose that partners interested one half in the establishment should be american citizens born  residing in the u s yet if i understood them rightly they expect that half of the company which resides here should make the greatest part or perhaps the whole of the advances while those on our side of the water should superintend the details they had at first thought of baltimore as the center of their american transactions i pointed out to them the advantages of alexandria for this purpose they have concluded to take information as to baltimore philadelphia  n york for a principal deposit  having no correspondent at alexandria have asked me to procure a state of the     advantages of that place as also to get a recommendation of the best merchant there to be adopted as partner  head of the business there skill punctuality  integrity are the requisites in such a character they will decide on their whole information as to the place for their principal factory being unwilling that alexandria should lose its pretensions i have undertaken to procure them information as to that place if they undertake this trade at all it will be on so great a scale as to decide the current of the indian trade to the place they adopt i have no acquaintance at alexandria or in its neighborhood but believing you would feel an interest in it from the same motives which i do i venture to ask the favor of you to recommend to me a proper merchant for their purpose  to engage some wellinformed person to send to me a representation of the advantages of alexandria as the principal deposit of the fur trade the author of the political part of the encyclopedie methodique desired me to examine his article etats unis i did so i found it a tissue of errors for in truth they know nothing about us here particularly however the article cincinnati was a mere philippic against that institution in which it appears that there was an utter ignorance of facts  motives i gave him notes on it he reformed it as he supposed  sent it again to me to revise in this reformed state colo humphreys saw it i found it necessary to write that article for him before i gave it to him i showed it to the marq de la fayette who made a correction or two i then     sent it to the author he used the materials mixing a great deal of his own with them in a work which is sure of going down to the latest posterity i thought it material to set facts to rights as much as possible the author was well disposed but could not entirely get the better of his original bias i send you the article as ultimately published if you find any material errors in it  will be so good as to inform me of them i shall probably have opportunities of setting this author to rights what has heretofore passed between us on this institution makes it my duty to mention to you that i have never heard a person in europe learned or unlearned express his thoughts on this institution who did not consider it as dishonorable  destructive to our governments and that every writing which has come out since my arrival here in which it is mentioned considers it even as now reformed as the germ whose development is one day to destroy the fabric we have reared i did not apprehend this while i had american ideas only but i confess that what i have seen in europe has brought me over to that opinion  that tho the day may be at some distance beyond the reach of our lives perhaps yet it will certainly come when a single fibre left of this institution will produce an hereditary aristocracy which will change the form of our governments from the best to the worst in the world to know the mass of evil which flows from this fatal source a person must be in france he must see the finest soil the finest climate the most compact state the most benevolent character of people  every earthly advantage combined insufficient     to prevent this scourge from rendering existence a curse to    out of    parts of the inhabitants of this country with us the branches of this institution cover all the states the southern ones at this time are aristocratical in their disposition and that that spirit should grow  extend itself is within the natural order of things i do not flatter myself with the immortality of our governments but i shall think little also of their longevity unless this germ of destruction be taken out when the society themselves shall weigh the possibility of evil against the impossibility of any good to proceed from this institution i cannot help hoping they will eradicate it i know they wish the permanence of our governments as much as any individuals composing them an interruption here  the departure of the gentleman by whom i send this obliges me to conclude it with assurances of the sincere respect  esteem with which i have the honor to be dear sir your most obedt  most humble servt thomas jefferson dec         paris mrs elizabeth trist to mrs elizabeth trist  paris dec         dear madam —i have duly received your friendly letter of july     received it with great pleasure as i do all those you do me the favor to write me if i have been long in acknowledging the receipt the last cause to which it should be ascribed would be     want of inclination unable to converse with my friends in person i am happy when i do it in black  white the true cause of the delay has been an unlucky dislocation of my wrist which has disabled me from writing three months i only begin to write a little now but with pain i wish while in virginia your curiosity had led you on to james river at richmond you would have seen your old friends mr  mrs randolph and a little further you would have become acquainted with my friend mrs eppes whom you would have found among the most amiable women on earth i doubt whether you would ever have got away from her this trip would have made you better acquainted too with my lazy  hospitable countrymen  you would have found that their character has some good traits mixed with some feeble ones i often wish myself among them as i am here burning the candle of life without present pleasure or future object a dozen or twenty years ago this scene would have amused me but i am past the age for changing habits i take all the fault on myself and it is impossible to be among a people who wish more to make one happy a people of the very best character it is possible for one to have we have no idea in america of the real french character with some true samples we have had many false ones i am very very sorry i did not receive your letter three or four months sooner it would have been absolutely convenient for me while in england to have seen browses relations and i should have done it with infinite pleasure at present i have no particular     expectation of returning there yet it is among possible events and the desire of being useful to him would render it a pleasing one the former journey thither was made at a weeks warning without the least previous expectation living from day to day without a plan for four  twenty hours to come i form no catalogue of impossible events laid up in port for life as i thought myself at one time i am thrown out to sea and an unknown one to me by so slender a thread do all our plans of life hang—my hand itself further every letter admonishing me by a pain that it is time to finish but my heart would go on in expressing to you all its friendship the happiest moments it knows are those in which it is pouring forth its affections to a few esteemed characters i will pray you to write me often i wish to know that you enjoy health and that you are happy present me in the most friendly terms to your mother  brother  be assured of the sincerity of the esteem with which i am dear madam your affectionate friend  humble servant thomas jefferson dec         paris james madison to james madison j mss paris dec         dear sir —after a very long silence i am at length able to write to you an unlucky dislocation of my right wrist has disabled me from using my pen for three months i now begin to use it a little but with great pain so that this letter must be taken up at such intervals as the state of my hand will permit      will probably be the work of some days tho the joint seems to well set the swelling does not abate nor the use of it return i am now therefore on the point of setting out to the south of france to try the use of some mineral waters there by immersion this journey will be of   or   months my last letters to you were of apr     may  0 the latter only a letter of recommendation yours of jan    mar    may    june     aug    remain unacknowledged i enclose you herein a copy of the letter from the minister of finance to me making several advantageous regulations for our commerce the obtaining this has occupied us a twelvemonth i say us because i find the m de la fayette so useful an auxiliary that acknowledgments for his cooperation are always due there remains still something to do for the articles of rice turpentine  ship duties what can be done for tobacco when the late regulation expires is very uncertain the commerce between the u s and this country being put on a good footing we may afterwards proceed to try if anything can be done to favour our intercourse with their colonies admission into them for our fish  flour is very desirable but unfortunately those articles would raise a competition against their own i find by the public papers that your commercial convention failed in point of representation if it should produce a full meeting in may and a broader reformation it will still be well to make us one nation as to foreign concerns  keep us distinct in domestic ones gives the outline of the proper division     of power between the general  particular governments but to enable the federal head to exercise the power given it to best advantage it should be organized as the particular ones are into legislative executive  judiciary the  st  last are already separated the  d should also be when last with congress i often proposed to members to do this by making of the committee of the states an executive committee during the recess of congress and during its sessions to appoint a committee to receive  despatch all executive business so that congress itself should meddle only with what should be legislative but i question if any congress much less all successively can have self denial enough to go through with this distribution the distribution should be imposed on them then i find congress have reversed their division of the western states  proposed to make them fewer  larger this is reversing the natural order of things a tractable people may be governed in large bodies but in proportion as they depart from this character the extent of their government must be less we see into what small divisions the indians are obliged to reduce their societies this measure with the disposition to shut up the mississippi give me serious apprehensions of the severance of the eastern  western parts of our confederacy it might have been made the interest of the western states to remain united with us by managing their interests honestly  for their own good but the moment we sacrifice their interests to our own they will see it is better to govern themselves the moment     they resolve to do this the point is settled a forced connection is neither our interest nor within our power the virginia act for religious freedom has been received with infinite approbation in europe  propagated with enthusiasm i do not mean by the governments but by the individuals which compose them it has been translated into french  italian has been sent to most of the courts of europe  has been the best evidence of the falsehood of those reports which stated us to be in anarchy it is inserted in the new encyclopedie  is appearing in most of the publications respecting america in fact it is comfortable to see the standard of reason at length erected after so many ages during which the human mind has been held in vassalage by kings priests  nobles and it is honorable for us to have produced the first legislature who had the courage to declare that the reason of man may be trusted with the formation of his own opinions i shall be glad when the revisal shall be got thro in the criminal law the principle of retaliation is much criticised here particularly in the case of rape they think the punishment indecent  unjustifiable i should be for altering it but for a different reason that is on account of the temptation women would be under to make it the instrument of vengeance against an inconstant lord  of disappointment to a rival are our courts of justice open for the recovery of british debts according to the septennial act the principles of that act can be justified but the total stoppage of justice cannot the removal of the negroes from new york would duly give cause for     stopping some of the last paiments if the british government should refuse satisfaction which however i think they will not do i thank you for your communications in natural history the several instances of trees c found far below the surface of the earth as in the case of mr hays well seem to set the reason of man at defiance another theory of the earth has been contrived by one whitford not absolutely reasonable but somewhat more so than any that has yet appeared it is full of interesting facts which however being inadequate to his theory he is obliged to supply them from time to time by begging questions it is worth your getting from london if i can be useful to you in ordering books from london you know you may command me you had better send me the duplicate volume of the encyclopedie i will take care to send you the proper one i have many more livraisons for you  have made some other inconsiderable purchases for you in this way but i shall not send them till the spring as a winter passage is bad for books i reserve myself till that time therefore to give you an account of the execution of your several commissions only observing that the watch will not be finished till the spring  that it will be necessary for me to detain her some time on trial because it often happens that a watch looking well to the eye  faithfully made goes badly at first on account of some little circumstance which escapes the eye of the workman when he puts her together  which he could easily rectify—with respect to the proposition   0 about the purchase of lands i had just before made the experiment desired it was to borrow money for aiding the opening of the potowmac which was proposed to me by genl washington i had the benefit of his name  the foundation of a special act of assembly i lodged the papers in the hands of mr grand to try to obtain money on loan at   per cent assuring him that the securities should be made compleatly satisfactory to the lenders after long trial he told me it could not be done that this government has always occasion to borrow more money than can be lent in this country that they pay   per cent per annum in quarterly paiments  with a religious punctuality that besides this they give very considerable douceurs to the lenders that every one therefore would prefer having his money here rather than on the other side the atlantic where distance want of punctuality  a habitual protection of the debtor would be against them there is therefore but one way in which i see any chance of executing your views monied men sometimes talk of investing money in american lands some such might be willing to ensure an advantageous investiture by interesting trustworthy characters in the purchase  to do this might be willing to advance the whole money being properly secured on this head no satisfaction should be wanting which i could give them and as persons with these views sometimes advise with me i shall be attentive to propose to them this plan i consider its success however as only possible not probable        thomas jefferson dec   th      paris charles thomson to charles thomson  paris dec   th      dear sir —a dislocation of my right wrist has for three or four months past disabled me from writing except with my left hand which was too slow and awkward to be employed but in cases of necessity i begin to have so much use of my wrist as to be able to write but it is slowly and in pain i take the first moment i can however to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of aug   july   and  0 in one of these you say you have not been able to learn whether in the new mills in london steam is the immediate mover of the machinery or raises water to move it it is the immediate mover the power of this agent tho long known is but now beginning to be applied to the various purposes of which it is susceptible you observe that whitford supposes it to have been the agent which bursting the earth threw it up into mountains and vallies you ask me what i think of his book i find in it many interesting facts brought together and many ingenious commentaries on them but there are great chasms in his facts and consequently in his reasoning these he fills up with suppositions which may be as reasonably denied as granted a sceptical reader therefore like myself is left in the lurch i acknowledge however he makes more use of fact than any other writer of a theory of the earth but i give one answer to all theorists—that is as follows they all suppose the earth a created existence they must     suppose a creator then and that he possessed power and wisdom to a great degree as he intended the earth for the habitation of animals and vegetables is it reasonable to suppose he made two jobs of his creation that he first made a chaotic lump and set it into motion and then waiting ages necessary to form itself—that when it had done this he stepped in a second time to create the animals and plants which were to inhabit it as a hand of a creator is to be called in it may as well be called in at one stage of the process as another we may as well suppose he created the earth at once nearly in the state in which we see it—fit for the preservation of the beings he placed on it but it is said we have a proof that he did not create it in its solid form but in a state of fluidity because its present shape of an oblate spheroid is precisely that which a fluid mass revolving on its axis would assume but i suppose the same equilibrium between gravity and centrifugal force which would determine a fluid mass into the form of an oblate spheroid would determine the wise creator of that mass if he made it in a solid state to give it the same spherical form a revolving fluid will continue to change its shape till it attains that in which its principles of contrary motion are balanced for if you suppose them not balanced it will change its form now the balanced form is necessary for the preservation of a revolving solid the creator therefore of a revolving solid would make it an oblate spheroid that figure alone admitting a perfect equilibrium he would make it in that form for another reason that is to prevent a     shifting of the axis of rotation had he created the earth perfectly spherical its axis might have been perpetually shifting by the influence of the other bodies of the system and by placing the inhabitants of the earth successively under its poles it might have been depopulated whereas being spheroidical it has but one axis on which it can revolve in equilibrio suppose the axis of the earth to shift   ° then cut it into   0 slices making every section in the plane of a circle of latitude perpendicular to the axis every one of these slices except the equatorial one would be unbalanced as there would be more matter on one side of its axis than on the other there would be but one diameter drawn through such a slice which would divide it into two equal parts on every other possible diameter the parts would hang unequal this would produce an irregularity in the diurnal rotation we may therefore conclude it impossible for the poles of the earth to shift if it was made spheroidically and that it would be made spheroidal tho solid to obtain this end i use this reasoning only on the supposition that the earth has had a beginning i am sure i shall read your conjectures on this subject with great pleasure tho i bespeak before hand a right to indulge my natural incredulity and scepticism the pain in which i write awakens me here from my reverie and obliges me to conclude with compliments to mrs thomson and assurances to yourself of the esteem and affection with which i am dear sir your friend and servant p s since writing the preceding i have had a     conversation on the subject of the steam mills with the famous boulton to whom those of london belong and who is here at this time he compares the effect of steam with that of horses in the following manner   horses aided with the most advantageous combination of the mechanical powers hitherto tried will grind   bushels of flour in an hour at the end of which time they are all in a foam and must rest they can work thus   horses in the    grinding    bushels of flour which is six to each horse for the    hours his steam mill in london consumes   0 bushels of coal in    hours turns  0 prs of stones which grind   bushels of flour an hour each which is    0 bushels in the    hours this makes a peck and a half of coal perform exactly as much as a horse in one day can perform thomas jefferson dec         paris nicholas lewis to nicholas lewis j mss paris    dec      dear sir —i have duly received your favors of march     july    my last to you was of apr    from london i am obliged to you for the particular account you give me of my affairs and the state of the cash account made out by the steward his articles however were generally so shortly expressed as to be quite unintelligible to me of this kind are the following to james foster  benjamin harris pr carter braxton £    0 to richard james  wm clark for cash      0 to joseph ashlin  c stone for cash at different times        0  to vincent markham  richd james pr doctr gilmer      0 to tandy rice  charles rice for cash          ½ to david mullings  henry mullings for cash          to carter braxton pr settlemt by colo lewis          to do for cash           the steward intended this account for my information but mentioning only names  sums without saying in some general way why those sums were paid to those names leaves me uninformed however the account having passed under your eye leaves me also without a doubt that the articles are right i suppose in the  st article for instance that carter braxton to whom i was indebted for a doz bottles of oil only stands in the place of some person to whom i owed £    0 and so of the rest as you give me reason to hope that all other debts will now be paid off i am in hopes the shoulder can be laid solidly to those of farrell  jones  kippen  co to these objects i would wish to apply the whole profits of the estate except the maintenance  education of my sister carrs two sons  the interest of my sister nancys debt i shall propose therefore to jones  mccaul the paying them an annual sum till their debts shall be discharged  i have asked the favor of mr eppes to consult with you  let me know what sum you think i may engage to pay them on an average of one year with another and that you will be so good as to let me know this as soon as possible that i may arrange the matter by agreement with them you mention that the price of tobo is at     i can always be sure of receiving for it delivered at havre    virginia money for the virginia hundred weight     whenever therefore the price with you is less than this after deducting freight insurance commission  port charges if a conveiance can be obtained for it to havre it would be better to ship it to me you may at the same time draw bills on me for the whole amount taking care that they shall not be presented till the tobacco is arrived at havre  that there be such an usence in them as will give me time to sell it  receive the money or for so much of the tobacco as can be destined to jones  mccaul no bills need be drawn as i can remit them the proceeds in all this however you will act according to your own judgment which is much better than mine i cannot help thinking however that it might be worth the experiment to ship me at any rate a small adventure to see how it will turn out but havre is the only port at which i could manage it i observe in your letter of march    after stating the amount of the crop  deducting overseers  stewards parts transportation negroes clothes tools medicine  taxes the profits of the whole estate would be no more than the hire of the few negroes hired out would amount to would it be better to hire more where good masters could be got would it be better to hire plantations  all if proper assurance can be provided for the good usage of everything i am miserable till i owe not a shilling the moment that shall be the case i shall feel myself at liberty to do something for the comfort of my slaves    i am much obliged to you for your attention to my trees  grass the latter is one of the principal pillars on which i shall rely for     subsistence when i shall be at liberty to try projects without injury to any body the negro girl which i sent to nancy bolling was not sent as a gift from me i understood she was claimed under a supposed gift from my mother which tho i thought ill founded i did not chuse to enter into disagreeable discussions about i meant therefore to abandon my right to her and i have no further pretensions to her with my letter from london i send under the care of mr fulwar skipwith a trunk containing some little matters for mr lewis  my sister nancy i hope it got safe to hand i have long had as i once wrote you a pretty little piece of furniture a clock which i meant for mrs lewis tho it is so small that it might almost be put into a pocket i have as yet found it impossible to get a safe conveiance for it the case being of marble  very slender it cannot bear transportation but by water i am obliged therefore to wait till some person shall be going from havre to richmond monsr doradour was to have carried it but he was not able he is safely returned to his family  in good humor with our country he made a considerable tramontane purchase his trip upon the whole turned out better than i had expected i am glad on account of madame de doradour who is a lady of great merit i have never seen her since the departure of her husband but i suppose she will decline further views on america i shall endeavor to send with this a packet of the seeds of trees which i would wish anthony to sow in a large nursery noting well their names there will be a little spanish st foin     represented to me as a very precious grass in a hot country i would have it sowed in one of the vacant lots of my grass ground i have but just room to render you a thousand thanks for your goodness

dec         paris william carmichael to william carmichael j mss paris decr         dear sir —   my notes on virginia having been hastily written need abundance of corrections two or three of these are so material that i am reprinting a few leaves to substitute for the old as soon as these shall be ready i will beg your acceptance of a copy i shall be proud to be permitted to send a copy also to the count de campomanes as a tribute to his science  his virtues you will find in them that the natural bridge had found an admirer in me also i should be happy to make with you a tour of the curiosities you will find therein mentioned that kind of pleasure surpasses much in my estimation whatever i find on this side the atlantic i sometimes think of building a little hermitage at the natural bridge for it is my property and of passing there a part of the year at least i have received american papers to the  st of november some tumultuous meetings of the people have taken place in the eastern states i e one in massachusetts one     in connecticut  one in n hampsh their principal demand was a respite in the judiciary proceedings no injury was done however in a single instance to the person or property of any one nor did the tumult continue    hours in any one instance in massachusetts this was owing to the discretion which the malcontents still preserved in connecticut  n hampshire the body of the people rose in support of government  obliged the malcontents to go to their homes in the last mentioned state they seized about  0 who were in jail for trial it is believed this incident will strengthen our government those people are not entirely without excuse before the war those states depended on their whale oil  fish the former was consumed in england  much of the latter in the mediterranean the heavy duties on american whale oil now required in england exclude it from that market  the algerines exclude them from bringing their fish into the mediterranean france is opening her port for their oil but in the meanwhile their antient debts are pressing them  they have nothing to pay with the massachusetts assembly too in their zeal for paying their public debt had laid a tax too heavy to be paid in the circumstances of their state the indians seem disposed to make war on us these complicated causes determined congress to increase their force to  000 men the latter was the sole object avowed yet the former entered for something into the measure however i am satisfied the good sense of the people is the strongest army our government can ever have    0 that it will not fail them the commercial convention at annapolis was not full enough to do business they found too their appointments too narrow being confined to the article of commerce they have proposed a meeting in philadelphia in may and that it may be authorized to propose amendments of whatever is defective in the federal constitution congress have at length determined on a coinage their money unit is a dollar  the pieces above  below that are in decimal proportion you will see their scheme in all the papers except that the proportion they established between gold  silver is mistated at upwards of  0 to   instead of about   ¼ to   it is believed that this court has patched up an accommodation for the moment between russia  the porte in holland they find greater difficulties the present king of prussia is zealous for the stadholder  the fear is of driving him into the austrian scale of the european balance such a weight as this shifted would destroy all equilibriums and the preponderance once in favor of the restless powers of the north the peace would soon be disturbed when i was in england i formed a portable copying press on the principle of the large one they make there for copying letters i had a model made there  it has answered perfectly a workman here has made several from that model the itinerent temper of your court will i think render one of these useful to you you must therefore do me the favor to accept of one i have it now in readiness  shall send     it by the way of bayonne to the care of mr alexander there unless don miguel de lardizabal can carry it with him my hand admonishes me it is time to stop  that i must defer writing to mr barclay till tomorrow thomas jefferson jan        paris alexander mccaul to alexander mccaul  j mss paris jan        dear sir —in the letter which i had the honor of addressing you from london on the   th of april      i informed you that i had left my estate in the hands of a mr eppes  a mr lewis who were first to clear off some debts which had been necessarily contracted during the war  afterwards to apply the whole profits to the paiment of my debt to you by which i mean that to the several firms with which you were connected and of my part of a debt due from mr wayless estate to farrell  jones of bristol being anxious to begin the paiment of these two debts  finding that it would be too long postponed if the residuary ones were to be paid merely from the annual profits of the estate a number of slaves have been sold  i have lately received information from messrs eppes  lewis that the proceeds of that sale with the profits of the estate to the end of      would pay off the whole of the residuary debts as we are now therefore clear of embarrasments to pursue our principal object i am desirous of arranging with you such just  practicable conditions as will ascertain to     you the receipt of your debt  give me the satisfaction of knowing that you are contented what the laws of virginia are or may be will in no wise influence my conduct substantial justice is my object as decided by reason  not by authority or compulsion the article of interest may make a difficulty i had the honour of observing to you in my former letter that i thought it just i should pay it for all the time preceding the war  all the time subsequent to it but that for the time during the war i did not consider myself as bound in justice to pay this includes the period from the commencement of hostilities apr         to their cessation april         being exactly eight years to the reasons against this paiment which apply in favor of the whole mass of american debtors i added the peculiar circumstance of having already lost the debt principal  interest by endeavoring to pay it by the sale of lands  by the depreciation of their price  also a second loss of an equal sum by ld cornwalliss barbarous  useless depredations i will therefore refer you to that letter to save the repetition here of those reasons which absolve me in justice from the paiment of this portion of interest in law our courts have uniformly decided that the treaty of peace stipulates the paiment of the principal only  not of any interest whatever this article being once settled i would propose to divide the clear proceeds of my estate in which there are from  0 to  00 labouring slaves between yourself  farrell  jones one third to you and two thirds to them  that the crop of this present year          shall constitute the first payment that crop you know cannot be got to the warehouse completely till may of the next year  i presume that three months more will be little enough to send it to europe or to sell it in virginia  remit the money so that i could not safely answer for placing the proceeds in your hands till the month of august  so annually every august afterwards till the debt shall be paid it will always be both my interest and my wish to get it to you as much sooner as possible  probably a part of it may always be paid some months sooner if the assigning the profits in general terms may seem to you too vague i am willing to fix the annual paiment at a sum certain but that i may not fall short of my engagement i shall name it somewhat less than i suppose may be counted on i shall fix your part at two hundred pounds sterling annually and as you know our crops of tobacco to be incertain i should reserve a right if they should fall short one year to make it up the ensuing one without being supposed to have failed in my engagement but i would be obliged every second year to pay any arrearages of the preceding one together with the full sum for the current year so that once in every two years the annual paiment should be fully paid up i do not know what the balance is having for a long time before the war had no settlement yet there can be no difficulty in making that settlement  in the mean while the paiments may proceed without affecting the right of either party to have a just settlement if you think proper to accede to these propositions     be so good as to say so at the foot of a copy of this letter on my receipt of that i will send you an acknowledgement of it which shall render this present letter obligatory on me for the paiment of the debt before mentioned  interest at the epochs  in the proportions before mentioned excepting always the interest during the war this done you may count on my faithful execution of it i avail myself of this as of every other occasion of recalling myself to your friendly recollection  of assuring you of the sentiments of perfect esteem and attachment with which i am c thomas jefferson jan        paris william jones to william jones j mss paris jan        sir —when i had the pleasure of seeing you in london i mentioned to you that the affairs of mr wayless estate were left to be ultimately settled by mr eppes the only acting executor that i had left in his hands also  in those of a mr lewis the part of mr wayless estate which came to me together with my own that they were first to clear off some debts which had been necessarily contracted during the war  would after that apply the whole profits to the paiment of my part of mr wayless debt to you  to a debt of mine to kippen  co of glasgow being anxious to begin the paiment of these two debts  finding that it would be too long postponed if the residuary ones were to be paid merely from the annual profits of the estate a number     of slaves have been sold  i have lately received information from messrs eppes  lewis that the proceeds of that sale with the profits of the estate to the end of      would pay off the whole of the residuary debts as we are now therefore clear of embarrassment to pursue our principal object i am desirous of arranging with you such just  practicable conditions as will ascertain to you the terms at which you will receive my part of your debt  give me the satisfaction of knowing that you are contented what the laws of virginia are or may be will in no wise influence my conduct substantial justice is my object as decided by reason  not by authority or compulsion the first question which arises is as to the article of interest for all the time preceding the war  all subsequent to it i think it reasonable that interest should be paid but equally unreasonable during the war interest is a compensation for the use of money your money in my hands is in the form of lands  negroes from these during the war no use no profits could be derived tobacco is the article they produce that can only be turned into money at a foreign market but the moment it went out of our ports for that purpose it was captured either by the kings ships or by those of individuals the consequence was that tobacco worth from twenty to thirty shillings the hundred sold generally in virginia during the war for five shillings this price it is known will not maintain the labourer  pay his taxes there was no surplus of profit then to pay an interest in the mean while we stood insurers of     the lives of the labourers  of the ultimate issue of the war he who attempted during the war to remit either his principal or interest must have expected to remit three times to make one paiment because it is supposed that two out of three parts of the shipments were taken it was not possible then for the debtor to derive any profit from the money which might enable him to pay an interest nor yet to get rid of the principal by remitting it to his creditor with respect to the creditors in great britain they mostly turned their attention to privateering and arming the vessels they had before emploied in trading with us they captured on the seas not only the produce of the farms of their debtors but of those of the whole state they thus paid themselves by capture more than their annual interest and we lost more some merchants indeed did not engage in privateering these lost their interest but we did not gain it it fell into the hands of their countrymen it cannot therefore be demanded of us as between these merchants  their debtors it is a case where a loss being incurred each party may justifiably endeavor to shift it from himself each has an equal right to avoid it one party can never expect the other to yield a thing to which he has as good a right as the demander we even think he has a better right than the demander in the present instance this loss has been occasioned by the fault of the nation which was creditor our right to avoid it then stands on less exceptionable ground than theirs but it will be said that each party thought the other the aggressor in these disputes     there is but one umpire  that has decided the question where the world in general thought the right laid besides these reasons in favor of the general mass of debtors i have some peculiar to my own case in the year      before a shilling of paper money was issued i sold lands to the amount of £  00 in order to pay these two debts i offered the bonds of the purchasers to your agent mr evans if he would acquit me  accept of the purchasers as debtors in my place they were as sure as myself had he done it these debts being turned over to you would have been saved to you by the treaty of peace but he declined it great sums of paper money were afterwards issued this depreciated and paiment was made me in this money when it was but a shadow our laws do not entitle their own citizens to require repaiment in these cases tho the treaty authorizes the british creditor to do it here then i lost the principal and interest once again ld cornwallis encamped  0 days on an estate of mine at elk island having his headquarters in my house he burned all the tobacco houses and barns on the farm with the produce of the former year in them he burnt all the enclosures  wasted the fields in which the crop of that year was growing it was the month of june he killed or carried off every living animal cutting the throats of those which were too young for service of the slaves he carried away thirty the useless  barbarous injury he did me in that instance was more than would have paid your debt principal  interest thus i lost it a second     time still i lay my shoulder assiduously to the paiment of it a third time in doing this however i think yourself will be of opinion i am authorized in justice to clear it of every article not demandable in strict right of this nature i consider interest during the war another question is as to the paper money i deposited in the treasury of virginia towards the discharge of this debt i before observed that i had sold lands to the amount of £  00 before a shilling of paper money was emitted with a view to pay this debt i received this money in depreciated paper the state was then calling on those who owed money to british subjects to bring it into the treasury engaging to pay a like sum to the creditor at the end of the war i carried the identical money therefore to the treasury where it was applied as all the money of the same description was to the support of the war subsequent events have been such that the state cannot  ought not to pay the same nominal sum in gold or silver which they received in paper nor is it certain what they will do my intention being  having always been that whatever the state decides you shall receive my part of the debt fully i am ready to remove all difficulty arising from this deposit to take back to myself the demand against the state  to consider the deposit as originally made for myself  not for you these two articles of interest  paper money being thus settled i would propose to divide the clear proceeds of the estate in which there are from  0 to  00 labouring slaves between yourself  kippen      co two thirds to you and one third to them  that the crop of this present year      shall constitute the first paiment that crop you know cannot be got to the warehouse completely till may of the next year  i suppose that three months more will be little enough to send it to europe or to sell it in virginia  remit the money so that i could not safely answer for placing the proceeds in your hands till the month of august and so annually every august afterwards till the debt shall be paid it will always be both my interest  my wish to get it to you as much sooner as possible  probably a part of it may always be paid some months sooner if the assigning of the profits in general terms may seem to you too vague i am willing to fix the annual paiment at a sum certain but that i may not fall short of my engagement i shall name it somewhat less than i suppose may be counted on i shall fix your part at four hundred pounds sterling annually and as you know our crops of tobacco to be incertain i should reserve a right if they fall short one year to make it up the ensuing one without being supposed to have failed in my engagement but every other year at least all arrearages shall be fully paid up my part of this debt of mr wayless estate being one third i should require that in proportion as i pay my third i shall stand discharged as to the other two thirds so that the paiment of every hundred pounds shall discharge me as to three hundred pounds of the undivided debt the other gentlemen have equal means of paying equal desires and more skill in affairs their parts of the debt therefore are at   0 least as sure as mine  my great object is in case of any accident to myself to leave my family uninvolved with any matters whatever i do not know what the balance of this debt is the last acct current i saw was before the war making the whole balance principal  interest somewhere about nine thousand pounds  after this there were upwards of four hundred hogshead of tobacco  some paiments in money to be credited however this settlement can admit of no difficulty  in the mean time the payments may proceed without affecting the right of either party to have a just settlement upon the whole then i propose that on your part you relinquish the claim to interest during the war say from the commencement of hostilities april         to their cessation april         being exactly eight years and that in proportion as i pay my third i shall be acquitted as to the other two thirds on my part i take on myself the loss of the paper money deposited in the treasury i agree to pay interest previous  subsequent to the war and oblige myself to remit to you for that  the principal four hundred pounds sterling annually till my third of the whole debt shall be fully paid  i will begin these paiments in august of the next year if you think proper to accede to these propositions be so good as to say so at the foot of a copy of this letter on my receipt of that i will send you an acknowledgement of it which shall render this present letter obligatory on me in which case you may count on my faithful execution of this undertaking     thomas jefferson jan         paris edward carrington to edward carrington  j mss paris jan         dear sir —uncertain whether you might be at new york at the moment of colo frankss arrival i have inclosed my private letters for virginia under cover to our delegation in general which otherwise i would have taken the liberty to inclose particularly to you as best acquainted with the situation of the persons to whom they are addressed should this find you at new york i will still ask your attention to them the two large packages addressed to colo n lewis contain seeds not valuable enough to pay postage but which i would wish to be sent by the stage or any similar quick conveyance the letters to colo lewis  mr eppes who take care of my affairs are particularly interesting to me the package for colo richd cary our judge of admiralty near hampton contains seeds  roots not to be sent by post whether they had better go by the stage or by water you will be the best judge i beg your pardon for giving you this trouble but my situation  your goodness will i hope excuse it in my letter to mr jay i have mentioned the meeting of the notables appointed for the   th inst it is now put off to the  th or  th of next month this event which will hardly excite any attention in america is deemed here the most important one which has taken place in their civil line during the present century some promise their country great things from it some nothing our friend de la fayette was placed on the list originally afterwards his name disappeared     but finally was reinstated this shews that his character here is not considered as an indifferent one and that it excites agitation his education in our school has drawn on him a very jealous eye from a court whose principles are the most absolute despotism but i hope he has nearly passed his crisis the king who is a good man is favorably disposed towards him  he is supported by powerful family connections  by the public good will he is the youngest man of the notables except one whose office placed him on the list the count de vergennes has within these ten days had a very severe attack of what is deemed an unfixed gout he has been well enough however to do business today but anxieties for him are not yet quieted he is a great  good minister and an accident to him might endanger the peace of europe the tumults in america i expected would have produced in europe an unfavorable opinion of our political state but it has not on the contrary the small effect of these tumults seems to have given more confidence in the firmness of our governments the interposition of the people themselves on the side of government has had a great effect on the opinion here i am persuaded myself that the good sense of the people will always be found to be the best army they may be led astray for a moment but will soon correct themselves the people are the only censors of their governors and even their errors will tend to keep these to the true principles of their institution to punish these errors too severely would be to suppress the only safeguard of the public     liberty the way to prevent these irregular interpositions of the people is to give them full information of their affairs thro the channel of the public papers  to contrive that those papers should penetrate the whole mass of the people the basis of our governments being the opinion of the people the very first object should be to keep that right and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government i should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter but i should mean that every man should receive those papers  be capable of reading them i am convinced that those societies as the indians which live without government enjoy in their general mass an infinitely greater degree of happiness than those who live under the european governments among the former public opinion is in the place of law  restrains morals as powerfully as laws ever did anywhere among the latter under pretence of governing they have divided their nations into two classes wolves  sheep i do not exaggerate this is a true picture of europe cherish therefore the spirit of our people and keep alive their attention do not be too severe upon their errors but reclaim them by enlightening them if once they become inattentive to the public affairs you  i  congress  assemblies judges  governors shall all become wolves it seems to be the law of our general nature in spite of individual exceptions and experience declares that man is the only animal which devours his own kind for i can apply no milder term to the governments of europe and     to the general prey of the rich on the poor the want of news has led me into disquisition instead of narration forgetting you have every day enough of that i shall be happy to hear from you sometimes only observing that whatever passes thro the post is read  that when you write what should be read by myself only you must be so good as to confide your letter to some passenger or officer of the packet i will ask your permission to write to you sometimes and to assure you of the esteem  respect with which i have honour to be dear sir your most obedient  most humble servt thomas jefferson jan  0      paris james madison to james madison  j mss paris jan  0      dear sir —my last to you was of the   th of dec since which i have received yours of nov     dec   which afforded me as your letters always do a treat on matters public individual  œconomical i am impatient to learn your sentiments on the late troubles in the eastern states so far as i have yet seen they do not appear to threaten serious consequences those states have suffered by the stoppage of the channels of their commerce which have not yet found other issues this must render money scarce and make the people uneasy this uneasiness has produced acts absolutely unjustifiable but     i hope they will provoke no severities from their governments a consciousness of those in power that their administration of the public affairs has been honest may perhaps produce too great a degree of indignation and those characters wherein fear predominates over hope may apprehend too much from these instances of irregularity they may conclude too hastily that nature has formed man insusceptible of any other government but that of force a conclusion not founded in truth nor experience societies exist under three forms sufficiently distinguishable   without government as among our indians   under governments wherein the will of every one has a just influence as is the case in england in a slight degree and in our states in a great one   under governments of force as is the case in all other monarchies and in most of the other republics to have an idea of the curse of existence under these last they must be seen it is a government of wolves over sheep it is a problem not clear in my mind that the first condition is not the best but i believe it to be inconsistent with any great degree of population the second state has a great deal of good in it the mass of mankind under that enjoys a precious degree of liberty  happiness it has its evils too the principal of which is the turbulence to which it is subject but weigh this against the oppressions of monarchy and it becomes nothing malo periculosam libertatem quam quietam servitutem even this evil is productive of good it prevents the degeneracy of government and nourishes a general attention to the     public affairs i hold it that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing  as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical unsuccessful rebellions indeed generally establish the encroachments on the rights of the people which have produced them an observation of this truth should render honest republican governors so mild in their punishment of rebellions as not to discourage them too much it is a medicine necessary for the sound health of government if these transactions give me no uneasiness i feel very differently at another piece of intelligence to wit the possibility that the navigation of the mississippi may be abandoned to spain i never had any interest westward of the alleghaney  i never will have any but i have had great opportunities of knowing the character of the people who inhabit that country and i will venture to say that the act which abandons the navigation of the mississippi is an act of separation between the eastern  western country it is a relinquishment of five parts out of eight of the territory of the united states an abandonment of the fairest subject for the paiment of our public debts  the chaining those debts on our own necks in perpetuum i have the utmost confidence in the honest intentions of those who concur in this measure but i lament their want of acquaintance with the character  physical advantages of the people who right or wrong will suppose their interests sacrificed on this occasion to the contrary interests of that part of the confederacy in possession of present power if they declare themselves a separate people we are     incapable of a single effort to retain them our citizens can never be induced either as militia or as souldiers to go there to cut the throats of their own brothers  sons or rather to be themselves the subjects instead of the perpetrators of the parricide nor would that country requite the cost of being retained against the will of its inhabitants could it be done but it cannot be done they are able already to rescue the navigation of the mississippi out of the hands of spain  to add new orleans to their own territory they will be joined by the inhabitants of louisiana this will bring on a war between them  spain and that will produce the question with us whether it will not be worth our while to become parties with them in the war in order to reunite them with us  thus correct our error  were i to permit my forebodings to go one step further i should predict that the inhabitants of the u s would force their rulers to take the affirmative of that question i wish i may be mistaken in all these opinions we have for some time expected that the chevalier de la luzerne would obtain a promotion in the diplomatic line by being appointed to some of the courts where this country keeps an ambassador but none of the vacancies taking place which had been counted on i think the present disposition is to require his return to his station in america he told me himself lately that he should return in the spring i have never pressed this matter on the court tho i knew it to be desirable and desired on our part because if the compulsion on him to return had been     the work of congress he would have returned in such ill temper with them as to disappoint them in the good they expected from it he would forever have laid at their door his failure of promotion i did not press it for another reason which is that i have great reason to believe that the character of the count de moustier who would go were the chevalier to be otherwise provided for would give the most perfect satisfaction in america as you are now returned into congress it will become of importance that you should form a just estimate of certain public characters on which therefore i will give you such notes as my knolege of them has furnished me with you will compare them with the materials you are otherwise possessed of and decide on a view of the whole mr carmichael is i think very little known in america i never saw him  while i was in congress i formed rather a disadvantageous idea of him his letters received then showed him vain  more attentive to ceremony  etiquette than we suppose men of sense should be i have now a constant correspondence with him and find him a little hypochondriac and discontented he possesses very good understanding tho not of the first order i have had great opportunities of searching into his character and have availed myself of them many persons of different nations coming from madrid to paris all speak of him as in high esteem  i think it certain that he has more of the count de florida blancas friendship than any diplomatic character at that court as long as this minister is in office carmichael can do more     than any other person who could be sent there you will see franks and doubtless he will be asking some appointment i wish there may be any one for which he is fit he is light indiscreet active honest affectionate tho bingham is not in diplomatic office yet as he wishes to be so i will mention such circumstances of him as you might otherwise be deceived in he will make you believe he was on the most intimate footing with the first characters in europe  versed in the secrets of every cabinet not a word of this is true he had a rage for being presented to great men  had no modesty in the methods by which he could if he attained acquaintance afterwards it was with such  0 who were susceptible of impression from the beauty of his wife i must except the marquis de bonclearren who had been an old acquaintance the marquis de la fayette is a most valuable auxiliary to me his zeal is unbounded  his weight with those in power great his education having been merely military commerce was an unknown field to him but his good sense enabling him to comprehend perfectly whatever is explained to him his agency has been very efficacious he has a great deal of sound genius is well remarked by the king  rising in popularity he has nothing against him but the suspicion of republican principles i think he will one day be of the ministry his foible is a canine appetite for popularity and fame but he will get above this the count de vergennes is ill the possibility of his recovery renders it dangerous for us to express a doubt of it but he is in danger he is a great minister in european affairs but has very   0 imperfect ideas of our institutions and no confidence in them his devotion to the principles of pure despotism renders him unaffectionate to our governments but his fear of england makes him value us as a make weight he is cool reserved in political conversations but free and familiar on other subjects and a very attentive agreeable person to do business with it is impossible to have a clearer better organized head but age has chilled his heart nothing should be spared on our part to attach this country to us it is the only one on which we can rely for support under every event its inhabitants love us more i think than they do any other nation on earth this is very much the effect of the good dispositions with which the french officers returned in a former letter i mentioned to you the dislocation of my wrist i can make not the least use of it except for the single article of writing though it is going on five months since the accident happened i have great anxieties lest i should never recover any considerable use of it i shall by the advice of my surgeons set out in a fortnight for the waters of aix in provence i chose these out of several they proposed to me because if they fail to be effectual my journey will not be useless altogether it will give me an opportunity of examining the canal of languedoc and of acquiring knowledge of that species of navigation which may be useful hereafter but more immediately it will enable me to make the tour of the ports concerned in commerce with us to examine on the spot the defects of the late regulations respecting our commerce to learn the further improvements     which may be made in it and on my return to get this business finished i shall be absent between two and three months unless anything happens to recall me here sooner which may always be effected in ten days in whatever part of my route i may be in speaking of characters i omitted those of reyneval and hennin the two eyes of count de vergennes the former is the most important character because possessing the most of the confidence of the count he is rather cunning than wise his views of things being neither great nor liberal he governs himself by principles which he has learned by rote and is fit only for the details of execution his heart is susceptible of little passions but not of good ones he is brotherinlaw to m gerard from whom he received disadvantageous impressions of us which cannot be effaced he has much duplicity hennin is a philosopher sincere friendly liberal learned beloved by everybody the other by nobody i think it a great misfortune that the united states are in the department of the former as particulars of this kind may be useful to you in your present situation i may hereafter continue the chapter i know it will be safely lodged in your discretion feb   since writing thus far franks is returned from england i learn that mr adams desires to be recalled  that smith should be appointed chargé des affaires there it is not for me to decide whether any diplomatic character should be kept at a court which keeps none with us you can judge of smiths abilities by his letters they are not of the first order but they are good for his honesty he is like     our friend monroe turn his soul wrong side outwards and there is not a speck on it he has one foible an excessive inflammability of temper but he feels it when it comes on and has resolution enough to suppress it and to remain silent till it passes over i send you by colo franks your pocket telescope walking stick  chemical box the two former could not be combined together the latter could not be had in the form you referred to having a great desire to have a portable copying machine  being satisfied from some experiments that the principle of the large machine might be applied in a small one i planned one when in england  had it made it answers perfectly i have since set a workman to making them here  they are in such demand that he has his hands full being assured that you will be pleased to have one when you shall have tried its convenience i send you one by colo franks the machine costs    livres the appendages    livres and i send you paper  ink for    livres in all     livres there is a printed paper of directions but you must expect to make many essays before you succeed perfectly a soft brush like a shaving brush is more convenient than the sponge you can get as much ink  paper as you please from london the paper costs a guinea a ream thomas jefferson feb         paris mrs john abigail adams to mrs john abigail adams j mss paris feb         dear madam —i am to acknowledge the honor of your letter of jan    and of the papers you were so     good as to send me they were the latest i had seen or have yet seen they left off too in a critical moment just at the point where the malcontents make their submission on condition of pardon  before the answer of government was known i hope they pardoned them the spirit of resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions that i wish it to be always kept alive it will often be exercised when wrong but better so than not to be exercised at all i like a little rebellion now  then it is like a storm in the atmosphere it is wonderful that no letter or paper tells us who is president of congress tho there are letters in paris to the beginning of january i suppose i shall hear when i come back from my journey which will be eight months after he will have been chosen and yet they complain of us for not giving them intelligence our notables assembled today and i hope before the departure of mr cairnes i shall have heard something of their proceedings worth communicating to mr adams the most remarkable effect of this convention as yet is the number of puns  bon mots it has generated i think were they all collected it would make a more voluminous work than the encyclopedie this occasion more than any thing i have seen convinces me that this nation is incapable of any serious effort but under the word of command the people at large view every object only as it may furnish puns and bon mots and i pronounce that a good punster would disarm the whole nation were they ever so seriously disposed to revolt indeed madam they are gone when a measure so capable of     doing good as the calling the notables is treated with so much ridicule we may conclude the nation desperate  in charity pray that heaven may send them good kings—the bridge at the place louis xv is begun the hotel dieu is to be abandoned  new ones to be built the old houses on the bridges are in a course of demolition this is all i know of paris we are about to lose the count darande who has desired  obtained his recall fernand nunner before destined for london is to come here the abbes arnoux  chalut are well the dutchess danville somewhat recovered from the loss of her daughter mrs barrett very homesick and fancying herself otherwise sick they will probably remove to honfleur this is all our news i have only to add then that mr cairnes has taken charge of    aunes of black lace for you at   livres the aune purchased by petit  therefore i hope better purchased than some things have been for you and that i am dear madam your affectionate  humble servant thomas jefferson march         aix en provence martha jefferson to martha jefferson  aix en provence march         i was happy my dear patsey to receive on my arrival here your letter informing me of your good health and occupation i have not written to you sooner because i have been almost constantly on the road my journey hitherto had been a very pleasing one it was undertaken with the hope that the     mineral waters of this place might restore strength to my wrist other considerations also concurred—instruction amusement and abstraction from business of which i had too much at paris i am glad to learn that you are employed in things new and good in your music and drawing you know what have been my fears for some time past—that you did not employ yourself so closely as i could wish you have promised me a more assiduous attention and i have great confidence in what you promise it is your future happiness which interests me and nothing can contribute more to it moral rectitude always excepted than the contracting a habit of industry and activity of all the cankers of human happiness none corrodes with so silent yet so baneful an influence as indolence body and mind both unemployed our being becomes a burthen and every object about us loathsome even the dearest idleness begets ennui ennui the hypochondriac and that a diseased body no laborious person was ever yet hysterical exercise and application produce order in our affairs health of body and cheerfulness of mind and these make us precious to our friends it is while we are young that the habit of industry is formed if not then it never is afterwards the fortune of our lives therefore depends on employing well the short period of youth if at any moment my dear you catch yourself in idleness start from it as you would from the precipice of a gulf you are not however to consider yourself as unemployed while taking exercise that is necessary for your health and health is the first of all objects for     this reason if you leave your dancingmaster for the summer you must increase your other exercises i do not like your saying that you are unable to read the ancient print of your livy but with the aid of your master we are always equal to what we undertake with resolution a little degree of this will enable you to decipher your livy if you always lean on your master you will never be able to proceed without him it is part of the american character to consider nothing as desperate to surmount every difficulty by resolution and contrivance in europe there are shops for every want its inhabitants therefore have no idea that their wants can be supplied otherwise remote from all other aid we are obliged to invent and to execute to find means within ourselves and not to lean on others consider therefore the conquering your livy as an exercise in the habit of surmounting difficulties a habit which will be necessary to you in the country where you are to live and without which you will be thought a very helpless animal and less esteemed music drawing books invention and exercise will be so many resources to you against ennui but there are others which to this object add that of utility these are the needle and domestic economy the latter you cannot learn here but the former you may in the country life of america there are many moments when a woman can have recourse to nothing but her needle for employment in a dull company and in dull weather for instance it is illmanners to read illmanners to leave them no cardplaying there among genteel people—that     is abandoned to blackguards the needle is then a valuable resource besides without knowing how to use it herself how can the mistress of a family direct the work of her servants you ask me to write you long letters i will do it my dear on condition you will read them from time to time and practice what they inculcate their precepts will be dictated by experience by a perfect knolege of the situation in which you will be placed and by the fondest love for you this it is which makes me wish to see you more qualified than common my expectations from you are high yet not higher than you may attain industry and resolution are all that are wanting nobody in this world can make me so happy or so miserable as you retirement from public life will ere long become necessary for me to your sister and yourself i look to render the evening of my life serene and contented its morning has been clouded by loss after loss till i have nothing left but you i do not doubt either your affections or dispositions but great exertions are necessary and you have little time left to make them be industrious then my child think nothing insurmountable by resolution and application and you will be all that i wish you to be you ask if it is my desire that you should dine at the abbesss table it is propose it as such to madame de frauleinheim with my respectful compliments and thanks for her care of you continue to love me with all the warmth with which you are beloved by my dear patsey yours affectionately     thomas jefferson april        toulon martha jefferson to martha jefferson  toulon april  th      my dear patsey —i received yesterday at marseilles your letter of march   th and i received it with pleasure because it announced to me that you are well experience learns us to be always anxious about the health of those whom we love i have not been able to write to you as often as i expected because i am generally on the road and when i stop anywhere i am occupied in seeing what is to be seen it will be some time now perhaps three weeks before i shall be able to write you again but this need not slacken your writing to me because you have leisure and your letters come regularly to me i have received letters which inform me that our dear polly will certainly come to us this summer by the time i return it will be time to expect her when she arrives she will become a precious charge on your hands the difference of your age and your common loss of a mother will put that office on you teach her above all things to be good because without that we can neither be valued by others nor set any value on ourselves teach her to be always true no vice is so mean as the want of truth and at the same time so useless teach her never to be angry anger only serves to torment ourselves to divert others and alienate their esteem and teach her industry and application to useful pursuits i will venture to assure you that if you inculcate this in her mind you will make her a happy being herself a most inestimable friend to you and precious to all the world     in teaching her these dispositions of mind you will be more fixed in them yourself and render yourself dear to all your acquaintances practice them then my dear without ceasing if ever you find yourself in difficulty and doubt how to extricate yourself do what is right and you will find it the easiest way of getting out of the difficulty do it for the additional incitement of increasing the happiness of him who loves you infinitely and who is my dear patsey yours affectionately thomas jefferson may        marseilles john jay to the secretary for foreign affairs john jay j mss marseilles may        sir —i had the honour of receiving at aix your letter of feb   and immediately wrote to the count de montmorin explaining the delay of the answer of congress to the kings letter and desired mr short to deliver that answer with my letter to monsieur de montmorin which he accordingly informs me he has done my absence prevented my noting to you in the first moment the revolution which has taken place at paris in the department of finance by the substitution of monsieur de fourqueux in the place of monsieur de calonnes so that you will have heard of it through other channels before this will have the honour of reaching you having staid at aix long enough to prove the inefficacy of the waters i came on to this place for the purpose of informing myself here as i mean to   0 do at the other seaport towns of whatever may be interesting to our commerce so far as carried on in our own bottoms i find it almost nothing  so it must probably remain till something can be done with the algerines tho severely afflicted with the plague they have come out within these few days  shewed themselves in force along the coast of genoa cannonading a little town  taking several vessels among other objects of inquiry this was the place to learn something more certain on the subject of rice as it is a great emporium for that of the levant  of italy i wished particularly to know whether it was the use of a different machine for cleaning which brought european rice to market less broken than ours as had been represented to me by those who deal in that article in paris i found several persons who had passed thro the rice country of italy but not one who could explain to me the nature of the machine but i was given to believe that i might see it myself immediately on entering piedmont as this would require but about three weeks i determined to go  ascertain this point as the chance only of placing our rice above all rivalship in quality as it is in colour by the introduction of a better machine if a better existed seemed to justify the application of that much time to it i found the rice country to be in truth lombardy  00 miles further than had been represented  that tho called piedmont rice not a grain is made in the country of piedmont i passed thro the rice fields of the venellese  milanese about  0 miles  returned from thence last night having found that the machine is     absolutely the same as ours and of course that we need not listen more to that suggestion it is a difference in the species of grain of which the government of turin is so sensible that as i was informed they prohibit the exportation of rough rice on pain of death i have taken measures however for obtaining a quantity of it which i think will not fail  i bought on the spot a small parcel which i have with me as further details on this subject to congress would be misplaced i propose on my return to paris to communicate them  send the rice to the society at charlestown for promoting agriculture supposing that they will be best able to try the experiment of cultivating the rice of this quality and to communicate the species to the two states of s carolina  georgia if they find it answer i thought the staple of these two states was entitled to this attention and that it must be desirable to them to be able to furnish rice of the two qualities demanded in europe especially as the greater consumption is in the forms for which the lombardy quality is preferred the mass of our countrymen being interested in agriculture i hope i do not err in supposing that in a time of profound peace as the present to enable them to adapt their productions to the market to point out markets for them and endeavor to obtain favorable terms of reception is within the line of my duty my journey into this part of the country has procured me information which i will take the liberty of communicating to congress in october last i received a letter dated montpelier octob            announcing to me that the writer was a foreigner who had a matter of very great consequence to communicate to me and desired i would indicate the channel thro which it might pass safely i did so i received soon after a letter in the following words omitting only the formal parts thomas

inhabitants as portugal they are   portuguese   native whites   black  mulatto slaves   indians civilized  savage   the portuguese are few in number mostly married there have lost sight of their native country as well as the prospect of returning to it  are disposed to become independant   the native whites form the body of their nation   the slaves are as numerous as the free   the civilized indians have no energy  the savage would not meddle there are  0000 regular troops originally these were portuguese but as they died off they were replaced by natives so that these compose     at present the mass of the troops  may be counted on by their native country the officers are partly portuguese partly brazilians their bravery is not doubted  they understand the parade but not the science of their profession they have no bias for portugal but no energy either for anything the priests are partly portuguese partly brazilians  will not interest themselves much the noblesse are scarcely known as such they will in no manner be distinguished from the people the men of letters are those most desirous of a revolution the people are not much under the influence of their priests most of them read  write possess arms  are in the habit of using them for hunting the slaves will take the side of their masters in short as to the question of revolution there is but one mind in that country but there appears no person capable of conducting a revolution or willing to venture himself at its head without the aid of some powerful nation as the people of their own might fail them there is no printing press in brazil they consider the north american revolution as a precedent for theirs they look to the united states as most likely to give them honest support  from a variety of considerations have the strongest prejudices in our favor this informant is a native  inhabitant of rio janeiro the present metropolis which contains  0000 inhabitants knows well st salvador the former one and the mines dor which are in the center of the country these are all for a revolution  constituting the body of the nation the other parts will follow them the kings fifth     of the mines yields annually    millions of crusadoes or half dollars he has the sole right of searching for diamonds  other precious stones which yields him about half as much his income alone then from these two resources is about  0 millions of dollars annually but the remaining part of the produce of the mines being    millions might be counted on for effecting a revolution besides the arms in the hands of the people there are public magazines they have abundance of horses but only a part of their country would admit the service of horses they would want cannon ammunition ships sailors souldiers  officers for which they are disposed to look to the u s always understood that every service  furniture will be well paid corn costs about  0 livres the  00 lb they have flesh in the greatest abundance insomuch that in some parts they kill beeves for the skin only the whale fishery is carried on by brazilians altogether  not by portuguese but in very small vessels so that the fishermen know nothing of managing a large ship they would want of us at all times shipping corn  salt fish the latter is a great article  they are at present supplied with it from portugal portugal being without either army or navy could not attempt an invasion under a twelvemonth considering of what it would be composed it would not be much to be feared and if it failed they would probably never attempt a second indeed this source of their wealth being intercepted they are scarcely capable of a first effort the thinking part of the nation are so sensible of this that they consider an     early separation inevitable there is an implacable hatred between the brazilians  portuguese to reconcile which a former minister adopted the policy of letting the brazilians into a participation of public offices but subsequent administrations have reverted to the antient policy of keeping the administration in the hands of native portuguese there is a mixture of natives of the old appointments still remaining in office if spain should invade them on their southern extremities these are so distant from the body of their settlements that they could not penetrate thence and spanish enterprise is not formidable the mines dor are among mountains inaccessible to any army and rio janeiro is considered as the strongest port in the world after gibraltar in case of a successful revolution a republican government in a single body would probably be established i took care to impress on him thro the whole of our conversation that i had neither instructions nor authority to say a word to anybody on this subject and that i could only give him my own ideas as a single individual which were that we were not in a condition to meddle nationally in any war that we wished particularly to cultivate the friendship of portugal with whom we have an advantageous commerce that yet a successful revolution in brazil could not be uninteresting to us that prospects of lucre might possibly draw numbers of individuals to their aid and purer motives our officers among whom are many excellent that our citizens being free to leave their own country individually without     the consent of their governments are equally free to go to any other a little before i received the first letter of the brazilian a gentleman informed me there was a mexican in paris who wished to have some conversation with me he accordingly called on me the substance of the information i drew from him was as follows he is himself a native of mexico where his relations are principally he left it at about    years of age  seems now to be about    or    he classes  characterizes the inhabitants of that country as follows   the natives of old spain possessed of most of the offices of government  firmly attached to it   the clergy equally attached to the government   the natives of mexico generally disposed to revolt but without instruction without energy  much under the dominion of their priests   the slaves mulatto  black the former enterprising  intelligent the latter brave  of very important weight into whatever scale they throw themselves but he thinks they will side with their masters   the conquered indians cowardly not likely to take any side nor important which   the free indians brave and formidable should they interfere but not likely to do so as being at a great distance i asked him the numbers of these several classes but he could not give them the first he thought very inconsiderable that the  d formed the body of the freemen the  d equal to the two first the  th to all the preceding  as to the  th he could form no idea of their proportion indeed it appeared to me that his conjectures as to the others were on     loose grounds he said he knew from good information there were  00000 inhabitants in the city of mexico i was still more cautious with him than with the brazilian mentioning it as my private opinion unauthorized to say a word on the subject otherwise that a successful revolution was still at a distance with them that i feared they must begin by enlightening  emancipating the minds of their people that as to us if spain should give us advantageous terms of commerce  remove other difficulties it was not probable that we should relinquish certain  present advantages tho smaller to incertain  future ones however great i was led into this caution by observing that this gentleman was intimate at the spanish ambassadors  that he was then at paris employed by spain to settle her boundaries with france on the pyrenees he had much the air of candour but that can be borrowed so that i was not able to decide about him in my own mind led by a unity of subject  a desire to give congress as general a view of the dispositions of our southern countrymen as my information enables me i will add an article which old  insulated i did not think important enough to mention at the time i received it you will remember sir that during the late war the british papers often gave details of a rebellion in peru the character of those papers discredited the information but the truth was that the insurrections were so general that the event was long on the poise had commodore johnson then expected on that coast touched  landed there  000 men the dominion of spain in that country was at     an end they only wanted a point of union which this body would have constituted not having this they acted without concert  were at length subdued separately this conflagration was quenched in blood  00000 souls on both sides having perished but the remaining matter is very capable of combustion i have this information from a person who was on the spot at the time and whose good faith understanding and means of information leave no doubt of the facts he observed however that the numbers above supposed to have perished were on such conjectures only as he could collect i trouble congress with these details because however distant we may be both in condition  dispositions from taking an active part in any commotions in that country nature has placed it too near us to make its movements altogether indifferent to our interests or to our curiosity i hear of another arret of this court increasing the duties on foreign stockfish  the premiums on their own imported into their islands but not having yet seen it i can say nothing certain on it i am in hopes the effect of this policy will be defeated by the practice which i am told takes place on the banks of newfoundland of putting our fish into the french fishingboats  the parties sharing the premium instead of ours paying the duty i am in hopes mr short will be able to send you the medals of general gates by this packet i await a general instruction as to these medals the academies of europe will be much pleased to receive each a set   0 i propose to set out the day after to morrow for bordeaux by the canal of languedoc nantes lorient  paris i have the honour to be with sentiments of the most perfect esteem  respect sir your most obedient  most humble servant thomas jefferson may  th      marseilles martha jefferson to martha jefferson  marseilles may  th      my dear patsey —i got back to aix the day before yesterday and found there your letter of the  th of april—from which i presume you to be well though you do not say so in order to exercise your geography i will give you a detail of my journey you must therefore take your map and trace out the following places dijon lyons pont st esprit nismes arles st remis aix marseilles toulon hières fréjus antibes nice col de tende coni turin vercelli milan pavia tortona novi genoa by sea to albenga by land to monaco nice antibes fréjus brignolles aix and marseilles the day after morrow i set out hence for aix avignon pont du gard nismes montpellier narbonne along the canal of languedoc to toulouse bordeaux rochefort rochelle nantes lorient nantes tours orleans and paris—where i shall arrive about the middle of june after having travelled something upwards of a thousand leagues from genoa to aix was very fatiguing the first     two days having been at sea and mortally sick—two more clambering the cliffs of the apennines sometimes on foot sometimes on a mule according as the path was more or less difficult—and two others travelling through the night as well as day without sleep i am not yet rested and shall therefore shortly give you rest by closing my letter after mentioning that i have received a letter from your sister which though a year old gave me great pleasure i inclose for your perusal as i think it will be pleasure for you also but take care of it and return it to me when i shall get back to paris for trifling as it seems it is precious to me when i left paris i wrote to london to desire that your harpsicord might be sent during the months of april and may so that i am in hopes it will arrive a little before i shall and give me an opportunity of judging whether you have got the better of that want of industry which i began to fear would be the rock on which you would split determine never to be idle no person will have occasion to complain of the want of time who never loses any it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing and that you may always be doing good my dear is the ardent prayer of yours affectionately thomas jefferson may         martha jefferson to martha jefferson  may   st      i write you my dear patsey from the canal of languedoc on which i am at present sailing as i     have been for a week past cloudless skies above limpid waters below and on each hand a row of nightingales in full chorus this delightful bird had given me a rich treat before at the fountain of vaucluse after visiting the tomb of laura at avignon i went to see this fountain—a noble one of itself and rendered famous forever by the songs of petrarch who lived near it i arrived there somewhat fatigued and sat down by the fountain to repose myself it gushes of the size of a river from a secluded valley of the mountains the ruins of petrarchs chateau being perched on a rock two hundred feet perpendicular above to add to the enchantment of the scene every tree and bush was filled with nightingales in full song i think you told me that you had not yet noticed this bird as you have trees in the garden of the convent there might be nightingales in them and this is the season of their song endeavor my dear to make yourself acquainted with the music of this bird that when you return to your own country you may be able to estimate its merit in comparison with that of the mockingbird the latter has the advantage of singing through a great part of the year whereas the nightingale sings about five or six weeks in the spring and a still shorter term and with a more feeble voice in the fall i expect to be at paris about the middle of the next month by that time we may begin to expect our dear polly it will be a circumstance of inexpressible comfort to me to have you both with me once more the object most interesting to me for the residue of my life will be to see you both developing     daily those principles of virtue and goodness which will make you valuable to others and happy in yourselves and acquiring those talents and that degree of science which will guard you at all times against ennui the most dangerous poison of life a mind always employed is always happy this is the true secret the grand recipe for felicity the idle are only the wretched in a world which furnishes so many employments which are so useful so many which are amusing it is our own fault if we ever know what ennui is or if we are ever driven to the miserable resources of gaming which corrupts our dispositions and teaching us a habit of hostility against all mankind we are now entering the port of toulouse where i quit my bark and of course must conclude my letter be good and be industrious and you will be what i shall most love in the world adieu my dear child yours affectionately thomas jefferson june  0      paris james madison to james madison j mss paris june  0      dear sir —i wrote you last on the  0th of jan with a postscript of feb   having set out the last day of that month to try the waters of aix and been journeying since till the  0th inst i have been unable to continue my correspondence with you in the meantime i have received your several favors of feb    mar        apr the    the last arrived here about the   th of may while those of mar        tho written five weeks earlier arrived three weeks     later i mention this to shew you how incertain is the conveyance thro england the idea of separating the executive business of the confederacy from congress as the judiciary is already in some degree is just  necessary i had frequently pressed on the members individually while in congress the doing this by a resolution of congress for appointing an executive committee to act during the sessions of congress as the committee of the states was to act during their vacations but the referring to this committee all executive business as it should present itself would require a more persevering self denial than i suppose congress to possess it will be much better to make that separation by a federal act the negative proposed to be given them on all the acts of the several legislatures is now for the first time suggested to my mind primâ facie i do not like it it fails in an essential character that the hole  the patch should be commensurate but this proposes to mend a small hole by covering the whole garment not more than one out of  00 state acts concern the confederacy this proposition then in order to give them   degree of power which they ought to have gives them    more which they ought not to have upon a presumption that they will not exercise the    but upon every act there will be a preliminary question does this act concern the confederacy and was there ever a proposition so plain as to pass congress without a debate their decisions are almost always wise they are like pure metal but you know of how much dross this is the result would not an appeal from the state judicatures to a     federal court in all cases where the act of confederation controlled the question be as effectual a remedy  exactly commensurate to the defect a british creditor eg sues for his debt in virginia the defendant pleads an act of the state excluding him from their courts the plaintiff urges the confederation  the treaty made under that as controulling the state law the judges are weak enough to decide according to the views of their legislature an appeal to a federal court sets all to rights it will be said that this court may encroach on the jurisdiction of the state courts it may but there will be a power to wit congress to watch  restrain them but place the same authority in congress itself and there will be no power above them to perform the same office they will restrain within due bounds a jurisdiction exercised by others much more rigorously than if exercised by themselves i am uneasy at seeing that the sale of our western lands is not yet commenced that precious fund for the immediate extinction of our debt will i fear be suffered to slip thro our fingers every delay exposes it to events which no human foresight can guard against when we consider the temper of the people of that country derived from the circumstances which surround them we must suppose their separation impossible at every moment if they can be retained till their governments become settled  wise they will remain with us always and be a precious part of our strength  of our virtue but this affair of the mississippi by shewing that congress is capable of hesitating on a question which proposes a clear sacrifice of the western     to the maritime states will with difficulty be obliterated the proposition of my going to madrid to try to recover there the ground which has been lost at new york by the concession of the vote of seven states i should think desperate with respect to myself weighing the pleasure of the journey  bare possibility of success in one scale and the strong probability of failure and the public disappointment directed on me in the other the latter preponderates add to this that jealousy might be excited in the breast of a person who could find occasions of making me uneasy the late changes in the ministry here excite considerable hopes i think we gain in them all i am particularly happy at the reentry of malesherbes into the council his knolege his integrity render his value inappreciable and the greater to me because while he had no views of office we had established together the most unreserved intimacy so far too i am pleased with montmorin his honesty proceeds from the heart as well as the head and therefore may be more surely counted on the king loves business economy order  justice and wishes sincerely the good of his people but he is irascible rude very limited in his understanding and religious bordering only on bigotry he has no mistress loves his queen and is too much governed by her she is capricious like her brother and governed by him devoted to pleasure and expense and not remarkable for any other vices or virtues unhappily the king shews a propensity for the pleasures of the table that for drink has increased lately or at least it is become     more known for european news in general i will refer you to my letter to mr jay is it not possible that the occurrences in holland may excite a desire in many of fleeing that country  transferring their effects out of it may make an opening for shifting into their hands the debts due to this country to its officers and farmers it would be surely eligible i believe dumas if put on the watch might alone suffice but surely if mr adams should go when the moment offers dumas has been in the habit of sending his letters open to me to be forwarded to mr jay during my absence they passed through mr shorts hands who made extracts from them by which i see he has been recommending himself and me for the money negotiations in holland it might be thought perhaps that i have encouraged him in this be assured my dear sir that no such idea ever entered my head on the contrary it is a business which would be the most disagreeable to me of all others  for which i am the most unfit person living i do not understand bargaining nor possess the dexterity requisite to them on the other hand mr adams whom i expressly and sincerely recommend stands already on ground for that business which i could not gain in years pray set me to rights in the minds of those who may have supposed me privy to this proposition en passant i will observe with respect to mr dumas that the death of the count de vergennes places congress more at their ease how to dispose of him our credit has been ill treated here in public debate and our debt deemed apocryphal we should try to transfer this debt elsewhere      leave nothing capable of exciting ill thoughts between us i shall mention in my letter to mr jay a disagreeable affair in which mr barclay has been thrown into at bordeaux an honester man cannot be found nor a slower nor more indecisive one his affairs too are so embarrassed and desperate that the public reputation is every moment in danger of being compromitted with him he is perfectly amiable  honest with all his embarrassments by the next packet i shall be able to send you some books as also your watch  pedometer the two last are not yet done to search for books and forward them to havre will require more time than i had between my return  the departure of this packet you did perfectly right as to the paiment by the mr fitzhughs having been a witness heretofore to the divisions in congress on the subject of their foreign ministers it would be a weakness in me to suppose none with respect to myself or to count with any confidence on the renewal of my commission which expires on the  0th day of march next and the more so as instead of requiring the disapprobation of   states as formerly that of one suffices for a recall when congress consists of only   states   when of   c which i suppose to be habitually their numbers at present whenever i leave this place it will be necessary to begin my arrangements   months before my departure and these once fairly begun and under way and my mind set homewards a change of purpose could hardly take place if it should be the desire of congress that i should continue still longer i could wish to know it at     farthest by the packet which will sail from new york in september because were i to put off longer the quitting my house selling my furniture c i should not have time left to wind up my affairs and having once quitted and sold off my furniture i could not think of establishing myself here again i take the liberty of mentioning this matter to you not with a desire to change the purpose of congress but to know it in time i have never fixed in my own mind the epoch of my return so far as shall depend on myself but i never supposed it very distant probably i shall not risk a second vote on this subject such trifling things may draw on one the displeasure of one or two states  thus submit me to the disgrace of a recall i thank you for the paccan nuts which accompanied your letter of march could you procure me a copy of the bill for proportioning crimes  punishments in the form in which it was ultimately rejected by the house of delegates young mr bannister desired me to send him regularly the mercure de france i will ask leave to do this thro you  that you will adopt such method of forwarding them to him as will save him from being submitted to postage which they would not be worth as a compensation for your trouble you will be free to keep them till you shall have read them thomas jefferson july        paris john adams to john adams j mss paris july        dear sir —i returned about three weeks ago from a very useless voyage useless i mean as to the   0 object which first suggested it that of trying the effect of the mineral waters of aix en provence on my hand i tried these because recommended among six or eight others as equally beneficial  because they would place me at the beginning of a tour to the seaports of marseilles bordeaux nantes  lorient which i had long meditated in hopes that a knolege of the places  persons concerned in our commerce  the information to be got from them might enable me sometimes to be useful i had expected to satisfy myself at marseilles of the causes of the difference of quality between the rice of carolina  that of piedmont which is brought in quantities to marseilles not being able to do it i made an excursion of three weeks into the rice country beyond the alps going through it from vercelli to pavia about  0 miles i found the difference to be not in the management as had been supposed both here  in carolina but in the species of rice  i hope to enable them in carolina to begin the cultivation of the piedmont rice  carry it on hand in hand with their own that they may supply both qualities which is absolutely necessary at this market i had before endeavored to lead the depôt of rice from cowes to honfleur and hope to get it received there on such terms as may draw that branch of commerce from england to this country it is an object of   0000 guineas a year while passing thro the towns of turin milan  genoa i satisfied myself of the practicability of introducing our whale oil for their consumption  i suppose it would be equally so in the other great cities of that country i was sorry that i     was not authorized to set the matter on foot the merchants with whom i chose to ask conferences met me freely and communicated fully knowing i was in a public character i could however only prepare a disposition to meet our oil merchants on the article of tobacco i was more in possession of my ground and put matters into a train for inducing their government to draw their tobaccos directly from the u s  not as heretofore from gr b i am now occupied with the new ministry here to put the concluding hand to the new regulations for our commerce with this country announced in the letter of m de calonnes which i sent you last fall i am in hopes in addition to those to obtain a suppression of the duties on tar pitch  turpentine and an extension of the privileges of american whale oil to their fish oils in general i find that the quantity of codfish oil brought to lorient is considerable this being got off hand which will be in a few days the chicaneries  vexations of the farmers on the article of tobacco and their elusions of the order of bernis call for the next attention i have reason to hope good dispositions in the new ministry towards our commerce with this country besides endeavoring on all occasions to multiply the points of contact  connection with this country which i consider as our surest mainstay under every event i have had it much at heart to remove from between us every subject of misunderstanding or irritation our debts to the king to the officers  to the farmers are of this description the having complied with no part of our engagements in these draws on us a great deal of     censure  occasioned a language in the assemblée des notables very likely to produce dissatisfaction between us dumas being on the spot in holland i had asked of him sometime ago in confidence his opinion on the practicability of transferring these debts from france to holland  communicated his answer to congress pressing them to get you to go over to holland  try to effect their business your knolege of the ground  former successes occasioned me to take this liberty without consulting you because i was sure you would not weigh your personal trouble against public good i have had no answer from congress but hearing of your journey to holland have hoped that some money operation had led you there if it related to the debts of this country i would ask a communication of what you think yourself at liberty to communicate as it might change the form of my answers to the eternal applications i receive the debt to the officers of france carries an interest of about  000 guineas so we may suppose its principle is between  0   0000 this makes more noise against us than all our other debts put together    monsieur de calonnes july        monsieur jefferson observations on the letter of monsieur de calonnes to monsieur jefferson dated fontainebleau octob         july        a committee was appointed in the course of the last year to take a view of the subjects of commerce which might be brought from the united states of     america in exchange for those of france and to consider what advantages and facilities might be offered to encourage that commerce the letter of monsieur de calonnes was founded on their report it was conclusive as to the articles on which satisfactory information had been then obtained and reserved for future consideration certain others needing further enquiry it is proposed now to review those unfinished articles that they also may be comprehended in the arrêt and the regulations on this branch of commerce be rendered complete   the letter promises to diminish the droits du roi et d amirauté paiable by an american vessel entering into a port of france  to reduce what should remain into a single duty which shall be regulated by the draught of the vessel or her number of masts it is doubted whether it will be expedient to regulate the duty in either of these ways if by the draught of water it will fall unequally on us as a nation because we build our vessels sharpbottomed for swift sailing so that they draw more water than those of other nations of the same burthen if by the number of masts it will fall unequally on individuals because we often see ships of   0 tons  brigs of   0 this then would produce an inequality among individuals of   to   the present principle is the most just to regulate by the burthen it is certainly desirable that these duties should be reduced to a single one their names and numbers perplex  harass the merchant more than their amount subject him to imposition  to the suspicion of it where there is none an intention of     general reformation in this article has been accordingly announced  with augmentation as to foreigners we are in hopes that this augmentation is not to respect us because it is proposed as a measure of reciprocity whereas in some of our states no such duties exist  in the others they are extremely light because we have been made to hope a diminution instead of augmentation and because this distinction cannot draw on france any just claims from other nations the jura gentis amicissimæ conferred by her late treaties having reference expressly to the nations of europe only  those conferred by the more ancient ones not being susceptible of any other interpretation nor admitting a pretension of reference to a nation which did not then exist and which has come into existence under circumstances distinguishing its commerce from that of all other nations merchandise received from them take emploiment from the poor of france ours give it theirs is brought in the last stage of manufacture ours in the first we bring our tobaccoes to be manufactured into snuff our flax  hemps into linen and cordage our furs into hats skins into saddlery shoes  clothing we take nothing till it has received the last hand   fishoils the hanseatic treaty was the basis on which the diminution of duty on this article was asked  granted it is expressly referred to as such in the letter of monsieur de calonnes instead however of the expression huile et graisse de baleine  dautres poissons used in that treaty the letter     uses the terms huiles de baleine spermaceti et tout ce qui est compris sous ces denominations and the farmers have availed themselves of this variation to refuse the diminution of duty on the oils of the vache marine chien de mer esturgeon  other fish it is proposed therefore to reestablish in the arrêt the expressions of the hanseatic treaty  to add from the same treaty the articles baleine coupee et fanon de baleine the letter states these regulations as finally made by the king the merchants on this supposition entered into speculations but they found themselves called on for the old duties not only on other fish oils but on the whale oil monsieur de calonnes always promised that the arrêt should be retrospective to the date of the letter so as to refund to them the duties they had thus been obliged to pay to this attention is prayed in forming the arrêt his majesty having been pleased as an encouragement to the importation of our fish oils to abolish the droits de fabrication it is presumed that the purpose  announced of continuing those duties on foreign oils will not be extended to us   rice the duty on this is only  ½ deniers the quintal or about one quarter per cent on its first cost while this serves to inform the government of the quantities imported it cannot discourage that importation nothing further therefore is necessary on this article   potashe this article is of principal utility to france in her bleacheries of linen glass works      soapworks  the potash of america being made of green wood is known to be the best in the world all duty on it was therefore abolished by the king but the city of rouen levies on it a duty of  0 sols the quintal which is very sensible in its price brings it dearer to the bleacheries near paris to those of beauvais laval c  to the glass works and encourages them to give a preference to the potash or souda of other nations this is a counteraction of the views of the king expressed in the letter which it is hoped will be prevented   turpentine tar  pitch were not decided on on the former occasion turpentine terebenthine pays  0 sols the quintal and  0 sols the livre making    sols the quintal which is  0 per cent on its prime cost tar goudron braigras pays   livres the leth of    barrels   0 sols the livre amounting to  0 sols the barrel which is   ½ per cent on its prime cost pitch brai sec pays  0 sols the quintal   0 sols the livre making    sols the quintal which is  0 per cent on its prime cost duties of from  0 to  0 per cent on articles of heavy carriage prevent their importation they eat up all the profits of the merchants  often subject him to loss this has been much the case with respect to turpentine tar  pitch which are a principal article of remittance for the state of north carolina it is hoped that it will coincide with the views of government in making the present regulations to suppress the duties on these articles which of all others can bear them least     thomas jefferson july        paris m clavière to m clavière j mss paris july        sir —the load of business which has accumulated during my absence has put it out of my power to answer sooner the letter  observations with which you were pleased to honour me i have perused those observations with attention and think them judicious and well calculated to remedy the evil of public robbers  unsafe highroads but it is a happy truth for us sir that these evils do not exist  never did exist in our part of america that sieur de perponcher has suffered himself to be misled probably by the english papers i attended the bar of the supreme court of virginia ten years as a student  as a practitioner there never was during that time a trial for robbery on the high road nor do i remember ever to have heard of one in that or any other of the states except in the cities of new york  philadelphia immediately after the departure of the british army some deserters from that army infested those cities for a while but as i have heard nothing of them for some time past i suppose the vigilance of the civil magistrate has suppressed the evils mr warville was so good as to give me a copy of the book written by himself  m clavière on france  the united states but i have not yet had time to read it the talents  information of those gentlemen leave me without doubt that it is well written i have the honour of inclosing you your observations with thanks for their

am glad to find that among the various branches of science presenting themselves to your mind you have fixed on that of politics as your principal pursuit your country will derive from this a more immediate and sensible benefit she has much for you to do for tho we may say with confidence that the worst of the american constitutions is better than the best which ever existed before in any other country  that they are wonderfully perfect for a first essay yet every human essay must have defects it will remain therefore to those now coming on the stage of public affairs to perfect what has been so well begun by those going off it mathematics natural philosophy natural history anatomy chemistry botany will become amusements for your hours of relaxation and auxiliaries to your principal studies precious and delightful ones they will be as soon as such a foundation is laid in them as you may build on as you please hereafter i suppose you will proceed to your main objects politics law rhetoric  history as to these the place where you study them is absolutely indifferent i should except rhetoric a very essential member of them and which i suppose must be taught to advantage where you are you would do well therefore     to attend the public exercises in this branch also and to do it with every particular diligence this being done the question arises where you shall fix yourself for studying politics law  history i should not hesitate to decide in favor of france because you will at the same time be learning to speak the language of that country become absolutely essential under our present circumstances the best method of doing this would be to fix yourself in some family where there are women  children in passey auteuil or some other of the little towns in reach of paris the principal hours of the day you will attend to your studies  in those of relaxation associate with the family you will learn to speak better from women  children in three months than from men in a year such a situation too will render more easy a due attention to economy of time  money having pursued your main studies here about two years  acquired a facility in speaking french take a tour of   or   months through this country  italy return then to virginia  pass a year in williamsburg under the care of mr wythe and you will be ready to enter on the public stage with superior advantages i have proposed to you to carry on the study of the law with that of politics  history every political measure will forever have an intimate connection with the laws of the land and he who knows nothing of these will always be perplexed  often foiled by adversaries having the advantage of that knolege over him besides it is a source of infinite comfort to reflect that under every change of fortune we have a  00 resource in ourselves from which we may be able to derive an honourable subsistence i would therefore propose not only the study but the practice of the law for some time to possess yourself of the habit of public speaking with respect to modern languages french as i have before observed is indispensable next to this the spanish is most important to an american our connection with spain is already important  will become daily more so besides this the antient part of american history is written chiefly in spanish to a person who would make a point of reading  speaking french  spanish i should doubt the utility of learning italian these three languages being all degeneracies from the latin resemble one another so much that i doubt the possibility of keeping in the head a distinct knolege of them all i suppose that he who learns them all will speak a compound of the three  neither perfectly the journey which i propose to you need not be expensive and would be very useful with your talents  industry with science and that steadfast honesty which eternally pursues right regardless of consequences you may promise yourself everything—but health without which there is no happiness an attention to health then should take place of every other object the time necessary to secure this by active exercises should be devoted to it in preference to every other pursuit i know the difficulty with which a studious man tears himself from his studies at any given moment of the day but his happiness  that of his family depend on it the most uninformed  0  mind with a healthy body is happier than the wisest valetudinarian i need not tell you that if i can be useful to you in any part of this or any other plan you shall adopt you will make me happy by commanding my services will you be so good sir as to return my most respectful thanks for the diploma with which i am honored by the society instituted with you for the encouragement of the study of natural history i am afraid it will never be in my power to contribute anything to the object of the institution circumstances have thrown me into a very different line of life and not choice as i am happy to find in your case in the year      while confined to my room by a fall from my horse i wrote some notes in answer to the inquiries of m de marbois as to the natural  political state of virginia they were hasty  undigested yet as some of these touch slightly on some objects of its natural history i will take the liberty of asking the society to accept a copy of them for the same reason  because too they touch on the political condition of our country i will beg leave to present you with a copy and ask the favor of you to find a conveyance for them from london to edinburgh they are printed by stockdale bookseller piccadilly and will be ready in   or   weeks from this time i will direct him to deliver two copies to your order repeating constantly the proffer of my services i shall only add assurances of the esteem  attachment with which i am dear sir your friend  servt  0  thomas jefferson july         paris edward rutledge to edward rutledge  paris july         dear sir —i received your favor of the   th of october in the moment i was setting out on a tour of the seaport towns of this country from which i have been not long returned i received it too with that kind of heartfelt pleasure which always attends the recollection of antient affections i was glad to find that the adoption of your rice to this market was considered worth attention as i had supposed it i set out from hence impressed with the idea the ricedealers here had given me that the difference between your rice  that of piedmont proceeded from a difference in the machine for cleaning it at marseilles i hoped to know what the piedmont machine was but i could find nobody who knew anything of it i determined therefore to sift the matter to the bottom by crossing the alps into the rice country i found the machine exactly such a one as you had described to me in congress in the year      there was but one conclusion then to be drawn to wit that the rice was of a different species  i determined to take enough to put you in seed they informed me however that its exportation in the husk was prohibited so i could only bring off as much as my coat  surtout pockets would hold i took measures with a muletier to run a couple of sacks across the appenines to genoa but have not great dependance on its success the little therefore which i brought myself must be relied on for fear we should get no more and because also it is  0  genuine from vercelli where the best is made of all the sardinian lombardy the whole of which is considered as producing a better rice than the milanese this is assigned as the reason of the strict prohibition piedmont rice sold at nice the port of its exportation when i was there at    livres french the french hundredweight it varies from time to time as the price of wheat does with us the price of carolina rice at bordeaux nantes lorient  havre varies from   ♯ to   ♯ the french quintal which is equal to  0  lb our weight the best ports to send it to are bordeaux  havre or rouen which is the same thing as havre but it is essential that it arrive here a month before the commencement of lent when the principal demand is made for it carolina rice after being sorted here into several qualities sells from   sols to  0 sols the french pound retail according to the quality unsorted and wholesale about  0♯ the french quintal piedmont rice is but of one quality which sells retail at  0 sous the fr pound  wholesale is about   or  ♯ dearer than yours in order to induce your countrymen to ship their rice here directly i have proposed to some merchants here to receive consignments allowing the consignor to draw on the moment of shipping for as much as he could sell for on the spot  the balance when it should be sold but they say that is impossible they are to consider  inform me what are the most favorable terms on which they can receive it i am told that freight insurance  commission are about  ♯ the fr quintal to a seaport town i have written so long a letter on the  0  subject of rice to mr drayton for the society of agriculture that i will trouble you with no farther particulars but refer you to that indeed i am sensible i have written too much on the subject being absolutely ignorant of it myself it was impossible for me to know what particulars merited communication i thought it best therefore to communicate everything after writing that letter i received one from mr izard by which i found that he had examined the riceprocess in lombardy he was so much more capable than myself of giving the details that i had at one moment determined to suppress my letter however observing that he considered the rice of piedmont to be of the same species with yours and suspecting myself certainly that it is not i determinded to hazard my letter and all those criticisms which fall justly on an ignorant person writing on a subject to those much more learned in it than himself a part of my letter too related to the olive tree  caper the first of which would surely succeed in your country  would be an infinite blessing after some    or  0 years the caper would also probably succeed  would offer a very great and immediate profit i thank you for your obliging mention of my worthless notes on virginia worthless  bad as they are they have been rendered more so as i am told by a translation into french that i may have neither merit nor demerit not my own i have consented to their publication in england i advised the bookseller to send  00 copies to philadelphia   00 to richmond supposing that number might be sold in the united states but i do not  0  know whether he will do it if you give me leave i will send you a copy of the original impression—i congratulate you my dear friend on the law of your state for suspending the importation of slaves and for the glory you have justly acquired by endeavoring to prevent it forever this abomination must have an end and there is a superior bench reserved in heaven for those who hasten it the distractions of holland thicken apace they begin to cut one anothers throats heartily i apprehend the neighboring powers will interfere but it is not yet clear whether in concert or by taking opposite sides it is a poor contest whether they shall have one or many masters your nephew is arrived here in good health my first interview with him has impressed me much in his favor present me very respectfully to mrs rutledge as well as to your brother  his house accept yourself assurances of the sincere esteem  respect with which i am dear sir your most obedient  most humble servt thomas jefferson july         paris mrs john bolling to mrs john bolling  paris july   d      dear sister —i received with real pleasure your letter of may  d informing me of your health and of that of your family be assured it is and ever has been the most interesting thing to me letters of business claiming their rights before those of affection we often write seldomest to whom we love  0  most the distance to which i am removed has given a new value to all i valued before in my own country and the day of my return to it will be the happiest i expect to see in my life when it will come is not yet decided as far as depends on myself my dear polly is safely arrived here and in good health she had got so attached to captain ramsey that they were obliged to decoy her from him she staid three weeks in london with mrs adams and had got up such an attachment to her that she refused to come with the person i sent for her after some days she was prevailed on to come she did not know either her sister or myself but soon renewed her acquaintance and attachment she is now in the same convent with her sister and will come to see me once or twice a week it is a house of education altogether the best in france and at which the best masters attend there are in it as many protestants as catholics and not a word is ever spoken to them on the subject of religion patsey enjoys good health and longs much to return to her friends we shall doubtless find much change when we get back many of our older friends withdrawn from the stage and our younger ones grown out of our knolege i suppose you are now fixed for life at chestnut grove i take a part of the misfortune to myself as it will prevent my seeing you as often as would be practicable at lickinghole it is still a greater loss to my sister carr we must look to jack for indemnification as i think it was the plan that he should live at lickinghole i suppose he is now become the father of a family and  0  that we may all hail you as grandmother as we approach that term it becomes less fearful you mention mr bollings being unwell so as not to write to me he has just been sick enough all his life to prevent his writing to any body my prayer is therefore only that he may never be any worse were he to be so nobody would feel it more sensibly than myself as nobody has a more sincere esteem for him than myself i find as i grow older that i love those most whom i loved first present me to him in the most friendly terms to jack also and my other nephews and nieces of your fireside and be assured of the sincere love with which i am dear sister your affectionate brother thomas jefferson july         paris a donald to a donald j mss paris july         dear sir —i received with infinite satisfaction your letter of the  st of march it was the first information i had of your being in america there is no person whom i shall see again with more cordial joy whenever it shall be my lot to return to my native country nor any one whose prosperity in the meantime will be more interesting to me i find as i grow older that i set a higher value on the intimacies of my youth and am more afflicted by whatever loses one of them to me should it be in my power to render any service in your shipment of tobacco to havre de grace i shall do it with great pleasure the order of berni has i believe been  0  evaded by the farmers general as much as possible at this moment i receive information from most of the seaports that they refuse taking any tobacco under pretext that they have purchased their whole quantity from havre i have heard nothing and believe you will stand a better chance there than anywhere else being one of the ports of manufacture too it is entitled to a higher price i have now desired that the farmers may make a distinct return of their purchases which are conformable to the order of berni if they have really bought their quantity on those terms we must be satisfied if they have not i shall propose their being obliged to make it up instantly there is a considerable accumulation of tobacco in the ports among many good qualities which my countrymen possess some of a different character unhappily mix themselves the most remarkable are indolence extravagance  infidelity to their engagements cure the two first and the last would disappear because it is a consequence of them and not proceeding from a want of morals i know of no remedy against indolence  extravagance but a free course of justice everything else is merely palliative but unhappily the evil has gained too generally the mass of the nation to leave the course of justice unobstructed the maxim of buying nothing without the money in our pocket to pay for it would make of our country one of the happiest upon earth experience during the war proved this as i think every man will remember that under all the privations it obliged him to submit to during  0  that period he slept sounder  awaked happier than he can do now desperate of finding relief from a free course of justice i look forward to the abolition of all credit as the only other remedy which can take place i have seen therefore with pleasure the exaggerations of our want of faith with which the london papers teem it is indeed a strong medicine for sensible minds but it is a medicine it will prevent their crediting us abroad in which case we cannot be credited at home i have been much concerned at the losses produced by the fire at richmond i hope you have escaped them it will give me much pleasure to hear from you as often as you can spare a moment to write be assured that nobody entertains for you sentiments of more perfect and sincere esteem than dear sir your friend  servant thomas jefferson july         paris nicholas lewis to nicholas lewis j mss paris july         dear sir —in my letter of dec         i informed you that as you had supposed in yours of march    that the balance of bonds  profits of the estate to that time would pay all the debts then known to you except my sister nancys i was desirous of laying our shoulder seriously to the paiment of farrell  jones  mccauls debts  that i should make propositions to them on that subject i did so these propositions were to pay to jones  00 £ sterl a year  to mccaul  00£ sterl or to the former if he preferred it two thirds of the profits of my estate    0 to the latter one third   that the crop of      should commence these paiments   that no interest should be allowed on their debts from apr         to apr         being   years   that their accounts should remain perfectly open to settlement  rectification notwithstanding the paiments which should be made mccaul has acceded very contentedly to these proposals i added some other conditions to jones not worth mentioning as he does not accede as yet i think however he will accede i consider myself as so much bound in honor to the sacred execution of this agreement that when the profits fall short of enabling us to pay at any time i would chuse to have made up by a sale of something or another i mentioned to you in my letter also that i could always get  0 virginia money for my tobacco delivered at havre  proposed your having it sent there further reflection and information of the virginia prices convince me it would be best to send them either to havre or to bordeaux at either of which places i could have them attended to i find that my old friend a donald is settled at richmond is concerned in the tobacco trade  particularly sends to havre i am confident he would take on himself the having my tobaccoes shipped to me the earlier they would come in the season the better alwais so far i had settled in my own mind the plan for extinguishing as fast as we could these two great debts when i received from mr eppes a letter of may        wherein he tells me he had been with you in sep      that you had computed together all the former debts except my sister nancys due from the estate      all due to it and that there was still a balance of   00£ against it to pay which there would be nothing but the crop of      two thirds of which would be consumed by negroes clothing  taxes this account threatens a total derangement of my plan for payment of my great debts i had observed that by a statement in your letter of march    of the probable proceeds of the crop of      about  0 hogsheads of tobacco that the profits of the few house servants  tradesmen hired out were as much as those of the whole estate  therefore suggested to you the hiring out the whole estate the torment of mind i endure till the moment shall arrive when i shall not owe a shilling on earth is such really as to render life of little value i cannot decide to sell my lands i have sold too much of them already and they are the only sure provision for my children nor would i willingly sell the slaves as long as there remains any prospect of paying my debts with their labor in this i am governed solely by views to their happiness which will render it worth their while to use extraordinary exertions for some time to enable me to put them ultimately on an easier footing which i will do the moment they have paid the debts due from the estate two thirds of which have been contracted by purchasing them i am therefore strengthened in the idea of renting out my whole estate not to any one person but in different parts to different persons as experience proves that it is only small concerns that are gainful  it would be my interest that the tenants should make a reasonable gain the lease i made to garth  moseley would be a good model i do not     recollect whether in that there was reserved a right of distraining on the lands for the whole rent if not such a clause would be essential especially in the present relaxed state of the laws i know there was in that no provision against paper money this is still more essential the best way of stating the rent would be in ounces of silver the rent in that lease tho expressed in current money was meant to be   £ sterling a titheable when we consider the rise in the price of tobacco it should balance any difference for the worse which may have taken place in the lands in albemarle so as to entitle us there to equal terms in cumberland goochland bedford where the lands are better perhaps better terms might be expected calculating this on the number of working slaves it holds up to us a clear revenue capable of working off the debts in a reasonable time think of it my dear sir  if you do not find it disadvantageous be so good as to try to execute it by leases of     or   years not more because no dependence can be reposed in our laws continuing the same for any length of time indeed   years might be the most elegible term the mill should be separate from the lease finished  rented by itself all the lands reserved to my own use in garth  mosleys lease should still be reserved and the privileges of that lease in general house negroes still to be hired separately the old and infirm who could not be hired or whom it would be a pity to hire could perhaps be employed in raising cotton or some other easy culture on lands to be reserved george still to be reserved to take care of my orchards grasses c     the lands in albemarle should be relieved by drawing off a good number of the labourers to bedford where a better hire might be expected  more lands be opened there i feel all the weight of the objection that we cannot guard the negroes perfectly against the usuage but in a question between hiring  selling them one of which is necessary the hiring will be temporary only and will end in their happiness whereas if we sell them they will be subject to equal ill usuage without a prospect of change it is for their good therefore ultimately and it appears to promise a relief to me within such a term as i would be willing to wait for i do not mention the rate of hire with a view to tie you up to that but merely to show that hiring presents a hopeful prospect i should rely entirely on your judgment for that for the choice of kind  helpful tenants  for every other circumstance the bacon hams you were so kind as to send to mr buchanan for me i never heard of the difficulty of getting them here renders it not worth attempting again i will put into this letter some more seeds of the spanish sainfoin lest those formerly sent should have miscarried the present situation of europe threatens a war which if it breaks out will probably be a very general one france  england are so little in a condition for war that we may still expect they will do much to avoid it should it take place i fear the scale against this country would be too heavy i must pray of you to make all the arrangements possible for enabling me to comply with the first years     paiment of my debts that is to say the paiment for this present year which is to be made in the city of london the next spring apologies for all the trouble i give you would only show you how sensible i am of your goodness i have proposed the extraordinary trouble of the leases with less reluctance because it will be taken once for all  will be a relief in the end be so good as to assure mrs lewis of my attachment and my wishes for her health  happiness as well as that of your whole family thomas jefferson aug        paris james madison to james madison j mss paris aug        dear sir —my last was of june  0 yours received since that date are may    and june   in mine i

a copy for you amelots travels into china i can learn nothing of i put among the books sent you two somewhat voluminous  the object of which will need explanation these are the tableau de paris  lespion anglois the former is truly a picture of private manners in paris but presented on the dark side  a little darkened moreover but there is so much truth in its ground work that it will be well worth your reading you will then know paris  probably the other large cities of europe as well as if you had been here years lespion anglois is no caricature it will give you a just idea of the wheels by which the machine of government is worked here there are in it also many interesting details of the last war which in general may be relied on it may be considered as the small history of great events i am in hopes when you shall have read them you will not think i have misspent your money for them my method for making out this assortment was to revise the list of my own purchases since the invoice of      and to select such as i had found worth your having besides this i have casually met with  purchased some few curious  cheap things i have made out the dr side of the account taking

will more fully explain it a particular friend of mine here applies to me for information which i must ask the favor of you to procure and forward to me writing news to others much pressed in time  making this letter one of private business i did not intend to have said anything to you on political subjects but i must press one subject mr adams informs me he has borrowed money in holland which if confirmed by congress will enable them to pay not only the interest due here to the foreign officers but the principal let me beseech you to reflect on the expediency of transferring this debt to holland all our other debts in europe do not injure our reputation so much as this these gentlemen have connections both in  out of office  these again their     connections so that our default on this article is further known more blamed  excites worse dispositions against us than you can conceive if you think as i do pray try to procure an order for paying off their capital mr adams adds that if any certain tax is provided for the paiment of interest congress may borrow enough in holland to pay off their whole debts in france both public  private to the crown to the farmers  to beaumarchais surely it will be better to transfer these debts to holland so critical is the state of that country that i imagine the monied men of it would be glad to place their money in foreign countries  that mr adams could borrow there for us without a certain tax for the interest  saving our faith too by previous explanations on that subject this country is really supposed on the eve of a bankruptcy such a spirit has risen within a few weeks as could not have been believed they see the great deficit in their revenues  the hopes of economy lessen daily the parliament refuse to register any act for a new tax  require an assembly of the states the object of this assembly is evidently to give law to the king to fix a constitution to limit expenses these views are said to gain upon the nation the kings passion for drink is diverting him of all respect the queen is detested and an explosion of some sort is not impossible the ministry is alarmed  the surest reliance at this moment for the public peace is on their two hundred thousand men i cannot write these things in a public dispatch because they would get into a newspaper and be back here     a final decision of some sort should be made on beaumarchais affairs i am with sentiments of the most perfect esteem dear sir your friend and servt p s the watch and pedometer are not done in the box of books are some for the colleges of philadelphia  williamsburg  two vols of the encyclopedie for congress presented by the author of that part thomas jefferson aug        paris edward carrington to edward carrington j mss paris aug        dear sir —since mine of the   th of january i have been honoured by your favors of ap     june   i am happy to find that the states have come so generally into the scheme of the federal convention from which i am sure we shall see wise propositions i confess i do not go as far in the reforms thought necessary as some of my correspondents in america but if the convention should adopt such propositions i shall suppose them necessary my general plan would be to make the states one as to every thing connected with foreign nations  several as to everything purely domestic but with all the imperfections of our present government it is without comparison the best existing or that ever did exist its greatest defect is the imperfect manner in which matters of commerce have been provided for it has been so often said as to be generally believed that congress have no power by the confederation to enforce anything for e g contributions of money     it was not necessary to give them that power expressly they have it by the law of nature when two parties make a compact there results to each a power of compelling the other to execute it compulsion was never so easy as in our case where a single frigate would soon levy on the commerce of any state the deficiency of its contributions nor more safe than in the hands of congress which has always shown that it would wait as it ought to do to the last extremities before it would execute any of its powers which are disagreeable i think it very material to separate in the hands of congress the executive  legislative powers as the judiciary already are in some degree this i hope will be done the want of it has been the source of more evil than we have experienced from any other cause nothing is so embarrassing nor so mischievous in a great assembly as the details of execution the smallest trifle of that kind occupies as long as the most important act of legislation  takes place of everything else let any man recollect or look over the files of congress he will observe the most important propositions hanging over from week to week  month to month till the occasions have past them  the thing never done i have ever viewed the executive details as the greatest cause of evil to us because they in fact place us as if we had no federal head by diverting the attention of that head from great to small objects and should this division of power not be recommended by the convention it is my opinion congress should make it itself by establishing an executive committee   0 thomas jefferson aug        paris benjamin hawkins to benjamin hawkins j mss paris aug        dear sir —i have to acknowlege the receipt of your favors of mar    june   and to give you many thanks for the trouble you have taken with the dionasa muscipula i have not yet heard anything of them which makes me fear they have perished by the way i believe the most effectual means of conveying them hither will be by the seed i must add my thanks too for the vocabularies this is an object i mean to pursue as i am persuaded that the only method of investigating the filiation of the indian nations is by that of their languages i look up with you to the federal convention for an amendment of our federal affairs yet i do not view them in so disadvantageous a light at present as some do and above all things i am astonished at some peoples considering a kingly government as a refuge advise such to read the fable of the frogs who solicited jupiter for a king if that does not put them to rights send them to europe to see something of the trappings of monarchy and i will undertake that every man shall go back thoroughly cured if all the evils which can arise among us from the republican form of our government from this day to the day of judgment could be put into a scale against what this country suffers from its monarchical form in a week or england in a month the latter would preponderate consider the contents of the red book in england or the almanac royale of france and say what a people gain by monarchy no race of kings has ever presented above one man of common     sense in twenty generations the best they can do is to leave things to their ministers  what are their ministers but a committee badly chosen if the king ever meddles it is to do harm it is still undecided whether we shall have war or not if war i fear it will not be a successful one for our friends against england  prussia such a war by sea  such a one by land are too much for this country at this time add to this that the condition of her finances threatens bankruptcy  that the hope of mending them lessens daily good will result from other late operations of the government but as to money matters they have lost more confidence than they have gained were it possible for us to borrow money in holland to pay them the principal of our debt at this time it would be felt by them with gratitude as if we had given them so much i think it probable they would do something clever for us in our commerce  would be very sure to help us again whenever our affairs would require it mr adams thinks the money could be borrowed in holland if there was a tax laid to pay the interest but i think it possible that the present storm in holland may make the monied men wish to transfer their money any where else i wish mr adams put on this business before he leaves europe adieu my dear sir  be assured of the esteem of your friend  servt     thomas jefferson aug  0      paris peter carr to peter carr  j mss paris aug  0      dear peter

letter  consulting mr wythe on the subject to this sketch i will add a few particular observations   italian i fear the learning this language will confound your french and spanish being all of them degenerated dialects of the latin they are apt to mix in conversation i have never seen a person speaking the three languages who did not mix them it is a delightful language but late events having rendered the spanish more useful lay it aside to prosecute that   spanish bestow great attention on this  endeavor to acquire an accurate knowlege of it our future connections with spain  spanish america     will render that language a valuable acquisition the antient history of a great part of america too is written in that language i send you a dictionary   moral philosophy i think it lost time to attend lectures in this branch he who made us would have been a pitiful bungler if he had made the rules of our moral conduct a matter of science for one man of science there are thousands who are not what would have become of them man was destined for society his morality therefore was to be formed to this object he was endowed with a sense of right  wrong merely relative to this this sense is as much a part of his nature as the sense of hearing seeing feeling it is the true foundation of morality  not the το καλον truth c as fanciful writers have imagined the moral sense or conscience is as much a part of man as his leg or arm it is given to all human beings in a stronger or weaker degree as force of members is given them in a greater or less degree it may be strengthened by exercise as may any particular limb of the body this sense is submitted indeed in some degree to the guidance of reason but it is a small stock which is required for this even a less one than what we call common sense state a moral case to a ploughman  a professor the former will decide it as well  often better than the latter because he has not been led astray by artificial rules in this branch therefore read good books because they will encourage as well as direct your feelings the writings of sterne particularly form the best course of morality that ever was written besides these read the books     mentioned in the enclosed paper and above all things lose no occasion of exercising your dispositions to be grateful to be generous to be charitable to be humane to be true just firm orderly courageous c consider every act of this kind as an exercise which will strengthen your moral faculties  increase your worth   religion your reason is now mature enough to examine this object in the first place divest yourself of all bias in favour of novelty  singularity of opinion indulge them in any other subject rather than that of religion it is too important  the consequences of error may be too serious on the other hand shake off all the fears  servile prejudices under which weak minds are servilely crouched fix reason firmly in her seat and call to her tribunal every fact every opinion question with boldness even the existence of a god because if there be one he must more approve of the homage of reason than that of blindfolded fear you will naturally examine first the religion of your own country read the bible then as you would read livy or tacitus the facts which are within the ordinary course of nature you will believe on the authority of the writer as you do those of the same kind in livy  tacitus the testimony of the writer weighs in their favor in one scale and their not being against the laws of nature does not weigh against them but those facts in the bible which contradict the laws of nature must be examined with more care and under a variety of faces here you must recur to the pretensions of the writer to inspiration from god examine upon what     evidence his pretensions are founded and whether that evidence is so strong as that its falsehood would be more improbable than a change in the laws of nature in the case he relates for example in the book of joshua we are told the sun stood still several hours were we to read that fact in livy or tacitus we should class it with their showers of blood speaking of statues beasts c but it is said that the writer of that book was inspired examine therefore candidly what evidence there is of his having been inspired the pretension is entitled to your inquiry because millions believe it on the other hand you are astronomer enough to know how contrary it is to the law of nature that a body revolving on its axis as the earth does should have stopped should not by that sudden stoppage have prostrated animals trees buildings and should after a certain time have resumed its revolution  that without a second general prostration is this arrest of the earths motion or the evidence which affirms it most within the law of probabilities you will next read the new testament it is the history of a personage called jesus keep in your eye the opposite pretensions   of those who say he was begotten by god born of a virgin suspended  reversed the laws of nature at will  ascended bodily into heaven and   of those who say he was a man of illegitimate birth of a benevolent heart enthusiastic mind who set out without pretensions to divinity ended in believing them  was punished capitally for sedition by being gibbeted according to the roman law which punished the first commission of that offence by whipping  the second     by exile or death in furcâ see this law in the digest lib    tit    §       lipsius lib   de cruce cap   these questions are examined in the books i have mentioned under the head of religion  several others they will assist you in your inquiries but keep your reason firmly on the watch in reading them all do not be frightened from this inquiry by any fear of its consequences if it ends in a belief that there is no god you will find incitements to virtue in the comfort  pleasantness you feel in its exercise and the love of others which it will procure you if you find reason to believe there is a god a consciousness that you are acting under his eye  that he approves you will be a vast additional incitement if that there be a future state the hope of a happy existence in that increases the appetite to deserve it if that jesus was also a god you will be comforted by a belief of his aid and love in fine i repeat that you must lay aside all prejudice on both sides  neither believe nor reject anything because any other persons or description of persons have rejected or believed it your own reason is the only oracle given you by heaven and you are answerable not for the rightness but uprightness of the decision i forgot to observe when speaking of the new testament that you should read all the histories of christ as well of those whom a council of ecclesiastics have decided for us to be pseudoevangelists as those they named evangelists because these pseudoevangelists pretended to inspiration as much as the others and you are to judge their pretensions by your own reason  not by the reason of those     ecclesiastics most of these are lost there are some however still extant collected by fabricius which i will endeavor to get  send you   travelling this makes men wiser but less happy when men of sober age travel they gather knolege which they may apply usefully for their country but they are subject ever after to recollections mixed with regret their affections are weakened by being extended over more objects  they learn new habits which cannot be gratified when they return home young men who travel are exposed to all these inconveniences in a higher degree to others still more serious and do not acquire that wisdom for which a previous foundation is requisite by repeated  just observations at home the glare of pomp  pleasure is analogous to the motion of their blood it absorbs all their affection  attention they are torn from it as from the only good in this world and return to their home as to a place of exile  condemnation their eyes are for ever turned back to the object they have lost  its recollection poisons the residue of their lives their first  most delicate passions are hackneyed on unworthy objects here  they carry home only the dregs insufficient to make themselves or anybody else happy add to this that a habit of idleness an inability to apply themselves to business is acquired  renders them useless to themselves  their country these observations are founded in experience there is no place where your pursuit of knolege will be so little obstructed by foreign objects as in your own country nor any wherein the virtues of the heart will be less exposed     to be weakened be good be learned  be industrious  you will not want the aid of travelling to render you precious to your country dear to your friends happy within yourself i repeat my advice to take a great deal of exercise  on foot health is the first requisite after morality write to me often  be assured of the interest i take in your success as well as of the warmth of those sentiments of attachment with which i am dear peter your affectionate friend p s let me know your age in your next letter your cousins here are well  desire to be remembered to you thomas jefferson aug         paris dr george gilmer to dr george gilmer j mss paris august         dear doctor —your letter of jan        came safely to hand in the month of june last unluckily you forgot to sign it and your handwriting is so protean that one cannot be sure it is yours to increase the causes of incertitude it was dated penpark a name which i only know as the seat of john harmer the handwriting too being somewhat in his style made me ascribe it hastily to him indorse it with his name and let it lie in my bundle to be answered at leisure that moment of leisure arriving i set down to answer it to john harmer  now for the first time discover marks of its being yours  particularly those expressions of friendship to myself and family which you have ever been so good as to entertain and which are to me among the most     precious possessions i wish my sense of this  my desires of seeing you rich  happy may not prevent my seeing any difficulty in the case you state of george harmers wills which as you state them are thus   a will dated dec         written in his own hand  devising to his brother the estates he had received from him   another will dated june         written also in his own hand devising his estate to trustees to be conveyed to such of his relations i h i l or h l as should become capable of acquiring property or on failure of that to be sold  the money remitted them   a third will dated sep         devising all his estate at marrowbone  his tracts at horsepasture  poisonfield to you which will is admitted to record  of course has been duly executed you say the learned are divided on these wills yet i see no cause of division as it requires little learning to decide that the first deed  last will must always prevail i am afraid therefore the difficulty may arise on the want of words of inheritance in the devise to you for you state it as a devise to george gilmer without adding  to his heirs of all the estate called marrowbone the tract called horsepasture and the tract called poisonfield if the question is on this point and you have copied the words of the will exactly i suppose you take an estate in fee simple in marrowbone  for life only in horsepasture  poisonfield the want of words of inheritance in the two last cases being supplied as to   0 the first by the word estate which has been repeatedly decided to be descriptive of the quantum of interest devised as well as of its locality i am in hopes however you have not copied the words exactly that there are words of inheritance to all the devises as the testator certainly knew their necessity  that the conflict only will be between the different wills in which case i see nothing which can be opposed to the last i shall be very happy to eat at penpark some of the good mutton  beef of marrowbone horsepasture  poisonfield with yourself  mrs gilmer  my good old neighbors i am as happy nowhere else  in no other society  all my wishes end where i hope my days will end at monticello too many scenes of happiness mingle themselves with all the recollections of my native woods  fields to suffer them to be supplanted in my affection by any other i consider myself here as a traveller only  not a resident my commission expires next spring  if not renewed i shall of course return then if renewed i shall remain here some time longer how much i cannot say yet my wishes shorten the period among the strongest inducements will be that of your society  mrs gilmers which i am glad to find brought more within reach by your return to penpark my daughters are importunate to return also patsy enjoys good health  is growing to my stature polly arrived here about a month ago after a favorable voyage  in perfect health my own health has been as good as ever after the first years probation the accident of a dislocated wrist badly set has i fear     deprived me for ever of almost every use of my right hand nor is the extent of the evil as yet known the hand withering the fingers remaining swelled  crooked  losing rather than gaining in point of suppleness it is now eleven months since the accident i am able to write tho for a long time i was not so this inability was succeeded by a journey into the southern parts of france and northern of of italy which added to the length of the chasm in my correspondence with my friends if you knew how agreeable to me are the details of the small news of my neighborhood your charity would induce you to write frequently your letters lodged in the post office at richmond to be forwarded to n york come with certainty we are doubtful yet whether there will be war or not present me with warm affection to mrs gilmer  be assured yourself of the unvarying sentiments of esteem  attachment with which i am dear doctor your sincere friend  servant thomas jefferson aug         paris joseph jones to joseph jones j mss paris aug         dear sir —i have never yet thanked you but with the heart for the act of assembly confirming the agreement with maryland the pamphlet  papers i received from you a twelve month ago very soon after their receipt i got my right wrist dislocated which prevented me long from writing  as soon as that was able to bear it i took a long journey from which i am but lately returned i am anxious to     hear what our federal convention recommends  what the states will do in consequence of their recommendation i wish to see our states made one as to all foreign  several as to all domestic matters a peaceable mode of compulsion over the states given to congress  the powers of this body divided as in the states into three departments legislative executive  judiciary it is my opinion the want of the latter organization has already done more harm than all the other federal defects put together  that every evil almost may be traced to that source but with all the defects of our constitutions whether general or particular the comparison of our governments with those of europe are like a comparison of heaven  hell england like the earth may be allowed to take the intermediate station and yet i hear there are people among you who think the experience of our governments has already proved that republican governments will not answer send those gentry here to count the blessings of monarchy a kings sister for instance stopped on the road  on a hostile journey is sufficient cause for him to march immediately  0000 men to revenge this insult when he had shewn himself little moved by the matter of right then in question i apprehend this hasty movement of the king of prussia may perhaps decide the crisis of europe to war when it was before doubtful the english squadron has sailed westwardly the french will doubtless do the same  they are moving an army into the neighborhood of holland still however the negociations are not broken off and the desperate     state of finances both in england  france give a hope they will yet arrange matters in this country a great  sudden discontent has arisen since the separation of the assemblee des notables it is not easy to fix the causes since it is certain that great improvements of their laws  constitution have actually taken place  others are promised great reforms in expence have been effected  are effecting but the investigation of the horrid depredation in the late administration of their finances some new and inconsiderable expences of the court and the new taxes have probably excited this discontent the opposition of the parliament to the new taxes is carried to its last point and their exile is a measure which may very possibly take place the principal security against it is the mild  patriotic character of the new ministry from all these broils we are happily free and that god may keep us long so and yourself in health  happiness is the prayer of dear sir your most obedient  most humble servant p s aug    the parliament is exiled to troyes this morning thomas jefferson aug         paris to the editor of the journal de paris j mss paris aug         sir —i am a citizen of the united states of america and have passed in those states almost the whole of my life when young i was passionately fond of reading books of history  travels since the commencement of the late revolution which separated us from great britain our country too has been     thought worthy to employ the pens of historians  travellers i cannot paint to you sir the agonies which these have cost me in obliging me to renounce these favorite branches of reading and in discovering to me at length that my whole life has been employed in nourishing my mind with fables  falsehoods for thus i reason if the histories of dauberteuil  of longchamps and the travels of the abbé robin can be published in the face of the world can be read  believed by those who are cotemporary with the events they pretend to relate how may we expect that future ages shall be better informed will those rise from their graves to bear witness to the truth who would not while living lift their voices against falsehood if cotemporary histories are thus false what will future compilations be and what are all those of preceding times in your journal of this day you announce  criticise a book under the title of les ligues acheenne suisse  hollandoise et revolution des etats unis de lamerique par m de mayer i was no part of the achaean swiss or dutch confederacies  have therefore nothing to say against the facts related of them and you cite only one fact from his account of the american revolution it is in these words monsieur mayer assure quune seule voix un seul homme prononça lindependance des etats unis ce fut dit il john dickinson un des deputés de la pensilvanie au congrés la veille il avoit vôté pour la soumission legalité des suffrages avoit suspendu la resolution sil eut persisté le congrés ne deliberoit point il fut foible il ceda aux instances de     ceux qui avoient plus denergie plus deloquence et plus de lumieres il donna sa voix lamerique lui doit une reconnaissance eternelle cest dickinson qui la affranchie the modesty and candour of mr dickinson himself sir would disavow every word of this paragraph except these—il avoit voté pour la soumission these are true every other tittle false i was on the spot  can relate to you this transaction with precision on the  th of june      the delegates from virginia moved in obedience to instructions from their constituents that congress should declare the    united colonies to be independant of great britain that a confederation should be formed to bind them together and measures be taken for procuring the assistance of foreign powers the house ordered a punctual attendance of all their members the next day at ten oclock  then resolved themselves into a committee of the whole and entered on the discussion it appeared in the course of the debates that   states viz n hampshire massachusetts rhode island connecticut virginia north carolina  georgia were decided for a separation but that   others still hesitated to wit new york new jersey pennsylvania delaware maryland  south carolina congress desirous of unanimity  seeing that the public mind was advancing rapidly to it referred the further discussion to the  st of july appointing in the mean time a committee to prepare a declaration of independance a second to form articles for the confederation of the states and a third to propose measures for obtaining foreign aid on the   th of june the     declaration of independance was reported to the house and was laid on the table for the consideration of the members on the  st day of july they resolved themselves into a committee of the whole and resumed the consideration of the motion of june   it was debated through the day and at length was decided in the affirmative by the vote of   states viz new hampshire massachusetts connecticut rhode island new jersey maryland virginia n carolina and georgia pennsylvania and s carolina voted against it delaware having but two members present was divided the delegates from new york declared they were for it  their constituents also but that the instructions against it which had been given them a twelvemonth before were still unrepealed that their convention was to meet in a few days and they asked leave to suspend their vote till they could obtain a repeal of their instructions observe that all this was in a committee of the whole congress and that according to the mode of their proceedings the resolution of that committee to declare themselves independant was to be put to the same persons reassuming their form as a congress it was now evening the members exhausted by a debate of   hours during which all the powers of the soul had been distended with the magnitude of the object and the delegates of s carolina desired that the final decision might be put off to the next morning that they might still weigh in their own minds their ultimate vote it was put off and in the morning of the  d of july they joined the other nine states in voting for it the members of the pennsylvania     delegation too who had been absent the day before came in  turned the vote of their state in favor of independance and a  d member of the state of delaware who hearing of the division in the sentiments of his two colleagues had travelled post to arrive in time now came in and decided the vote of that state also for the resolution thus twelve states voted for it at the time of its passage and the delegates of new york the   th state received instructions within a few days to add theirs to the general vote so that instead of the egalité des suffrages spoken of by m mayer there was not a dissenting voice congress proceeded immediately to consider the declaration of independence which had been reported by their committee on the   th of june the several paragraphs of that were debated for three days viz the  d  d   th of july in the evening of the  th they were finally closed and the instrument approved by an unanimous vote and signed by every member except mr dickinson look into the journal of congress of that day sir and you will see the instrument and the name of the signers and that mr dickinsons name is not among them then read again those words of your paper il m mayer assure quune seule voix un seul homme prononça lindependance des etats unis ce fut john dickinson—lamerique lui doit une reconnoissance eternelle cest dickinson qui la affranchie with my regrets  my adieus to history to travels to mayer  to you sir permit me to mingle assurances of the great respect with which i have the honor to be sir your most obedient  most humble servant     thomas jefferson sep         paris george wythe to george wythe j mss paris sep         dear sir —i am now to acknowlege the receipt of your favors of dec              of jan      these should not have been so long unanswered but that they arrived during my absence on a journey of between      months through the southern parts of france  northern of italy in the latter country my time allowed me to go no further than turin milan and genoa consequently i scarcely got into classical ground i took with me some of the writings in which endeavors have been made to investigate the passage of annibal over the alps and was just able to satisfy myself from a view of the country that the descriptions given of his march are not sufficiently particular to enable us at this day even to guess at his track across the alps in architecture painting sculpture i found much amusement but more than all in their agriculture many objects of which might be adopted with us to great advantage i am persuaded there are many parts of our lower country where the olive tree might be raised which is assuredly the richest gift of heaven i can scarcely except bread i see this tree supporting thousands in among the alps where there is not soil enough to make bread for a single family the caper too might be cultivated with us the fig we do raise i do not speak of the vine because it is the parent of misery those who cultivate it are always poor and he who would employ himself with us in the culture of corn cotton c can procure in exchange much more wine  better than he could     raise by its direct culture i sent you formerly copies of the documents on the tagliaferro family which i had received from mr febroni i now send the originals i have procured for you a copy of polybius the best edition but the best edition of vitruvius which is with the commentaries of ticinus is not to be got here i have sent to holland for it in the mean time the polybius comes in a box containing books for peter carr  for some of my friends in williamsburg  its vicinities i have taken the liberty of addressing this box to you it goes to new york in the packet boat which carries this letter  will be forwarded to you by water by mr madison its freight to new york is paid here the transportation from thence to williamsburgh will be demanded of you and shall stand as the equivalent to the cost of polybius  vitruvius if you please the difference either way will not be worth the trouble of erecting  transmitting accounts i send you herewith a state of the contents of the box and for whom each article is among these are some as you will perceive of which i ask your acceptance it is a great comfort to me that while here i am able to furnish some amusement to my friends by sending them such productions of genius antient  modern as might otherwise escape them and i hope they will permit me to avail myself of the occasion while it lasts this world is going all to war i hope ours will remain clear of it it is already declared between the turks  russians and considering the present situation of holland it cannot fail to spread itself all over europe perhaps it may   0 not be till the next spring that the other powers will be engaged in it nor is it as yet clear how they will arrange themselves i think it not impossible that france  the two empires may join against all the rest the patriotic party in holland will be saved by this and the turks sacrificed the only thing which can prevent the union of france  the two empires is the difficulty of agreeing about the partition of the spoils constantinople is the key of asia who shall have it is the question i cannot help looking forward to the reestablishment of the greeks as a people and the language of homer becoming again a living language as among possible events you have now with you mr paradise who can tell you how easily the modern may be improved into the antient greek you ask me in your letter what ameliorations i think necessary in our federal constitution it is now too late to answer the question and it would always have been presumption in me to have done it your own ideas  those of the great characters who were to be concerned with you in these discussions will give the law as they ought to do to us all my own general idea was that the states should severally preserve their sovereignty in whatever concerns themselves alone  that whatever may concern another state or any foreign nation should be made a part of the federal sovereignty that the exercise of the federal sovereignty should be divided among three several bodies legislative executive  judiciary as the state sovereignties are and that some peaceable means should be contrived for the federal head to     enforce compliance on the part of the states—i have reflected on your idea of wooden or ivory diagrams for the geometrical demonstrations i should think wood as good as ivory  that in this case it might add to the improvement of the young gentlemen that they should make the figures themselves being furnished by a workman with a piece of veneer no other tool than a penknife  a wooden rule would be necessary perhaps pasteboards or common cards might be still more convenient the difficulty is how to reconcile figures which must have a very sensible breadth to our ideas of a mathematical line which having neither breadth nor thickness will revolt more at these than at simple lines drawn on paper or slate if after reflecting on this proposition you would prefer having them made here lay your commands on me and they shall be executed i return you a thousand thousand thanks for your goodness to my nephew after my debt to you for whatever i am myself it is increasing it too much to interest yourself for his future fortune but i know that to you a consciousness of doing good is a luxury ineffable you have enjoyed it already beyond all human measure and that you may long live to enjoy it and to bless your country  friends is the sincere prayer of him who is with every possible sentiment of esteem  respect dear sir your most obedient  most humble servant     thomas jefferson sep  0      paris charles thomson to charles thomson j mss paris sep  0      dear sir —your favor of april    did not come to my hands till the  st inst unfortunately the boxes of plants which were a day too late to come by the april packet missed the packet of june  0 also  only came by that of july    they are not yet arrived at paris but i expect them daily i am sensible of your kind attention to them and that as you were leaving new york you took the course which bade fair to be the best that they were forgotten in the hands in which you placed them was probably owing to too much business  more important i have desired mr madison to refund to you the money you were so kind as to advance for me the delay of your letter will apologize for this delay of the repayment i thank you also for the extract of the letter you were so kind as to communicate to me on the antiquities found in the western country i wish that the persons who go thither would make very exact descriptions of what they see of that kind without forming any theories the moment a person forms a theory his imagination sees in every object only the traits which favor that theory but it is too early to form theories on those antiquities we must wait with patience till more facts are collected i wish your philosophical society would collect exact descriptions of the several monuments as yet known and insert them naked in their transactions and continue their attention to those hereafter to be discovered patience  observation may enable us in time to solve the problem     whether those who formed the scattering monuments in our western country were colonies sent off from mexico or the founders of mexico itself whether both were the descendants or the progenitors of the asiatic redmen the mexican tradition mentioned by dr robertson is an evidence but a feeble one in favor of the one opinion the number of languages radically different is a strong evidence in favor of the contrary one there is an american of the name of ledyard he who was with captain cook on his last voyage  wrote an account of that voyage who is gone to st petersburg from thence he was to go to kamschatka to cross over thence to the northwest coast of america  to penetrate through the main continent to our side of it he is a person of ingenuity  information unfortunately he has too much imagination however if he escapes safely he will give us new curious  useful information i had a letter from him dated last march when he was about to leave st petersburgh on his way to kamschatka with respect to the information of the strata of rocks i had observed them between the blue ridge  north mountain in virginia to be parallel with the pole of the earth i observed the same thing in most instances in the alps between cette  turin but in returning along the precipices of the pyrinees  where they hang over the mediterranean their direction was totally different and various and you mention that in our western country they are horizontal this variety proves they have not been formed by     subsidence as some writers of theories of the earth have pretended for then they should always have been in circular strata  concentric it proves too that they have not been formed by the rotation of the earth on its axis as might have been suspected had all these strata been parallel with that axis they may indeed have been thrown up by explosions as whitehurst supposes or have been the effect of convulsions but there can be no proof of the explosion nor is it probable that convulsions have deformed every spot of the earth it is now generally agreed that rock grows and it seems that it grows in layers in every direction as the branches of trees grow in all directions why seek further the solution of this phenomenon everything in nature decays if it were not reproduced then by growth there would be a chasm i remember you asked me in a former letter whether the steam mill in london was turned by the steam immediately or by the intermediate agency of water raised by the steam when i was in london boulton made a secret of his mill therefore i was permitted to see it only superficially i saw no water wheels  therefore supposed none i answered you accordingly that there were none but when i was at nismes i went to see the steam mill there  they showed it to me in all its parts i saw that their steam raised water  that this water turned a wheel i expressed my doubts of the necessity of the interagency of water  that the london mill was without it but they supposed me mistaken perhaps i was so i have had no opportunity since of clearing up the doubt        thomas jefferson sep         paris william carmichael to william carmichael  j mss paris sep         dear sir —the copy of your letter of july   and that of aug    came to hand together the original of the former i never received my last to you was dated june    i heard indirectly that mr grand had refused to pay a bill of yours but he never said a word to me on the subject nor mentioned any letter of yours in consequence of it i have stated the matter to the board of treasury i also wrote to mr adams a state of the same fact there are at amsterdam  00000 florins at his disposal colo smith will endeavor to get for you an order to draw on that fund the subject of smiths mission to portugal appeared to me so causeless as given out that i imagined it was only the ostensible one the real cause remaining a secret between him and congress yet i never heard any other hinted with respect to the reimbursement to the count dexpilly for the maintenance of our prisoners at algiers i wrote to mr jay what you had formerly communicated to me but am not authorized to give any answer i think it important to destroy at algiers every idea that congress will redeem our captives there perhaps at any price much less at that paid by spain it seems to be the general opinion that the redeeming them would occasion the capture of greater numbers by increasing the incitements to cruise against us we must never make it their interest to go out of the straights in quest of us and we must avoid entering into the straights at least     till we are rich enough to arm in that sea the spanish consul therefore cannot too soon withdraw himself from all responsibility for our prisoners as to the affair of the frigate of south carolina i communicated to you every thing i knew on the subject by inclosing you all the papers which had come to my hands i have received letters  gazettes from america to the    of july the federal convention was likely to sit to the month of october a thin congress was sitting at the same time they had passed an ordinance dividing the country north of ohio into three states  providing both a present and a future form of government for them the sale of their lands commence this month an idea had got abroad in the western country that congress was ceding to spain the navigation of the mississippi for a certain time they had taken flame at it  were assembling conventions on the subject wherein the boldest  most dangerous propositions were to be made they are said to be now  0000 strong and are more formidable from their spirit than numbers this is the only bone of contention which can arise between spain  us for ages it is a pity it could not be settled amicably when we consider that the mississippi is the only issue to the ocean for five eights of the territory of the u s  how fast that territory peoples the ultimate event cannot be mistaken it would be wise then to take arrangements according to what must happen there had been a hope that the affairs of holland might be accomodated without a war but this hope has failed the prussian troops have entered the     territories of the republick the stadtholder is now at the hague and there seems to be no force capable of opposing him england too has notified this court by her envoy two days ago that she is arming in the meantime little provision has been made here against such an event m de segur declares that six weeks ago he proposed in council to march   000 men into holland the archbp is charged principally with having prevented this he seems to have been duped by his strong desire for peace and by calculating that the k of prussia would have acted on principles of common sense to complicate the game still more you know of the war which has arisen between russia  the turks you know also that it was excited there as well as at berlin by the english former alliances thus broke prussia having thrown herself into the scale opposed to france turkey having abandoned her councils and followed the instigations of her enemies what remains for this country to do i know that russia proposed a confederation with this court that this court without committing itself wished          i know the final determination of the emperor was that he came into the proposition has formed a line from the russian to the turkish confines by   camps of  0000 men in one   0000 in each of the others yet it does not seem that france has closed the proposal in favor of which every principle of common sense enlists itself the queen breteuil and montmorin have been for some time decidedly for this triple alliance which especially if aided by spain would give law to the world the premier is still     accused with hesitation they begin to say that tho he is a patriotic minister and an able one for peace he has not energy enough for war if this takes place the consequences to prussia and the stadtholder may be easily foreseen whether it does or not the turks must quit europe neutrality should be our plan because no nation should without urgent necessity begin a second war while the debts of the former remain unpaid the accumulation of debts is a most fearful evil but ever since the accession of the present king of england that court has unerringly done what common sense would have dictated not to do now common sense dictates that they should avoid forcing us to take part against them because this brings on them a heavy land war therefore they will not avoid it they will stop our ships visit and harass them seize them on the most frivolous pretexts and oblige us to take from them canada  nova scotia which it is not our interest to possess mr eden sets out in a few days for madrid you will have to oppose in him the most bitter enemy against our country which exists his late and sudden elevation makes the remembrance of the contempt we shewed to his mission in america rankle the more in his breast whether his principle will restrain him to fair modes of opposition i am not well enough acquainted with him to say i know nothing of him but his parliamentary history and that is not in his favor as he wishes us every possible ill all the lies of the london papers are true history in his creed and will be propagated as such to prejudice against us the mind of the court where     you are you will find it necessary to keep him well in your eye and to trace all his footsteps—you know doubtless that m de brienne has been appointed minister of war  the count de la luzerne minister of marine he is brother of the chevalier  at present in st domingo of which he is commandant the count de moustier goes minister to america the chevalier de la luzerne preferring the promise of the first vacant embassy lambert is comptrolleur general de la borde  cabarus have successively refused the office of directeur du tresor royale—having now got the maps for the notes on virginia i will send by the count daranda two copies one for yourself  one for monsr de campomenes by the same conveyance i will forward the ratification of the treaty with morocco  ask the favor of you to contrive it to that court mr barclay is gone to america thomas jefferson sep         paris john adams to john adams j mss paris sep         dear sir —i received your favor by mr cutting and thank you sincerely for the copy of your book the departure of a packet boat which always gives me full emploiment for sometime before has only permitted me to look into it a little i judge of it from the first volume which i thought formed to do a great deal of good the first principle of a good government is certainly a distribution of its powers into executive judiciary  legislative and a   0 subdivision of the latter into two or three branches it is a good step gained when it is proved that the english constitution acknowledged to be better than all which have preceded it is only better in proportion as it has approached nearer to this distribution of powers from this the last step is easy to shew by a comparison of our constitutions with that of england how much more perfect they are the article of confederations is surely worthy of your pen it would form a most interesting addition to shew what have been the nature of the confederations which have existed hitherto what were their excellencies  what their defects a comparison of ours with them would be to the advantage of ours and would increase the veneration of our countrymen for it it is a misfortune that they do not sufficiently know the value of their constitutions  how much happier they are rendered by them than any other people on earth by the governments under which they live—you know all that has happened in the united netherlands you know also that our friends van staphorsts will be among the most likely to become objects of severity if any severities should be exercised is the money in their hands entirely safe if it is not i am sure you have already thought of it are we to suppose the game already up and that the stadtholder is to be reestablished perhaps erected into a monarch without this country lifting a finger in opposition to it if so it is a lesson the more for us in fact what a crowd of lessons do the present miseries of holland teach us never to have an hereditary officer of any sort     never to let a citizen ally himself with kings never to call in foreign nations to settle domestic differences never to suppose that any nation will expose itself to war for us c still i am not without hopes that a good rod is in soak for prussia and that england will feel the end of it it is known to some that russia made propositions to the emperor  france for acting in concert that the emperor consents and has disposed four camps of   0000 men from the limits of turkey to those of prussia this court hesitates or rather its premier hesitates for the queen montmorin  breteuil are for the measure should it take place all may yet come to rights except for the turks who must retire from europe and this they must do were france quixotic enough to undertake to support them we i hope shall be left free to avail ourselves of the advantages of neutrality and yet much i fear the english or rather their stupid king will force us out of it for thus i reason by forcing us into the war against them they will be engaged in an expensive land war as well as a sea war common sense dictates therefore that they should let us remain neuter ergo they will not let us remain neuter i never yet found any other general rule for foretelling what they will do but that of examining what they ought not to do you will have heard doubtless that m lambert is comptroller general that the office of directeur general du tresor royal has been successively refused by monsr de la borde  monsr cabarrus that the conte de brienne brother of the archbishop is     minister of war and the count de la luzerne minister of marine they have sent for him from his government in the west indies the chevalier de la luzerne has a promise of the vacant embassy it will be that of london if adhemar can be otherwise disposed of the chevalier might have had that of holland if he would the count de moustier will sail about the middle of next month count daranda leaves us in a few days his successor is hourly expected i have the honor to be with my best respects to mrs adams  sentiments of perfect esteem  regard to yourself dear sir your most obedient  most humble servant p s since writing the above i learn thro a        0    0      0                      00        is    0  0            with the   0

      sir —i had the honour of informing you some time ago that i had written to some of my friends in america desiring they would send me such of the spoils of the moose caribou elk  deer as might throw light on that class of animals but more particularly to send me the complete skeleton skin  horns of the moose in such condition as that the     skin might be sewed up  stuffed on its arrival here i am happy to be able to present to you at this moment the bones  skin of a moose the horns of the caribou the elk the deer the spiked horned buck and the roebuck of america they all come from new hampshire  massachusetts i give you their popular names as it rests with yourself to decide their real names the skin of the moose was drest with the hair on but a great deal of it has come off and the rest is ready to drop off the horns of the elk are remarkably small i have certainly seen of them which would have weighed five or six times as much this is the animal which we call elk in the southern parts of america and of which i have given some description in the notes on virginia of which i had the honour of presenting you a copy i really doubt whether the flathorned elk exists in america and i think this may be properly classed with the elk the principal difference being in the horns i have seen the daim the cerf the chevreuil of europe but the animal we call elk and which may be distinguished as the roundhorned elk is very different from them i have never seen the brandhirtz or cerf dardennes nor the european elk could i get a sight of them i think i should be able to say to which of them the american elk resembles most as i am tolerably well acquainted with that animal i must observe also that the horns of the deer which accompany these spoils are not of the fifth or sixth part of the weight of some that i have seen this individual has been of age according to our method of judging i have     taken measures particularly to be furnished with large horns of our elk  our deer  therefore beg of you not to consider those now sent as furnishing a specimen of their ordinary size i really suspect you will find that the moose the round horned elk  the american deer are species not existing in europe the moose is perhaps of a new class i wish these spoils sir may have the merit of adding anything new to the treasures of nature which have so fortunately come under your observation  of which she seems to have given you the key they will in that case be some gratification to you which it will always be pleasing to me to have procured having the honor to be with sentiments of the most perfect esteem  respect sir your most obedient  most humble servant thomas jefferson oct        john rutledge to the governor of south carolina john rutledge j mss paris oct        sir —i am informed that the persons having claims against the state of south carolina on account of the frigate of the same name have appointed mr cutting their attorney for settling those claims with the state it becomes my duty therefore to inform you that a claim of the state against the court of spain for services performed by that frigate was transmitted to me the last spring by mr jay together with the papers on which it was founded  that i was instructed to forward the same to mr carmichael at madrid to be sollicited by him     and at the same time to confer with the prince of luxemburg on the subject  engage the assistance of the french ambassador at madrid in the sollicitation all this was done and i have lately received a letter from mr carmichael inclosing the copy of one from the count de florida blanca by which it appears that the court of spain has referred the adjustment of your claim to mr gardoqui  your delegates at new york where perhaps the whole business may be most conveniently settled in my conference with the prince of luxemburg i undertook to quiet his mind by assurances which i knew i might make with truth that the state of south carolina would settle his claim finally with justice  honor  would take measures for paying it as soon as their situation would permit a recent instance of arrangements taken in a like case by the state of maryland has had a good effect in counteracting those calumnies against us which our enemies on the other side the channel disseminate industriously through all europe thomas jefferson oct        paris james madison to james madison  j mss paris oct        dear sir —the bearer hereof the count de moustier successor to monsr de la luzerne would from his office need no letter of introduction to you or to anybody yet i take the liberty of recommending him to you to shorten those formal approaches which the same office would otherwise expose him     to in making your acquaintance he is a great enemy to formality etiquette ostentation  luxury he goes with the best dispositions to cultivate society without poisoning it by ill example he is sensible disposed to view things favorably  being well acquainted with the constitution of england its manners  language is the better prepared for his station with us but i should have performed only the lesser  least pleasing half of my task were i not to add my recommendations of madame de brehan she is goodness itself you must be well acquainted with her you will find her well disposed to meet your acquaintance  well worthy of it the way to please her is to receive her as an acquaintance of a thousand years standing she speaks little english you must teach her more and learn french from her she hopes by accompanying monsieur de moustier to improve her health which is very feeble  still more to improve her son in his education  to remove him to a distance from the seductions of this country you will wonder to be told that there are no schools in this country to be compared to ours in the sciences the husband of madame de brehan is an officer  obliged by the times to remain with the army monsieur de moustier brings your watch i have worn it two months and really find her a most incomparable one she will not want the little redressing which new watches generally do after going about a year she cost  00 livres to open her in all her parts press the little pin on the edge with the point of your nail that opens the chrystel then open the dial plate in the     usual way then press the stem at the end within the loop  it opens the back for winding up or regulating de moustier is remarkably communicative with adroitness he may be pumped of anything his openness is from character not from affectation an intimacy with him may on this account be politically valuable thomas jefferson nov        paris john jay to john jay j mss paris nov        sir —i shall take the liberty of confiding sometimes to a private letter such details of the small history of the court or cabinet as may be worthy of being known and yet not proper to be publicly communicated i doubt whether the administration is yet in a permanent form the count de montmorin  baron de breteuil are i believe firm enough in their places it was doubted whether they would wait for the count de la lucerne if the war had taken place but at present i suppose they will i wish it also because m de hector his only competitor has on some occasions shewn little value for the connection with us lambert the comptroller general is thought to be very insecure i should be sorry also to lose him i have worked several days with him the m de la fayette and monsr du pont father of the young gentleman gone to america with the count de moustier to reduce into one arret whatever concerned our commerce i have found him a man of great judgment  application possessing good general principles on subjects of     commerce  friendly dispositions towards us he passed the arret in a very favorable form but it has been opposed in the council  will i fear suffer some alteration in the article of whale oil that of tobacco which was put into a separate instrument experiences difficulties also which do not come from him mr du pont has rendered us essential service on these occasions i wish his son could be so well noticed as to make a favorable report to his father he would i think be gratified by it  his good dispositions be strengthened  rendered further useful to us whether i shall be able to send you these regulations by the present packet will depend on their getting thro the council in time the archbishop continues well with his patroness her object is a close connection with her brother i suppose he convinces her that peace will furnish the best occasions of cementing that connection it may not be uninstructive to give you the origin  nature of his influence with the queen—when the d de choiseul proposed the marriage of the dauphin with this lady he thought it proper to send a person to vienna to perfect her in the language he asked his friend the archbishop of toulouse to recommend to him a proper person he recommended a certain abbé the abbé from his first arrival at vienna either tutored by his patron or prompted by gratitude impressed on the queens mind the exalted talents and merit of the archbishop and continually represented him as the only man fit to be placed at the helm of affairs on his return to paris being retained near the person of the queen he kept him     constantly in her view the archbishop was named of the assembly des notables had occasion enough there to prove his talents  count de vergennes his great enemy dying opportunely the queen got him into place he uses the abbé even yet for instilling all his notions into her mind that he has imposing talents and patriotic dispositions i think is certain good judges think him a theorist only little acquainted with the details of business  spoiling all his plans by a bungled execution he may perhaps undergo a severe trial his best actions are exciting against him a host of enemies particularly the reduction of the pensions  reforms in other branches of economy some think the ministers are willing he should stay in till he has effected this odious yet necessary work  that they will then make him the scapegoat of the transaction the declarations too which i send you in my public letter if they should become public will probably raise an universal cry it will all fall on him because montmorin  breteuil say without reserve that the sacrifice of the dutch has been against their advice he will perhaps not permit these declarations to appear in this country they are absolutely unknown they were communicated to me by the d of dorset and i believe no other copy has been given here they will be published doubtless in england as a proof of their triumph  may thence make their way into this country if the premier can stem a few months he may remain long in office  will never make war if he can help it if he should be removed the peace will probably be short he is solely chargeable with   0 the loss of holland true they could not have raised money by taxes to supply the necessities of war but could they do it were their finances ever so well arranged no nation makes war nowadays but by the aid of loans and it is probable that in a war for the liberties of holland all the treasures of that country would have been at their service they have now lost the cow which furnishes the milk of war she will be on the side of their enemies whenever a rupture shall take place  no arrangement of their finances can countervail this circumstance i have no doubt you permit access to the letters of your foreign ministers by persons only of the most perfect trust it is in the european system to bribe the clerks high in order to obtain copies of interesting papers—i am sure you are equally attentive to the conveyance of your letters to us as you know that all are opened that pass thro any post office of europe your letters which come by the packet if put into the mail at new york or into the post office at havre wear proofs that they have been opened the passenger to whom they are confided should be cautioned always to keep them in his own hands till he can deliver them personally in paris thomas jefferson nov         paris william stephens smith to william stephens smith j mss paris nov         dear sir —i am now to acknoledge the receipt of your favors of october the  th  th    th in the last you apologise for your letters of introduction to     americans coming here it is so far from needing apology on your part that it calls for thanks on mine i endeavor to shew civilities to all the americans who come here  will give me opportunities of doing it and it is a matter of comfort to know from a good quarter what they are  how far i may go in my attentions to them can you send me woodmasons bills for the two copying presses for the m de la fayette  the m de chastellux the latter makes one article in a considerable account of old standing and which i cannot present for want of this article—i do not know whether it is to yourself or mr adams i am to give my thanks for the copy of the new constitution i beg leave through you to place them where due it will be yet three weeks before i shall receive them from america there are very good articles in it  very bad i do not know which preponderate what we have lately read in the history of holland in the chapter on the stadtholder would have sufficed to set me against a chief magistrate eligible for a long duration if i had ever been disposed towards one  what we have always read of the elections of polish kings should have forever excluded the idea of one continuable for life wonderful is the effect of impudent  persevering lying the british ministry have so long hired their gazetteers to repeat and model into every form lies about our being in anarchy that the world has at length believed them the english nation has believed them the ministers themselves have come to believe them  what is more wonderful we have believed them ourselves yet where does this anarchy exist     where did it ever exist except in the single instance of massachusetts and can history produce an instance of rebellion so honourably conducted i say nothing of its motives they were founded in ignorance not wickedness god forbid we should ever be  0 years without such a rebellion the people cannot be all  always well informed the part which is wrong will be discontented in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive if they remain quiet under such misconceptions it is a lethargy the forerunner of death to the public liberty we have had    states independent    years there has been one rebellion that comes to one rebellion in a century  a half for each state what country before ever existed a century  half without a rebellion  what country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance let them take arms the remedy is to set them right as to facts pardon  pacify them what signify a few lives lost in a century or two the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots  tyrants it is its natural manure our convention has been too much impressed by the insurrection of massachusetts and in the spur of the moment they are setting up a kite to keep the henyard in order i hope in god this article will be rectified before the new constitution is accepted—you ask me if any thing transpires here on the subject of s america not a word i know that there are combustible materials there and that they wait the torch only but this country probably     will join the extinguishers—the want of facts worth communicating to you has occasioned me to give a little loose to dissertation we must be contented to amuse when we cannot inform thomas jefferson dec         paris william carmichael to william carmichael j mss paris dec         dear sir —i am later in acknoledging the receipt of your favors of oct    nov       because we have been long expecting a packet which i hoped would bring communications worth detailing to you and she arrived only a few days ago after a very long passage indeed i am very sorry you have not been able to make out the cypher of my letter of sept    because it contained things which i wished you to know at that time they have lost now a part of their merit but still i wish you could decypher them there remains a part which it might still be agreeable to you to understand i have examined the cypher from which it was written it is precisely a copy of those given to messieurs barclay  lamb in order that you may examine whether yours corresponds i will now translate into cypher the three first lines of my letter of june       0    0        0                00        0

as well as my manner of using it but i shall not use it in future till i know from you the result of your reexamination of it i have the honor now to return you the letter you had been so good as to enclose to me about the same time of listons conversation with you similar ones were held with me by mr eden he particularly questioned me on the effect of our treaty with france in the case of a war and what might be our dispositions i told him without hesitation that our treaty obliged us to receive the armed vessels of france with their prizes into our ports  to refuse admission to the prizes made on her by her enemies that there was a clause by which we guaranteed to france her american possessions and which might perhaps force us into the war if these were attacked and it is certain said he that they would have been attacked i added that our dispositions would have been to be neutral  that i thought it the interest of both those powers that we should be so because it would relieve both from all anxiety as to the feeding their west indian islands and england would moreover avoid a heavy land war on our continent which would cripple all her proceedings elsewhere he expected these sentiments from me personally and he knew them to be analogous to those of our country we had often before had occasions of knowing each other his peculiar bitterness towards us had sufficiently appeared  i had never concealed from him that i considered the british as our natural enemies and as the only nation on earth who wished us ill from the     bottom of their souls and i am satisfied that were our continent to be swallowed up by the ocean great britain would be in a bonfire from one end to the other mr adams as you know has asked his recall this has been granted  colonel smith is to return too congress having determined to put an end to their commission at that court i suspect and hope they will make no new appointment our new constitution is powerfully attacked in the american newspapers the objections are that its effect would be to form the    states into one that proposing to melt all down into one general government they have fenced the people by no declaration of right they have not renounced the power of keeping a standing army they have not secured the liberty of the press they have reserved a power of abolishing trials by jury in civil cases they have proposed that the laws of the federal legislature shall be paramount the laws  constitutions of the states they have abandoned rotation in office  particularly their president may be reelected from   years to   years for life so as to render him a king for life like a king of poland  have not given him either the check or aid of a council to these they add calculations of expense c c to frighten people you will perceive that these objections are serious and some of them not without foundation the constitution however has been received with a very general enthusiasm and as far as can be judged from external demonstrations the bulk of the people are eager to adopt it in the eastern states the printers will print nothing against it unless the writer     subscribes his name massachusetts  connecticut have called conventions in january to consider of it in new york there is a division the governor clinton is known to be hostile to it jersey it is thought will certainly accept it pennsylvania is divided  all the bitterness of her factions has been kindled anew on it but the party in favor of it is strongest both in  out of the legislature this is the party antiently of morris wilson c delaware will do what pennsylvania shall do maryland is thought favorable to it yet it is supposed chase  paca will oppose it as to virginia two of her delegates in the first place refused to sign it these were randolph the governor  george mason besides these henry harrison nelson  the lees are against it genl washington will be for it but it is not in his character to exert himself much in the case madison will be its main pillar but tho an immensely popular one it is questionable whether he can bear the weight of such a host so that the presumption is that virginia will reject it we know nothing of the disposition of the states south of this should it fall thro as is possible notwithstanding the enthusiasm with which it was received in the first moment it is probable that congress will propose that the objections which the people shall make to it being once known another convention shall be assembled to adopt the improvements generally acceptable  omit those found disagreeable in this way union may be produced under a happy constitution and one which shall not be too energetic as are the constitutions of europe i give you these     details because possibly you may not have received them all the sale of our western lands is immensely successful   millions of acres had been sold at private sale for a dollar an acre in certificates and at the public sales some of them had sold as high as    0 dollars the acre the sale had not been begun two months by these means taxes c our domestic debt originally    millions of dollars was reduced by the  st day of last october to    millions  they were then in treaty for   millions of acres more at a dollar private sale our domestic debt will thus be soon paid off and that done the sales will go on for money at a cheaper rate no doubt for the payment of our foreign debt the petite guerre always waged by the indian seems not to abate the ardor of purchase or emigration kentucky is now counted at  0000 frankland is also growing fast i inclose you a letter from mr littlepage on the subject of money he owes you the best thing you can do i think will be to desire your banker at madrid to give orders to his correspondent here to receive the money and remit it to you i shall chearfully lend my instrumentality as far as it can be useful to you if any sum of money is delivered me for you before you write on the subject i shall place it in mr grands hands subject to your order  give you notice of it—no moneynews yet from our board of treasury you ask me if there is any french translation of my notes there is one by the abbé morellet but the whole order is changed and other differences     made which with numerous typographical errors render it a different book in some respects perhaps a better one but not mine i am flattered by the count de campomanes acceptance of the original i wish i had thought to have sent one to don ulloa for i suppose him to be living tho i have not heard of him lately a person so well acquainted with the southern part of our world  who has given such excellent information on it would perhaps be willing to know something of the northern part i have been told that the cutting thro the isthmus of panama which the world has so often wished  supposed practicable has at times been thought of by the government of spain  that they once proceeded so far as to have a survey  examination made of the ground but that the result was either impracticability or too great difficulty probably the count de campomanes or don ulloa can give you information on this head i should be exceedingly pleased to get as minute details as possible on it and even copies of the survey report c if they could be obtained at a moderate expense i take the liberty of asking your assistance in this thomas jefferson dec  0      paris james madison to james madison  mad mss paris dec  0      dear sir —my last to you was of oct   by the count de moustier yours of july    sep        oct    have been successively received yesterday the day before  three or four days before that i have only had time to read the letters the printed papers communicated with them however interesting being obliged to lie over till i finish my dispatches for the packet which dispatches must go from hence the day after tomorrow i have much to thank you for first and most for the cyphered paragraph respecting myself these little informations are very material towards forming my own decisions i would be glad even to know when any individual member thinks i have gone wrong in any instance if i know myself it would not excite ill blood in me while it would assist to guide my conduct perhaps to justify it and to keep me to my duty alert i must thank you too for the information in thos burkes case tho you will have found by a subsequent letter that i have asked of you a further investigation of that matter it is to gratify the lady who is at the head of the convent wherein my daughters are  who by her attachment  attention to them lays me under great obligations i shall hope therefore still to receive from you the result of the further enquiries my second letter had asked—the parcel of rice which you informed me had miscarried accompanied my letter to the delegates of s carolina mr bourgoin was to be the bearer of both  both were delivered together into the hands of his relation here who introduced him to me and who at a subsequent moment undertook to convey them to mr bourgoin this person was an engraver particularly recommended to dr franklin   0  mr hopkinson perhaps he may have mislaid the little parcel of rice among his baggage—i am much pleased that the sale of western lands is so successful i hope they will absorb all the certificates of our domestic debt speedily in the first place and that then offered for cash they will do the same by our foreign one the season admitting only of operations in the cabinet and these being in a great measure secret i have little to fill a letter i will therefore make up the deficiency by adding a few words on the constitution proposed by our convention i like much the general idea of framing a government which should go on of itself peaceably without needing continual recurrence to the state legislatures i like the organization of the government into legislative judiciary  executive i like the power given the legislature to levy taxes and for that reason solely approve of the greater house being chosen by the people directly for tho i think a house chosen by them will be very illy qualified to legislate for the union for foreign nations c yet this evil does not weigh against the good of preserving inviolate the fundamental principle that the people are not to be taxed but by representatives chosen immediately by themselves i am captivated by the compromise of the opposite claims of the great  little states of the latter to equal and the former to proportional influence i am much pleased too with the substitution of the method of voting by persons instead of that of voting by states and i like the negative given to the executive with a third of either house     though i should have liked it better had the judiciary been associated for that purpose or invested with a similar and separate power there are other good things of less moment i will now add what i do not like first the omission of a bill of rights providing clearly  without the aid of sophisms for freedom of religion freedom of the press protection against standing armies restriction against monopolies the eternal  unremitting force of the habeas corpus laws and trials by jury in all matters of fact triable by the laws of the land  not by the law of nations to say as mr wilson does that a bill of rights was not necessary because all is reserved in the case of the general government which is not given while in the particular ones all is given which is not reserved might do for the audience to whom it was addressed but is surely a gratis dictum opposed by strong inferences from the body of the instrument as well as from the omission of the clause of our present confederation which had declared that in express terms it was a hard conclusion to say because there has been no uniformity among the states as to the cases triable by jury because some have been so incautious as to abandon this mode of trial therefore the more prudent states shall be reduced to the same level of calamity it would have been much more just  wise to have concluded the other way that as most of the states had judiciously preserved this palladium those who had wandered should be brought back to it and to have established general right instead of general wrong let me add that a bill of rights is what the     people are entitled to against every government on earth general or particular  what no just government should refuse or rest on inferences the second feature i dislike and greatly dislike is the abandonment in every instance of the necessity of rotation in office and most particularly in the case of the president experience concurs with reason in concluding that the first magistrate will always be reelected if the constitution permits it he is then an officer for life this once observed it becomes of so much consequence to certain nations to have a friend or a foe at the head of our affairs that they will interfere with money  with arms a galloman or an angloman will be supported by the nation he befriends if once elected and at a second or third election out voted by one or two votes he will pretend false votes foul play hold possession of the reins of government be supported by the states voting for him especially if they are the central ones lying in a compact body themselves  separating their opponents and they will be aided by one nation of europe while the majority are aided by another the election of a president of america some years hence will be much more interesting to certain nations of europe than ever the election of a king of poland was reflect on all the instances in history antient  modern of elective monarchies and say if they do not give foundation for my fears the roman emperors the popes while they were of any importance the german emperors till they became hereditary in practice the kings of poland the deys of the ottoman dependances it may be said     that if elections are to be attended with these disorders the seldomer they are renewed the better but experience shews that the only way to prevent disorder is to render them uninteresting by frequent changes an incapacity to be elected a second time would have been the only effectual preventative the power of removing him every fourth year by the vote of the people is a power which will not be exercised the king of poland is removeable every day by the diet yet he is never removed—smaller objections are the appeal in fact as well as law and the binding all persons legislative executive  judiciary by oath to maintain that constitution i do not pretend to decide what would be the best method of procuring the establishment of the manifold good things in this constitution and of getting rid of the bad whether by adopting it in hopes of future amendment or after it has been duly weighed  canvassed by the people after seeing the parts they generally dislike  those they generally approve to say to them we see now what you wish send together your deputies again let them frame a constitution for you omitting what you have condemned  establishing the powers you approve even these will be a great addition to the energy of your government—at all events i hope you will not be discouraged from other trials if the present one should fail of its full effect—i have thus told you freely what i like  dislike merely as a matter of curiosity for i know your own judgment has been formed on all these points after having heard everything which could be urged on them i own i am     not a friend to a very energetic government it is always oppressive the late rebellion in massachusetts has given more alarm than i think it should have done calculate that one rebellion in    states in the course of    years is but one for each state in a century  a half no country should be so long without one nor will any degree of power in the hands of government prevent insurrections france with all its despotism and two or three hundred thousand men always in arms has had three insurrections in the three years i have been here in every one of which greater numbers were engaged than in massachusetts  a great deal more blood was spilt in turkey which montesquieu supposes more despotic insurrections are the events of every day in england where the hand of power is lighter than here but heavier than with us they happen every half dozen years compare again the ferocious depredations of their insurgents with the order the moderation  the almost self extinguishment of ours —after all it is my principle that the will of the majority should always prevail if they approve the proposed convention in all its parts i shall concur in it chearfully in hopes that they will amend it whenever they shall find it work wrong i think our governments will remain virtuous for many centuries as long as they are chiefly agricultural and this will be as long as there shall be vacant lands in any part of america when they get piled upon one another in large cities as in europe they will become corrupt as in europe above all things i hope the education of the common people will be     attended to convinced that on their good sense we may rely with the most security for the preservation of a due degree of liberty i have tired you by this time with my disquisitions  will therefore only add assurances of the sincerity of those sentiments of esteem  attachment with which i am dear sir your affectionate friend  servant p s the instability of our laws is really an immense evil i think it would be well to provide in our constitutions that there shall always be a twelvemonth between the ingrossing a bill  passing it that it should then be offered to its passage without changing a word and that if circumstances should be thought to require a speedier passage it should take two thirds of both houses instead of a bare majority thomas jefferson dec         paris edward carrington to edward carrington j mss paris dec         dear sir —i have just received your two favors of october    and that of nov  0 i am much obliged to you for your hints in the danish business they are the only information i have on that subject except the resolution of congress  warn me of a rock on which i should most certainly have split the vote plainly points out an agent only leaving it to my discretion to substitute another my judgment concurs with that of congress as to his fitness but i shall enquire for the surest banker at copenhagen to receive the money not because i should have had any doubts but because i am     informed others would have had them against the failure of a banker were such an accident or any similar one to happen i cannot be held accountable in a case where i act without particular interest my principal idea in proposing the transfer of the french debt was to obtain in the new loans a much longer day for the reimbursement of the principal hoping that the resources of the u s could have been equal to the article of interest alone but i shall endeavor to quiet as well as i can those interested a part of them will probably sell at any rate and one great claimant may be expected to make a bitter attack on our honor i am very much pleased to hear that our western lands sell so successfully i turn to this precious resource as that which will in every event liberate us from our domestic debt and perhaps too from our foreign one and this much sooner than i had expected i do not think any thing could have been done with them in europe individual speculators  sharpers had duped so many with their unlocated land warrants that every offer would have been suspected as to the new constitution i find myself nearly a neutral there is a great mass of good in it in a very desirable form but there is also to me a bitter pill or two i have written somewhat lengthily to mr madison on this subject and will take the liberty to refer you to that part of my letter to him i will add one question to what i have said there would it not have been better to assign to congress exclusively the article of imposts for federal purposes  to have left direct taxation exclusively to the states i     should suppose the former fund sufficient for all probable events aided by the land office the form which the affairs of europe may assume is not yet decypherable by those out of the cabinet the emperor gives himself at present the air of a mediator this is necessary to justify a breach with the porte he has his eye at the same time on germany and particularly on bavaria the elector of which has for a long time been hanging over the grave probably france would now consent to the exchange of the austrian netherlands to be created into a kingdom for the duke de deuxponts against the electorate of bavaria this will require a war the empress longs for turkey  viewing france as her principal obstacle would gladly negotiate her acquiescence to spur on this she is coquetting it with england the king of prussia too is playing a double game between france  england but i suppose the former incapable of forgiving him or of ever reposing confidence in him perhaps the spring may unfold to us the final arrangement which will take place among the powers of this continent i often doubt whether i should trouble congress or my friends with these details of european politicks i know they do not excite that interest in america of which it is impossible for one to divest himself here i know too that it is a maxim with us and i think it a wise one not to entangle ourselves with the affairs of europe still i think we should know them the turks have practiced the same maxim of not medling in the complicated wrangles of this continent but they have unwisely     chosen to be ignorant of them also and it is this total ignorance of europe its combinations  its movements which exposes them to that annihilation possibly about taking place while there are powers in europe which fear our views or have views on us we should keep an eye on them their connections  oppositions that in a moment of need we may avail ourselves of their weakness with respect to others as well as ourselves and calculate their designs  movements on all the circumstances under which they exist tho i am persuaded therefore that these details are read by many with great indifference yet i think it my duty to enter into them and to run the risk of giving too much rather than too little information i have the honour to be with perfect esteem  respect dear sir your most obedient  most humble servant p s the resolution of congress relative to the prize money received here speaks of that money as paid to me i hope this matter is properly understood the treasury board desired me to receive it and apply it to such  such federal purposes  that they would pay the dividends of the claimants in america this would save the expense of remittance i declined however receiving the money  ordered it into the hands of their banker who paid it away for the purposes to which they had destined it i should be sorry an idea should get abroad that i had received the money of these poor fellows  applied it to other purposes i shall in like manner order the danish  barbary money into the     hands of bankers carefully avoiding ever to touch a sou of it or having any other account to make out than what the banker will furnish thomas jefferson dec         paris colonel forrest to

reserved it for a good private conveiance which has never offered till now by mr parker tho i pretend to make no mystery of my opinion yet my distance from the scene gives me too much diffidence in my views of it to detail them lengthily  publicly this diffidence is increased by my high opinion of the abilities  honesty of the framers of the constitution yet we cannot help thinking for ourselves i suppose i see much precious improvement in it but some seeds of danger which might have been kept out of sight of the framers by a consciousness of their own honesty  a presumption that all succeeding

also as to let me know who undertook the map of s america  even to get from him some acknowledgment in writing of what he is to do i am glad to learn by letters which come down to the  0th of december that the new constitution will undoubtedly be received by a sufficiency of the states to set it a going were i in america i would advocate it warmly till nine should have adopted  then as warmly take the other side to convince the remaining four that they ought not to come into it till the declaration of rights is annexed to it by this means we should secure all the good of it  procure so respectable an opposition as would induce the accepting states to offer a bill of rights this would be the happiest turn the thing could take i fear much the effects of the perpetual reeligibility of the president but it is not thought of in america  have therefore no prospect of a change of that article but i own it     astonishes me to find such a change wrought in the opinions of our countrymen since i left them as that three fourths of them should be contented to live under a system which leaves to their governors the power of taking from them the trial by jury in civil cases freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of commerce the habeas corpus laws  of yoking them with a standing army this is a degeneracy in the principles of liberty to which i had given four centuries

here i beg you not to think of the trifle i furnished you with nor to propose to return it till you shall have that sum more than you know what to do with and on every other occasion of difficulty i hope you will make use of me freely i presume you will now remain at london to see the trial of hastings without suffering yourself to be imposed on by the pomp in which it will be inveloped i would recommend to you to consider  decide for yourself these questions if his offence is to be decided by the law of the land why is he not tried in that court in which his fellow citizens are tried i e     the kings bench if he is cited before another court that he may be judged not according to the law of the land but by the discretion of his judges is he not disfranchised of his most precious right the benefit of the laws of his country in common with his other fellow citizens i think you will find on investigating this subject that every solid argument is against the extraordinary court  that every one in its favor is specious only it is a transfer from a judicature of learning  integrity to one the greatness of which is both illiterate  unprincipled yet such is the force of prejudice with some  of the want of reflection in others that many of our constitutions have copied this absurdity without suspecting it to be one i am glad to hear that our new constitution is pretty sure of being accepted by states enough to secure the good it contains  to meet such opposition in some others as to give us hopes it will be accommodated to them by the amendment of its most glaring faults particularly the want of a declaration of rights—the long expected edict for the protestants at length appears here its analysis is this it is an acknoledgment hitherto withheld by the laws that protestants can beget children and that they can die  be offensive unless buried it does not give them permission to think to speak or to worship it enumerates the humiliations to which they shall remain subject  the burthens to which they shall continue to be unjustly exposed what are we to think of the condition of the human mind in a country where such a wretched thing as this has thrown the state into convulsions and how must we bless our own situation in     a country the most illiterate peasant of which is a solon compared with the authors of this law there is modesty often which does itself injury our countrymen possess this they do not know their own superiority you see it you are young you have time  talents to correct them study the subject while in europe in all the instances

continue to mark to me its progress i will thank you also for as exact a data as you can procure me of the impression made on the sum of our domestic debt by the sale of lands  by federal  state exertions in any other manner i have not yet heard whether the law passed in virginia for prohibiting the importn of brandies if it did the late arret for encouraging our commerce will be repealed the

  sir —i am very sensible of the honour you propose to me of becoming a member of the society for the abolition of the slave trade you know that nobody wishes more ardently to see an abolition not only of the trade but of the condition of slavery and certainly nobody will be more willing to encounter every sacrifice for that object but the influence  information of the friends to this proposition in france will be far above the need of my association i am here as a public servant and those whom i serve having never yet been able to give their voice against this practice it is decent for me to avoid too public a demonstration of my wishes to see it abolished without serving the cause here it might render me less able to serve it beyond the water i trust you will be sensible of the prudence of those motives therefore which govern my conduct on this occasion  be assured of my wishes for the success of your undertaking and the sentiments of esteem  respect with which i have the honour to be sir your most obedt humble servt thomas jefferson may        paris george washington to george washington j mss paris may        sir —i am honoured with your excellencys letter by the last packet  thank you for the information it contains on the communication between the cayahoga  big beaver i have ever considered the opening a canal between those two water courses as the     most important work in that line which the state of virginia could undertake it will infallibly turn thro the patowmack all the commerce of lake erie  the country west of that except what may pass down the mississippi and it is important that it be soon done lest that commerce should in the mean time get established in another channel having in the spring of last year taken a journey through the southern parts of france  particularly examined the canal of languedoc through its whole course i take the liberty of sending you the notes i made on the spot as you may find in them something perhaps which may be turned to account some time or other in the prosecution of the patowmack canal being merely a copy from my travelling notes they are undigested  imperfect but may still perhaps give hints capable of improvement in your mind    i had intended to have written a word to your excellency on the subject of the new constitution but i have already spun out my letter to an immoderate length i will just observe therefore that according to my ideas there is a great deal of good in it there are two things however which i dislike strongly   the want of a declaration of rights i am in hopes the opposition of virginia will remedy this  produce such a declaration   the perpetual reeligibility of the president this i fear will make an office for life first  then hereditary i was much an enemy to monarchy before i came to europe i am ten thousand times more so since i have seen what they are there is scarcely an evil known in these countries which may not be traced to their   0 king as its source nor a good which is not derived from the small fibres of republicanism existing among them i can further say with safety there is not a crowned head in europe whose talents or merits would entitle him to be elected a vestryman by the people of any parish in america however i shall hope that before there is danger of this change taking place in the office of president the good sense  free spirit of our countrymen will make the changes necessary to prevent it under this hope i look forward to the general adoption of the new constitution with anxiety as necessary for us under our present circumstances thomas jefferson may         paris mrs william bingham to mrs william bingham j mss paris may         dear madam —a gentleman going to philadelphia furnishes me the occasion of sending you some numbers of the cabinet des modes  some new theatrical pieces these last have had great success on the stage where they have excited perpetual applause we have now need of something to make us laugh for the topics of the times are sad and eventful the gay and thoughtless paris is now become a furnace of politics all the world is now politically mad men women children talk nothing else  you know that naturally they talk much loud  warm society is spoilt by it at least for those who like myself are but lookers on—you too have had your political fever but our good ladies i trust have been too wise to wrinkle their foreheads with politics they are contented to soothe  calm the     minds of their husbands returning ruffled from political debate they have the good sense to value domestic happiness above all other and the art to cultivate it beyond all others there is no part of the earth where so much of this is enjoyed as in america you agree with me in this but you think that the pleasures of paris more than supply its wants in other words that a parisian is happier than an american you will change your opinion my dear madam and come over to mine in the end recollect the women of this capital some on foot some on horses  some in carriages hunting pleasure in the streets in routs  assemblies and forgetting that they have left it behind them in their nurseries compare them with our own countrywomen occupied in the tender and tranquil amusements of domestic life and confess that it is a comparison of americans and angels—you will have known from the public papers that monsieur de buffon the father is dead  you have known long ago that the son and his wife are separated they are pursuing pleasure in opposite directions madame de rochambeau is well so is madame de la fayette i recollect no other nouvelles de societé interesting to you and as for political news of battles  sieges turks  russians i will not detail them to you because you would be less handsome after reading them i have only to add then what i take a pleasure in repeating tho it will be the thousandth time that i have the honour to be with sentiments of very sincere respect

opportunity of acknoledging the receipt of your favors of feb  mar    and of congratulating you on your resurrection from the dead among whom you had been confidently entombed by the newsdealers of paris i am sorry that your first impressions have been disturbed by matters of etiquette where surely they should least have been expected to occur these disputes are the most insusceptible of determination because they have no foundation in reason arbitrary  senseless in their nature they are arbitrarily decided by every nation for itself these decisions are meant to prevent disputes but they produce ten where they prevent one it would have been better therefore in a new country to have excluded etiquette altogether or if it must be admitted in some form or other to have made it depend on some circumstance founded in nature such as the age or stature of the parties however you have got over all this and i am in hopes have been able to make up a society suited to your own dispositions your situation will doubtless be improved by the adoption of the new constitution which i hope will have taken place before you receive this i see in this instrument a great deal of good the consolidation of our government a just representation an administration of some permanence and other features of great value will be gained by it there are indeed some faults which revolted me a good deal in the first moment but we must be contented to travel on towards perfection step by     step we must be contented with the ground which this constitution will gain for us and hope that a favourable moment will come for correcting what is amiss in it i view in the same light the innovations making here the new organization of the judiciary department is undoubtedly for the better the reformation of the criminal code is an immense step taken towards good the composition of the plenary court is indeed vicious in the extreme but the basis of that court may be retained and its composition changed make of it a representative of the people by composing it of members sent from the provincial assemblies and it becomes a valuable member of the constitution but it is said the court will not consent to do this the court however has consented to call the states general who will consider the plenary court but as a canvas for them to work on the public mind is manifestly advancing on the abusive prerogatives of their governors and bearing them down no force in the government can withstand this in the long run courtiers had rather give up power than pleasures they will barter therefore the usurped prerogatives of the king for the money of the people this is the agent by which modern nations will recover their rights i sincerely wish that in this country they may be contented with a peaceable  passive opposition at this moment we are not sure of this tho as yet it is difficult to say what form the opposition will take it is a comfortable circumstance that their neighboring enemy is under the administration of a minister disposed to keep the peace        thomas jefferson may         paris james madison to james madison  j mss paris may         dear sir —the inclosed letter for mr jay being of a private nature i have thought it better to put it under your cover lest it might be opened by some of his clerks in the case of his absence but i inclose a press copy of it for yourself as you will perceive the subject of it referred to you as well as to him i ask your aid in it so far as you think right and to have done what you think right if you will now be so good as to cast your eye over the copy inclosed what follows the present sentence will be some details supplementary to that only necessary for your information but not proper for me to state to mr jay mr jay tho appointed a minister resident at the court of madrid he never was received in that character he was continually passing from paris to madrid and madrid to paris so that he had no occasion to establish a household at either accordingly he staid principally in furnished lodgings of all our ministers he had the least occasion for an outfit and i suppose spent almost nothing on that article he was of a disposition too to restrain himself within any limits of expence whatever and it suited his recluse turn which is to avoid society should he judge of what others should do by what he did it would be an improper criterion he was in europe as a voyageur only and it was while the salary was  00 guineas more than at present j adams he came over when instead of outfit  salary all expences were paid of rigorous honesty     and careless of appearances he lived for a considerable time as an œconomical private individual after he was fixed at the hague and the salary at a sum certain he continued his œconomical stile till out of the difference between his expences and his salary he could purchase furniture for his house this was the easier as the salary was at   00 guineas then he was obliged too to be passing between paris and the hague so as to avoid any regular current of expence when he established himself his pecuniary affairs were under the direction of mistress adams one of the most estimable characters on earth and the most attentive  honourable œconomists neither had a wish to lay up a copper but both wished to make both ends meet i suspected however from an expression dropped in conversation that they were not able to do this and that a deficit in their accounts appeared in their winding up if this conjecture be true it is a proof that the salary so far from admitting savings is unequal to a very plain stile of life for such was theirs i presume congress will be asked to allow it and it is evident to me from what i saw while in london that it ought to be done as they did not expend a shilling which should have been avoided would it be more eligible to set the example of making good a deficit or to give him an outfit which will cover it the impossibility of living on the sum allowed respectably was the true cause of his insisting on his recall doct franklin he came over while all expences were paid he rented a house with standing     furniture such as tables chairs presses c and bought all other necessaries the latter were charged in his account the former was included in the article of houserent and paid during the whole time of his stay here and as the established rate of hire for furniture is from  0 to  0 per cent per annum the standing furniture must have been paid for three times over during the   years he stayed here his salary too was   00 guineas when congress reduced it to less than  000 he refused to accede to it asked his recall and insisted that whenever they chose to alter the conditions on which he came out if he did not approve of it they ought to replace him in america on the old conditions he lived plain but as decently as his salary would allow he saved nothing but avoided debt he knew he could not do this on the reduced salary  therefore asked his recall with decision to him i succeeded he had established a certain stile of living the same was expected from me and there were  00 guineas a year less to do it on it has been aimed at however as far as was practicable this rendered it constantly necessary to step neither to the right nor to the left to incur any expence which could possibly be avoided  it called for an almost womanly attention to the details of the household equally perplexing disgusting  inconsistent with business you will be sensible that in this situation no savings could be made for reimbursing the half years salary ordered to be advanced under the former commission  more than as much again which was unavoidably so applied without     order for the purchase of the outfit the reason of the thing the usage of all nations the usage of our own by paying all expences of preceding ministers which gave them the outfit as far as their circumstances appeared to them to render it necessary have made me take for granted all along that it would not be refused to me nor should i have mentioned it now but that the administration is passing into other hands and more complicated forms it would be disagreeable to me to be presented to them in the first instance as a suitor men come into business at first with visionary principles it is practice alone which can correct  conform them to the actual current of affairs in the meantime those to whom their errors were first applied have been their victims the government may take up the project of appointing foreign ministers without outfits and they may ruin two or three individuals before they find that that article is just as indispensable as the salary they must then fall into the current of general usage which has become general only because experience has established its necessity—upon the whole be so good as to reflect on it and to do not what your friendship to me but your opinion of what is right will dictate accept in all cases assurances of the sincere esteem  respect with which i am dear sir your friend  servant thomas jefferson may         paris john brown to john brown j

removal from carolina to kentuckey was not an indifferent event to me i wish to see that country in the hands of people well disposed who know the value of the connection between that  the maritime states and who wish to cultivate it i consider their happiness as bound up together and that every measure should be taken which may draw the bands of union tighter it will be an efficacious one to receive them into congress as i perceive they are about to desire if to this be added an honest  disinterested conduct in congress as to everything relating to them we may hope for a perfect harmony the navigation of the mississippi was perhaps the strongest trial to which the justice of the federal government could be put if ever they thought wrong about it i trust they have got to rights i should think it proper for the western country to defer pushing their right to that navigation to extremity as long as they can do without it tolerably but that the moment it becomes absolutely necessary for them it will become the duty of the maritime states to push it to every extremity to which they would their own right of navigating the chesapeake the delaware the hudson or any other water a time of peace will not be the surest for obtaining this object those therefore who have influence in the new country would act wisely to endeavor to keep things quiet till the western parts of europe shall be engaged in war notwithstanding the aversion of the courts of london  versailles to war it is not certain that some incident     may not engage them in it england france spain russia sweden  denmark will all have fleets at sea or ready to put to sea immediately who can answer for the prudence of all their officers war is their interest even their courts are pacific from impotence only not from disposition i wish to heaven that our new government may see the importance of putting themselves immediately into a respectable position to make provision for the speedy paiment of their foreign debts will be the first operation necessary this will give them credit a concomitant one should be magazines  manufactures of arms this country is at present in a crisis of very uncertain issue i am in hopes it will be a favourable one to the rights  happiness of the people and that this will take place quietly small changes in the late regulations will render them wholly good the campaign opens between the turks  the two empires with an aspect rather favourable to the former the russians seem not yet thawed from the winters torpitude they have no army yet in motion and the emperor has been worsted in twothirds of the small actions which they have had as yet he is said to be rather retiring i do not think however that the success of the turks in the partisan affairs which have taken place can authorize us to presume that they will be superior also in great decisions their want of discipline and skill in military manœuvres is of little consequence in small engagements  of great in larger ones their grand army was at adrianople by the last accounts and to get from thence to belgrade  00 will require a month it will be that time at least then before we can have any very interesting news from them in the meantime the plague rages at constantinople to a terrible degree i cannot think but that it would be desireable to all commercial nations to have that nation  all its dependencies driven from the seacoast into the interior parts of asia  africa what a field would thus be restored to commerce the finest parts of the old world are now dead in a great degree to commerce to arts to science  to society greece syria egypt  the northern coast of africa constituted the whole world almost for the romans and to us they are scarcely known scarcely accessible at all the present summer will enable us to judge what turn this contest will take—i am greatly anxious to hear that nine states accept our new constitution we must be contented to accept of its good and to cure what is evil in it hereafter it seems necessary for our happiness at home i am sure it is so for our respectability abroad i shall at all times be glad to hear from you from new york from kentucky or whatever region of the earth you inhabit being with sentiments of very sincere esteem  attachment dear sir your friend  servant thomas jefferson may         paris edward carrington to edward carrington j mss paris may         dear sir —i have received with great pleasure your friendly letter of apr    it has come to hand after i had written my letters for the present  0  conveiance and just in time to add this to them i learn with great pleasure the progress of the new constitution indeed i have presumed it would gain on the public mind as i confess it has on my own at first tho i saw that the great mass  ground work was good i disliked many appendages reflection and discussion have cleared off most of these you have satisfied me as to the query i had put to you about the right of direct taxation my first wish was that   states would adopt it in order to ensure what was good in it  that the others might by holding off produce the necessary amendments but the plan of massachusetts is far preferable and will i hope be followed by those who are yet to decide there are two amendments only which i am anxious for   a bill of rights which it is so much the interest of all to have that i conceive it must be yielded the  st amendment proposed by massachusetts will in some degree answer this end but not so well it will do too much in some instances  too little in others it will cripple the federal government in some cases where it ought to be free and not restrain it in some others where restraint would be right the  d amendment which appears to me essential is the restoring the principle of necessary rotation particularly to the senate  presidency but most of all to the last reeligibility makes him an officer for life and the disastors inseparable from an elective monarchy render it preferable if we cannot tread back that step that we should go forward  take refuge in an hereditary one of the correction of this article however i  0  entertain no present hope because i find it has scarcely excited an objection in america and if it does not take place ere long it assuredly never will the natural progress of things is for liberty to yield  government to gain ground as yet our spirits are free our jealousy is only put to sleep by the unlimited confidence we all repose in the person to whom we all look as our president after him inferior characters may perhaps succeed and awaken us to the danger which his merit has led us into for the present however the general adoption is to be prayed for and i wait with great anxiety for the news from maryland  s carolina which have decided before this and with that virginia now in session may give the  th vote of approbation there could then be no doubt of n carolina n york  new hampshire but what do you propose to do with rhode island as long as there is hope we should give her time i cannot conceive but that she will come to rights in the long run force in whatever form would be a dangerous precedent there are rumours that the austrian army is obliged to retire a little that the spanish squadron is gone to south america that the english have excited a rebellion there and some others equally unauthorized i do not mention them in my letter to mr jay because they are unauthenticated the bankruptcies in london have recommenced with new force there is no saying where this fire will end perhaps in the general conflagration of all their paper if not now it must ere long with only  0 millions of coin  three or four hundred million of circulating  0  paper public  private nothing is necessary but a general panic produced either by failure invasion or any other cause and the whole residuary fabric vanishes into air  shews that paper is poverty that it is only the ghost of money  not money itself  00 years ago they had  0 odd millions of coin since that they have brought in from holland by borrowing  0 millions more yet they have but  0 millions left and they talk of being rich and of having the balance of trade in their favor paul jones is invited into the empresss service with the rank of rearadmiral  to have a separate command i wish it corresponded with the views of congress to give him that rank from the taking of the serapis i look to this officer as our great future dependence on the sea where alone we should think of ever having a force he is young enough to see the day when we shall be more populous than the whole british dominions and able to fight them ship to ship we should procure him then every possible opportunity of acquiring experience thomas jefferson june        paris william carmichael to william carmichael  j mss paris june        dear sir —    with respect to the isthmus of panama i am assured by burgoyne who would not chuse to be named however that a survey was made that a canal appeared very practicable and that the idea was suppressed for political reasons altogether he has seen  minutely examined the report this report is to me a vast desideratum for  0  reasons political  philosophical i cannot help suspecting the spanish squadron to be gone to s america and that some disturbances have been excited there by the british the court of madrid may suppose we would not see this with an unwilling eye this may be true as to the uninformed part of our people but those who look into futurity farther than the present moment or age and who combine well what is with what is to be must see that our interests well understood  our wishes are that spain shall not forever but very long retain her possessions in that quarter and that her views  ours must in a good degree  for a long time concur it is said in our gazettes that the spaniards have sunk one of our boats on the mississippi and that our people retaliated on one of theirs but my letters not mentioning this fact have made me hope it is not true in which hope your letter confirms me there are now  00000 inhabitants at kentucky they have accepted the offer of independence on the terms proposed by virginia and they have decided that their independent government shall begin on the  st day of the next year in the meantime they claim admittance into congress georgia has ceded her western territory to the u s to take place with the commencement of the new federal government i do not know the boundaries there has been some dispute of etiquette with the new french minister which has disgusted him the following is a state of the progress and prospect of the new plan of government the conventions of   states have accepted it to wit  0      massachusetts by         ayes     against            noes     connecticut             0     pennsylvania                    delaware               0      new jersey               0      georgia               0    ———   ———                 the other conventions were to meet as follows     maryland april        s carolina may        virginia may     0 new york june       new hampshire june       north carolina july        rhode island  referred the question to their people about one third of these gave their votes  of these there were about nine tenths against accepting the constitution  in maryland there was respectable opposition yet it is thought they will accept in s carolina there is scarcely any opposition in virginia the opposition is very formidable yet on the whole it is thought to have lessened and that that state will accede new york is perhaps more doubtful but if the   preceding states should have adopted it this will surely induce her to do it the new hampshire convention met many of the delegates came instructed  determined to vote against it the discussions brought them over to the side of the constitution but they could not vote against their  0  instructions they therefore asked an adjournment that they might go back to their constituents and ask a repeal of their instructions little doubt is entertained that they will accede the conduct of massachusetts has been noble she accepted the constitution but voted that it should stand as a perpetual instruction to their delegates to endeavor to obtain such  such reformations and the minority tho very strong both in numbers  abilities declared viritim  seriatim that acknowleging the principle that the majority must give the law they would now support the new constitution with their tongues  with their blood if necessary i was much pleased with many  essential parts of this instrument from the beginning but i thought i saw in it many faults great  small what i have read  reflected has brought me over from several of my objections of the first moment and to acquiesce under some others two only remain of essential consideration to wit the want of a bill of rights  the expunging the principle of necessary rotation in the offices of president  senate at first i wished that when   states should have accepted the constitution so as to ensure us what is good in it the other   might hold off till the want of the bill of rights at least might be supplied but i am now convinced that the plan of massachusetts is the best that is to accept and to amend afterwards if the states which were to decide after her should all do the same it is impossible but they must obtain the essential amendments it will be more difficult if we lose this instrument to recover what is good in it than to correct what is  0  bad after we shall have adopted it it has therefore my hearty prayers and i wait with anxiety for news of the votes of maryland s carolina  virginia there is no doubt that genl washington will accept the presidentship tho he is silent on the subject he will not be chosen to the virginia convention a riot has taken place in new york which i will state to you from an eye witness it has long been a practice with the surgeons of that city to steal from the grave bodies recently buried a citizen had lost his wife he went the  st or  d evening after her burial to pay a visit to her grave he found that it had been disturbed and suspected from what quarter he found means to be admitted to the anatomical lecture of that day and on his entering the room saw the body of his wife naked  under dissection he raised the people immediately the body in the mean time was secreted they entered into  searched the houses of the physicians whom they most suspected but found nothing one of them however more guilty or more timid than the rest took asylum in the prison the mob considered this as an acknolegement of guilt they attacked the prison the governor ordered militia to protect the culprit  suppress the mob the militia thinking the mob had just provocation refused to turn out hereupon the people of more reflection thinking it more dangerous that even a guilty person should be punished without the forms of law than that he should escape armed themselves and went to protect the physician they were received by the mob with a volley of stones which wounded several  0  of them they thereupon fired on the mob  killed four by this time they received reinforcement of other citizens  of the militia horse the appearance of which in the critical moment dispersed the mob so ended this chapter of history which i have detailed to you because it may be represented as a political riot when politics had nothing to do with it mr jay  baron steuben were both grievously wounded in the head by stones the former still kept his bed  the latter his room when the packet sailed which was the   th of april    thomas jefferson june         paris mr thomas digges to mr thomas digges j mss paris june         sir —i have duly received your favor of may    as well as that of the person who desires information on the state of cotton manufactures in america and for his interest  safety i beg leave to address to you the answers to his queries without naming him in general it is impossible that manufactures should succeed in america from the high price of labour this is occasioned by the great demand of labour for agriculture a manufacturer going from europe will turn to labour of other kind if he find more to be got by it  he finds some emploiment so profitable that he can soon lay up money enough to buy fifty acres of land to the culture of which he is irresistibly tempted by the independence in which that places him  the desire of having a wife  family around him if any manufactures can succeed there it will  0  be that of cotton i must observe for his information that this plant grows nowhere in the united states northward of the potowmack and not in quantity till you get southward as far as york  james rivers i know nothing of the manufacture which is said to be set up at richmond it must have taken place since      when i left virginia in that state for it is the only one i am enabled to speak of with certainty there is no manufacture of wire or of cotton cards or if any it is not worth notice no manufacture of stockingweaving consequently none for making the machine none of cotton cloths of any kind whatever for sale tho in almost every family some is manufactured for the use of the family which is always good in quality  often tolerably fine in the same way they make excellent knit stockings of cotton weaving it in like manner carried on principally in the family way among the poor the wife weaves generally  the rich either have a weaver among their servants or employ their poor neighbors cotton cost in virginia from   d to   d sterling the pound before the war probably it is a little raised since richmond is as good a place for a manufactory as any in that state  perhaps the best as to its resources for this business cotton clothing is very much the taste of the country a manufacturer on his landing should apply to the well informed farmers and gentlemen of the country their information will be more disinterested than that of merchants and they can better put him into the way of disposing of his workmen in the cheapest manner till he has time to look about him  decide how  where he will   0 establish himself such is the hospitality in that country  their disposition to assist strangers that he may boldly go to any good house he sees and make the inquiry he needs he will be sure to be kindly received honestly informed and accommodated in a hospitable way without any other introduction than an information who he is  what are his views it is not the policy of the government in that country to give any aid to works of any kind they let things take their natural course without help or impediment which is generally the best policy more particularly as to myself i must add that i have not the authority nor the means of assisting any persons in their passage to that country thomas jefferson july         paris nicholas lewis to nicholas lewis j mss paris july         dear sir —your favor of aug  0      came to hand some time ago that of apr         i received last night i had just written to mr eppes on the subject of my affairs and intended writing to you to day the opportune arrival of the last letter enables me to answer both at the same time i am much pleased that you approve of my plan of hiring my estate besides that the profit will be greater it will enable me to see a fixed term to my embarrassments for the same reason i would prefer money to tobacco rents because my engagements for annual paiments must be in money yet if you think the greater assurance of punctual paiments in tobacco overbalances the advantage of a fixed sum in money i     leave it to your discretion one piece of information however i must give you which is that there is no prospect that the european market for tobacco will improve our principal dependence is on this country and the footing on which i have got that article placed here is the best we can ever expect in the leases therefore tobacco of my own estate or of the best warehouses cannot be counted on at more than from  0 to     currency the utmost but i am in hopes my dear sir that more can be obtained per hand than   £ currency which you mention i found my hopes on these considerations i rented to garth  mosley as well as i recollect for £   sterling a hand tobacco then from    to  0 the hundred and the legal exchange    per cent tobacco is now ten per cent higher  legal exchange raised   per cent this entitles us at present to ask £   currency a hand i never knew exactly what garth  mosley made they only told me in general that they had made about a good overseers or stewards lay each suppose this   £ each  calculate it on the number of workers they had and it will prove how much more worth is a working hand with the lands and stock thrown in than without them add to this that there is the addition of hickman  smiths lands in albemarle about  000 acres and that the lands in bedford are much better for tobacco than those of albemarle were when garth  mosley rented them i only mention these considerations to enable you to demonstrate to those who enter into conference on the subject that a higher sum than £   currency may be reasonably asked but not to tie you down     for certainty i had rather rent for £   currency than not to rent at all i think i suggested in my former letters the necessity of stipulating a right to distrain when the rent is not paid it might be a still greater security to stipulate also that their tobaccos shall be delivered at certain warehouses in your name so that you may receive the money from the purchaser when the tenant has failed to pay—i come over to your advice sir to sell my lands in cumberland  goochland and have accordingly desired mr eppes to join you in doing it as to the prices i leave it to your discretions i never had a direct offer for those lands because i never meant to sell them but from overtures made before a shilling of paper money had issued i suppose i could get   00£ for cumberland and the same for elkhill this was before i purchased smiths i have promised to jones three fifths of what these lands shall sell for and even that the bonds shall be given in his name if he will acquit me so far and on condition he will make a final settlement with me on the terms i have promised i shall immediately write to mr mccaul that he shall have the other two fifths as well as two fifths annually of the rents  profits of my estate the other three fifths of these being proposed to jones the check on the tenants against abusing my slaves was by the former lease that i might discontinue it on a reference to arbitrators would it not be well to retain an optional right to sue them for illusage of the slaves or to discontinue it by arbitration whichever you should chuse at the time i will now proceed to take notice of some of the     debts mentioned in your letters as to mr braxtons i still think his memory has led him into error on the subject and that my memorandum books of that date would correct it you mention a considerable debt due to dr walker not enumerated in my list i settled with doctr walker just before i left virginia and gave my acknowledgment of the balance i owed him which was £ 0–  – ¾ this is stated in the list of my debts which i left you  which i presume escaped your notice as i know of no other debt of money to doctr walker unless he should have taken an assignment from somebody be this as it will i know his justice and honour so well that whatever he has demanded is right  i would wish it to be paid of the first money possible if it be no more than the balance i have named with its interest rather than he should be incommoded if you have not the money be so good as to obtain it by drawing a bill on me at  0 days sight which shall be honored my friend mr donald can dispose of this draft for you coutts demand donald scott  co i doubt both i do not even remember the name of such a house as the latter my papers will perhaps throw light on these they were alphabetically arranged so as that any paper may be found in a moment but most of all my memorandum books will shew doctor reads account is noted in my list £  –  –  under the name of colo bannister because you will find among my papers reids account  his order to pay the money to bannister since i left virginia colo bannister is fallen in my debt if therefore he has not relinquished to reid     his claim on me you can get his receipt for the money for which i will credit him in the account of what i have paid for him boden of norfolk £   if this is for phripp  bowden for leather i believe it may be right by possibility but i doubt it hierom gaines for timber work c £   frank gaines owed me a certain number of days work i agreed to take in exchange for it work from his father whom i wished to employ in searching timber searching the lines of my order of council c i think there is no other claim of hieroms against me  of course that his services were to pay a debt before i left monticello i made a point of settling every account i could get at in order to state it in my list of debts where i could not settle the balance accurately still i entered the name in the list i left you as a note that there was something due it is not probable that i could have over looked hierom gaines account  especially for such a sum i have great confidence in hieroms integrity and therefore hope that by the aid of these circumstances you will be able to settle this matter rightly wm chisholm £   this is in my opinion impossible he left my estate in goochland when the british came there he was in such distress afterwards that if i had owed him money it was impossible i should not have raised it for him by some means or other and much more so that i should have omitted it in my list  lost every trace of it in my memory johnson a carpenter thirty odd pounds for work     many years ago i have forgot that ever such a person worked for me but if he did that he has been paid is certain i made a point of paying my workmen in preference to all other claimants i never parted with one without settling with him and giving him either his money or my note every person that ever worked for me can attest this and that i always paid their notes pretty soon i am sure there did not exist one of these notes unpaid when i left virginia except to watson  orr who were still at work for me the debts in bedford to robinson bennett  calloway i suppose have been contracted since i came away in general i will beg of you to refer to my memorandum books they are small books which i used to carry in my pocket they are   or   in number there is an alphabetical index of names to every one so that all the entries respecting any one person may be found in a moment in them they are made with such scrupulous fidelity that i shall not be afraid to justify them on the bed of death and so exact that in the course of    years which they comprehend i never discovered that i had made but one omission of a payment i do not mean to say that the accounts before questioned are not just decisively i have not confidence enough in my memory to say that but they should be examined under several points of view they may be paper money accounts they may have been transferred from some other person who has been paid they may be due from some other person  the demand made on the without foundation they may have been paid by me     either directly or circuitously the silence of my memorandum books as to a money paiment or receipt by me may be relied on as negative proof and their entries of a paiment or receipt as a positive proof of that paiment or entry wherever credits have been transferred circuitously from one to another and accounts discharged in that way i did not always enter them nor even generally but as you know a great deal of business was done in this way it should always be well enquired into as to any accounts presented since i came away  not enumerated in my list my omission there is a presumption that the account has been settled some way tho i do not pretend it to be infallible i only made out as exact a list as i could i am so desirable of proceeding to the hiring of my estate that i would not detain my sawyers to finish my bill of scantling only be so good as to put what stuff is ready into perfect security the bricks also which are ready made i would wish to have well taken care of that i may not have occasion to make any on my return i shall continue to reflect on the debts before observed on and which are mentioned to me for the first time in your letter received last night probably my recollection will enable me to be more particular on their subject in my next letter so that the settlement of them had better be a little delayed if my memorandum books do not satisfy you i shall give orders at havre relative to the bacon whenever it arrives but in future it will not be worth while to send me any because its importation     is prohibited and i have never yet been able to obtain any article of this kind from the custom house i thank mrs lewis kindly for the ears of corn  the seeds accompanying them which are safely come to hand the homony corn is a precious present the corn of this country and of italy as far as i have seen it cannot be eaten either in the form of corn or of bread by any person who has eaten that of america i have planted some grains which may perhaps come to maturity as we have still   months  a half to frost—one word more on my leases i think the term should not exceed three years the negroes too old to be hired could they not make a good profit by cultivating cotton much enquiry is made of me here about the cultivation of cotton  i would thank you to give me your opinion how much a hand would make cultivating that as his principal crop instead of tobacco great george ursula betty hennings not to be hired at all nor martin nor bob otherwise than as they are now i am sensible my dear sir how much trouble  perplexity i am giving you with my affairs the plan of leasing will in a great measure relieve you i know mrs lewiss goodness too  her attentions to them thomas jefferson july         paris dr william gordon to dr william gordon j mss paris july         sir —in your favor of the  th instant you mention that you had written to me in february last this letter never came to hand that of apr        came here during my absence on a journey thro holland  germany and having been obliged to devote the first moments after my return to some very pressing matters this must be my apology for not having been able to write to you till now as soon as i knew that it would be agreeable to you to have such a disposal of your work for translation as i had made for dr ramsay i applied to the same bookseller with propositions on your behalf he told me that he had lost so much by that work that he could hardly think of undertaking another and at any rate not without first seeing  examining it as he was the only bookseller i could induce to give anything on the former occasion i went to no other with my proposals meaning to ask you to send me immediately as much of the work as is printed this you can do by the diligence which comes three times a week from london to paris furnished with this i will renew my propositions and do the best for you i can tho i fear that the ill success of the translation of dr ramsays work and of another work on the subject of america will permit less to be done for you than i had hoped i think dr ramsay failed from the inelegance of the translation  the translators having departed entirely from the doctors instructions i will be obliged to you to set me down as a subscriber for half a dozen copies and to ask mr trumbull no   north street rathbone place to pay you the whole subscription price for me which he will do on showing him this letter these copies can be sent by the diligence i have not yet received the pictures mr trumbull was to     send me nor consequently that of m de la fayette i will take care of it when it arrives his title is simply le marquis de la fayette you ask in your letter of apr    details of my sufferings by colo tarleton i did not suffer by him on the contrary he behaved very genteelly with me on his approach to charlottesville which is within   miles of my house at monticello he despatched a troop of horse under capt mcleod with the double object of taking me prisoner with the two speakers of the senate  delegates who then lodged with me and of remaining there in vedette my house commanding a view of  0 or    counties round about he gave strict orders to capt mcleod to suffer nothing to be injured the troops failed in one of their objects as we had notice so that the two speakers had gone off about two hours before their arrival at monticello  myself with my family about five minutes but capt mcleod preserved everything with sacred care during about    hours that he remained there colo tarleton was just so long at charlottesville being hurried from thence by the news of the rising of the militia and by a sudden fall of rain which threatened to swell the river and intercept his return in general he did little injury to the inhabitants on that short  hasty excursion which was about  0 miles from their main army then in spotsylvania  ours in orange it was early in june      lord cornwallis then proceeded to the point of fork and encamped his army from thence all along the main james river to a seat of mine called elkhill opposite to elk island  a little below the   0 mouth of the byrd creek you will see all these places exactly laid down in the map annexed to my notes on virginia printed by stockdale he remained in this position ten days his own headquarters being in my house at that place i had had time to remove most of the effects out of the house he destroyed all my growing crops of corn  tobacco he burned all my barns containing the same articles of the last year having first taken what he wanted he used as was to be expected all my stocks of cattle sheep  hogs for the sustenance of his army and carried off all the horses capable of service of those too young for service he cut the throats and he burned all the fences on the plantation so as to leave it an absolute waste he carried off also about  0 slaves had this been to give them freedom he would have done right but it was to consign them to inevitable death from the small pox  putrid fever then raging in his camp this i knew afterwards to have been the fate of    of them i never had news of the remaining three but presume they shared the same fate when i say that lord cornwallis did all this i do not mean that he carried about the torch in his own hands but that it was all done under his eye the situation of the house in which he was commanding a view of every part of the plantation so that he must have seen every fire i relate these things on my own knowledge in a great degree as i was on the ground soon after he left it he treated the rest of the neighborhood somewhat in the same stile but not with that spirit of total extermination with which he     seemed to rage over my possessions wherever he went the dwelling houses were plundered of everything that could be carried off lord cornwalliss character in england would forbid the belief that he shared in the plunder but that his table was served with the plate thus pillaged from private houses can be proved by many hundred eye witnesses from an estimate i made at that time on the best information i could collect i supposed the state of virginia lost under ld cornwalliss hands that year about  0000 slaves and that of these about   000 died of the small pox and camp fever and the rest were partly sent to the west indies  exchanged for rum sugar coffee  fruit  partly sent to new york from whence they went at the peace either to nova scotia or england from this last place i believe they have been lately sent to africa history will never relate the horrors committed by the british army in the southern states of america they raged in virginia   months only from the middle of april to the middle of october      when they were all taken prisoners  i give you a faithful specimen of their transactions for  0 days of that time  on one spot only ex pede herculem i suppose their whole devastations during those   months amounted to about three millions sterling the copiousness of this subject has only left me space to assure you of the sentiments of esteem  respect with which i am sir your most obedt humble servt     thomas jefferson july         paris edward rutledge to edward rutledge j mss paris july         my dear sir —   you promise in your letter of octob         to give me in your next at large the conjectures of your philosopher on the descent of the creek indians from the carthaginians supposed to have been separated from hannos fleet during his periplus i shall be very glad to receive them  see nothing impossible in his conjecture i am glad he means to appeal to the similarity of language which i consider as the strongest kind of proof it is possible to adduce i have somewhere read that the language of the ancient carthaginians is still spoken by their descendants inhabiting the mountainous interior parts of barbary to which they were obliged to retire by the conquering arabs if so a vocabulary of their tongue can still be got and if your friend will get one of the creek languages the comparison will decide he probably may have made progress in this business but if he wishes any enquiries to be made on this side the atlantic i offer him my services cheerfully my wish being like his to ascertain the history of the american aborigines i congratulate you on the accession of your state to the new federal constitution this is the last i have yet heard of but i expect daily that my own has followed the good example  suppose it to be already established our government wanted bracing still we must take care not to run from one extreme to another not to brace too high i own i join those in opinion who think a bill of rights necessary     i apprehend too that the total abandonment of the principle of rotation in the offices of president  senator will end in abuse but my confidence is that there will for a long time be virtue  good sense enough in our countrymen to correct abuses we can surely boast of having set the world a beautiful example of a government reformed by reason alone without bloodshed but the world is too far oppressed to profit of the example on this side of the atlantic the blood of the people is become an inheritance and those who fatten on it will not relinquish it easily the struggle in this country is as yet of doubtful issue it is in fact between the monarchy and the parliaments the nation is no otherwise concerned but as both parties may be induced to let go some of its abuses to court the public favor the danger is that the people deceived by a false cry of liberty may be led to take side with one party  thus give the other a pretext for crushing them still more if they can avoid the appeal to arms the nation will be sure to gain much by this controversy but if that appeal is made it will depend entirely on the dispositions of the army whether it issue in liberty or despotism those dispositions are not as yet known in the mean time there is great probability that the war kindled in the east will spread from nation to nation  in the long run become general        thomas jefferson july         paris james madison to james madison  j mss paris july         dear sir —my last letters to you were of the  d    th of may yours from orange of apr    came to hand on the  0th inst my letter to mr jay containing all the public news that is well authenticated i will not repeat it here but add some details in the smaller way which you may be glad to know the disgrace of the marquis de la fayette which at any other period of their history would have had the worst consequences for him will on the contrary mark him favorably to the nation at present during the present administration he can expect nothing but perhaps it may serve him with their successors whenever a change shall take place no change of the principal probably take place before the meeting of the states general though a change is to be wished for his operations do not answer the expectations formed of him these had been calculated on his brilliancy in society he is very feebly aided too montmorin is weak though a most worthy character he is indolent and inattentive too in the extreme luzerne is considerably inferior in abilities to his brother whom you know he is a good man too but so much out of his element that he has the air of one huskanoyed the garde des sceaux is considered as the principals bull dog braving danger like that animal his talents do not pass mediocrity the archbishops brother and the new minister villedeuil and lambert have no will of their own they cannot raise money for the     peace establishment the next year without the states general much less if there be war and their administration will probably end with the states general littlepage who was here as a secret agent for the king of poland rather overreached himself he wanted more money the king furnished it more than once still he wanted more and thought to obtain a high bid by saying he was called for in america and asking leave to go there contrary to his expectation he received leave but he went to warsaw instead of america and from thence to join the russian army i do not know these facts certainly but recollect them by putting several things together the king then sent an ancient secretary here in whom he had much confidence to look out for a correspondent a mere letter writer for him a happy hazard threw mazzei his way he recommended him and he is appointed he has no diplomatic character whatever but is to receive eight thousand livres a year as an intelligencer i hope this employment may have some permanence the danger is that he will overact his part the marquis de la luzerne had been for many years married to his brothers wifes sister secretly she was ugly and deformed but sensible amiable and rather rich when he was named ambassador to london with ten thousand guineas a year the marriage was avowed and he relinquished his cross of malta from which he derived a handsome revenue for life and which was very open to advancement she staid here and not long after died his real affection for her which was great and unfeigned and     perhaps the loss of his order for so shortlived a satisfaction has thrown him almost into a state of despondency he is now here i send you a book of duponts on the subject of the commercial treaty with england tho its general matter may not be interesting yet you will pick up in various parts of it such excellent principles and observations as will richly repay the trouble of reading it i send you also two little pamphlets of the marquis de condorcet wherein is the most judicious statement i have seen of the great questions which agitate this nation at present the new regulations present a preponderance of good over their evil but they suppose that the king can model the constitution at will or in other words that his government is a pure despotism the question then arising is whether a pure despotism in a single head or one which is divided among a king nobles priesthood  numerous magistracy is the least bad i should be puzzled to decide but i hope they will have neither and that they are advancing to a limited moderate government in which the people will have a good share i sincerely rejoice at the acceptance of our new constitution by nine states it is a good canvass on which some strokes only want retouching what these are i think are sufficiently manifested by the general voice from north to south which calls for a bill of rights it seems pretty generally understood that this should go to juries habeas corpus standing armies printing religion  monopolies i conceive there may be difficulty in finding general     modifications of these suited to the habits of all the states but if such cannot be found then it is better to establish trials by jury the right of habeas corpus freedom of press  freedom of religion in all cases and to abolish standing armies in time of peace and monopolies in all cases than not do it in any the few cases wherein these things may do evil cannot be weighed against the multitude wherein the want of them will do evil in disputes between a foreigner  a native a trial by jury may be improper but if this exception cannot be agreed to the remedy will be to model the jury by giving the mediatas linguæ in civil as well as criminal cases why suspend the hab corp in insurrections  rebellions the parties who may be arrested may be charged instantly with a well defined crime of course the judge will remand them if publick safety requires that the government should have a man imprisoned on less probable testimony in those than in other emergencies let him be taken  tried retaken  retried while the necessity continues only giving him redress against the government for damages examine the history of england see how few of the cases of the suspension of the habeas corpus law have been worthy of that suspension they have been either real treasons wherein the parties might as well have been charged at once or sham plots where it was shameful they should ever have been suspected yet for the few cases wherein the suspension of the hab corp has done real good that operation is now become habitual  the minds of the nation almost prepared to live under its     constant suspension a declaration that the federal government will never restrain the presses from printing anything they please will not take away the liability of the printers for false facts printed the declaration that religious faith shall be unpunished does not give impunity to criminal acts dictated by religious error the saying there shall be no monopolies lessens the incitements to ingenuity which spurred on by the hope of a monopoly for a limited time as of    years but the benefit even of limited monopolies is too doubtful to be opposed to that of their general suppression if no check can be found to keep the number of standing troops within safe bounds while they are tolerated as far as necessary abandon them altogether discipline well the militia  guard the magazines with them more than magazine guards will be useless if few  dangerous if many no european nation can ever send against us such a regular army as we need fear  it is hard if our militia are not equal to those of canada or florida my idea then is that tho proper exceptions to these general rules are desirable  probably practicable yet if the exceptions cannot be agreed on the establishment of the rules in all cases will do ill in very few i hope therefore a bill of rights will be formed to guard the people against the federal government as they are already guarded against their state governments in most instances the abandoning the principle of necessary rotation in the senate has i see been disapproved by many in the case of the president by none i readily therefore suppose my opinion     wrong when opposed by the majority as in the former instance  the totality as in the latter in this however i should have done it with more complete satisfaction had we all judged from the same position solicitations which cannot be directly refused oblige me to trouble you often with letters recommending  introducing to you persons who go from hence to america i will beg the favour of you to distinguish the letters wherein i appeal to recommendations from other persons from those which i write on my own knoledge in the former it is never my intention to compromit myself nor you in both instances i must beg you to ascribe the trouble i give you to circumstances which do not leave me at liberty to decline it thomas jefferson sep  0      paris william short to william short j mss paris sept  0      dear sir —the evening of your departure came a letter by the way of london  n york addressed to you and probably from virginia i think you wished your american letters to remain here i shall therefore keep it the passport now enclosed came the day after your departure so also did a mass of american letters for me as low down as august  0 i shall give you their substance—the convention of virginia annexed to their ratification of the new constitution a copy of the state declaration of rights not by way of condition but to announce   0 their attachment to them they added also propositions for specific alterations of the constitution among these was one for rendering the president incapable of serving more than   years in any term of    new york has followed the example of virginia expressing the substance of her bill of rights ie virginias  proposing amendments these last differ much from those of virginia but they concur as to the president only proposing that he shall be incapable of being elected more than twice but i own i should like better than either of these what luther martin tells us was repeatedly voted  adhered to by the federal convention  only altered about    days before their rising when some members had gone off to wit that he should be elected for   years  incapable for ever after but new york has taken another step which gives uneasiness she has written a circular letter to all the legislatures asking their concurrence in an immediate convention for making amendments no news yet from n carolina

balance of interests in congress he was just setting out for kentucké disgusted yet disposed to persuade to an acquiescence tho doubting they would immediately separate from the union the principal obstacle to this he thought would be the indian war—the following is a quotation from a letter from virginia dated july    pendleton tho much impaired in health  in every respect in the decline of life shewed as much zeal to carry the new const as if he had been a young man perhaps more than he discovered in the commencement of the late revolution in his opposition to great britain wythe acted as chairman to the comee of the whole  of course took but little part in the debate but was for the adoption relying on subsequent amendments blair said nothing but was for it the governor exhibited a curious spectacle to view having refused to sign the paper everybody supposed him against it but he afterwards had written a letter  having taken a part which might be called rather vehement than active he was constantly labouring to shew that his present conduct was consistent with that letter  that letter with his refusal to sign madison took the principal     share in the debate for it in which together with the aid i have already mentioned he was somewhat assisted by innes lee marshall corbin  g nicholas mason henry  grayson were the principal supporters of the opposition the discussion as might be expected where the parties were so nearly on a balance was conducted generally with great order propriety  respect of either party to the other the assembly of virginia hurried

tell me where to write to thomas jefferson nov         paris james madison to james madison j mss paris nov         dear sir —my last to you was of the   st july since which i have received yours of july    aug  0     the first part of this long silence in me was occasioned by a knoledge that you were absent from n york the latter part by a want of opportunity which has been longer than usual mr shippen being just arrived here and to set out tomorrow for london i avail myself of that channel of conveyance mr carrington was so kind as to send me the  d vol of the amer phil transactions the federalist and some other interesting pamphlets and i am to thank you for another copy of the federalist and the report of the instrns to the ministers for negotiating peace the latter unluckily omitted exactly the passage i wanted which was what related to the navigation of the mississippi with respect to the federalist the three authors had been named to me i read it with care pleasure  improvement and was satisfied there was nothing in it by one of those     hands  not a great deal by a second it does the highest honor to the third as being in my opinion the best commentary on the principles of government which ever was written in some parts it is discoverable that the author means only to say what may be best said in defence of opinions in which he did not concur but in general it establishes firmly the plan of government i confess it has rectified me in several points as to the bill of rights however i still think it should be added and i am to see that three states have at length considered the perpetual reeligibility of the president as an article which should be amended i should deprecate with you indeed the meeting of a new convention i hope they will adopt the mode of amendment by congress  the assemblies in which case i should not fear any dangerous innovation in the plan but the minorities are too respectable not to be entitled to some sacrifice of opinion in the majority especially when a great proportion of them would be contented with a bill of rights here things internally are going on well the notables now in session have indeed passed one vote which augurs ill to the rights of the people but if they do not obtain now so much as they have a right to they will in the long run the misfortune is that they are not yet ripe for receiving the blessings to which they are entitled i doubt for instance whether the body of the nation if they could be consulted would accept of a habeas corpus law if offered them by the king if the etats generaux when they assemble do not aim at too much they may begin a good constitution     there are three articles which they may easily obtain   their own meeting periodically   the exclusive right of taxation   the right of registering laws  proposing amendments to them as exercised now by the parliaments this last would be readily approved by the courts on account of their hostility against the parliaments  would lead immediately to the origination of laws the  d has been already solemnly avowed by the king and it is well understood there would be no opposition to the first if they push at much more all may fail i shall not enter further into public details because my letter to mr jay will give them that contains a request of permission to return to america the next spring for the summer only the reasons therein urged drawn from my private affairs are very cogent but there is another more cogent on my mind tho of a nature not to be explained in a public letter it is the necessity of attending my daughters myself to their own country and depositing them safely in the hands of those with whom i can safely leave them i have deferred this request as long as circumstances would permit and am in hopes it will meet with no difficulty i have had too many proofs of your friendship not to rely on your patronage of it as in all probability nothing can suffer by a short absence but the immediate permission is what i am anxious about as by going in april  returning in october i shall be sure of pleasant  short passages out  in i must intreat your attention my friend to this matter and that the answers may be sent me thro several channels     mr limozin at havre sent you by mistake a package belonging to somebody else i do not know what it contained but he has written to you on the subject  prayed me to do the same he is likely to suffer if it be not returned supposing that the funding their foreign debt will be among the first operations of the new government i send you two estimates the one by myself the other by a gentleman infinitely better acquainted with the subject shewing what fund will suffice to discharge the principal and interest as it shall become due aided by occasional loans which the same fund will repay i inclose them to you because collating them together and with your own ideas you will be able to devise something better than either but something must be done this government will expect i fancy a very satisfactory provision for the paiment of their debt from the first session of the new congress perhaps in this matter as well as the arrangement of your foreign affairs i may be able when on the spot with you to give some information  suggest some hints which may render my visit to my native country not altogether useless i consider as no small advantage the resuming the tone of mind of my constituents which is lost by long absence and can only be recovered by mixing with them and shall particularly hope for much profit  pleasure by contriving to pass as much time as possible with you should you have a trip to virginia in contemplation for that year i hope you will time it so as that we may be there together i will camp you at monticello where if illy entertained     otherwise you shall not want for books in firm hope of a happy meeting with you in the spring or early in summer i conclude with assurances of the sincere esteem  attachment with which i am dear sir your affectionate friend  servant thomas jefferson dec        paris george washington to george washington j mss paris dec        sir —your favor of aug    came to hand yesterday and a confidential conveiance offering by the way of london i avail myself of it to acknolege the receipt i have seen with infinite pleasure our new constitution accepted by    states not rejected by the   th and that the   th happens to be a state of the least importance it is true that the minorities in most of the accepting states have been very respectable so much so as to render it prudent were it not otherwise reasonable to make some sacrifice to them i am in hopes that the annexation of the bill of rights to the constitution will alone draw over so great a proportion of the minorities as to leave little danger in the opposition of the residue and that this annexation may be made by congress and the assemblies without calling a convention which might endanger the most valuable parts of the system calculation has convinced me that circumstances may arise and probably will arise wherein all the resources of taxation will be necessary for the safety of the state for tho i am decidedly of opinion we should take no part in european quarrels     but cultivate peace and commerce with all yet who can avoid seeing the source of war in the tyranny of those nations who deprive us of the natural right of trading with our neighbors the products of the u s will soon exceed the european demand what is to be done with the surplus when there shall be one it will be employed without question to open by force a market for itself with those placed on the same continent with us and who wish nothing better other causes too are obvious which may involve us in war and war requires every resource of taxation  credit the power of making war often prevents it and in our case would give efficacy to our desire of peace if the new government wears the front which i hope it will i see no impossibility in the availing ourselves of the wars of others to open the other parts of america to our commerce as the price of our neutrality    your communications to the count de moustier whatever they may have been cannot have done injury to my endeavors here to open the w indies to us on this head the ministers are invincibly mute tho i have often tried to draw them into the subject i have therefore found it necessary to let it lie till war or other circumstance may force it on whenever they are in war with england they must open the islands to us and perhaps during that war they may see some price which might make them agree to keep them always open in the meantime i have laid my shoulder to the opening the markets of this country to our produce and rendering its transportation a nursery for our seamen a maritime     force is the only one by which we can act on europe our navigation law if it be wise to have any should be the reverse of that of england instead of confining importations to homebottoms or those of the producing nations i think we should confine exportations to home bottoms or to those of nations having treaties with us our exportations are heavy and would nourish a great force of our own or be a tempting price to the nation to whom we should offer a participation of it in exchange for free access to all their possessions this is an object to which our government alone is adequate in the gross but i have ventured to pursue it here so far as the consumption of productions by this country extends thus in our arrangements relative to tobacco none can be received here but in french or american bottoms this is emploiment for nearly  000 seamen and puts nearly that number of british out of employ by the arret of dec      it was provided that our whale oils should not be received here but in french or american bottoms and by later regulations all oils but those of france and america are excluded this will put  00 english whale vessels immediately out of employ and   0 ere long and call so many of french  american into service we have had  000 seamen formerly in this business the whole of whom we have been likely to lose the consumption of rice is growing fast in this country and that of carolina gaining ground on every other kind i am of opinion the whole of the carolina rice can be consumed here its transportation employs   00 sailors almost all   0 of them english at present the rice being deposited at cowes  brought from thence here it would be dangerous to confine this transportation to french  american bottoms the ensuing year because they will be much engrossed by the transportation of wheat  flour hither and the crop of rice might lie on hand for want of vessels but i see no objections to the extensions of our principle to this article also beginning with the year    0 however before there is a necessity of deciding on this i hope to be able to consult our new government in person as i have asked of congress a leave of absence for   months that is to say from april to november next it is necessary for me to pay a short visit to my native country first to reconduct my family thither and place them in the hands of their friends  secondly to place my private affairs under certain arrangements when i left my own house i expected to be absent but   months  i have been led by events to an absence of   years i shall hope therefore for the pleasure of personal conferences with your excellency on the subject of this letter and others interesting to our country of getting my own ideas set to rights by a communication of yours and of taking again the tone of sentiment of my own country which we lose in some degree after a certain absence you know doubtless of the death of the marquise de chastellux the marquis de la fayette is out of favor with the court but high in favor with the nation i once feared for his personal liberty but i hope he is on safe ground at present on the subject of the whale fishery i     inclose you some observations i drew up for the ministry here in order to obtain a correction of their arret of sepr last whereby they had involved our oils with the english in a general exclusion from their ports they will accordingly correct this so that our oils will participate with theirs in the monopoly of their markets there are several things incidentally introduced which do not seem pertinent to the general question they were rendered necessary by particular circumstances the explanation of which would add to a letter already too long i will trespass no further then than to assure you of the sentiments of sincere attachment and respect with which i have the honor to be your excellencys most obedt humble servant p s the observations inclosed tho printed have been put into confidential hands only thomas jefferson january      john jay to john jay  january      dear sir —    as the character of the prince of wales is becoming interesting i have endeavored to learn what it truly is this is less difficult in his case than it is in other persons of rank because he has taken no pains to hide himself from the world the information i most rely on is from a person here with whom i am intimate who divides his time between paris and london—an englishman by birth of truth sagacity and science he is of a circle when in london which has had good opportunities of knowing the prince but he has also     himself had special occasions of verifying their information by his own personal observations he happened when last in london to be invited to a dinner of three persons the prince came by chance and made the fourth he ate half a leg of mutton and did not taste of small dishes because small drank champagne and burgundy as small beer during dinner and bourdeaux after dinner as the rest of the company upon the whole he ate as much as the other three and drank about two bottles of wine without seeming to feel it my informant sat next him and being until then unknown to the prince personally though not by character and lately from france the prince confined his conversation to him almost entirely observing to the prince that he spoke french without the slightest foreign accent the prince told him that when very young his father had put only french servants about him and it was to that circumstance he owed his pronunciation he led him from this to give an account of his education the total of which was the learning a little latin he has not a single element of mathematics of natural or moral philosophy or any other science on earth nor has the society he has kept been such as to supply the void of education it has been that of the lowest the most illiterate and profligate persons of the kingdom without choice of rank or mind and with whom the subjects of conversation are only horses drinkingmatches bawdyhouses and in terms the most vulgar the young nobility who begin by associating with him soon leave him     disgusted by the insupportable profligacy of his society and mr fox who has been supposed his favorite and not overnice in the choice of company would never keep his company habitually in fact he never associated with a man of sense he has not a single idea of justice morality religion or of the rights of men or any anxiety for the opinion of the world he carries that indifference for fame so far that he probably would not be hurt if he were to lose his throne provided he could be assured of having always meat horses and women in the article of women nevertheless he has become more correct since his connection with mrs fitzherbert who is an honest and worthy woman he is even less crapulous than he was he had a fine person but it is becoming coarse he possesses good native common sense is affable polite and very goodhumored—saying to my informant on another occasion your friend such a one dined with me yesterday and i made him damned drunk he replied i am sorry for it i had heard that your royal highness had left off drinking the prince laughed tapped him on the shoulder very goodnaturedly without saying a word or ever after showing any displeasure the duke of york who was for some time cried up as the prodigy of the family is as profligate and of less understanding to these particular traits from a man of sense and truth it would be superfluous to add the general terms of praise or blame in which he is spoken of by other persons in whose impartiality and penetration i have less confidence     a sample is better than a description for the peace of europe it is best that the king should give such gleanings of recovery as would prevent the regent or his ministry from thinking themselves firm and yet that he should not recover    thomas jefferson jan         paris james madison to james madison j mss paris jan         dear sir —my last to you was of the   th of nov since which i have received yours of sep    and oct   with the pamphlet on the mohicon language for which receive my thanks i endeavor to collect all the vocabularies i can of the american indians as of those of asia persuaded that if they ever had a common parentage it will appear in their languages i was pleased to see the vote of congress of sep    on the subject of the mississippi as i had before seen with great uneasiness the pursuits of other principles which i could never reconcile to my own ideas of probity or wisdom and from which and my knolege of the character of our western settlers i saw that the loss of that country was a necessary consequence i wish this return to true policy may be in time to prevent evil there has been little foundation for the reports and fears relative to the m de la fayette he has from the beginning taken openly part with those who demand a constitution and there was a moment that we apprehended the bastile but they venture on nothing more than to take from him a temporary service on     which he had been ordered and this more to save appearances for their own authority than anything else for at the very time they pretended that they had put him into disgrace they were constantly conferring  communicating with him since this he has stood on safe ground and is viewed as among the foremost of the patriots everybody here is trying their hand at forming declarations of rights as something of that kind is going on with you also i send you two specimens from hence the one is by our friend of whom i have just spoken you will see that it contains the essential principle of ours accommodated as much as could be to the actual state of things here the other is from a very sensible man a pure theorist of the sect called the œconomists of which turgot was considered as the head the former is adapted to the existing abuses the latter goes to those possible as well as to those existing with respect to doctr spence supposed to have been taken by the algerines i think the report extremely improbable obryan one of our captives there has constantly written to me and given me information on every subject he thought interesting he could not have failed to know if such a capture had been made tho before his time nor to inform me of it i am under perpetual anxiety for our captives there the money indeed is not yet ready at amsterdam but when it shall be there are no orders from the board of treasury to the bankers to furnish what may be necessary for the redemption of the captives and it is so long since congress approved the loan that the orders of     the treasury for the application of the money would have come if they had intended to send any i wrote to them early on the subject  pointedly i mentioned it to mr jay also merely that he might suggest it to them the paiments to the foreign officers will await the same formality i thank you for your attention to the case of mrs burke—we have no news of dr franklin since july last when he was very ill tho the silence of our letters on that subject is a proof that he is well yet there is an anxiety here among his friends we have lately had three books published which are of great merit in different lines the one is in   vols  vo by an abbé barthelemy wherein he has collected every subject of grecian literature after a labour of  0 years it is called les voyages danacharsis i have taken a copy for you because the whole impression was likely to be run off at once the second is a work on government by the marquis de condorcet   v  vo i shall secure you a copy the  d are the works of the k of prussia in    vols  vo these were a little garbled at berlin before printed the government lais its hands on all which come here and change some leaves there is a genuine edition published at basle where even the garblings of berlin are reestablished i doubt the possibility of getting a copy so vigilant is the government as to this work i shall obtain you one if it be possible as i write all the public news to mr jay i will not repeat it to you i have just received the flora caroliniana of walter a very learned and good work     thomas jefferson jan         paris dr edward bancroft to dr edward bancroft j mss paris jan         dear sir —i have deferred answering your letter on the subject of slaves because you permitted me to do it till a moment of leisure and that moment rarely comes and because too i could not answer you with such a degree of certainty as to merit any notice i do not recollect the conversation at vincennes to which you allude but can repeat still on the same ground on which i must have done then that as far as i can judge from the experiments which have been made to give liberty to or rather to abandon persons whose habits have been formed in slavery is like abandoning children many quakers in virginia seated their slaves on their lands as tenants they were distant from me and therefore i cannot be particular in the details because i never had very particular information i cannot say whether they were to pay a rent in money or a share of the produce but i remember that the landlord was obliged to plan their crops for them to direct all their operations during every season  according to the weather but what is more afflicting he was obliged to watch them daily  almost constantly to make them work  even to whip them a mans moral sense must be unusually strong if slavery does not make him a thief he who is permitted by law to have no property of his own can with difficulty conceive that property is founded in anything but force these slaves chose to steal from their neighbors rather than work they became public nuisances and in most instances were reduced to     slavery again but i will beg of you to make no use of this imperfect information unless in common conversation i shall go to america in the spring  return in the fall during my stay in virginia i shall be in the neighborhood where many of these trials were made i will inform myself very particularly of them  communicate the information to you besides these there is an instance since i came away of a young man mr mayo who died and gave freedom to all his slaves about  00 this is about   years ago i shall know how they have turned out notwithstanding the discouraging result of these experiments i am decided on my final return to america to try this one i shall endeavor to import as many germans as i have grown slaves i will settle them and my slaves on farms of  0 acres each intermingled and place all on the footing of the metayers medietani of europe their children shall be brought up as others are in habits of property and foresight  i have no doubt but that they will be good citizens some of their fathers will be so others i suppose will need government with these all that can be done is to oblige them to labour as the labouring poor of europe do and to apply to their comfortable subsistence the produce of their labour retaining such a moderate portion of it as may be a just equivalent for the use of the lands they labour and the stocks  other necessary advances a word now on mr paradises affairs you were informed at the time of the arrangement they had established in their affairs to wit reserving  00 £ a     year for their subsistence abandoning the rest of their income about  00 £ more all their credits one of which is  00 £ from an individual and another is  000 £ from the state and the cutting of a valuable wood to their creditors their whole debts amounting but to   00 £ the term of paiment cannot be long if this arrangement can be preserved i had hope that the journey to italy would have fixed mrs paradise with her daughter and left him free to travel or tarry where he liked best but this journey has been a burthen instead of a relief to their affairs in fact it is evident to me that the society of england is necessary for the happiness of mrs paradise and is perhaps the most agreeable to mr paradise also it is become an object therefore to obtain the concurrence of their creditors in the arrangements taken the inducement to be proposed to them is mrs paradises joining in a deed in which these dispositions shall be stipulated which by the laws of virginia will bind her property there so that the creditors will be secured of their debts in the event of mr paradises death the inducement to mr  mrs paradise is that their persons  property shall be free from molestation  their substance not consumed at law we suppose that the creditors will name one trustee  mr paradise another yourself fully  solely authorized to receive all remittances from america to pay to them first their subsistence money  the rest to the creditors till they are fully paid mrs paradise will set out in a few days for london to set her hand to this accommodation in the mean time they hope you will   0 prepare the ground by negociating the settlement with the creditors as far as i have any influence with mr or mrs paradise i have used it  shall use it for the joint interests of their creditors  themselves for i view it as clearly their interest to reduce themselves to as moderate an expense as possible till their debts are paid if this can be effected before my departure in april i will not only aid it here but have any thing done which may be necessary in virginia when i go there such as the recording the deed c this journey of mrs paradise will also be an experiment whether their distresses will not be lighter when separate than while together—i shall always be glad to hear from you

are federalists except those of virga so that a majority of federalists are secured in the senate and expected in the h of representatives genl washington will be president and probably mr adams vice president so that the constitution will be put under way by those who will give it a fair trial it does not seem probable that the attempt of n york to have another convention to make amendments will succeed tho virginia concurs in it it is tolerably certain that congress will propose amendments to the assemblies as even the friends of the constitution are willing to make amendments some from a conviction they are necessary others from a spirit of conciliation the addition of a bill of rights will probably be the most essential change a vast majority of antifederalists have got into the assembly of virginia so that mr henry is omnipotent there mr madison was left out as a senator by   or   votes and henry has so modelled the districts for representatives as to tack orange to counties where he himself has great influence that madison may not be elected in the lower federal house which was the place madison had wished to serve in  not the senate henry pronounced a philippic against madison in open assembly madison being then at philadelphia mifflin is presidt of pennsylvania and peters speaker colo howard is govr of maryland beverly randolph govr of virginia this last is said by

mss paris mar        dear sir —my last to you was of the   th of december tho the establishment of packet boats with you and suppression of them with us puts it in your power perhaps to give me better details of american affairs than i can you i shall nevertheless continue to communicate to you what i know persuaded     it is better you should hear a thing twice than not hear it at all i mentioned to you in my last that the convention of virginia had proposed to congress the method of amending by congress  the assemblies since that the assembly of that state a much more antifederal body has proposed the other method of amendment by a federal convention but this will not take the elections for the new congress are almost universally federal which proves the people in general to be so the

a day for another convention but a very distant one it is the antifederalism of virginia which levens the mass rhode island has again refused to call a convention genl washington tho with vast reluctance will undertake the presidency if called to it  there was no doubt he would be so called the only candidates for the vice presidency with their own consent are mr hancock and mr j adams the latter it was thought would be chosen the friends     of the new constitution agree pretty generally to add a declaration of rights to it and the opposition becomes daily weaker so that the government confided generally to friendly hands and gaining on the esteem of the nation begins this very day under the most auspicious appearances the revolution in this country seems to be going on well in burgundy  franche compté indeed there is great stubbornness in the privileged orders and in bretagne they have proceeded to blows which however are stopped for the present in the west of the kingdom it seems as if the rights of the tiers etat would be acknoleged and by a majority of the nobles the circumstance from which i fear the worst is that the states general are too numerous i see great difficulty in preventing   00 people from becoming a mob should confusion be prevented from this circumstance i suppose the states general with the consent of the king will establish some of the leading features of a good constitution they have indeed a miserable old canvas to work on covered with daubings which it will be difficult to efface but some they will efface  some soften so as to make a tolerable thing of it perhaps a good one the war in the north is likely to spread  the king of england seems recovering his senses but time will be requisite to shew whether it be a lucid interval only whether it be permanent or whether it be anything more than a recovery from insanity to imbecility which is the most ordinary case in either event time is necessary to give such confidence in his state of mind as that his ministers may venture to     take a part in the war and that time will suffice to enable this nation to arrange its internal affairs so solidly as to put them more in condition than ever they were at any period of their history to act the part they may chuse in foreign affairs how happy is it for us that we are beyond the reach of those storms which are eternally desolating europe we have indeed a neighbor with whom misunderstandings are possible but they must be the effect of interests ill calculated nothing is more demonstrable than is the unity of their  our interest for ages to come i have had a letter from admiral paul jones dated st petersburgh jan    he was well and just arrived there on the call of the empress he has commanded on the black sea during the last campaign but does not know where he is to act the ensuing one—my last accounts from lediard another bold countryman of ours were from grand cairo he was just then plunging into the unknown regions of africa probably never to emerge again if he returns he has promised me to go to america and penetrate from kentucke to the western side of the continent i do not know whether you are informed that in the years     –     he went from here bound for kamschatka to cross over thence to the western coast of our continent  pass through to the eastern one he was arrested par ordre superieure within two or three days journey of kamschatka conveyed back to the confines of poland  there turned adrift he arrived here last june  immediately set out for africa i received some time ago a very interesting     history del luxo de españa and the charming poems of m yriarte tho they have not been mentioned in any of your letters i presume it is you i am to thank for them which i do very cordially i know nothing since my last more precise on the time of my departure but i think it would be better you should address no letters to me at this place which may arrive between the middle of april  november mr short will transact the business of the legation during my absence as i expect thomas jefferson mar         paris francis hopkinson to francis hopkinson j mss paris mar         dear sir —    you say that i have been dished up to you as an antifederalist and ask me if it be just my opinion was never worthy enough of notice to merit citing but since you ask it i will tell it you i am not a federalist because i never submitted the whole system of my opinions to the creed of any party of men whatever in religion in philosophy in politics or in anything else where i was capable of thinking for myself such an addiction is the last degradation of a free and moral agent if i could not go to heaven but with a party i would not go there at all therefore i protest to you i am not of the party of federalists but i am much farther from that of the antifederalists i approved from the first moment of the great mass of what is in the new constitution the consolidation of the government the organization into executive legislative      judiciary the subdivision of the legislative the happy compromise of interests between the great  little states by the different manner of voting in the different houses the voting by persons instead of states the qualified negative on laws given to the executive which however i should have liked better if associated with the judiciary also as in new york and the power of taxation i thought at first that the latter might have been limited a little reflection soon convinced me it ought not to be what i disapproved from the first moment also was the want of a bill of rights to guard liberty against the legislative as well as executive branches of the government that is to say to secure freedom in religion freedom of the press freedom from monopolies freedom from unlawful imprisonment freedom from a permanent military and a trial by jury in all cases determinable by the laws of the land i disapproved also the perpetual reeligibility of the president to these points of disapprobation i adhere my first wish was that the   first conventions might accept the constitution as the means of securing to us the great mass of good it contained and that the   last might reject it as the means of obtaining amendments but i was corrected in this wish the moment i saw the much better plan of massachusetts and which had never occurred to me with respect to the declaration of rights i suppose the majority of the united states are of my opinion for i apprehend all the antifederalists and a very respectable proportion of the federalists think that such a declaration should now be annexed the enlightened part of europe have     given us the greatest credit for inventing this instrument of security for the rights of the people and have been not a little surprised to see us so soon give it up with respect to the reeligibility of the president i find myself differing from the majority of my countrymen for i think there are but three states out of the    which have desired an alteration of this and indeed since the thing is established i would wish it not to be altered during the life of our great leader whose executive talents are superior to those i believe of any man in the world and who alone by the authority of his name and the confidence reposed in his perfect integrity is fully qualified to put the new government so under way as to secure it against the efforts of opposition but having derived from our error all the good there was in it i hope we shall correct it the moment we can no longer have the same name at the helm these my dear friend are my sentiments by which you will see i was right in saying i am neither federalist nor antifederalist that i am of neither party nor yet a trimmer between parties these my opinions i wrote within a few hours after i had read the constitution to one or two friends in america i had not then read one single word printed on the subject i never had an opinion in politics or religion which i was afraid to own a costive reserve on these subjects might have procured me more esteem from some people but less from myself my great wish is to go on in a strict but silent performance of my duty to avoid attracting notice  to keep my name out of newspapers because i find the pain of a little     censure even when it is unfounded is more acute than the pleasure of much praise the attaching circumstance of my present office is that i can do its duties unseen by those for whom they are done—you did not think by so short a phrase in your letter to have drawn on yourself such an egotistical dissertation thomas jefferson march   th      paris madame de brehan to madame de brehan  paris march   th      dear madam —i had the honor of writing to you on the   th of february soon after which i had that of receiving your favor of december the   th i have a thousand questions to ask you about your journey to the indian treaty how you like their persons their manners their customs cuisine etc but this i must defer until i can do it personally in new york where i hope to see you for a moment in the summer and to take your commands for france i have little to communicate to you from this place it is deserted everybody being gone into the country to choose or to be chosen deputies to the states general i hope to see that great meeting before my departure it is to be on the   th of next month a great political revolution will take place in your country and that without bloodshed a king with two hundred thousand men at his orders is disarmed by force of public opinion and want of money among the economies becoming necessary perhaps one may be the opera they say it has cost the public treasury   0 a hundred thousand crown in the last year a new theatre is established since your departure—that of the opera buffons where italian operas are given and good music paris is every day enlarging and beautifying i do not count among its beauties however the wall with which they have inclosed us they have made some amends for this by making fine boulevards within and without the walls these are in considerable forwardness and will afford beautiful rides around the city of between fifteen and twenty miles in circuit we have had such a winter madame as makes me shiver yet whenever i think of it all communications almost were cut off dinners and suppers were suppressed and the money laid out in feeding and warming the poor whose labors were suspended by the rigors of the season loaded carriages passed the seine on the ice and it was covered with thousands of people from morning to night skating and sliding such sights were never seen before and they continued two months we have nothing new and excellent in your charming art of painting in fact i do not feel an interest in any pencil but that of david but i must not hazard details on a subject wherein i am so ignorant and you are such a connoisseur adieu my dear madam permit me always the honor of esteeming and being esteemed by you and of tendering you the homage of that respectful attachment with which i am and ever shall be dear madam your most obedient humble servant     thomas jefferson mar         paris james madison to james madison j mss paris mar         dear sir —i wrote you last on the   th of jan since which i have received yours of octob    dec       that of oct    came to hand only feb    how it happened to be four months on the way i cannot tell as i never knew by what hand it came looking over my letter of jan   th i remark an error of the word probable instead of improbable which doubtless however you had been able to correct your thoughts on the subject of the declaration of rights in the letter of oct    i have weighed with great satisfaction some of them had not occurred to me before but were acknoleged just in the moment they were presented to my mind in the arguments in favor of a declaration of rights you omit one which has great weight with me the legal check which it puts into the hands of the judiciary this is a body which if rendered independent  kept strictly to their own department merits great confidence for their learning  integrity in fact what degree of confidence would be too much for a body composed of such men as wythe blair  pendleton on characters like these the civium ardor prava jubentium would make no impression i am happy to find that on the whole you are a friend to this amendment the declaration of rights is like all other human blessings alloyed with some inconveniences and not accomplishing fully its object but the good in this instance vastly overweighs the evil i cannot refrain from making short answers to the objections which your letter states to have     been raised   that the rights in question are reserved by the manner in which the federal powers are granted answer a constitutive act may certainly be so formed as to need no declaration of rights the act itself has the force of a declaration as far as it goes and if it goes to all material points nothing more is wanting in the draught of a constitution which i had once a thought of proposing in virginia  printed afterwards i endeavored to reach all the great objects of public liberty and did not mean to add a declaration of rights probably the object was imperfectly executed but the deficiencies would have been supplied by others in the course of discussion but in a constitutive act which leaves some precious articles unnoticed and raises implications against others a declaration of rights becomes necessary by way of supplement this is the case of our new federal constitution this instrument forms us into one state as to certain objects and gives us a legislative  executive body for these objects it should therefore guard us against their abuses of power within the field submitted to them   a positive declaration of some essential rights could not be obtained in the requisite latitude answer half a loaf is better than no bread if we cannot secure all our rights let us secure what we can   the limited powers of the federal government  jealousy of the subordinate governments afford a security which exists in no other instance answer the first member of this seems resolvable into the first objection before stated the jealousy of the subordinate governments     is a precious reliance but observe that those governments are only agents they must have principles furnished them whereon to found their opposition the declaration of rights will be the text whereby they will try all the acts of the federal government in this view it is necessary to the federal government also as by the same text they may try the opposition of the subordinate governments   experience proves the inefficacy of a bill of rights true but tho it is not absolutely efficacious under all circumstances it is of great potency always and rarely inefficacious a brace the more will often keep up the building which would have fallen with that brace the less there is a remarkable difference between the characters of the inconveniences which attend a declaration of rights  those which attend the want of it the inconveniences of the declaration are that it may cramp government in its useful exertions but the evil of this is shortlived trivial  reparable the inconveniences of the want of a declaration are permanent afflicting  irreparable they are in constant progression from bad to worse the executive in our governments is not the sole it is scarcely the principal object of my jealousy the tyranny of the legislatures is the most formidable dread at present and will be for long years that of the executive will come in its turn but it will be at a remote period i know there are some among us who would now establish a monarchy but they are inconsiderable in number and weight of character the rising race are all republicans we were educated in royalism     no wonder if some of us retain that idolatry still our young people are educated in republicanism an apostasy from that to royalism is unprecedented  impossible i am much pleased with the prospect that a declaration of rights will be added and hope it will be done in that way which will not endanger the whole frame of the government or any essential part of it i have hitherto avoided public news in my letters to you because your situation insured you a communication of my letters to mr jay this circumstance being changed i shall in future indulge myself in these details to you there had been some slight hopes that an accommodation might be affected between the turks  two empires but these hopes do not strengthen and the season is approaching which will put an end to them for another campaign at least the accident to the king of england has had great influence on the affairs of europe his mediation joined with that of prussia would certainly have kept denmark quiet and so have left the two empires in the hands of the turks  swedes but the inactivity to which england is reduced leaves denmark more free and she will probably go on in opposition to sweden the k of prussia too had advanced so far that he can scarcely retire this is rendered the more difficult by the troubles he has excited in poland he cannot well abandon the party he had brought forward there so that it is very possible he may be engaged in the ensuing campaign france will be quiet this year because this year at least is necessary for     settling her future constitution the states will meet the   th of april and the public mind will i think by that time be ripe for a just decision of the question whether they shall vote by orders or persons i think there is a majority of the nobles already for the latter if so their affairs cannot but go on well besides settling for themselves a tolerably free constitution perhaps as free a one as the nation is yet prepared to bear they will fund their public debts this will give them such a credit as will enable them to borrow any money they may want  of course to take the field again when they think proper and i believe they mean to take the field as soon as they can the pride of every individual in the nation suffers under the ignominies they have lately been exposed to and i think the states general will give money for a war to wipe off the reproach there have arisen new bickerings between this court  the hague and the papers which have passed shew the most bitter acrimony rankling at the heart of this ministry they have recalled their ambassador from the hague without appointing a successor they have given a note to the diet of poland which shews a disapprobation of their measures the insanity of the king of england has been fortunate for them as it gives them time to put their house in order the english papers tell you the king is well and even the english ministry say so they will naturally set the best foot foremost and they guard his person so well that it is difficult for the public to contradict them the king is probably better but not well by a great deal       he has been bled and judicious physicians say that in his exhausted state nothing could have induced a recurrence to bleeding but symptoms of relapse   the prince of wales tells the irish deputation he will give them a definitive answer in some days but if the king had been well he could have given it at once   they talk of passing a standing law for providing a regency in similar cases they apprehend then they are not yet clear of the danger of wanting a regency   they have carried the king to church but it was his private chapel if he be well why do not they shew him publicly to the nation  raise them from that consternation into which they have been thrown by the prospect of being delivered over to the profligate hands of the prince of wales in short judging from little facts which are known in spite of their teeth the king is better but not well possibly he is getting well but still time will be wanting to satisfy even the ministry that it is not merely a lucid interval consequently they cannot interrupt france this year in the settlement of her affairs  after this year it will be too late as you will be in a situation to know when the leave of absence will be granted me which i have asked will you be so good as to communicate it by a line to mr lewis  mr eppes i hope to see you in the summer and that if you are not otherwise engaged you will encamp with me at monticello for awhile     thomas jefferson mar         paris david humphreys to david humphreys j mss paris mar         dear sir —your favor of nov         came to hand the last month how it happened that mine of aug      was fourteen months on its way is inconceivable i do not recollect by what conveyance i sent it i had concluded however either that it had miscarried or that you had become indolent as most of our countrymen are in matters of correspondence the change in this country since you left it is such as you can form no idea of the frivolities of conversation have given way entirely to politics men women  children talk nothing else and all you know talk a great deal the press groans with daily productions which in point of boldness make an englishman stare who hitherto has thought himself the boldest of men a complete revolution in this government has within the space of two years for it began with the notables of      been effected merely by the force of public opinion aided indeed by the want of money which the dissipations of the court had brought on and this revolution has not cost a single life unless we charge to it a little riot lately in bretagne which began about the price of bread became afterwards political and ended in the loss of   or   lives the assembly of the states general begins the   th of april the representation of the people will be perfect but they will be alloyed by an equal number of nobility  clergy the first great question they will have to decide will be whether they shall vote by orders or persons  i have hopes that the majority of the nobles are     already disposed to join the tiers etat in deciding that the vote shall be by persons this is the opinion à la mode at present and mode has acted a wonderful part in the present instance all the handsome young women for example are for the tiers etat and this is an army more powerful in france than the  00000 men of the king add to this that the court itself is for the tiers etat as the only agent which can relieve their wants not by giving money themselves they are squeezed to the last drop but by pressing it from the noncontributing orders the king stands engaged to pretend no more to the power of laying continuing or appropriating taxes to call the states general periodically to submit lettres de cachet to legal restrictions to consent to freedom of the press and that all this shall be fixed by a fundamental constitution which shall bind his successors he has not offered a participation in the legislature but it will surely be insisted on the public mind is so ripened on all these subjects that there seems to be now but one opinion the clergy indeed think separately  the old men among the nobles but their voice is suppressed by the general one of the nation the writings published on this occasion are some of them very valuable because unfettered by the prejudices under which the english labour they give a full scope to reason and strike out truths as yet unperceived  unacknoleged on the other side the channel an englishman dosing under a kind of half reformation is not excited to think by such gross absurdities as stare a frenchman in the face wherever he looks whether it be towards the throne     or the altar in fine i believe this nation will in the course of the present year have as full a portion of liberty dealt out to them as the nation can bear at present considering how uninformed the mass of their people is this circumstance will prevent their immediate establishment of the trial by jury the palsied state of the executive in england is a fortunate circumstance for france as it will give them time to arrange their affairs internally the consolidation  funding their debts will give them a credit which will enable them to do what they please for the present year the war will be confined to the two empires  denmark against turkey  sweden it is not yet evident whether prussia will be engaged if the disturbances of poland break out into overt acts it will be a power divided in itself  so of no weight perhaps by the next year england  france may be ready to take the field it will depend on the former principally for the latter tho she may be then able must wish still a little time to see her new arrangements well under way the english papers  english ministry say the king is well he is better but not well no malady requires a longer time to ensure against its return than insanity time alone can distinguish accidental insanity from habitual lunacy the operations which have taken place in america lately fill me with pleasure in the first place they realize the confidence i had that whenever our affairs go obviously wrong the good sense of the people will interpose and set them to rights the example of changing a constitution by assembling the wise men   0 of the state instead of assembling armies will be worth as much to the world as the former examples we had given them the constitution too which was the result of our deliberations is unquestionably the wisest ever yet presented to men and some of the accommodations of interest which it has adopted are greatly pleasing to me who have before had occasions of seeing how difficult those interests were to accommodate a general concurrence of opinion seems to authorize us to say it has some defects i am one of those who think it a defect that the important rights not placed in security by the frame of the constitution itself were not explicitly secured by a supplementary declaration there are rights which it is useless to surrender to the government and which governments have yet always been fond to invade these are the rights of thinking and publishing our thoughts by speaking or writing the right of free commerce the right of personal freedom there are instruments for administering the government so peculiarly trustworthy that we should never leave the legislature at liberty to change them the new constitution has secured these in the executive  legislative departments but not in the judiciary it should have established trials by the people themselves that is to say by jury there are instruments so dangerous to the rights of the nation and which place them so totally at the mercy of their governors that those governors whether legislative or executive should be restrained from keeping such instruments on foot but in welldefined cases such an instrument is a standing army we are now allowed     to say such a declaration of rights as a supplement to the constitution where that is silent is wanting to secure us in these points the general voice has legitimated this objection it has not however authorized me to consider as a real defect what i thought and still think one the perpetual reeligibility of the president but three states out of    having declared against this we must suppose we are wrong according to the fundamental law of every society the lex majoris partis to which we are bound to submit and should the majority change their opinion  become sensible that this trait in their constitution is wrong i would wish it to remain uncorrected as long as we can avail ourselves of the services of our great leader whose talents and whose weight of character i consider as peculiarly necessary to get the government so under way as that it may afterwards be carried on by subordinate characters i must give you sincere thanks for the details of small news contained in your letter you know how precious that kind of information is to a person absent from his country and how difficult it is to be procured i hope to receive soon permission to visit america this summer and to possess myself anew by conversation with my countrymen of their spirits  their ideas i know only the americans of the year      they tell me this is to be much a stranger to those of      this renewal of acquaintance is no indifferent matter to one acting at such a distance as that instructions cannot be received hot and hot one of my pleasures too will be that of talking over the old  new with you     thomas jefferson may        paris marquis de la fayette to the marquis de la fayette j mss paris may        my dear friend —as it becomes more  more possible that the noblesse will go wrong i become uneasy for you your principles are decidedly with the tiers etat and your instructions against them a complaisance to the latter on some occasions and an adherence to the former on others may give an appearance of trimming between the two parties which may lose you both you will in the end go over wholly to the tiers etat because it will be impossible for you to live in a constant sacrifice of your own sentiments to the prejudices of the noblesse but you would be received by the tiers etat at any future day coldly and without confidence it appears to me the moment to take at once that honest and manly stand with them which your own principles dictate this will win their hearts forever be approved by the world which marks and honours you as the man of the people and will be an eternal consolation to yourself the noblesse  especially the noblesse of auvergne will always prefer men who will do their dirty work for them you are not made for that they will therefore soon drop you and the people in that case will perhaps not take you up suppose a scission should take place the priests and nobles will secede the nation will remain in place and with the king will do its own business if violence should be attempted where will you be you cannot then take side with the people in opposition to your own vote that very vote which will have helped to produce the scission still less     can you array yourself against the people that is impossible your instructions are indeed a difficulty but to state this at its worst it is only a single difficulty which a single effort surmounts your instructions can never embarass you a second time whereas an acquiescence under them will reproduce greater difficulties every day  without end besides a thousand circumstances offer as many justifications of your departure from your instructions will it be impossible to persuade all parties that as for good legislation two houses are necessary the placing the privileged classes together in one house and the unprivileged in another would be better for both than a scission i own i think it would people can never agree without some sacrifices and it appears but a moderate sacrifice in each party to meet on this middle ground the attempt to bring this about might satisfy your instructions and a failure in it would justify your siding with the people even to those who think instructions are laws of conduct forgive me my dear friend if my anxiety for you makes me talk of things i know nothing about you must not consider this as advice i know you and myself too well to presume to offer advice receive it merely as the expression of my uneasiness and the effusion of that sincere friendship with which i am my dear sir yours affectionately thomas jefferson may  0      paris george washington to george washington j mss paris may  0      sir —i am now to acknolege the honor of your two letters of nov    and feb    both of which     have come to hand since my last to you of dec      the details you are so good as to give me on the subject of the navigation of the waters of the potowmac and ohio are very pleasing to me as i consider the union of these two rivers as among the strongest links of connection between the eastern  western sides of our confederacy it will moreover add to the commerce of virginia in particular all the upper parts of the ohio  its waters another vast object and of much less difficulty is to add also all the country on the lakes  their waters this would enlarge our field immensely and would certainly be effected by an union of the upper waters of the ohio  lake erie the big beaver  cayahoga offer the most direct line and according to information i received from genl hand and which i had the honor of writing you in the year      the streams in that neighborhood head in lagoons and the country is flat with respect to the doubts which you say are entertained by some whether the upper waters of potowmac can be rendered capable of navigation on account of the falls  rugged banks they are answered by observing that it is reduced to a maxim that whenever there is water enough to float a batteau there may be navigation for a batteau canals  locks may be necessary  they are expensive but i hardly know what expense would be too great for the object in question probably negotiations with the indians perhaps even settlement must precede the execution of the cayahoga canal the states of maryland and virginia should make a common object of it the navigation again between     elizabeth river  the sound is of vast importance and in my opinion it is much better that these should be done at public than private expense tho we have not heard of the actual opening of the new congress  consequently have not official information of your election as president of the u s yet as there never could be a doubt entertained of it permit me to express here my felicitations not to yourself but to my country nobody who has tried both public  private life can doubt but that you were much happier on the banks of the potowmac than you will be at new york but there was nobody so well qualified as yourself to put our new machine into a regular course of action nobody the authority of whose name could have so effectually crushed opposition at home and produced respect abroad i am sensible of the immensity of the sacrifice on your part your measure of fame was full to the brim and therefore you have nothing to gain but there are cases wherein it is a duty to risk all against nothing and i believe this was exactly the case we may presume too according to every rule of probability that after doing a great deal of good you will be found to have lost nothing but private repose in a letter to mr jay of the    of november i asked a leave of absence to carry my children back to their own country and to settle various matters of a private nature which were left unsettled because i had no idea of being absent so long i expected that letter would have been received in time to be decided on by the government then existing i know now that it would arrive when there     was no congress and consequently that it must have awaited your arrival at new york i hope you found the request not an unreasonable one i am excessively anxious to receive the permission without delay that i may be able to get back before the winter sets in nothing can be so dreadful to me as to be shivering at sea for two or three months in a winter passage besides there has never been a moment at which the presence of a minister here could be so well dispensed with a certainty of no war this summer and that the government will be so totally absorbed in domestic arrangements as to attend to nothing exterior mr jay will of course communicate to you some ciphered letters lately written and one of this date my public letter to him contains all the interesting public details i inclose with the present some extracts of a letter from mr payne which he desired me to communicate your knolege of the writer will justify my giving you the trouble of these communications which their interesting nature and his respectability will jointly recommend to notice—i am in great pain for the m de la fayette his principles you know are clearly with the people but having been elected for the noblesse of auvergne they have laid him under express instructions to vote for the decision by orders  not persons this would ruin him with the tiers etat and it is not possible he could continue long to give satisfaction to the noblesse i have not hesitated to press on him to burn his instructions  follow his conscience as the only sure clue which will eternally guide a man clear of all doubts  inconsistencies     if he cannot effect a conciliatory plan he will surely take his stand manfully at once with the tiers etat he will in that case be what he pleases with them and i am in hopes that base is now too solid to render it dangerous to be mounted on it—in hopes of being able in the course of the summer to pay my respects to you personally in new york i have the honour to be with sentiments of the most perfect respect  attachment sir your most obedient  most humble servant thomas jefferson may  0      paris comte de moustier to comte de moustier  paris may  0      dear sir —i had the honor of writing to you on the   th of march by the way of london another conveiance the same way now occurring i avail myself of it to send you a list of the deputies to the states general which i presume will be interesting to you you will already have received the speeches of the king garde des sceaux  mr necker as i know that m de montmorin wrote to you the evening of the day on which they appeared  sent his letter by the bordeaux packet you are doubtless informed that a difference among the orders as to the manner of voting suspends all their proceedings they continue inactive and many despair of their ever getting under way the truth is that this revolution has gone on so happily till now and met with so few obstacles that your countrymen are frightened at seeing that the machine is stopped and that no way yet presents itself of getting over the difficulty     i see nothing to fear as yet the nation is in a movement which cannot be stopped their representatives if they cannot get on one way will try another the mind of man is full of expedients and this is the case where all will be tried i think that in the end the nobles will be obliged to yield to the vote by persons because the tiers are more unanimous more inflexible and more formidable they have for them also a part of the noblesse the majority of the clergy to wit le basclergé the nation and the body of the army the officers of the army the bishops and about four fifths of the nobles which form the opposition cannot make head against such a mass—the cardinal de lomenie is reposing under the shadow of his new hat at pisa where he is greatly courted his colleague m de lamoignon late garde de sceaux shot himself four days ago as the world says but as his friends say was killed by the accidental discharge of his own fusil the grand seignior is dead the emperor will certainly soon follow him and the war will probably go on this year in the state in which it was at the close of the last campaign that is to say without any accession of other powers the present state of the k of england promises a long and wholesome inactivity in that kingdom and may perhaps bridle the king of prussia from making any effort to change the succession of the empire which he would be disposed to attempt—i should have observed to you that your parliaments have been for some time past as quiet as if they were already entombed it is a great presumption in me     to write to you because you will get so much better information from your friends but it is to shew you how acceptable your communications are to me and how willing i am to do something for them present me with great affection to madame de brehan i am in hourly expectation of receiving my leave of absence and shall leave paris the instant i receive it and flatter myself soon to assure you both in person of those sentiments of esteem  respect with which i have the honor to be dear sir your most obedt humble servt thomas jefferson june        paris marquis de la fayette to the marquis de la fayette j mss paris june        dear sir —revolving further in my mind the idea started yesterday evening of the kings coming forward in a seance royale and offering a charter containing all the good in which all parties agree i like it more and more i have ventured to sketch such a charter merely to convey my idea which i now inclose to you as i do also to m de st etienne i write him a letter of apology for my meddling in a business where i know so little  you  he so much i have thought it better to possess him immediately of the paper because he may at the conference of today sound the minds of the conferees adieu yours affectionately thomas jefferson june        paris m de st etienne to m de st etienne j mss paris june        sir —after you quitted us yesterday evening we continued our conversation monsr de la fayette   0 mr short  myself on the subject of the difficulties which environ you the desirable object being to secure the good which the king has offered  to avoid the ill which seems to threaten an idea was suggested which appearing to make an impression on monsr de la fayette i was encouraged to pursue it on my return to paris to put it into form  now to send it to you  him it is this that the king in a seance royale should come forward with a charter of rights in his hand to be signed by himself  by every member of the three orders this charter to contain the five great points which the resultat of december offered on the part of the king the abolition of pecuniary privileges offered by the privileged orders  the adoption of the national debt and a grant of the sum of money asked from the nation this last will be a cheap price for the preceding articles and let the same act declare your immediate separation till the next anniversary meeting you will carry back to your constituents more good than ever was effected before without violence and you will stop exactly at the point where violence would otherwise begin time will be gained the public mind will continue to ripen  to be informed a basis of support may be prepared with the people themselves and expedients occur for gaining still something further at your next meeting  for stopping again at the point of force i have ventured to send to yourself  monsieur de la fayette a sketch of my ideas of what this act might contain without endangering any dispute but it is offered merely as a canvas for you to work on if it be fit to work on at     all i know too little of the subject  you know too much of it to justify me in offering anything but a hint i have done it too in a hurry insomuch that since committing it to writing it occurs to me that the  th article may give alarm that it is in a good degree included in the  th and is therefore useless but after all what excuse can i make sir for this presumption i have none but an unmeasurable love for your nation and a painful anxiety lest despotism after an unaccepted offer to bind its own hands should seize you again with tenfold fury permit me to add to these very sincere assurances of the sentiments of esteem  respect with which i have the honor to be sir your most obedt  most humble servt thomas jefferson june        proposed charter for france june  d      a charter of rights solemnly established by the king and nation   the states general shall assemble uncalled on the first day of november annually and shall remain together so long

representatives in the states general at versailles this — day of june      signed by the king and by every member individually and in his presence thomas jefferson july         paris labbé arnond to labbé arnond j mss paris july         dear sir —the above is a catalogue  of all the books i recollect on the subject of juries with respect to the value of this institution i must make a general observation we think in america that it is necessary to introduce the people into every department of government as far as they are capable of exercising it and that this is the only way to ensure a long continued  honest administration of its powers   they are not qualified to exercise themselves the executive department but they are qualified to name the person who shall exercise it with us therefore they chuse this officer every   years   they are not qualified to legislate with us therefore they only chuse the legislators   they are not qualified to judge questions of law but they     are very capable of judging questions of fact in the form of juries therefore they determine all matters of fact leaving to the permanent judges to decide the law resulting from those facts but we all know that permanent judges acquire an esprit de corps that being known they are liable to be tempted by bribery that they are misled by favor by relationship by a spirit of party by a devotion to the executive or legislative that it is better to leave a cause to the decision of cross  pile than to that of a judge biased to one side and that the opinion of    honest jurymen gives still a better hope of right than cross  pile does it is left therefore to the juries if they think the permanent judges are under any biass whatever in any cause to take on themselves to judge the laws as well as the fact they never exercise this power but when they suspect partiality in the judges and by the exercise of this power they have been the firmest bulwarks of english liberty were i called upon to decide whether the people had best be omitted in the legislative or judiciary department i would say it is better to leave them out of the legislature the execution of the laws is more important than the making them however it is best to have the people in all the three departments where that is possible i write in great haste my dear sir  have therefore only time to add wishes for the happiness of your country to which a new order of things is opening  assurances of the sincere esteem with which i have the honor to be dear sir your most obedient  humble servt     thomas jefferson july         paris james madison to james madison  j mss paris july         dear sir —i wrote you on the   d since that i have received yours of the   d of may the presidents title as proposed by the senate was the most superlatively ridiculous thing i ever heard of it is a proof the more of the justice of the character given by doctor franklin of my friend  always an honest one  often a great one but sometimes absolutely mad i wish he could have been here during the late scenes if he could then have had one fibre of aristocracy left in his frame he would have been a proper subject for bedlam the tranquility of this place has not been disturbed since the death of foulon  bertier supplies of bread are precarious but there has not as yet been such a want as to produce disorder and we may expect the new wheat harvest to begin now in ten or twelve days you will wonder to find the harvest here so late but from my observations i guess because i have not calculated their result carefully the sun does not shine here more than   hours of the    through the whole year i inclose you some papers worth notice which indeed have principally induced me to address you so soon after my last thomas jefferson aug        paris james swan to james swan j mss paris aug        sir —whenever foreigners possessed of american funds have come to consult me as to their solidity i     have made it a point to give them the best information in my power but i have wished to avoid being consulted by those who desire to buy because it is far from being among my duties to assist in converting the domestic debts of our country into foreign debts and because too i have not been willing by giving an opinion which might induce an individual to embark his fortune in a speculation to take upon myself any responsibility or reproaches for the event of that speculation the incident which i presume is the subject of your letter was the following about a week ago one of my servants came and told me there was a person who wished to speak to me i asked if he was an american or a foreigner he said a foreigner i had a good deal of company at the moment and told him i could not receive him unless his business was extremely pressing he went to ask his business and returned with a letter too long to be read in that situation but at one glance of the eye i saw that it related to the purchase of american funds i told him to tell the person i did not meddle in that subject but that unless he was well acquainted with it he might lose you know better than i do sir that under the denomination of american funds are comprehended at least  0 kinds of paper of the united states  of the several states and three times as many kinds of paper effects those of the confederacy i know to be as solid as the earth itself  would as soon lend money on them myself as on mortgages of land some of those of the several states are good but i do not suppose all of them to be so none but a broker living on the     spot can distinguish the good from the bad i therefore told the servant to say to him that sil ne sy connoissoit pas il pourvoit bien y perdre how the servant or he could transform this into an answer that the american funds were of no great stability is not for me to explain the line or two of the letter which i read mentioned no names nor specified any particular kind of funds this sir is the true answer and the explanation of the motives which led to it both of them very far from imputing a want of solidity to the funds of the united states no body living i believe has been more uniformly confident in them than myself thomas jefferson aug         paris james madison to james madison  j mss paris aug         dear sir —my last to you was of july    since that i have received yours of may    june      0 the tranquillity of the city has not been disturbed since my last dissensions between the french  swiss guards occasioned some private combats in which five or six were killed these dissensions are made up the want of bread for some days past has greatly endangered the peace of the city some get a little some none at all the poor are the best served because they besiege perpetually the doors of the bakers notwithstanding this distress and the palpable impotence of the city administration to furnish bread to the city it was not till yesterday that general leave was given to the bakers to go into the     country  buy flour for themselves as they can this will soon relieve us because the wheat harvest is well advanced never was there a country where the practice of governing too much had taken deeper root  done more mischief their declaration of rights is finished if printed in time i will inclose a copy with this it is doubtful whether they will now take up the finance or the constitution first the distress for money endangers everything no taxes are paid and no money can be borrowed mr neckar was yesterday to give in a memoir to the assembly on this subject i think they will give him leave to put into execution any plan he pleases so as to debarrass themselves of this  take up that of the constitution no plan is yet reported but the leading members with some small differences of opinion have in contemplation the following the executive power in a hereditary king with a negative on laws and power to dissolve the legislature to be considerably restrained in the making of treaties and limited in his expenses the legislative in a house of representatives they propose a senate also chosen on the plan of our federal senate by the provincial assemblies but to be for life of a certain age they talk of  0 years and certain wealth   or  00 guineas a year but to have no other power as to laws but to remonstrate against them to the representatives who will then determine their fate by a simple majority this you will readily perceive is a mere council of revision like that of new york which in order to be something must form an alliance with the king to avail themselves     of his veto the alliance will be useful to both  to the nation the representatives to be chosen every two or three years the judiciary system is less prepared than any other part of their plan however they will abolish the parliaments and establish an order of judges  justices general  provincial a good deal like ours with trial by jury in criminal cases certainly perhaps also in civil the provinces will have assemblies for their provincial government  the cities a municipal body for municipal government all founded on the basis of popular election these subordinate governments tho completely dependent on the general one will be intrusted with almost the whole of the details which our state governments exercise they will have their own judiciary final in all but great cases the executive business will principally pass through their hands and a certain local legislature will be allowed them in short ours has been professedly their model in which such changes are made as a difference of circumstances rendered necessary and some others neither necessary nor advantageous but into which men will ever run when versed in theory and new in the practice of government when acquainted with man only as they see him in their books  not in the world this plan will undoubtedly undergo changes in the assembly and the longer it is delayed the greater will be the changes for that assembly or rather the patriotic part of it hooped together heretofore by a common enemy are less compact since their victory that enemy the civil  ecclesiastical aristocracy begins to raise its head the   0 lees too of the patriotic party of wicked principles  desperate fortunes hoping to pillage something in the wreck of their country are attaching themselves to the faction of the duke of orleans that faction is caballing with the populace  intriguing at london the hague  berlin and have evidently in view the transfer of the crown to the d of orleans he is a man of moderate understanding of no principle absorbed in low vice and incapable of abstracting himself from the filth of that to direct anything else his name and his money therefore are mere tools in the hands of those who are duping him mirabeau is their chief they may produce a temporary confusion and even a temporary civil war supported as they will be by the money of england but they cannot have success ultimately the king the mass of the substantial people of the whole country the army and the influential part of the clergy form a firm phalanx which must prevail should those delays which necessarily attend the deliberations of a body of   00 men give time to this plot to ripen  burst so as to break up the assembly before anything definite is done a constitution the principles of which are pretty well settled in the minds of the assembly will be proposed by the national militia that is their commander urged by the individual members of the assembly signed by the king and supported by the nation to prevail till circumstances shall permit its revision and more regular sanction this i suppose the pis aller of their affairs while their probable event is a peaceable settlement of them they fear a war from england holland  prussia     i think england will give money but not make war holland would soon be afire internally were she to be embroiled in external difficulties prussia must know this  act accordingly it is impossible to desire better dispositions towards us than prevail in this assembly our proceedings have been viewed as a model for them on every occasion and tho in the heat of debate men are generally disposed to contradict every authority urged by their opponents ours has been treated like that of the bible open to explanation but not to question i am sorry that in the moment of such a disposition anything should come from us to check it the placing them on a mere footing with the english will have this effect when of two nations the one has engaged herself in a ruinous war for us has spent her blood  money to save us has opened her bosom to us in peace and received us almost on the footing of her own citizens while the other has moved heaven earth  hell to exterminate us in war has insulted us in all her councils in peace shut her doors to us in every part where her interests would admit it libelled us in foreign nations endeavored to poison them against the reception of our most precious commodities to place these two nations on a footing is to give a great deal more to one than to the other if the maxim be true that to make unequal quantities equal you must add more to the one than to the other to say in excuse that gratitude is never to enter into the motives of national conduct is to revive a principle which has been buried for centuries with its kindred principles of     the lawfulness of assassination poison perjury c all of these were legitimate principles in the dark ages which intervened between antient  modern civilization but exploded  held in just horror in the   th century i know but one code of morality for men whether acting singly or collectively he who says i will be a rogue when i act in company with a hundred others but an honest man when i act alone will be believed in the former assertion but not in the latter i would say with the poet hic niger est hunc tu romane cavato if the morality of one man produces a just line of conduct in him acting individually why should not the morality of  00 men produce a just line of conduct in them acting together but i indulge myself in these reflections because my own feelings run into them with you they were always acknoleged let us hope that our new government will take some other occasions to shew that they mean to prescribe no virtue from the canons of their conduct with other nations in every other instance the new government has ushered itself to the world as honest masculine and dignified it has shown genuine dignity in my opinion in exploding adulatory titles they are the offerings of abject baseness and nourish that degrading vice in the people— i must now say a word on the declaration of rights you have been so good as to send me i like it as far as it goes but i should have been for going further for instance the following alterations  additions would have pleased me art   the people shall not be deprived or abridged of their right to speak to     write or otherwise to publish anything but false facts affecting injuriously the life liberty property or reputation of others or affecting the peace of the confederacy with foreign nations art   all facts put in issue before any judicature shall be tried by jury except   in cases of admiralty jurisdiction wherein a foreigner shall be interested   in cases cognizable before a court martial concerning only the regular officers  souldiers of the u s or members of the militia in actual service in time of war or insurrection    in impeachments allowed by the constitution art   no person shall be held in confinement more than days after they shall have demanded  been refused a writ of hab corp by the judge appointed by law nor more than days after such a writ shall have been served on the person holding him in confinement  no order given on due examination for his remandment or discharge nor more than hours in any place at a greater distance than miles from the usual residence of some judge authorized to issue the writ of hab corp nor shall that writ be suspended for any term exceeding one year nor in any place more than miles distant from the station or encampment of enemies or of insurgents art   monopolies may be allowed to persons for their own productions in literature  their own inventions in the arts for a term not exceeding years but for no longer term  no other purpose art  0 all troops of the u s shall stand ipso facto disbanded at the expiration of the term for which their pay  subsistence shall have been last voted by congress and all officers  souldiers not     natives of the u s shall be incapable of serving in their armies by land except during a foreign war these restrictions i think are so guarded as to hinder evil only however if we do not have them now i have so much confidence in my countrymen as to be satisfied that we shall have them as soon as the degeneracy of our government shall render them necessary i have no certain news of p jones i understand only in a general way that some persecution on the part of his officers occasioned his being called to petersburgh  that tho protected against them by the empress he is not yet restored to his station silas deane is coming over to finish his days in america not having one sou to subsist on elsewhere he is a wretched monument of the consequences of a departure from right—i will before my departure write colo lee fully the measures i pursued to procure success in his business  which as yet offer little hope  i shall leave it in the hands of mr short to be pursued if any prospect opens on him i propose to sail from havre as soon after the  st of october as i can get a vessel  shall consequently leave this place a week earlier than that as my daughters will be with me  their baggage somewhat more than that of mere voyageures i shall endeavor if possible to obtain a passage for virginia directly probably i shall be there by the last of november if my immediate attendance at new york should be requisite for any purpose i will leave them with a relation near richmond and proceed immediately to new york but as i do not foresee any pressing purpose for that journey immediately     on my arrival and as it will be a great saving of time to finish at once in virginia so as to have no occasion to return there after having once gone on to the northward i expect to proceed to my own house directly staying there two months which i believe will be necessary and allowing for the time i am on the road i may expect to be at new york in february and to embark from thence or some eastern port—you ask me if i would accept any appointment on that side of the water you know the circumstances which led me from retirement step by step  from one nomination to another up to the present my object is a return to the same retirement whenever therefore i quit the present it will not be to engage in any other office and most especially any one which would require a constant residence from home—the books i have collected for you will go off for havre in three or four days with my baggage from that port i shall try to send them by a direct occasion to new york i am with great  sincere esteem dr sir your affectionate friend and servant p s i just now learn that mr neckar
