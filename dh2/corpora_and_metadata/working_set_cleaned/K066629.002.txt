the strand sold by r faulder new bondstreet and b law ave marylane  mdcclxxix  lecture xiv duties owing to particular persons  duty of children to parents  respect and obedience  in what the former consists  in what the latter  succouring a parent  brotherly affection  obedience to law  founded on the advantages of society  from the two grand principles of loving our neighbor as ourselves and of doing to others as we would have them do to us which regulate our social intercourse in general we proceed to those more confined duties which arise from particular relations connections and stations in life  among these we are first taught as indeed the order of nature directs to consider the great duty of children to parents  the two points to be insisted on are respect and obedience both these should naturally spring from love to which parents have the highest claim and indeed parents in general behave to their children in a manner both to deserve and to obtain their love  but if the kindness of the parent be not such as to work upon the affections of the child yet still the parent has a title to respect and obedience on the principle of duty a principle which the voice of nature dictates which reason inculcates which human laws and human customs all join to enforce and which the word of god strictly commands  the child will show respect to his parent by treating him at all times with deference he will consult his parents inclination and show a readiness in a thousand nameless trifles to conform himself to it he will never peevishly contradict his parent and when he offers a contrary opinion he will offer it modestly respect will teach him also not only to put the best coloring upon the infirmities of his parent but even if those infirmities be great it will soften and screen them as much as possible from the public eye  obedience goes a step further and supposes a positive command in things unlawful indeed the parental authority cannot bind but this is a case that rarely happens the great danger is on the other side that children through obstinacy or sulleness should refuse their parents lawful commands to the observance of all which however inconvenient to themselves they are tied by various motives and above all by the command of god who in his sacred denunciations against sin ranks disobedience to parents among the worst romans i  0   they are farther bound not only to obey the commands of their parents but to obey them cheerfully he does but half his duty who does it not from his heart  there remains still a third part of filial duty which peculiarly belongs to children when grown up this the catechism calls succouring or administering to the necessities of the parent either in the way of managing his affairs when he is less able to manage them himself or in supplying his wants should he need assistance in that way and this the child should do on the united principles of love duty and gratitude the hypocritical jew would sometimes evade this duty by dedicating to sacred uses what should have been expended in assisting his parent our savior sharply rebukes this perversion of duty and gives him to understand that no pretense of serving god can cover the neglect of assisting a parent and if no pretense of serving god can do it surely every other pretense must still be more unnatural  under this head also we may consider that attention and love which are due to other relations especially that mutual affection which should subsist between brothers the name of brother expresses the highest degree of tenderness and is generally used in scripture as a term of peculiar endearment to call men to the practice of social virtue it reminds them of every kindness which man can show to man if then we ought to treat all mankind with the affection of brothers in what light must they appear who being really such are ever at variance with each other continually doing spiteful actions and showing upon every occasion not only a want of brotherly kindness but even of common regard  the next part of our duty is to honor and obey the king and all that are put in authority under him  by the king and all that are put in authority under him is meant the various parts of the government we live under of which the king is the head and the meaning of the precept is that we ought to live in dutiful submission to legal authority  government and society are united we cannot have one without the other and we submit to the inconveniences for the sake of the advantages  the end of society is mutual safety and convenience without it even safety could in no degree be obtained the good would become a prey to the bad nay the very human species to the beasts of the field  still less could we obtain the conveniences of life which cannot be had without the labor of many if every man depended upon himself for what he enjoyed how destitute would be the situation of human affairs  but even safety and convenience are not the only fruits of society man living merely by himself would be an ignorant unpolished savage it is the intercourse of society which cultivates the human mind one mans knowledge and experience is built upon anothers and so the great edifice of science and polished life is reared  to enjoy these advantages therefore men joined in society and hence it became necessary that government should be established magistrates were created laws made taxes submitted to and every one instead of righting himself except in mere selfdefence is injoined to appeal to the laws he lives under as the best security of his life and property  lecture xv duty to our teachers and instructors  arising from the great importance of knowledge and religion  and the great necessity of gaining habits of attention and of virtue in our youth  analogy of youth and manhood to this world and the next  we are next injoined to submit ourselves to all our governors teachers spiritual pastors and masters here another species of government is pointed out the laws of society are meant to govern our riper years the instructions of our teachers spiritual pastors and masters are meant to guide our youth  by our teachers spiritual pastors and masters are meant all those who have the care of our education and of our instruction in religion whom we are to obey and listen to with humility and attention as the means of our advancement in knowledge and religion the instructions we receive from them are unquestionably subject to our own judgment in future life for by his own judgment every man must stand or fall but during our youth it is highly proper for us to pay a dutiful submission to their instructions as we cannot yet be supposed to have formed any judgment of our own at that early age it should be our endeavor to acquire knowledge and afterward unprejudiced to form our opinions  the duty which young people owe to their instructors cannot be shown better than in the effect which the instructions they receive have upon them they would do well therefore to consider the advantages of an early attention to these two things both of great importance knowledge and religion  the great use of knowledge in all its various branches to which the learned languages are generally considered as an introduction is to free the mind from the prejudices of ignorance and to give it juster and more enlarged conceptions than are the mere growth of rude nature by reading you add the experience of others to your own it is the improvement of the mind chiefly that makes the difference between man and man and gives one man a real superiority over another  besides the mind must be employed the lower orders of men have their attention much engrossed by those employments in which the necessities of life engage them and it is happy that they have labor stands in the room of education and fills up those vacancies of mind which in a state of idleness would be engrossed by vice and if they who have more leisure do not substitute something in the room of this their minds also will become the prey of vice and the more so as they have the means to indulge it more in their power a vacant mind is exactly that house mentioned in the gospel which the devil found empty in he entered and taking with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself they took possession it is an undoubted truth that one vice indulged introduces others and that each succeeding vice becomes more depraved  if then the mind must be employed what can fill up its vacuities more rationally than the acquisition of knowledge let us therefore thank god for the opportunities he has afforded us and not turn into a curse those means of leisure which might become so great a blessing  but however necessary to us knowledge may be religion we know is infinitely more so the one adorns a man and gives him it is true superiority and rank in life but the other is absolutely essential to his happiness  in the midst of youth health and abundance the world is apt to appear a very gay and pleasing scene it engages our desires and in a degree satisfies them also but it is wisdom to consider that a time will come when youth health and fortune will all fail us and if disappointment and vexation do not sour our taste for pleasure at least sickness and infirmities will destroy it in these gloomy seasons and above all at the approach of death what will become of us without religion when this world fails where shall we fly if we expect no refuge in another without holy hope in god and resignation to his will and trust in him for deliverance what is there that can secure us against the evils of life  the great utility therefore of knowledge and religion being thus apparent it is highly incumbent upon us to pay a studious attention to them in our youth if we do not it is more than probable that we shall never do it that we shall grow old in ignorance by neglecting the one and old in vice by neglecting the other  for improvement in knowledge youth is certainly the fittest season the mind is then ready to receive any impression it is free from all that care and attention which in riper age the affairs of life bring with them the memory too is then stronger and better able to acquire the rudiments of knowledge and as the mind is then void of ideas it is more suited to those parts of learning which are conversant in words besides there is sometimes in youth a modesty and ductility which in advanced years if those years especially have been left a prey to ignorance become selfsufficiency and prejudice and these effectually bar up all the inlets to knowledge  but above all unless habits of attention and application are early gained we shall scarce acquire them afterward  the inconsiderate youth seldom reflects upon this nor knows his loss till he knows also that it cannot be retrieved  nor is youth more the season to acquire knowledge than to form religious habits it is a great point to get habit on the side of virtue it will make every thing smooth and easy the earliest principles are generally the most lasting and those of a religious cast are seldom wholly lost though the temptations of the world may now and then draw the wellprincipled youth aside yet his principles being continually at war with his practice there is hope that in the end the better part may overcome the worse and bring on a reformation whereas he who has suffered habits of vice to get possession of his youth has little chance of being brought back to a sense of religion in a common course of things it can rarely happen some calamity must rouse him he must be awakened by a storm or sleep for ever  how much better is it then to make that easy to us which we know is best and to form those habits now which hereafter we shall wish we had formed  there are who would restrain youth from imbibing any religious principles till they can judge for themselves lest they should imbibe prejudice for truth but why should not the same caution be used in science also and the minds of youth left void of all impressions the experiment i fear in both cases would be dangerous if the mind were left uncultivated during so long a period though nothing else should find entrance vice certainly would and it would make the larger shoots as the soil would be vacant a boy had better receive knowledge and religion mixed with error than none at all for when the mind is set a thinking it may deposit its prejudices by degrees and get right at last but in a state of stagnation it will infallibly become foul  to conclude our youth bears the same proportion to our more advanced life as this world does to the next in this life we must form and cultivate those habits of virtue which must qualify us for a better state if we neglect them here and contract habits of an opposite kind instead of gaining that exalted state which is promised to our improvement we shall of course sink into that state which is adapted to the habits we have formed  exactly thus is youth introductory to manhood to which it is properly speaking a state of preparation during this season we must qualify ourselves for the parts we are to act hereafter in manhood we bear the fruit which has in youth been planted if we have sauntered away our youth we must expect to be ignorant men if indolence and inattention have taken an early possession of us they will probably increase as we advance in life and make us a burden to ourselves and useless to society if again we suffer ourselves to be misled by vicious inclinations they will daily get new strength and end in dissolute lives but if we cultivate our minds in our youth attain habits of attention and industry of virtue and sobriety we shall find ourselves well prepared to act our future parts in life and what above all things ought to be our care by gaining this command over ourselves we shall be more able as we get forward in the world to resist every new temptation as it arises  lecture xvi behavior to superiors  the word betters explained  probable reasons for gods appointing various distinctions among men  happiness and misery not connected with station  we are next injoined to order ourselves lowly and reverently to all our betters  by our betters are meant they who are in a superior station of life to our own and by ordering ourselves lowly and reverently toward them is meant paying them that respect which is due to their station  the word betters indeed includes two kinds of persons to whom our respect is due  those who have a natural claim to it and those who have an acquired one that is a claim arising from some particular situation in life  among the first are all our superior relations not only parents but all other relations who are in a line above us all these have a natural claim to our respect  there is a respect also due from youth to age which is always becoming and tends to keep youth within the bounds of modesty  to others respect is due from those particular stations which arise from society and government fear god says the text and it adds honor the king  it is due also from many other situations in life employments honors and even wealth will exact it and all may justly exact it in a proper degree  but it may here perhaps be inquired why god should permit this latter distinction among men that some should have more authority than others we can easily see is absolutely necessary in government but among men who are all born equal why should the goods of life be distributed in so unequal a proportion  to this inquiry it may be answered that in the first place we see nothing in this but what is common in all the works of god a gradation is every where observable beauty strength swiftness and other qualities are varied through the creation in numberless degrees in the same manner likewise are varied the gifts of fortune as they are called why therefore should one mans being richer than another surprise us more than his being stronger than another or more prudent  though we can but very inadequately trace the wisdom of god in his works yet very wise reasons appear for this variety in the gifts of fortune it seems necessary both in a civil and in a moral light  in a civil light it is the necessary accompaniment of various employments on which depend all the advantages of society like the stones of a regular building some must range higher and some lower some must support and others be supported some will form the strength of the building and others its ornament but all unite in producing one regular and proportioned whole if then different employments are necessary of course different degrees of wealth honor and consequence must follow a variety of distinctions and obligations in short different ranks and a subordination must take place  again in a moral light the disproportion of wealth and other worldly adjuncts gives a range to the more extensive exercise of virtue some virtues could but faintly exist upon the plan of an equality if some did not abound there were little room for temperance if some did not suffer need there were as little for patience other virtues again could hardly exist at all who could practice generosity where there was no object of it who humility where all ambitious desires were excluded  since then providence in scattering these various gifts proposes ultimately the good of man it is our duty to acquiesce in this order and to behave ourselves lowly and reverently not with servility but with a decent respect to all our superiors  before i conclude this subject it may be proper to observe in vindication of the ways of providence that we are not to suppose happiness and misery necessarily connected with riches and poverty each condition has its particular sources both of pleasure and pain unknown to the other those in elevated stations have a thousand latent pangs of which their inferiors have no idea while their inferiors again have as many pleasures which the others cannot taste i speak only of such modes of happiness or misery as arise immediately from different stations of misery indeed from a variety of other causes all men of every station are equal heirs either when god lays his hand upon us in sickness or misfortune or when by our own follies and vices we become the ministers of our own distress  who then would build his happiness upon an elevated station or who would envy the possession of such happiness in another we know not with what various distresses that station which is the object of our envy may be attended  besides as we are accountable for all we possess it may be happy for us that we possess so little the means of happiness as far as station can procure them are commonly in our own power if we are not wanting to ourselves  let each of us then do his duty in that station which providence has assigned him ever remembering that the next world will soon destroy all earthly distinctions  one distinction only will remain among the sons of men at that time  the distinction between good and bad and this distinction it is worth all our pains and all our ambition to acquire  lecture xvii the injury of words  evilspeaking  lying  an equivocation  breach of promise  slandering  we are next instructed to hurt nobody by word or deed  to be true and just in all our dealings  to bear no malice nor hatred in our hearts  to keep our hands from picking and stealing  our tongues from evilspeaking lying and slandering  the duties comprehended in these words are a little transposed what should class under one head is brought under another to hurt nobody by word or deed is the general proposition the under parts should follow first to keep the tongue from evilspeaking lying and slandering which is to hurt nobody by word secondly to be true and just in all our dealings and to keep our hands from picking and stealing which is to hurt nobody by deed as to the injunction to bear no malice nor hatred in our hearts it belongs properly to neither of these heads but is a distinct one by itself the duties being thus separated i shall proceed to explain them  and first of injuring our neighbor by our words this may be done we find in three ways by evilspeaking by lying and by slandering  by evilspeaking is meant speaking ill of our neighbor but upon a supposition that this ill is the truth in some circumstances it is certainly right to speak ill of our neighbor as when we are called upon in a court of justice to give our evidence or when we can set any one right in his opinion of a person in whom he is about to put an improper confidence nor can there be any harm in speaking of a bad action which has been determined in a court of justice or is otherwise become notorious  but on the other hand it is highly disallowable to speak wantonly of the characters of others from common fame because in a thousand instances we find that stories which have no better foundation are misrepresented they are perhaps only halftold  they have been heard through the medium of malice or envy  some favorable circumstance has been omitted  some foreign circumstance has been added  some trifling circumstance has been exaggerated  the motive the provocation or perhaps the reparation has been concealed  in short the representation of the fact is some way or other totally different from the fact itself  but even when we have the best evidence of a bad action with all its circumstances before us we surely indulge a very illnatured pleasure in spreading the shame of an offending brother we can do no good and we may do harm we may weaken his good resolutions by exposing him we may harden him against the world perhaps it may be his first bad action perhaps nobody is privy to it but ourselves let us give him at least one trial let us not cast the first stone which of our lives could stand so strict a scrutiny he only who is without sin himself can have any excuse for treating his brother with severity  let us next consider lying which is an intention to deceive by falsehood in our words  to warn us against lying we should do well to consider the folly the meanness and the wickedness of it  the folly of lying consists in its defeating its own purpose a habit of lying is generally in the end detected and after a detection the liar instead of deceiving will not even be believed when he happens to speak the truth nay every single lie is attended with such a variety of circumstances which lead to a detection that it is often discovered the use generally made of a lie is to cover a fault but as the end is seldom answered we only aggravate what we wish to conceal in point even of prudence an honest confession would serve us better  the meanness of lying arises from the cowardice which it implies we dare not boldly and nobly speak the truth but have recourse to low subterfuges which always argue a sordid and disingenuous mind hence it is that in the fashionable world the word liar is always considered as a term of peculiar reproach  the wickedness of lying consists in its perverting one of the greatest blessings of god the use of speech in making that a mischief to mankind which was intended for a benefit truth is the great bond of society falsehood of course tends to its dissolution if one man may lie why not another and if there is no mutual trust among men there is an end of all intercourse and dealing  an equivocation is nearly related to a lie it is an intention to deceive under words of a double meaning or words which literally speaking are true and is equally criminal with the most downright breach of truth when st peter asked sapphira in the  th chapter of the acts whether her husband had sold the land for so much she answered he had and literally she spoke the truth for he had sold it for that sum included in a larger but having an intention to deceive we we find the apostle considered the equivocation as a lie  in short it is the intention to deceive which is criminal the mode of deception like the vehicle in which poison is conveyed is of no consequence a nod or sign may convey a lie as effectually as the most deceitful language  under the head of lying may be mentioned a breach of promise while a resolution remains in our own breasts it is subject to our own review but when we make another person a party with us an engagement is made and every engagement though only of the lightest kind should be punctually observed if we have added to this engagement a solemn promise the obligation is so much the stronger and he who does not think himself bound by such an obligation has no pretensions to the character of an honest man a breach of promise is still worse than a lie a lie is simply a breach of truth but a breach of promise is a breach both of truth and trust  forgetfulness is a weak excuse it only shows how little we are affected by so solemn an engagement should we forget to call for a sum of money of which we were in want at an appointed time or do we think a solemn promise of less value than a sum of money  having considered evilspeaking and lying let us next consider slandering by slandering we mean injuring our neighbors character by falsehood here we still rise higher in the scale of injurious words slandering our neighbor is the greatest injury which words can do him and is therefore worse than either evilspeaking or lying the mischief of this sin depends on the value of our characters all men unless they be past feeling desire naturally to be thought well of by their fellow creatures a good character is one of the principal means of being serviceable either to ourselves or others and among numbers the very bread they eat depends upon it what aggravated injury therefore do we bring upon every man whose name we slander and what is still worse the injury is irreparable if you defraud a man restore what you took and the injury is repaired but if you slander him it is not in your power to shut up all the ears and all the mouths to which your tale may have access the evil spreads like the winged seeds of some noxious plants which scatter mischief on a breath of air and disperse it on every side and beyond prevention  before we conclude this subject it may just be mentioned that a slander may be spread as a lie may be told in various ways we may do it by an insinuation as well as in a direct manner we may spread it in a secret or propagate it under the color of friendship  i may add also that it is a species of slander and often a very malignant one to lessen the merits or exaggerate the failings of others as it is likewise to omit defending a misrepresented character or to let others bear the blame of our offenses  lecture xviii injurious actions  law and justice different things  illustrated by several instances  malice and hatred arising from the resentment of injuries  arising from envy  having thus considered injurious words let us next consider injurious actions on this head we are injoined to keep our hands from picking and stealing and to be true and just in all our dealings  as to theft it is a crime of so odious and vile a nature that one would imagine no person who has had the least tincture of a virtuous education even though driven to necessity could be led into it  i shall not therefore enter into a dissuasive from this crime but go on with the explanation of the other part of the injunction and see what it is to be true and just in all our dealings  justice is even still more if possible the support of society than truth inasmuch as a man may be more injurious by his actions than by his words it is for this reason that the whole force of human law is bent to restrain injustice and the happiness of every society will increase in proportion to this restraint  we very much err however if we suppose that every thing within the bounds of law is justice the law was intended only for bad men and it is impossible to make the meshes of it so strait but that many very great enormities will escape the well meaning man therefore knowing that the law was not made for him consults a better guide  his own conscience informed by religion and indeed the great difference between the good and the bad man consists in this the good man will do nothing but what his conscience will allow the bad man will do any thing which the law cannot reach  it would indeed be endless to describe the various ways in which a man may be dishonest within the limits of law they are as various as our intercourse with mankind some of the most obvious of them i shall cursorily mention  in matters of commerce the knave has many opportunities the different qualities of the same commodity  the different modes of adulteration  the specious arts of vending  the frequent ignorance in purchasing and a variety of other circumstances open an endless field to the ingenuity of fraud the honest fairdealer in the mean time has only one rule which is that all arts however common in business which are intended to deceive are utterly unlawful it may be added upon this head that if any one conscious of having been a transgressor is desirous of repairing his fault restitution is by all means necessary till that be done he continues in a course of injustice  again in matters of contract a man has many opportunities of being dishonest within the bounds of law he may be strict in observing the letter of an agreement when the equitable meaning requires a laxer interpretation or he can take the laxer interpretation when it serves his purpose and at the loophole of some ambiguous expression exclude the literal meaning though it be undoubtedly the true one  the same iniquity appears in withholding from another his just right or in putting him to expense in recovering it the movements of the law are slow and in many cases cannot be otherwise but he who takes the advantage of this to injure his neighbor proves himself an undoubted knave  it is a species of the same kind of injustice to withhold a debt when we have ability to pay or to run into debt when we have not that ability the former can proceed only from a bad disposition the latter from suffering our desires to exceed our station some are excused on this head as men of generous principles which they cannot confine but what is their generosity they assist one man by injuring another and what good arises to society from hence such persons cannot act on principle and we need not hesitate to rank them with those who run into debt to gratify their own selfish inclinations one man desires the elegancies of life another desires what he thinks an equal good the reputation of generosity  oppression is another species of injustice by which in a thousand ways under the cover of law we may take the advantage of the superiority of our power either to crush an inferior or humble him to our designs  ingratitude is another a loan we know claims a legal return and is the obligation less if instead of a loan you receive a kindness the law indeed says nothing on this point of immorality but an honest conscience will be very loud in the condemnation of it  we may be unjust also in our resentment by carrying it beyond what reason and religion prescribe  but it would be endless to describe the various ways in which injustice discovers itself in truth almost every omission of duty may be resolved into injustice  the next precept is to bear no malice nor hatred in our hearts  the malice and hatred of our hearts arise in the first place from injurious treatment and surely no man when he is injured can at first help feeling that he is so but christianity requires that we should subdue these feelings as soon as possible and not suffer the sun to go down upon our wrathvarious are the passages of scripture which inculcate the forgiveness of injuries indeed no point is more labored than this and with reason because no temper is more productive of evil both to ourselves and others than a malicious one the sensations of a mind burning with revenge are beyond description and as we are at these seasons very unable to judge coolly and of course liable to carry our resentment too far the consequence is that in our rage we may do a thousand things which can never be atoned for and of which we may repent as long as we live  besides one act draws on another and retaliation keeps the quarrel alive the gospel therefore ever gracious and kind to man in all its precepts injoins us to check all these violent emotions and to leave our cause in the hands of god vengeance is mine i will repay says the lord and he who in opposition to this precept takes vengeance into his own hands and cherishes the malice and hatred of his heart may assure himself that he has not yet learned to be a christian these precepts perhaps may not entirely agree with modern principles of honor but let the man of honor see to that the maxims of the world cannot change the truth of the gospel  nay even in recovering our just right or in pursuing a criminal to justice we should take care that it be not done in the spirit of retaliation and revenge if these be our motives though we make the law our instrument we are equally guilty  but besides injurious treatment the malice and hatred of our hearts have often another source and that is envy and thus in the litany envy malice and hatred are all joined together with great propriety the emotions of envy are generally cooler and less violent than those which arise from the resentment of injury so that envy is seldom so mischievous in its effects as revenge but with regard to ourselves it is altogether as bad and full as destructive of the spirit of christianity what is the religion of that man who instead of thanking heaven for the blessings he receives is fretting himself continually with a disagreeable comparison between himself and some other he cannot enjoy what he has because another has more wealth a fairer fame or perhaps more merit than himself he is miserable because others are happy  but to omit the wickedness of envy how absurd and foolish is it in a world where we must necessarily expect much real misery to be perniciously inventive in producing it  besides what ignorance we see only the glaring outside of things under all that envied glare many unseen distresses may lurk from which our station may be free for our merciful creator seems to have bestowed happiness as far as station is concerned with great equality among all his creatures  in conclusion therefore let it be the great object of our attention and the subject of our prayers to rid our minds of all this cursed intrusion of evil thoughts  whether they proceed from malice or from an envious temper let all our malicious thoughts soften into charity and benevolence and let us forgive one another as god for christs sake has forgiven us as for our envious thoughts as far as they relate to externals let them subside in humility acquiescence and submission to the will of god and when we are tempted to envy the good qualities of others let us spurn so base a conception and change it into a generous emulation  into an endeavor to raise ourselves to an equality with our rival not to depress him to a level with us  lecture xix duties owing to ourselves  temperance  sobriety  chastity  rules for preserving the purity of our thoughts words and actions  thus far the duties we have considered come most properly under the head of those which we owe to our neighbor what follows relates rather to ourselves on this head we are instructed to keep our bodies in temperance soberness and chastity  though our souls should be our great concern yet as they are nearly connected with our bodies and as the impurity of the one contaminates the other a great degree of moral attention is of course due to our bodies also  as our first station is in this world to which our bodies particularly belong they are formed with such appetites as are requisite to our commodious living in it and the rule given us is to use the world so as not to abuse it st paul by a beautiful allusion calls our bodies the temples of the holy ghost by which he means to impress us with a strong idea of their dignity and to deter us from debasing by low pleasures what should be the seat of so much purity to youth these cautions are above measure necessary because their passions and appetites are strong their reason and judgment weak they are prone to pleasure and void of reflection how therefore these young adventurers in life may best steer their course and use this sinful world so as not to abuse it is a consideration well worth their attention let us then see under what regulations their appetites should be restrained  by keeping our bodies in temperance is meant avoiding excess in eating with regard both to the quantity and quality of our food we should neither eat more than our stomachs can well bear nor be nice and delicate in our eating  to preserve the body in health is the end of eating and they who regulate themselves merely by this end who eat without choice or distinction paying no regard to the pleasure of eating observe perhaps the best rule of temperance they go rather indeed beyond temperance and may be called abstemious a man may be temperate and yet allow himself a little more indulgence great care however is here necessary and the more as perhaps no precise rule can be affixed after we have passed the first great limit and let the palate loose among variety  nam variae res ut noceant homini credas memor illius escae quae simplex olim tibi sederit at simul assis miscueris elixa simul conchylia turdis dulcia se in bilem vertent stomachoq tumultum lenta feret pituita  hor our own discretion must be our guide which should be constantly kept awake by considering the many bad consequences which attend a breach of temperance  young men in the full vigor of health do not consider these things but as age comes on and different maladies begin to appear they may perhaps repent they did not a little earlier practice the rules of temperance  in a moral and religious light the consequences of intemperance are still worse to enjoy a comfortable meal when it comes before us is allowable but he who suffers his mind to dwell upon the pleasures of eating and makes them the employment of his thoughts has at least opened one source of mental corruption  corpus onustum hesternis vitiis animum quoq praegravat una atq affigit humo divinae particulam aurae hor sat   after all he who would most perfectly enjoy the pleasures of the table such as they are must look for them within the rules of temperance the palate accustomed to satiety has lost its tone and the greatest sensualists have been brought to confess that the coarsest fare with an appetite kept in order by temperance affords a more delicious repast than the most luxurious meal without it  as temperance relates chiefly to eating soberness or sobriety relates properly to drinking and here the same observations recur the strictest and perhaps the best rule is merely to satisfy the end of drinking but if a little more indulgence be taken it ought to be taken with the greatest circumspection  with regard to youth indeed i should be inclined to great strictness on this head in eating if they eat of proper and simple food they cannot easily err their growing limbs and strong exercise require larger supplies than fullgrown bodies which must be kept in order by a more rigid temperance but if more indulgence be allowed them in eating less surely should in drinking with strong liquors of every kind they have nothing to do and if they should totally abstain on this head it were so much the better the languor which attends age  ubive accedant anni et tractari mollius aetas imbecilla volet  hor sat requires perhaps now and then some aids but the spirits of youth want no recruits a little rest is sufficient  as to the bad consequences derived from excessive drinking besides filling the blood with bloated and vicious humors and debauching the purity of the mind as in the case of intemperate eating it is attended with this peculiar evil the loss of our senses hence follow frequent inconveniences and mortifications we expose our follies  we betray our secrets  we are often imposed upon  we quarrel with our friends  we lay ourselves open to our enemies and in short make ourselves the objects of contempt and the topics of ridicule to all our acquaintance  nor is it only the act of intoxication which deprives us of our reason during the prevalence of it the habit of drunkenness soon besots and impairs the understanding and renders us at all times less fit for the offices of life  we are next injoined to keep our bodies in chastity flee youthful lusts says the apostle which war against the soul and there is surely nothing which carries on a war against the soul more successfully wherever we have a catalogue in scripture and we have many such catalogues of those sins which in a peculiar manner debauch the mind these youthful lusts have always under some denomination a place among them  to keep ourselves free from all contagion of this kind let us endeavor to preserve a purity in our thoughts  our words  and our actions  first let us preserve a purity in our thoughts these dark recesses which the eye of the world cannot reach are the receptacles of these youthful lusts here they find their first encouragement the entrance of such impure ideas perhaps we cannot always prevent we may always however prevent cherishing them we may always prevent their making an impression upon us the devil may be cast out as soon as discovered  let us always keep in mind that even into these dark abodes the eye of heaven can penetrate that every thought of our hearts is open to that god before whom we must one day stand and that however secretly we may indulge these impure ideas at the great day of account they will certainly appear in an awful detail against us  let us remember again that if our bodies be the temples of the holy ghost our minds are the very sanctuaries of those temples and if there be any weight in the apostles argument against polluting our bodies it urges with double force against polluting our minds  but above all other considerations it behooves us most to keep our thoughts pure because they are the fountains from which our words and actions flow out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks obscene words and actions are only bad thoughts matured and spring as naturally from them as the plant from its seed it is the same vicious depravity carried a step farther and only shows a more confirmed and a more mischievous degree of guilt while we keep our impurities in our thoughts they debauch only ourselves bad enough it is true but when we proceed to words and actions we let our impurities loose we spread the contagion and become the corrupters of others  let it be our first care therefore to keep our thoughts pure if we do this our words and actions will be pure of course and that we may be the better enabled to do it let us use such helps as reason and religion prescribe let us avoid all company and all books that have a tendency to corrupt our minds and every thing that can inflame our passions he who allows himself in these things holds a parley with vice which will infallibly debauch him in the end if he do not take the alarm in time and break off such dalliance  one thing ought to be our particular care and that is never to be unemployed ingenious amusements are of great use in filling up the vacuities of our time idle we should never be a vacant mind is an invitation to vice  lecture xx covetousness the source of wickedness and misery  a desiring frame of mind  covetousness consistent with prodigality  particularly to be restrained in youth  duties of each station  an active useful life recommended  the proper motive to such a life  we are forbidden next to covet or desire other mens goods  there are two great paths of vice into which bad men commonly strike that of unlawful pleasure and that of unlawful gain  the path of unlawful pleasure we have just examined and have seen the danger of obeying the headstrong impulse of our appetites  we have considered also an immoderate love of gain and have seen dishonesty and fraud in a variety of shapes but we have yet viewed them only as they relate to society we have viewed only the outward action the rule before us we must not covet nor desire other mens goods comes a step nearer home and considers the motive which governs the action  covetousness or the love of money is called in scripture the root of all evil and it is called so for two reasons because it makes us wicked and because it makes us miserable  first it makes us wicked when it once gets possession of the heart it will let no good principle flourish near it most vices have their fits and when the violence of the passion is spent there is some interval of calm the vicious appetite cannot always run riot it is fatigued at least by its own impetuosity and it is possible that in this moment of tranquillity a whisper from virtue may be heard but in avarice there is rarely intermission it hangs like a dead weight upon the soul always pulling it to earth we might as well expect to see a plant grow upon a flint as a virtue in the heart of a miser  it makes us miserable as well as wicked the cares and the fears of avarice are proverbial and it must needs be that he who depends for happiness on what is liable to a thousand accidents must of course feel as many distresses and almost as many disappointments the good man depends for happiness on something more permanent and if his worldly affairs go ill his great dependence is still left saeviat atq novos moveat fortuna tumultus quantum hinc imminuet  hor sat but as wealth is the only god which the covetous man worships for covetousness we are told is idolatry a disappointment here is a disappointment indeed be he ever so prosperous his wealth cannot secure him against the evils of mortality against that time when he must give up all he values when his bargains of advantage will be over and nothing left but tears and despair  but even a desiring frame of mind tho it be not carried to such a length is always productive of misery it cannot be otherwise while we suffer ourselves to be continually in quest of what we have not it is impossible that we should be happy with what we have in a word to abridge our wants as much as possible not to increase them is the truest happiness  we are much mistaken however if we think the man who hoards up his money is the only covetous man the prodigal though he differ in his end may be as avaritious in his means alieni appetens sui profusus sal de catil the former denies himself every comfort the latter grasps at every pleasure both characters are equally bad in different extremes the miser is more detestable in the eyes of the world because he enters into none of its joys but it is a question which is more wretched in himself or more pernicious to society  as covetousness is esteemed the vice of age every appearance of it among young persons ought particularly to be discouraged because if it gets ground at this early period nobody can tell how far it may not afterward proceed and yet on the other side there may be great danger of encouraging the opposite extreme as it is certainly right under proper restrictions both to save our money and to spend it it would be highly useful to fix the due bounds on each side but nothing is more difficult than to raise these nice limits between extremes every mans case in a thousand circumstances differs from his neighbors and as no rule can be fixed for all every man of course in these disquisitions must be left to his own conscience we are all indeed very ready to give our opinions how others ought to act we can adjust with great nicety what is proper for them to do and point out their mistakes with much precision while nothing is necessary to us but to act as properly as as we can ourselves observing as just a mean as possible between prodigality and avarice and applying in all our difficulties to the word of god where these great landmarks of morality are the most accurately fixed  we have now taken a view of what is prohibited in our commerce with mankind let us next see what is injoined we are still proceeding with those duties which we owe to ourselves instead of spending our fortune therefore in unlawful pleasure or increasing it by unlawful gain we are required to learn and labor truly that is honestly to get our own living and to do our duty in that state of life unto which it shall please god to call us  these words will be sufficiently explained by considering first that we all have some station in life  some particular duties to discharge and secondly in what manner we ought to discharge them  first that man was not born to be idle may be inferred from the active spirit that appears in every part of nature every thing is alive every thing contributes to the general good even the very inanimate parts of the creation plants stones metals cannot be called totally inactive but bear their part likewise in the general usefulness if then every part even of inanimate nature be thus employed surely we cannot suppose it was the intention of the almighty father that man who is the most capable of employing himself properly should be the only creature without employment  again that man was born for active life is plain from the necessity of labor if it had not been necessary god would not originally have imposed it but without it the body would become enervated and the mind corrupted idleness therefore is justly esteemed the origin both of disease and vice so that if labor and employment either of body or mind had no use but what respected ourselves they would be highly proper but they have farther use  the necessity of them is plain from the want that all men have of the assistance of others if so this assistance should be mutual every man should contribute his part we have already seen that it is proper there should be different stations in the world  that some should be placed high in life and others low the lowest we know cannot be exempt from labor and the highest ought not though their labor according to their station will be of a different kind some we see must labor as the catechism phrases it to get their own living and others should do their duty in that state of life whatever that state is unto which it has pleased god to call them all are assisted all should assist god distributes we read various talents among men to some he gives five talents to others two and to others one but it is expected we find that notwithstanding this inequality each should employ the talent that is given to the best advantage and he who received five talents was under the same obligation of improving them as he who had received only one and would if he had hid his talents in the earth have been punished in proportion to the abuse every man even in the highest station may find a proper employment both for his time and fortune if he please and he may assure himself that god by placing him in that station never meant to exempt him from the common obligations of society and give him a license to spend his life in ease and pleasure god meant assuredly that he should bear his part in the general commerce of life  that he should consider himself not as an individual but as a member of the community the interests of which he is under an obligation to support with all his power  and that his elevated station gives him no other preeminence than that of being the more extensively useful  having thus seen that we have all some station in life to support  some particular duties to discharge let us now see in what manner we ought to discharge them  we have an easy rule given us in scripture on this head that all our duties in life should be performed as to the lord and not unto man that is we should consider our stations in life as trusts reposed in us by our maker and as such should discharge the duties of them what though no worldly trust be reposed what though we are accountable to nobody upon earth can we therefore suppose ourselves in reality less accountable can we suppose that god for no reason that we can divine has singled us out and given us a large proportion of the things of this world while others around us are in need for no other purpose than to squander it away upon ourselves to god undoubtedly we are accountable for every blessing we enjoy what mean in scripture the talents given and the use assigned but the conscientious discharge of the duties of life according to the advantages with which they are attended  it matters not whether these advantages be an inheritance or an acquisition still they are the gift of god agreeably to their rank in life it is true all men should live human distinctions require it and in doing this properly every one around will be benefited utility should be considered in all our expenses even the very amusements of a man of fortune should be founded in it  in short it is the constant injunction of scripture in whatever station we are placed to consider ourselves as gods servants and as acting immediately under his eye not expecting our reward among men but from our great master who is in heaven this sanctifies in a manner all our actions it places the little difficulties of our station in the light of gods appointments and turns the most common duties of life into acts of religion  lecture xxi bad company  meaning of the phrase  different classes of bad company  illchosen company  what is meant by keeping bad company  the danger of it from our aptness to imitate and catch the manners of others  from the great power and force of custom  from our own bad inclinations  we have now gone through our duty to god our neighbor and ourselves and should proceed in the order pointed out in the catechism to consider the lords prayer but it will not perhaps be amiss to step a little aside and but a little for the sake of one lesson on a subject which to youth is very important and without the observance of which every station will be attended with its peculiar danger the lesson i mean respects the danger of keeping bad company  evil communication says the text corrupts good manners the assertion is general and no doubt all people suffer from such communication but above all the minds of youth will suffer which are yet unformed unprincipled unfurnished and ready to receive any impression  but before we consider the danger of keeping bad company let us first see the meaning of the phrase  in the phrase of the world good company means fashionable people their stations in life not their morals are considered and he who associates with such though they set him the example of breaking every commandment of the decalogue is still said to keep good company  i should wish you to fix another meaning to the expression and to consider vice in the same detestable light in whatever company it is found nay to consider all company in which it is found be their station what it will as bad company  the three following classes will perhaps include the greatest part of those who deserve this appellation  in the first i should rank all who endeavor to destroy the principles of christianity  who jest upon scripture  talk blasphemy  and treat revelation with contempt  a second class of bad company are those who have a tendency to destroy in us the principles of common honesty and integrity under this head we may rank gamesters of every denomination and the low and infamous characters of every profession  a third class of bad company and such as are commonly most dangerous to youth includes the long catalogue of men of pleasure in whatever way they follow the call of appetite they have equally a tendency to corrupt the purity of the mind  besides these three classes whom we may call bad company there are others who come under the denomination of illchosen company trifling insipid characters of every kind who follow no business  are led by no ideas of improvement  but spend their time in dissipation and folly  whose highest praise it is that they are only not vicious  with none of these a serious man would wish his son to keep company  it may be asked what is meant by keeping bad company the world abounds with characters of this kind they meet us in every place and if we keep company at all it is impossible to avoid keeping company with such persons  it is true if we were determined never to have any commerce with bad men we must as the apostle remarks altogether go out of the world by keeping bad company therefore is not meant a casual intercourse with them on occasion of business or as they accidentally fall in our way but having an inclination to consort with them  complying with that inclination  seeking their company when we might avoid it  entering into their parties  and making them the companions of our choice mixing with them occasionally cannot be avoided  the danger of keeping bad company arises principally from our aptness to imitate and catch the manners and sentiments of others  from the power of custom  from our own bad inclinations  and from the pains taken by the bad to corrupt us see this subject treated more at large in an anonymous pamphlet on the employment of time   in our earliest youth the contagion of manners is observable in the boy yet incapable of having any thing instilled into him we easily discover from his first actions and rude attempts at language the kind of persons with whom he has been brought up we see the early spring of a civilized education or the first wild shoots of rusticity  as he enters farther into life his behavior manners and conversation all take their cast from the company he keeps observe the peasant and the man of education the difference is striking and yet god has bestowed equal talents on each the only difference is they have been thrown into different scenes of life and have had commerce with persons of different stations  nor are manners and behavior more easily caught than opinions and principles in childhood and youth we naturally adopt the sentiments of those about us and as we advance in life how few of us think for ourselves how many of us are satisfied with taking our opinions at second hand  the great power and force of custom forms another argument against keeping bad company however seriously disposed we may be and however shocked at the first approaches of vice this shocking appearance goes off upon an intimacy with it custom will soon render the most disgustful thing familiar and this is indeed a kind provision of nature to render labor and toil and danger which are the lot of man more easy to him the raw soldier who trembles at the first encounter becomes a hardy veteran in a few campaigns habit renders danger familiar and of course indifferent to him  but habit which is intended for our good may like other kind appointments of nature be converted into a mischief the welldisposed youth entering first into bad company is shocked at what he hears and what he sees the good principles which he had imbibed ring in his ears an alarming lesson against the wickedness of his companions but alas this sensibility is but of a days continuance the next jovial meeting makes the horrid picture of yesterday more easily endured virtue is soon thought a severe rule the gospel an inconvenient restraint a few pangs of conscience now and then interrupt his pleasures and whisper to him that he once had better thoughts but even these by degrees die away and he who at first was shocked even at the appearance of vice is formed by custom into a profligate leader of vicious pleasures  perhaps into an abandoned tempter to vice  so carefully should we oppose the first approaches of sin so vigilant should we be against so insidious an enemy  our own bad inclinations form another argument against bad company we have so many passions and appetites to govern so many bad propensities of different kinds to watch that amidst such a variety of enemies within we ought at least to be on our guard against those without the breast even of a good man is represented in scripture and experienced in fact to be in a state of warfare his vicious inclinations are continually drawing him one way while his virtue is making efforts another and if the scriptures represent this as the case even of a good man whose passions it may be imagined are become in some degree cool and temperate and who has made some progress in a virtuous course what may we suppose to be the danger of a raw unexperienced youth whose passions and appetites are violent and seducing and whose mind is in a still less confirmed state it is his part surely to keep out of the way of temptation and to give his bad inclinations as little room as possible to acquire new strength  lecture xxii ridicule one of the chief arts of corruption  bad company injures our characters as well as manners  presumption the forerunner of ruin  the advantages of good company equal to the disadvantages of bad  cautions in forming intimacies  these arguments against keeping bad company will still receive additional strength if we consider farther the great pains taken by the bad to corrupt others it is a very true but lamentable fact in the history of human nature that bad men take more pains to corrupt their own species than virtuous men do to reform them hence those specious arts that show of friendship that appearance of disinterestness with which the profligate seducer endeavors to lure the unwary youth and at the same time yielding to his inclinations seems to follow rather than to lead him many are the arts of these corrupters but their principal art is ridicule by this they endeavor to laugh out of countenance all the better principles of their wavering proselyte and make him think contemptibly of those whom he formerly respected by this they stifle the ingenuous blush and finally destroy all sense of shame their cause is below argument they aim not therefore at reasoning raillery is the weapon they employ and who is there that has the steadiness to hear persons and things whatever reverence he may have had for them the subject of continual ridicule without losing that reverence by degrees  having thus considered what principally makes bad company dangerous i shall just add that even were your morals in no danger from such intercourse your characters would infallibly suffer the world will always judge of you by your companions and nobody will suppose that a youth of virtuous principles himself can possibly form a connection with a profligate  in reply to the danger supposed to arise from bad company perhaps the youth may say he is so firm in his own opinions so steady in his principles that he thinks himself secure and need not restrain himself from the most unreserved conversation  alas this security is the very brink of the precipice nor has vice in her whole train a more dangerous enemy to you than presumption caution ever awake to danger is a guard against it but security lays every guard asleep let him who thinks he stands says the apostle take heed lest he fall even an apostle himself did fall by thinking that he stood secure though i should die with thee said st peter to his master yet will i not deny thee that very night notwithstanding this boasted security he repeated the crime three several times and can we suppose that presumption which occasioned an apostles fall shall not ruin an unexperienced youth the story is recorded for our instruction and should be a standing lesson against presuming upon our own strength  in conclusion such as the dangers are which arise from bad company such are the advantages which accrue from good we imitate and catch the manners and sentiments of good men as we do of bad custom which renders vice less a deformity renders virtue more lovely good examples have a force beyond instruction and warm us into emulation beyond precept while the countenance and conversation of virtuous men encourage and draw out into action every kindred disposition of our hearts  besides as a sense of shame often prevents our doing a right thing in bad company it operates in the same way in preventing our doing a wrong one in good our character becomes a pledge and we cannot without a kind of dishonor draw back  it is not possible indeed for a youth yet unfurnished with knowledge which fits him for good company to choose his companions as he pleases a youth must have something peculiarly attractive to qualify him for the acquaintance of men of established reputation what he has to do is at all events to avoid bad company and to endeavor by improving his mind and morals to qualify himself for the best  happy is that youth who upon his entrance into the world can choose his company with discretion there is often in vice a gayety an unreserve a freedom of manners which are apt at sight to engage the unwary while virtue on the other hand is often modest reserved diffident backward and easily disconcerted that freedom of manners however engaging may cover a very corrupt heart and this awkwardness however unpleasing may veil a thousand virtues suffer not your mind therefore to be easily either engaged or disgusted at first sight form your intimacies with reserve and if drawn unawares into an acquaintance you disapprove immediately retreat open not your hearts to every profession of friendship they whose friendship is worth accepting are as you ought to be reserved in offering it choose your companions not merely for the sake of a few outward accomplishments  for the idle pleasure of spending an agreeable hour but mark their disposition to virtue or vice and as much as possible choose those for your companions whom you see others respect always remembering that upon the choice of your company depends in a great measure the success of all you have learned the hopes of your friends your future characters in life and what you ought above all other things to value the purity of your hearts  lecture xxiii of prayer in general  its first object is praise  a second to solicit the pardon of sin  a third to beg a supply of our wants  one of the advantages of prayer to preserve in our minds a sense of god and of our dependence upon him  together with a sense of our duty to which it contributes not only in a natural but in a spiritual way  the qualifications of prayer considered  faith  humility  sincerity  resolutions of amendment  charity  to be offered through the merits of christ  ejaculations of praise  petition  objections  praise an absurd homage  absurd to inform god of our wants  absurd to attempt by our prayers to alter a stated course of things  before we enter upon the lords prayer which falls next under our examination it may be proper to consider prayer in general  the object the advantages and the qualifications of it together with some of the most popular objections which are made to it  when we consider the infinite distance between god and man  between that being whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain and man with all the weaknesses of mortality about him it may at first appear matter of astonishment that we are allowed any communication with so great a being the distinctions which worldly policy and worldly pride make among mankind  among creatures of the same rank cannot but raise our ideas still higher of the goodness of god when we see man treating his fellow creatures with petulance and disdain upon the vile distinctions of station family and fortune what a lesson to us is the goodness of god merciful mild and condescending to our weaknesses he listens to and grants the petitions of his meanest creatures  the first great object of prayer is the praise of god the works of creation naturally raise it and the goodness of god in continuing to us that being which we cannot ourselves preserve and the comforts which we cannot ourselves procure brings it home to our feelings it is a duty which every rational creature owes to his creator it is also one of the best sources of our happiness simple praise which consists merely in extolling excellence is a pleasing theme but when it is excited by gratitude it flows with still greater pleasure gratitude has a tendency to improve that happy disposition of mind which feels every enjoyment that it possesses  a second object of prayer is to solicit the pardon of our sins god not only permits but even injoins us to to do it and he has appointed penitent prayer as one of the means of obtaining pardon it must ever be accompanied by confession as confessing a fault is one of the first steps toward amending it in this humiliating employment we have not only to deplore our own sinfulness but the lost condition of human nature without being truly sensible of this we can neither acknowledge the means which god has used to obviate it nor be grateful for them  after thanking god for his past goodness and endeavoring to make ourselves as worthy as we can of future favors it is the next object of prayer to petition a supply of our wants among them the principal is that of the assistance of gods holy spirit it is the constant doctrine of scripture that however necessary our own endeavors are to make us virtuous they are not sufficient alone to do it our own feelings and imperfections in a thousand instances must convince us that this is the case to counteract the depravity of nature god has promised us the divine assistance of his holy spirit and earnest prayer is the means he has appointed for the attainment of that end we are permitted also to pray for our temporal wants this is indeed the nicest and most delicate part of prayer too thankful for past mercies we cannot be too earnest in soliciting the pardon of our sins and gods spiritual assistance we cannot be but so short sighted are we that in begging a supply of our temporal wants we may easily err but on these heads i shall be more full in the explanation of the lords prayer  besides praising god for his mercies asking pardon for our sins and beging a supply of our wants which are the primary objects of prayer there are other great advantages which are closely connected with it  of these the first is to preserve in our minds a sense of god and of our dependence upon him when we praise god we are naturally impressed with an idea of his perfections and when we beg the forgiveness of our sins and a supply of our wants we are as naturally reminded that we are weak and sinful creatures that we are continually under the eye of an allpowerful being and are in hourly need of his protection and favor and if our prayers be constant uniform and fervent these great truths will be impressed upon our minds and become the leading principles of our lives  prayer is calculated also to impress us with a sense of our duty and to keep us steady in the practice of it a virtuous wish is a step toward virtue a fervent prayer is still a nearer advance to pray ardently for an increase of virtue even in a natural way must increase it and to pray frequently must tend to preserve it indeed in the whole circle of christian duties perhaps there is not one which has a greater effect in forming the heart than rational devotion  after the advantages of prayer let us consider the qualifications of it or what concomitant circumstances are necessary to make it an acceptable service to god it should be founded in faith and accompanied with humility sincerity resolutions of amendment and charity it should also be offered up in the name and through the merits of christ  it should first be founded in faith it is obvious to common sense that he who comes to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them who diligently seek him otherwise why should we come to him at all we ought therefore to trust his promises and put up our prayers in the full assurance of being heard even men when their word is plighted expect this confidence and shall we approach god with less confidence than we do man  secondly our prayers must be accompanied with humility humility is expected even when we ask a favor of our fellow creatures what humiliation then is due to god from whom we have every thing to ask and before whom we have not the smallest merits to plead an humble heart is in itself a pleasing sacrifice to god the humility of the publican was half his prayer  they should be accompanied also with sincerity mere lipservice can never please god it is a mockery of him indeed if our minds are thoroughly impressed with a sense of gods power and goodness and of our own weakness and dependence our prayers will of course be sincere we shall find it less difficult to check the idle wanderings of our thoughts we shall confess our sins with an heartfelt contrition and praise god with unfeigned thankfulness i shall just add that as we should guard on one hand against an unanimate coldness and insensibility so ought we on the other to avoid all irrational fervor in our devotions the effusions of a heated imagination cannot be a pleasing sacrifice to an allwise god  but sincere prayer is of little value in the sight of god if it be not accompanied with steady resolutions of amendment if the heart be not improved devotion is dead its fruit is lost to implore pardon for our sins and not endeavor to avoid them is showing ourselves to be just so much in earnest as to own we are in the wrong without attempting to get right  one thing more is necessary to make our devotions acceptable to god they should be offered up in the spirit of charity he who begs forgiveness at gods hands in an unforgiving temper may as well omit his prayers he had better omit them to his uncharitable temper he only adds a new offense  that of an unworthy prayer it is the constant language of scripture that with the same measure with which we mete it shall be measured to us again give and it shall be given unto you forgive and ye shall be forgiven  but no human qualifications alone can carry up our prayers to the throne of grace we must have other merits besides our own to make them acceptable in the sight of god  the allsufficient merits of our blessed redeemer he is the great mediator between god and man a holy life makes his merits ours all our prayers therefore should be offered up in his name and through his most powerful mediation  but in the lords prayer no mention is made of the merits of christ  it is true nor could there when that prayer was composed the great atonement was not made how could it then be pleaded but we are told it ought to be pleaded as soon as it was made hitherto said our savior to his disciples a little before his passion have ye asked nothing in my name but whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he will give it you  when all these qualifications are united when our prayers are founded in faith  when they are accompanied with humility sincerity resolutions of amendment and charity  and lastly when they are offered up in the name and through the merits of christ we may assure ourselves that they will be acceptable in the sight of god  i shall just add on this subject that besides formal prayers either public or private a devout mind will find many opportunities of exercising itself in the midst even of business and pleasure an ejaculation of praise a single petition raised from the heart in one devout thought unaccompanied by any external act will unquestionably find its way to heaven this is literally having god in all our thoughts and making our lives a continual prayer  as reasonable a duty however as prayer is objections have been made to it  praise it has been said is an absurd homage as if the almighty father could be pleased with the empty praises of a poor insignificant race of creatures we are to do all it seems to the glory of god what glory can god receive from our doings does his name in any respect depend upon the breath of man  to this objection we answer that if the real exaltation of gods glory or if any addition to his happiness be supposed to be the intention of praise the idea indeed were very absurd but certainly with regard to man no employment can be more adapted to his nature or in itself more rational than to praise his creator it reminds him of all those great attributes which as he praises them he learns to imitate it reminds him of that infinite wisdom and power on which he ought always to depend it reminds him of that tenderness and indulgence which he has so often experienced and which he ought ever to praise  when we are ordered therefore to do every thing for the glory of god the expression is merely adapted to common acceptance and alludes to the glory of earthly princes which good subjects advance by obeying the laws the highest glory therefore according to our ideas which god can receive from his creatures arises from their obedience to his commands  but it is absurd replies the objector to inform god of our wants nay such information amounts almost to a denial of his omniscience  undoubtedly if it were the intention of the petitioner to inform god but this never enters into the idea of a prayer god has injoined us to pray for a supply of our wants as a mean of receiving it in what manner prayer is efficacious to this purpose it is not for us to inquire one thing is very obvious that dependant creatures ought always to be reminded of their dependent state and of that being from whose bounty they receive every thing they enjoy and nothing surely can be better calculated than prayer to promote this wise end  but is not prayer an absurd attempt to alter the stated course of things and is it not high presumption to imagine that god will alter it for the sake of our petitions  the objection is founded in ignorance do we know what is the stated course of things do we know whether there even exists what the objector calls a stated course or whether god may not reserve all events as far as free agents are concerned in a mutable condition dependant on circumstances  in whatever way our prayers are efficacious it is not our part to inquire we have the almightys express command for this intercourse with him and therefore we ought with thankfulness to comply he who gave the command knows best how to make the compliance with it effectual  lecture xxiv occasion on which the lords prayer was composed  general idea of it  division into five parts  the first contains an address of praise  explanation of the word father when applied to god  of the word heaven  the second part contains a petition for the general good of mankind  meaning of hallowing gods name  thy kingdom come  thy will be done  having thus considered prayer in general let us now consider the lords prayer  this prayer was composed by our savior upon a request which his disciples made him to teach them to pray as john taught his disciples much of the substance of it is supposed to have been taken from the jewish forms then in use from which our savior as it appears selecting proper parts adapted them to his own purpose this mode of composing a prayer was agreeable to his usual practice which was to give as little offense as possible to the prejudices of men in forming a prayer therefore he chose rather to take in part what he found already established than to compose one entirely anew  this prayer was not only intended as a form of prayer in itself but also as a model to show us how to fashion our prayers we have the great lines of rational devotion marked out to which we may adapt our own exigencies this seems implied in the introduction after this manner pray ye as if our savior had said the precise form of words here given you needs not always be adhered to but let it be your general direction  the lords prayer seems to admit an easy division into five parts  the first contains an invocation of praise our father which art in heaven  the second contains a petition for the general good of mankind hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven  the third part contains a petition for temporal blessings give us this day our daily bread  the fourth for spiritual and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil  the fifth concludes with a profession of our faith for thine is the kingdom the power and the glory for ever and ever  part i the first part contains an invocation of praise our father which art in heaven  the jews as far as appears were not allowed the use of this address to god at least they had no idea of it in a christian sense they were taught rather to address him by some such awful title as the lord jehovah  the lord of hosts  or the lord who takes vengeance his power rather than his goodness was the leading character under which they acknowledged him but the christian dispensation allows us to address the deity under the tender name of father we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ under the gracious appellation of father we not only acknowledge god as the creator and preserver of the world but hope from him as a child expects from his parent the supply of our wants assistance in our difficulties indulgence to our failings and pardon for our faults and these kindnesses in a greater degree proportioned to his greater goodness and power  by the word heaven the jewish language frequently understands preeminence a city exalted to heaven means only a city raised to an extraordinary height of power when we address god therefore in heaven we are not taught to conceive him as stationed in any particular place of abode god is present we know on earth as well as in heaven every where as well as any where when we address ourselves therefore to god in heaven we mean only to address ourselves to that god who is omnipotent and supreme  part ii after the invocation the prayer begins in the spirit of christian benevolence with a petition for the general good of mankind hallowed be thy name  thy kingdom come  thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven  gods name is hallowed or religiously honored when his creatures have just sentiments of him when we pray therefore that gods name may be hallowed we pray that mankind may have their minds impressed with just ideas of his wisdom power justice and other attributes in a word we pray that all mankind may love and fear him as their great benefactor and judge  and that in the scripture language they may sanctify the lord god in their hearts  we farther pray that mankind may not only have just sentiments of the deity but may be partakers also with us in the purity of religion thy kingdom come  by kingdom in the new testament or the kingdom of heaven is generally meant the christian religion when john the baptist preached saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand he meant the gospel or the christian religion is about to be established when we pray therefore that gods kingdom may come we pray that the christian religion in its full purity and perfection may be established throughout the world as what must be most conducive to the happiness of it this is yet we see far from being the case great part of the world never heard of christianity great part of it though they have heard of christ yet acknowledge him not a large portion even of the christian world debase christianity almost into heathenism and great numbers even where we suppose christianity purely professed deny the power of it by leading wicked lives great reason therefore have we to pray that gods kingdom may come  we have ground to hope from many parts of the prophetic writings that at length the fullness of the gentiles shall come in and for this event we devoutly pray when the day star shall arise to all the world and the people which sit in darkness shall see a great light when the whole race of mankind shall join in the psalmists triumphant song the lord reigns let the earth rejoice yea the multitude of the isles shall be glad thereof  in consequence of mens having just notions of god and a true religion to direct them we pray that their lives may be answerable to such advantages and that god may be obeyed by mankind on earth as far as human frailty will permit as he is by the angels in heaven thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven  angelic obedience we conceive to be perfect human obedience we know is very defective lifeless and inanimate in our devotions  negligent at best in our practice  our most plausible actions springing often from unworthy motives great reason have we to pray that we and all mankind may give the best proof of our religious principles by emulating the prompt obedience of angels and doing gods will on earth as it is done in heaven  lecture xxv the third part contains a prayer for the supply of our wants  first of a temporal kind  the necessaries of life all we are allowed to pray for  the fourth part contains a prayer for the supply of our spiritual wants  the forgiveness of our sins  and the assistance of gods holy spirit  the phrase lead us not into temptation considered  the fifth part contains an acknowlegement of gods power and our gratitude  a paraphrase of the whole  part iii after praying for the general good of mankind we are instructed to pray for the supply of our own wants these are of two kinds temporal and spiritual  and first we are allowed to pray for temporal things give us this day our daily bread is all we are allowed and it cannot possibly by any mode of interpretation extend to more than the necessaries of life it is a common analogy in language to make some principal thing stand for many of the same kind thus the word faith often stands for the whole of religion tho it is only a part and thus the word bread in the passage before us stands for all the necessaries of life of which it is the principal for the necessaries of life then we are allowed to pray but not for the superfluities of it we must pray in general terms but must not particularize for spiritual things we are at full liberty because here we cannot err but with regard to temporal so circumscribed is all our knowledge that if we go farther we may run into error and in a thousand instances ask for things which may prove our ruin the apostle warns us against those who ask amiss that they may consume it upon their lusts  there is something singular in the repetition of the words this day and daily as if human nature so apt to err on this subject were doubly cautioned not to be solicitous to lay up a great store for the future but to be satisfied with a moderate provision and that we should not seem to form in our hearts that wicked wish of placing ourselves in a state independent of god thou fool this night shall thy soul be required of thee is a dreadful sentence upon record against such folly  part iv being permitted with these restrictons to pray for temporal things we are allowed a larger scope with regard to spiritual on this head we have two things to pray for  that god would pardon our past sins and assist us in avoiding sin for the future both these requests are contained in the following words forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil  first then we are to beg of god forgiveness of our past sins and a christian knows upon what conditions only they will be forgiven without a thorough repentance of them  such a repentance as ends in a reformed life we know it is in vain to expect forgiveness  something more also is required we are instructed to approach the throne of god in a forgiving temper toward others when we petition forgiveness for ourselves agreeably to those passages of scripture in which we are told that unless we forgive others our heavenly father will not forgive us and that when we come to the altar and there remember that we are at enmity with our neighbor we must first be reconciled to him before we presume to offer our gift that is before we make our supplication to god the forgiveness of others therefore we see tho not the absolute condition of our own forgiveness is however a necessary qualification tho alone it cannot obtain our pardon yet at the same time our pardon cannot be obtained without it nay whoever uses the lords prayer in an unforgiving temper instead of begging a blessing begs a curse he begs that god will forgive him as he forgives others that is he proposes his own uncharitable temper as the only rule by which he wishes himself to be judged  having thus prayed that god would forgive our past sins we next beg his assistance in avoiding sin for the future it has already been observed that in this prayer no mention is made of the merits of christ as the great atonement was not then offered we may observe also that no mention is made of the holy spirit of god which was not then promised and yet even then we see men were ordered to pray for the assistance of god to lead them out of temptation and deliver them from evil in what way god assisted his faithful servants under the old dispensation or how that mode of divine assistance differed from the assistance now afforded us under the dispensation of grace is a question of very little importance certain it is that god always did assist his servants and never left himself without a witness of his goodness in the moral as well as in the natural world but though this prayer was composed before the spirit of truth was promised and when man of course could not use the petition for gods assistance in that sense in which it was afterward used by christians yet the christian sense ought certainly to be the sense in which it should now be used when we pray therefore for gods assistance to deliver us from evil we pray for it in that way in which god has graciously promised it in the gospel that is through his holy spirit  the mode of expression is rather singular in the phrase lead us not into temptation it immediately occurs how can god lead us into temptation god st james tells us tempts no man  but the phrase according to the jewish idiom means no more than that god would lead us out of temptation that he would not suffer us in the scripture language to be tempted above our strength but that he would with the temptation make a way to escape the purport of the petition therefore is that he would graciously conduct us through all the moral difficulties of this life and that finally having passed our pilgrimage here upon earth he would take us to himself safe from all our dangers and grant us peace in a happy immortality  surrounded by dangers and difficulties of every kind great reason have we for these petitions every object around us  every period of age  every station of life  every temper of mind  our passions  our appetites  our imagination  our very reason  all conspire in furnishing abundant matter either to mislead or to seduce us the poor are tempted to dishonesty and to repine at god the rich are tempted by wantonness to forget him the life of business and the life of leisure abound equally with temptations the man of commerce with the world finds them in company nor can the recluse avoid them in solitude thus surrounded by temptations human power is insufficient to carry us safely through them to heaven therefore we must pray for assistance with god all things are possible his power cooperating with our endeavors will enable us to meet our adversary on superior ground it can lead us out of temptation and deliver us from evil  part v having thus put up our petitions to god we conclude with an assurance of our firmest confidence in him faith we know is one of the greatest requisites of prayer if we do not believe that god is able to grant our petitions it is idle to make them we pray therefore to god  because his is the kingdom the power and the glory for ever and ever he is the supreme disposer of all events and his power like his goodness is above conception we have the firmest confidence therefore that he is both able and willing to grant all our reasonable petitions  the whole prayer then according to this explanation may be thus paraphrased  o thou beneficent being our creator preserver and father have mercy upon the whole race of mankind may we all have just sentiments of thee may thy true religion be established throughout the world and may men feel its influence live suitably to its precepts and emulate in their obedience the blessed spirits of heaven  grant us such a share of this worlds good as thou see most proper for us we ask not for wealth or power grant us the necessaries of life  the rest we submit to thee and may we never through the influence of the world forget our dependence upon thee  grant o lord that we may make ourselves proper objects of thy mercy and forgiveness may we have a thorough sense of our own unworthiness and may that lead us to contrition penitence and steady resolutions of amendment and may we never presume to ask thy forgiveness in an unforgiving temper  amidst all the temptations and difficulties of this world be thou present with us let us not be tempted above our strength but let thy gracious spirit always conduct us may we exert our own best endeavors in resisting the temptations which arise from the various deluding objects of the world and may thy gracious aid render those endeavors successful so that finally having finished our course we may after this state of trial upon earth be received into the eternal mansions of thy heavenly kingdom hear our petitions o lord which are put up in the fullest confidence and faith in thee we acknowledge thy power and trust in thy goodness for a proper supply of all our wants  lecture xxvii nature of positive duties  definition of a sacrament  its original meaning  the several parts of the definition explained  sacrament of baptism  significancy of water as a sign  baptism of infants  we have now considered the great duties of faith and obedience in which consists the sum of religion these we commonly call morally right or right in their own nature  besides these there is another species of duties which are called positive in their own nature they are indifferent but are rendered binding only as they are appointed by divine authority  the jews were burdened with a heavy load of these positive duties one may almost say the spirit of the mosaic law consisted in them in ceremonies also consisted entirely the religion of the heathens all they knew indeed of religion was a burdensome ritual made up of external acts which had no reference to life and manners  never was any system of religion so free from the burden of ceremonies as christianity never was any religion so purely addressed to the heart the two sacraments of baptism and the lords supper are the only ceremonies ordained by christ both certainly very apposite  baptism as an outward testimony of our entrance into the christian religion and the lords supper as an outward testimony of our continuance in it the former of course is administered only once the latter frequently  the short account of the sacraments contained in the catechism considers three points the nature of a sacrament in general  the nature of the sacrament of baptism  and the nature of the lords supper  with regard to the nature of a sacrament in general it is first asked how many sacraments christ has ordained  the answer is two only as generally necessary to salvation viz baptism and the supper of the lord  this question points chiefly at the papists who hold seven sacraments  baptism the lords supper confirmation matrimony penance orders and extreme unction now as the word sacrament is no where defined in scripture we have no objection to a dozen sacraments instead of seven if the papists choose it all we contend for is that none of them should be placed upon an equal footing with baptism and the lords supper which according to our definition of a sacrament are the only two that are ordained by christ  the word sacrament originally implied the oath which soldiers took to their leader and under this idea it was first adopted into the language of religion but its meaning in the earlier ages was very indefinite and we find it used among the writers of the first centuries to express any thing mysterious in religion by degrees it obtained a closer acceptance and among protestants was at length confined merely to baptism and the lords supper however still unfortunately the old idea of a mystery in some degree cleaves to it and has been of prejudice to one of these rites especially which in itself seems to be as simple as it is significant  we define a sacrament to be an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace ordained by christ himself as a means whereby we receive the same and a pledge to assure us thereof  in a sacrament there must first be an outward visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace that is a sensible representation of some benefit received  a sacrament must secondly be distinguished from other ceremonies by being ordained by christ common ceremonies the church may decree and abrogate at pleasure they are useful merely for the sake of order and under different circumstances different ceremonies may take place but a sacrament as ordained by christ is of perpetual obligation  lastly a sacrament is a means whereby we receive the grace of god and a pledge to assure us thereof  the gospel we know is a gracious covenant between god and man on our part the conditions are faith and obedience on gods part the forgiveness of our sins and eternal life now the sacraments of baptism and the lords supper are the appointed means whereby we receive or declare our acceptance of these conditions and our resolution of observing them and on gods part they are a kind of pledge and security that these gracious conditions shall be performed seals and signatures are visible signs which have in all ages been thought necessary in the execution of a covenant they are necessary to reduce into a formal act what would otherwise be only an intention of the mind in conformity to human ideas god thought fit to appoint circumcision as a ratification of the jewish covenant st paul mentions it under the idea of a romans iv    seal by which that covenant was confirmed  under the same idea the two sacraments were appointed and may be considered on gods part as his seals to the covenant of grace or as it is here phrased pledges to assure us thereof  a sacrament in general being thus defined the sacrament of baptism is next considered in which if we consider the inward grace we shall see how aptly the sign represents it  the inward grace or thing signified we are told is a death unto sin and a new birth unto righteousness by which is meant that great renovation of nature that purity of heart which the christian religion is intended to produce and surely there cannot be a more significant sign of this than water on account of its cleansing nature as water refreshes the body and purifies it from all contracted filth it aptly represents that renovation of nature which cleanses the soul from the impurities of sin water indeed among the ancients was more adapted to the thing signified than it is at present among us they used immersion in baptising so that the child being dipped into the water and raised out again baptism with them was more significant of a new birth unto righteousness but though we in these colder climates think immersion an unsafe practice yet the original meaning is still supposed  it is next asked what is required of those who are baptized to this we answer repentance whereby they forsake sin and faith whereby they steadfastly believe the promises of god made to them in that sacrament  the primitive church was extremely strict on this head in those times before christianity was established when adults offered themselves to baptism no one was admitted till he had given a very satisfactory evidence of his repentance and till on good grounds he could profess his faith in christ and it was afterward expected from him that he should prove his faith and repentance by a regular obedience during the future part of his life  if faith and repentance are expected at baptism it is a very natural question why then are infants baptized when by reason of their tender age they can give no evidence of either  whether infants should be admitted to baptism or whether that sacrament should be deferred till years of discretion is a question in the christian church which has been agitated with some animosity our church by no means looks upon baptism as necessary to the infants salvation the catechism asserts the sacraments to be only generally necessary to salvation excepting particular cases where the use of them is intentionally rejected it is certainly criminal  the quakers indeed reject them on principle but though we may wonder both at their logic and divinity we should be sorry to include them in an anathema no man acquainted with the spirit of christianity can conceive that god will leave the salvation of so many innocent souls in the hands of others but the practice is considered as founded upon the usage of the earliest times and the church observing that circumcision was the introductory rite to the jewish covenant and that baptism was intended to succeed circumcision it naturally supposes that baptism should be administered to infants as circumcision was the church however in this case has provided sponsors who make a profession of obedience in the childs name but the nature and office of this proxy has been already examined under the head of our baptismal vow  lecture xxviii sacrament of the lords supper  its end  significancy of its symbols  the words verily and indeed taken explained  frame of mind requisite on receiving it  other ends in the sacrament besides those proposed  having thus considered the sacrament of baptism the catechism proceeds lastly to the sacrament of the lords supper  the first question is an inquiry into the original of the institution why was the sacrament of the lords supper ordained  it was ordained we are informed  for the continual remembrance of the sacrifice of the death of christ and of the benefits which we receive thereby  in examining a sacrament in general we have already seen that both baptism and the lords supper were originally instituted as the means of receiving the grace of god and as pledges to assure us thereof  but besides these primary ends they have each a secondary one in representing the two most important truths of religion which gives them more force and influence baptism we have seen represents that renovation of our sinful nature which the gospel was intended to introduce and the peculiar end which the lords supper had in view was the sacrifice of the death of christ with all the benefits which arise from it  the remission of our sins  and the reconciliation of the world to god this do said our savior alluding to the passover which the lords supper was designed to supersede not as hitherto in memory of your deliverance from egypt but in memory of that greater deliverance of which the other was only a type do it in remembrance of me  the outward part or sign of the lords supper is bread and wine  the things signified are the body and blood of christ  in examining the sacrament of baptism i endeavored to show how very apt a symbol water is in that ceremony bread and wine also are symbols equally apt in representing the body and blood of christ and in the use of these particular symbols it is reasonable to suppose that our savior had an eye to the jewish passover in which it was a custom to drink wine and to eat bread he might have instituted any other apt symbols for the same purpose but it was his usual practice through the whole system of his institution to make it in every part as familiar as possible and for this reason he seems to have chosen such symbols as were then in use that he might give as little offense as possible in a matter of indifference  as our savior in the institution of his supper ordered both the bread and the wine to be received it is certainly a great error in papists to deny the cup to the laity they say indeed that as both flesh and blood are united in the substance of the human body so are they in the sacramental bread which according to them is changed or as they phrase it transubstantiated into the real body of christ if they have no other reason why do they administer wine to the clergy the clergy might participate equally of both in the bread  but the plain truth is they are desirous by this invention to add an air of mystery to the sacrament and a superstitious reverence to the priest as if he being endowed with some peculiar holiness might be allowed the use of both  there is a difficulty in this part of the catechism which should not be passed over we are told that the body and blood of christ are verily and indeed taken and received by the faithful in the lords supper this expression sounds very like the popish doctrine just mentioned of transubstantiation the true sense of the words undoubtedly is that the faithful believer only verily and indeed receives the benefit of the sacrament but the expression must be allowed to be inaccurate as it is capable of an interpretation so entirely opposite to that which the church of england has always professed  i would not willingly suppose as some have done that the compilers of the catechism meant to manage the affair of transubstantiation with the papists it is one thing to show a liberality of sentiment in matters of indifference and another to speak timidly and ambiguously where essentials are concerned  it is next asked what benefits we receive from the lords supper to which it is answered the strengthening and refreshing of our souls by the body and blood of christ as our bodies are by the bread and wine as our bodies are strengthened and refreshed in a natural way by bread and wine so should our souls be in a spiritual way by a devout commemoration of the passion of christ by gratefully remembering what he suffered for us we should be excited to a greater abhorrence of sin which was the cause of his sufferings every time we partake of this sacrament like faithful soldiers we take a fresh oath to our leader and should be animated anew by his example to persevere in the spiritual conflict in which under him we are engaged  it is lastly asked what is required of them who come to the lords supper to which we answer that we should examine ourselves whether we repent us truly of our former sins  steadfastly purposing to lead a new life  have a lively faith in gods mercy through christ  with a thankful remembrance of his death and to be in charity with all men  that pious frame of mind is here in very few words pointed out which a christian ought to cherish and cultivate in himself at all times but especially upon the performance of any solemn act of religion very little indeed is said in scripture of any particular frame of mind which should accompany the performance of this duty but it may easily be inferred from the nature of the duty itself  in the first place we should repent us truly of our former sins steadfastly purposing to lead a new life he who performs a religious exercise without being earnest in this point adds only a pharisaical hypocricy to his other sins unless he seriously resolve to lead a good life he had better be all of a piece and not pretend by receiving the sacrament to a piety which he does not feel  these steadfast purposes of leading a new life form a very becoming exercise to christians the lives even of the best of men afford only a mortifying retrospect though they may have conquered some of their worst propensities yet the triumphs of sin over them at the various periods of their lives will always be remembered with sorrow and may always be remembered with advantage keeping them on their guard for the future and strengthening them more and more in all their good resolutions of obedience  and when can these meditions arise more properly than when we are performing a rite instituted on purpose to commemorate the great atonement for sin  to our repentance and resolutions of obedience we are required to add a lively faith in gods mercy through christ with a thankful remembrance of his death we should impress ourselves with the deepest sense of humility  totally rejecting every idea of our own merit  hoping for gods favor only through the merits of our great redeemer  and with hearts full of gratitude trusting only to his allsufficient sacrifice  lastly we are required at the celebration of this great rite to be in charity with all men it commemorates the greatest instance of love that can be conceived and should therefore raise in us correspondent affections it should excite in us that constant flow of benevolence in which the spirit of religion consists and without which indeed we can have no religion at all love is the very distinguishing badge of christianity by this said our great master shall all men know that ye are my disciples  one species of charity should at this time never be forgotten and that is the forgiveness of others no acceptable gift can be offered at this altar but in the spirit of reconciliation  hence it was that the ancient christians instituted at the celebration of the lords supper what they called love feasts they thought they could not give a better instance of their being in perfect charity with each other than by joining all ranks together in one common meal  by degrees indeed this wellmeant custom degenerated and it may not be amiss to observe here that the passages see   cor xi in which these enormities are rebuked have been variously misconstrued and have frightened many wellmeaning persons from the sacrament whereas what the apostle here says has no other relation to this rite than as it was attended by a particular abuse in receiving it and as this is a mode of abuse which does not now exist the apostles reproof seems not to affect the christians of this age  what the p  0  primary and what the p     secondary ends in the two sacraments were i have endeavored to explain but there might be others  god might intend them as trials of our faith the divine truths of the gospel speak for themselves but the performance of a positive duty rests only on faith  these institutions are also strong arguments for the truth of christianity we trace the observance of them into the very earliest times of the gospel we can trace no other origin than what the scriptures give us these rites therefore greatly tend to corroborate the scriptures  god also who knows what is in man might condescend so far to his weakness as to give him these external badges of religion to keep the spirit of it more alive and it is indeed probable that nothing has contributed more than these ceremonies to preserve a sense of religion among mankind it is a melancholy proof of this that no contentions in the christian church have been more violent nor carried on with more acrimony and unchristian zeal than the contentions about baptism and the lords supper as if the very essence of religion consisted in this or that mode of observing these rites  but this is the abuse of them  let us be better taught let us receive these sacraments for the gracious purposes for which our lord injoined them with gratitude and with reverence but let us not lay a greater stress upon them than our lord intended heaven we doubt not may be gained when there have been the means of receiving neither the one sacrament nor the other but unless our affections are right and our lives answerable to them we can never please god though we perform the externals of religion with ever so much exactness we may err in our notions about the sacraments the world has long been divided on these subjects and a gracious god it may be hoped will pardon our errors but in matters of practice we have no apology for error the great lines of our duty are drawn so strong that a deviation here is not error but guilt  let us then to conclude from the whole make it our principal care to purify our hearts in the sight of god let us beseech him to increase the influence of his holy spirit within us that our faith may be of that kind which works by love that all our affections and from them our actions may flow in a steady course of obedience that each day may correct the last by a sincere repentance of our mistakes in life and that we may continue gradually to approach nearer the idea of christian perfection let us do this disclaiming after all any merits of our own and not trusting in outward observances but trusting in the merits of christ to make up our deficiencies and we need not fear our acceptance with god  a catechism that is to say an instuction to be learned of every person before he be brought to be confirmed by the bishop catechism etc question what is your name  answ n or m  quest who gave you this name  answ my godfathers and godmothers in my baptism wherein i was made a member of christ the child of god and an inheritor of the

saying i am the lord thy god who brought thee out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage  i thou shall have none other gods but me  ii thou shall not make to thyself any graven image nor the likeness of any thing that is in heaven above or in the earth beneath or in the water under the earth thou shall not bow down to them nor worship them for i the lord thy god am a jealous god and visit the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me and show mercy unto thousands in them that love me and keep my commandments  iii thou shall not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in vain  iv remember that thou keep holy the sabbath day six days shall thou labor and do all that thou have to do but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shall do no manner of work thou and thy son and thy daughter thy manservant and thy maidservant thy cattle and the

or hatred in my heart to keep my hands from picking and stealing and my tongue from evil speaking lying and slandering to keep my body in temperance soberness and chastity not to covet nor desire other mens goods but to learn and labor truly to get my own living and to do my duty in that state of life unto which it shall please god to call me  catechist my good child know this that thou art not able to do these things of thyself nor to walk in the commandments of god and to serve him without his special grace which thou must learn at all times to call for by diligent prayer let me hear therefore if thou can say the lords prayer  answer  our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread
