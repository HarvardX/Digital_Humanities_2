the principles of bridges containing the mathematical demonstrations of the properties of the arches the thickness of the piers the force of the water against them etc  together with practical observations and directions drawn from the whole  by cha hutton mathematician  newcastle printed by t saint and sold by j wilkie in st pauls church yard and h turpin in st johns street london and by kincaid and creech edinburgh       preface a large and elegant bridge forming a way over a broad and rapid river is justly esteemed one of the noblest pieces of mechanism that man is capable of performing and the usefulness of an art which at the same time that it connects distant shores by a way over the deep and rapid waters also allows those waters and their navigation to pass smooth and uninterrupted renders all probable attempts to advance the theory or practice of it highly deserving the encouragement of the public  this little book is offered as an attempt toward the perfection of the theory of this art in which the properties dimensions proportions and other relations of the various parts of a bridge are strictly demonstrated and clearly illustrated by various examples it is divided into five sections the  st treats on the projects of bridges containing a regular detail of the various circumstances and considerations that are cognizable in such projects the  d treats on arches demonstrating their various properties with the relations between their intrados and extrados and clearly distinguishes the most preferable curves to be used in a bridge the first two or three propositions being instituted after the manner of two or three done by mr emerson in his fluxions and mechanics the  d section treats on the piers demonstrating their thickness necessary for supporting any kind of an arch springing at any height and that both when part of the pier is supposed to be immersed in water and when otherwise the  th demonstrates the force of the water against the end or face of the pier considered as of different forms with the best form for dividing the stream etc and to it is added a table showing the several heights of the fall of the water under the arches arising from its velocity and the obstruction of the piers as it was composed by tho wright esquire of auckland in the county of durham who informs me it is part of a word on which he has spent much time and with which he intends to favor the public and the  th and last section contains a dictionary of the most material terms peculiar to the subject in which many practical observations and directions are given which could not be so regularly nor properly introduced into the former sections the whole it is presumed containing full directions for constituting and adapting to one another the several essential parts of a bridge so as to make it the strongest and the most convenient both for the passage over and under it that the situation and other circumstances will possibly admit not indeed for the actual methods of disposing the stones making of mortar or the external ornaments etc those things i do not descend to but leave to the discretion of the practical architect as being no part of the plan of my undertaking and for the same reason also i have given no views of bridges but only prints of such parts or figures as are necessary in explaining the elementary parts of the subject  as my profession is not that of an architect very probably i should never have turned my thoughts to this subject so as to address the public upon it had it not been from the occasion of an accident in that part of the country in which i reside viz the fall of newcastle and other bridges on the river tyne on the   th of november      occasioned by a high flood which rose about   feet higher at newcastle than the usual spring tides do  and this occasion having furnished me with many opportunities of hearing and seeing very absurd things advanced on the subject in general i thought the demonstrations of the relations of the essential parts of a bridge would not be unacceptable to those architects and others who may be capable of perceiving the force of them and whose ignorance may not have prejudiced them against things which they do not understand  in the  th section there is one thing forgotten to be remarked viz that in determining the best form of the end of the pier to be a rightlined triangle the water was supposed to strike every part of it with the same velocity had the variably increased velocity been used the form of the ends would come out a little curved but as the increase of the velocity in the best bridges is very small the difference in them is quite imperceptable  the principles of stone bridges section i of the projects of bridges with the design estimate etc when a bridge is deemed necessary to be built over a river the first consideration is the place of it or what particular situation will contain a maximum of the advantages over the disadvantages  in agitating this most important question every circumstance certain and probable attending or likely to attend the bridge should be separately minutely and impartially stated and examined and the advantage or disadvantage of it rated at a value proportioned to it then the difference between the whole advantages and disadvantages will be the neat value of that particular situation for which the calculation is made and by doing the same for any other situations all their neat values will be found and of consequence the most preferable situation among them  or in a competition between two place if each ones advantage over the other be estimated or valued in every circumstance attending them the sums of their advantages will show whether of them is the better and the same being done for this and a third and so on the best situation of all will be obtained  in this estimation a great number of particulars must be included and nothing omitted that can be found to make a part of the consideration  among these the situation of the town or place for the convenience of which the bridge is chiefly to be made will naturally produce a particular of the first consequence and a great many others ought to be sacrificed to it if possible the bridge should be placed where there can conveniently be opened and made passages or streets from the ends of it in every direction and especially one as nearly in the direction of the bridge itself as possible tending toward the body of the town without narrows or crooked windings and easily communicating with the chief streets thoroughfares etc  and here every person in judging of this should divest himself of all partial regards or attachments whatever think and determine for the good of the whole only and for posterity as well as the present  the banks or declivities toward the river are also of particular concern as they affect the convenience of the passage to and from the bridge or determine the height of it upon which in a great measure depends the expense  the breadth of the river the navigation upon it and the quantity of water to be passed or the velocity and depth of the stream from also considerations of great moment as they determine the bridge to be higher or lower longer or shorter however in most cases a wide part of the river ought rather to be chosen than a narrow one especially if it is subject to great tides or floods for the increased velocity of the stream in the narrow part being again augmented by the farther contraction of the breadth by the piers of the bridge will both incommode the navigation through the arches and undermine the piers and endanger the whole bridge  the nature of the bed of the river is also of great concern it having a great influence on the expense as upon it and the depth and velocity of the stream depend the manner of laying the foundations and building the piers  these are the chief and capital articles of consideration and which will branch themselves out into other dependent ones and so lead to the required estimate of the whole  having resolved on the place the next considerations are the form the estimate of the expense and the manner of execution  with respect to the form strength utility and beauty ought to be regarded and united the chief part of which lies in the arches the form of the arches will depend on their height and span and the height on that of the water the navigation and the adjacent banks they ought to be made so high as that they may easily transmit the water at its greatest height either from tides or floods and their height and figure ought also to be such as will easily allow of a convenient passage of the craft through them this and the disposition of it above so as to render the passage over it also convenient make up its utility  having fixed the heights of the arches their spans are still necessary for determining their figure their spans will be known by dividing the whole breadth of the river into a convenient number of arches and piers allowing at least the necessary thickness of the piers out of the whole in fixing on the number of arches take always an odd number and rather take few and large ones than many and smaller if convenient for thus you will have not only fewer foundations and piers to make with fewer arches and centers which will produce great savings in the expense but the arches themselves will also require much less materials and workmanship and allow of more and better passage for the water and craft through them and will appear at the same time more noble and beautiful especially if constructed in elliptical or in cycloidal forms for the truth of which it may be sufficient to refer to that noble and elegant bridge lately built at blackfriars london by mr mylne and here i cannot help remarking that the gentleman who a few years since in a pamphlet on the principles of bridges censured mr mylne and mr muller concerning elliptic arches has very much exposed himself and absurdly criticizes them through his own want of mathematical knowledge which he somewhere in the same pamphlet affects to despise he brings to my mind an expression of i think mr henry fielding somewhere in his works that a person does not speak the worse on a subject for knowing something about it i do not however make this remark through any particular disrespect for this gentleman concerning whom i know nothing farther any more than i do about the other two gentlemen but only to prevent others from being prejudiced and misled by the authority of his ipse dixit  if the top of the bridge be a straight horizontal line let the arches be made all of a size if it be a little lower at the ends than the middle the arches must proportionally decrease from the middle toward the ends but if higher at the ends than the middle let them increase toward the ends a choice of the most convenient arches is to be made from the  th and  th propositions where their several properties etc are demonstrated and pointed out among them the elliptic cycloidal and equilibrial arch in prop   will generally claim the preference both on account of their strength beauty and cheapness or saving in materials and labor other particulars also concerning them may be seen under the word arch in the dictionary in the last section and as the choice of the arch is of so great moment let no person either through ignorance or indolence prefer a worse arch because it may seem to him easier to construct for he would very ill deserve the name or employment of an architect who is incapable of rendering the exact construction of these curves easy and familiar to himself but if by chance a bridgebuilder should be employed who is incapable of doing that he ought at least to be endowed with such a share of honesty as to procure some person to go through the calculations which he cannot make for himself  next find what thickness at the keystone or top will be necessary for the arches for which see the word keystone in the dictionary in the last section  having thus obtained all the parts of the arches with the height of the piers the necessary thickness of the piers themselves are next to be computed by prop  0  this done the chief and material requisites are found the elevation and plans of the design can then be drawn and the calculations of the expense form thence made including the foundations with such ornamental or accidental appendages as shall be thought fit which i shall leave to the discretion of the practical architect as being no part of the plan of my undertaking together with the practical methods of carrying the design into execution i shall however in the dictionary in the last section not only describe the terms parts machines etc but also speak of their dimensions properties and any thing else material belonging to them and to which therefore i from hence refer for more explicit information in each particular article as well as to these immediately following propositions in which the theory of the arches piers etc are fully and strictly demonstrated  section ii of the arches proposition i let there be any number of lines ab bc cd de etc all in the same vertical plane connected together and moveable about the joints or angles a b c d e f the two extreme points a and f being fixed it is required to find the proportions of the weights to be laid upon the angles b c d etc so that the whole may remain in equilibrium  diagram  solution from the several angles having drawn the lines bb cc dd etc perpendicular to the horizon about them as diagonals constitute parallelograms such that those sides of each two that are upon the same one of the given lines may be equal to each other viz having made one parallelogram mn take cp  bn and form the parallelogram pq then take dr  cq and make the parallelogram rs and take et  ds and form the parallelogram tv and so on then the said vertical diagonals bb cc dd ee etc of those parallelograms will be proportional to the weights as required  demonstration by the resolution of forces each of the weights or forces bb cc dd etc in the diagonals of the parallelograms is equal to and may be resolved into two forces expressed by two adjacent sides of the parallelogram viz the force bb will be resolved into the two forces bm bn and in those directions the force cc into the two forces cp cq and in those directions the force dd into the two forces dr ds and in those directions and so on then since two forces that are equal and in opposite directions do mutually balance each other therefore the several pairs of forces bn and cp cq and dr ds and et etc being equal and opposite by the construction do mutually destroy or balance each other and the extreme forces bm ev are balanced by the opposite resistances of the sixed points a f wherefore there is no force to change the position of any one of the lines and consequently they will all remain in equilibrium qed  corollary hence if one of the weights and the positions of all the lines be given all the other weights may be found  proposition ii if any number of lines that are connected together and moveable about the points of connection be kept in equilibrium by weights laid upon the angles as in the last proposition then will the weight on any angle c be universally as  that is directly as the sine of that angle and reciprocally as the sines of the two parts or angles into which that angle is divided by a line drawn through it perpendicular to the horizon  demonstration by the last proposition the weights are as bb cc dd etc when bn  pc cq  rd ds  te etc but since the angle abb is  the angle bbn and the angle bcc  the angle ccq etc as being always the alternate angles made by a line cutting two other parallel lines also the sine of the abc  s bnb and s bcd  s cqc as being supplements one to another by plane trigonometry we shall have bn bbxsabb  sabc  cp ccxsccd  sbcd cq ccxsbcc  sbcd  dr ddxsdde  scde ds ddxscdd  scde  et eexseef  sdef etc  hence bb cc sabc  sabb sbcd  sccd cc dd sbcd  sbcc scde  sdde dd ee scde  scdd sdef  seef etc  or by dividing the latter terms of the first of these proportions each by s bbc and then compounding together two of the proportions then three of them etc striking out the common factors and observing that the s bbc is  s bbc the s ccd  s cdd etc we shall have bb cc sabc  sabbxsbbc sbcd  sbccxsccd bb dd sabc  sabbxsbbc scde  scddxsdde bb ee sabc  sabbxsbbc sdef  sdeexseef etc qed  otherwise since cp or bn bm or nb s bbn or s abb s bbc or s bcc  sbcc  sabb and cp or qc cq or dr s ccq or s cdd s ccq or s bcc  sbcc  scdd it is clear that cp is as  sbcc that is the forces mb pc rd etc are reciprocally as the sines of the angles which they make with the vertical line  and since cc is  cpxscpc  sccp  cpxsbcd  sccd therefore any force cc is as sbcd  sccbxsccd qed  corollary if dc be produced to h the sine of the hcb being  to the sine of its supplement bcd the weight or force cc will be as shcb  sbccxccd which three angles together make up two right angles  proposition iii to find the proportion of the height of the wall above every point of an arch of equilibration that is if ghik be the top of a wall supported by an arch abcd it is required to find the proportion of the perpendiculars bh ci etc so that all the parts of the arch may be kept in equilibrium from falling by the weight or pressure of the superincumbent wall  diagram  solution the lines of equilibration in the former propositions being imagined to become indefinitely small they will constitute a curve of equilibration and the weights will press upon every point of it and will be respectively equal to the perpendiculars bh ci etc drawn into their respective breadths supposing them to be indefinitely narrow parallelograms also the angle hcb will become the angle of contact formed by the tangent and curve whose sine is equal to the angle itself or its measure and the angles ccb and ccd become equal to the angles cch cck or equal to the angles ick ich whose sines are equal because the angles are supplements to each other these values being substituted in the expression in the corollary to the last proposition we shall have the force cc or parallelogram ci as  or as   now supposing these narrow parallelograms to stand upon indefinitely small equal parts of the arch their breadths will be directly as the s kci and inversly as radius hence the parallelogram ic x s kci is as  and consequently the altitude ic as  or as the  cp being perpendicular to ci and the radius all along equal to unity  but the angle of contact kcd is as the curvature of the arch and that again is inversly as the radius of curvature wherefore ic is as  or as  putting r for the radius of curvature to the point c that is the height of the wall above any point is reciprocally as the radius of curvature and cube of the sine of the angle in which the vertical line cuts the curve in that point or reciprocally as the radius of curvature and directly as the cube of the secant of the curves inclination to the horizon  corollary   hence if the form of the arch or nature of the curve abcd be given the form of the line ghik bounding the top of the wall or forming the extrados may be found so that abcd shall be an arch of equilibration or be in equilibrium in all its parts by the pressure of the wall  for since the arch is given the radius of curvature and position of the tangent at every point of it will be given and consequently the proportions of the verticals bh ci etc and by assuming one of them or making it equal to an assigned length the rest will be found from it and then the line ghi etc may be drawn through the extremities of them all  corollary   and if the line ghik forming the top of the wall be given the curve of equilibration abcd may be found and the manner of finding them both the one from the other we shall teach in the two following propositions  corollary   if the arch abcd be a circle the radius of curvature will be constant and the angle kcp always measured by the arc dc supposing d the vertex of the curve and then ci will be everywhere as the cube of the secant of the arc dc  proposition iv having given the intrados to find the extrados that is given the nature or form of an arch to find the nature of the line forming the top of the superincumbent wall by whose pressure the arch is kept in equilibrium  solution let d be the vertex of the given curve abcd and k that of the required line ghik put a  dk x  ap the abscissa y  pc the ordinate z  dc the arch and r  the radius of curvature at the point c  now by the last prop ci is as  but by similar triangles as y z   radius z y  sec kcp therefore ci is as z ry  again in every curve whose ordinate is refered to an axis the radius of curvature r is  z  yx xy wherefore ci will be as yx xy y  or ci  yxxy  y  x q where q is a constant quantity whose value will be determined by taking the expression for the given perpendicular dk at the vertex of the curve  corollary hence then as either x or y may be supposed to flow uniformly and consequently either of their second fluxions equal to nothing by striking either of the terms out of the numerator of the above value of ci and then exterminating either of the unknown quantities by the equation of the curve the value of ci will be obtained as is done in the following examples  example   to find the extrados of a circular arch diagram  let q be the center and d the vertex of the given circular arch k the vertex of the extrados and the other lines as in the figure  put a  dk r  aq  quoth  the radius x  dp and y  pc  ri  then  and  by making x  0 hence  but at the vertex x is  0 and then ci is  consequently the value of q is  ar and the general value of ci or  is   otherwise by making y constant the notation remaining as before we have   and  hence ci or yxxy  y  x q becomes  this when y  0 gives a  q r and q  ar as before and consequently ci or  is  as before  hence the equation to the curve ki is  or   corollary   hence kig is a curve running up an infinite height toward g the perpendicular ag being an asymptote to it and the curve is accurately as represented in the figure when the thickness dk at the top is    th of the span  corollary   but the curve kig is quite inconvenient for the form of the extrados of any bridge diagram however a straight horizontal line ik might be used instead of it if the materials of which the arch is built could be so chosen as that they might increase in their specific gravity from dk toward ci continually as the cube of the secant of the arch from d and this again perhaps would be quite impracticable but if a circular arch and a right line at the top were necessarily required the proportion of dk to the radius dq may be found so as the arch may be nearly in equilibrium thus  when ki is a right line then kr in the figure to the example must be nothing or rather when the curve crosses the horizontal line then kr is equal to nothing put its value then as found above equal to o and we shall have  and from this equation by assuming one of the quantities a y the corresponding value of the other may be found for the point where the curve crosses the horizontal line so from hence the general value of a is  now this value of a or dk evidently becomes  0 when the arch consists of the whole semicircle but when the arch is less than the semicircle a will have a finite value and between  0 and   0 degrees many arches of equilibration of a certain thickness at top may be found thus if the half arch dc contain  0 degrees then its sine y or pc is  r which being substituted for it in the above general value of a we have a        x    r or  r extremely near that is dk is  of dq or of  pc the span when the curve cuts the horizontal line directly above the point in the circle which answers to  0 degrees and if dc were an arch of    degrees then y  r   and a        x r     r 00 or    of the span nearly also if dc were  0 degrees then y  r   and a     th of r    r 00 or     of the span nearly  so that in each of these cases the points c and d would be in equilibrium but then about the middle parts between d and c or rather nearer to d than to c the materials should be a little lighter than at d and c and the exact proportion in which their gravity should be diminished might easily be found by calculation so in the first case in particular the specific gravity of the materials in the middle of the arch between d and c that is at    degrees from d should be to that at d or c as     to     which is but a very inconsiderable decrease and may be very well neglected  in the first two cases the thickness at the top would be too much but in the latter one when the whole arch is   0 degrees the thickness is just about that which the best architects now allow and in greater arches the thickness would become too little so that an arch of nearly about   0 degrees is the only part of a circle that can be used with any degree of propriety  example   to determine the extrados of an elliptical arch of equilibration diagram  suppose the curve in the above figure to be a semiellipse with either the longer or shorter axe horizontal and let h denote the horizontal semiaxe aq and r the vertical one dq and all the other letters as in the last example  then by the nature of the ellipse  hence  and  by making x constant then  is  but when x is  0 this expression becomes a  rq hh and then q  ahh r consequently ci is  the same as in the circle  and the same expression may be brought out by making y constant  hence the nature of the curve ki is thus expressed  and is of the same kind with that in the last example  but the elliptic arch may take a straight line at top better than the circular one when the longer axe is horizontal because the arch is flatter or of a less curvature and worse than the circular arch when the shorter axe is horizontal  example   to determine the figure of the extrados of a parabolic arch of equilibration diagram  put a  kd r  dq h  qa x  dp and y  pc  ri  then by the nature of the curve hh yy r x  ryy hh and hence x    ryy hh and x    ry hh by making y constant then ci  x y  x q is    rq hh  a constant quantity  a that is ci is everywhere equal to kd  consequently kr is  dp and since ri is  pc it is evident that ki is the same parabolic curve with dc and may be placed any height above it  example   to find the figure of the extrados for an hyperbolic arch of equilibration diagram  put a  kd r  the semitransverse and h  the semiconjugate axe x  dp and y  pc  ri  then by the nature of the hyperbola  hence  and  by making x constant wherefore ci or  but when x  0 this expression becomes rq hh a hence q ahh r and consequently ci or  is   whence the equation to the curve ki required will be   scholium in this hyperbolic arch then it is evident that the extrados ki continually approaches nearer to the intrados whereas in the circular and elliptic arches it goes off continually farther from it and in the parabola the two curves keep always at the same distance observing however that by the distance between the two curves in each of these cases is meant their distance in the vertical direction  example   to find the extrados for a catenarian arch of equilibration diagram  let a  kd x  dp and y  pc  ri as before also let c denote the constant tension of the curve at the vertex  then by the nature of the catenary y is  c x hyp log of  hence taking the fluxions we have  and  by making x constant wherefore ci or  xy y  x q is c x cc x q but at the vertex x is  0 and ci  a  q c consequently q is  ac this being written for it there results ci  c x c x a  a  ax c  hence for the nature of the curve ki we have kr   a  x  ci  x  ax c  c a c x x  corollary and hence the abscissa dp is to the abscissa kr always in the constant proportion of c to c  a so that when a is less than c r and the curve ki lies below the horizontal line but when a is greater than c they lie above it and when a is equal to c kr is always equal to nothing and ki or the extrados coincides with the horizontal line  as a diminishes the line ki approaches nearer to dc in all its parts till when a entirely vanishes or is so little in respect of c as to be omitted in the expression c a c x x  kr the two curves quite coincide throughout  scholium as we have found above that the extrados will be a straight horizontal line when a is equal to c i shall here make a calculation to determine in that case the value of c and consequently of a with respect to x and y or a given span and height of an arch  now the equation to the curve expressed in terms of c x and y is y  c x hyp log of  and when x and y are given the value of c may be found from this equation by the method of trial and error but as the process would be at best but a tedious one and perhaps the method not easy in this case to be practiced by every person i shall here investigate a series for finding the value of c from those of x and y in a direct manner  since then y is  c x hyp log of  by taking the fluxion of this equation we have  by writing d for   c and by expanding this expression into a series it becomes y  x d x x    x  d     x    d       x     d        x      d etc and by taking the fluents we have y  dx x    x   d     x     d       x      d        x       d  etc and hence by dividing by x we have y x  d x x    x   d     x     d       x      d        x       d  etc or by writing v for y x and w for d x it is v  w      w        w           w             w  etc then by reverting this series we have w  v     v      0 v       0 0 v        00 v  etc and hence by squaring etc and restoring the original letters it is  d  xw   c  x x y  x      x    y       x    0 y         x     00 y  etc where a few of the first terms are sufficient to determine the value of c pretty nearly  now for an example in numbers suppose the height of the arch to be  0 feet and its span  00 which are nearly the dimensions of the middle arch of blackfriars bridge at london then x   0 and y   0 which being substituted for them in this series it gives c       feet nearly so that to have made that arch a catenarian one with a straight line above the top of the arch must have been almost of the immense thickness of    feet to have kept it in equilibrium  but if the height and span be  0 and  00 feet as above and the thickness of the arch at top be assumed equal to   feet then the extrados will not be a right line but as it is drawn in the figure to this example which figure is accurately constructed according to these dimensions  it may be farther remarked that the curves in these last three examples viz the parabola hyperbola and catenary are all very improper for the arches of a bridge consisting of several arches because it is evident from their figures which are all accurately constructed that all the building or filling up of the flanks of the arches will tend to destroy the equilibrium of them but in a bridge of one single arch whose extrados rises pretty much from the spring to the top one of these figures will answer better than any of the former ones  example   to determine the extrados of a cycloidal arch of equilibration diagram  let dzq be the circle from which the cycloid dca is generated and the other lines as before  put a  dk x  dp and y  pc  ri also put d  dq the diameter of the circle and z  the circular arc dz  then by the nature of the cycloid cz is always equal to dz  z and by the nature of the circle pz is  wherefore pc or  hence  but  by the nature of the circle therefore  and then  making x constant hence  but when x  0 ci is  a  q  d therefore q    ad and then the general value of ci is   consequently  will express the nature of the curve ki which resembles that for the circle and ellipse as evidently appears by comparing the figures together each of them being accurately constructed but this figure seems to be rather better than either of them as the extrados approaches rather nearer to a right line and extends farther out before it is bent upwards  other examples of known curves might be given but those that have been put down already seem to be the fittest for real practice and there is a sufficient variety among them to suit the various circumstances of convenience strength and beauty  i shall now proceed to another general problem which is the reverse of the last one and determines the figure of the intrados for any given figure of the extrados so that the arch may be in equilibrium in all its parts  proposition v having the extrados given to find the intrados that is having given the nature or form of a line bounding the top of a wall above an arch to find the figure of the arch so that by the pressure of the superincumbent wall the whole may remain in equilibrium  solution put a  dk the thickness of the arch at top x  dp the abscissa of the intrados dc z  kr the abscissa of the given extrados ki and y  pc  ri their equal ordinates  diagram  then by the last proposition ci is  yx xy y  x q but ci is also evidently equal to a  x  z therefore a  x  z is  yx xy y  x q  q y x the fluxion of x y where q is a constant quantity as used in the last proposition and always to be determined from the nature or conditions of each particular case  hence then by substituting in this equation the given value of z instead of it as expressed in terms of y the resulting equation will then involve only x and y together with their first and second fluxions besides constant quantities and from it the relation between x and y themselves may be found by the application of such methods as may seem to be best adapted to the particular form of the given equation to the extrados in general a proper series for the value of x in terms of y is to be assumed with indeterminate coefficients which series being put into fluxions striking out of every term the fluxion of y and the result fluxed again striking out from every term of this also the fluxion of y the last expression drawn into q being equated to a  x  z there will be produced an equation from which will be found the values of the coefficients of the terms in the assumed value of x  but in the particular case when z is always nothing or the extrados a right horizontal line a different and easier process obtains as in this following example  example to find an arch of equilibration whose extrados shall be a horizontal line diagram  making the notation as in the proposition we have z  0 and therefore a  x  q y x the fluxion of x y  now assume y  x v then x y  v and q y x flux of x y  qvv x that is a  x  qvv x hence ax  xx  qvv then by taking the fluents we have   ax  x   qv  hence v    ax xx q and consequently  then the fluent of this is  but when x  0 this is q x hyp log of   a therefore the correct fluent is   or the fluent might be otherwise found thus  the equation a  x  yx xy y  x q supposing y constant becomes a  x  qx y  or ay   xy   qx multiply by x and then axy   xxy   qxx and hence by taking the fluents   axy   x  y   qx  consequently y   qx   ax xx or  and then the rest will be as above  now the value of q will be found by writing in this equation some particular correspondent known values of x and y thus when p arrives at q then x  dq  r and y  qa  h these being substituted for them we have  and consequently  wherefore the general value of y is thus   hence when q is  a the curve dc is the catenary and in general the ordinate is everywhere to the corresponding ordinate of the catenary whose tension at the vertex is a as h is to   if x were desired in terms of y it would be thus put a  the hyp log of a and  then  again put n  the number whose hyp log is die  a then  and hence  or a  x  kp  n  a   n  by taking aq  h   0 and dq  r   0 also dk  a    then the hyp log of  is  the hyp log of  the hyp log of                   by which dividing h   0 the quotient is          so that the ordinate y will be constantly in that case equal to          x the hyp log of  also           0        is  d and a  hyp log of             then n  the number whose hyp log is          0        y and then by assuming several values of one of the letters x y the corresponding values of the other will be found from one of the two equations above  and in this manner were calculated the numbers in the following table from which the curve being constructed it will be as appears in the figure to the example  and thus we have an arch in equilibrium in all its parts and its top a straight line as is generally required in most bridges or at least they are so near a horizontal line that their difference from it will cause no sensible ill consequence it is also both both of a graceful figure and of a convenient form for the passage through it so that there can be no good reason for neglecting to use it in works of any consequence  the table for constructing the curve in this example value of ki

above numbers may be feet or any other lengths of which dq is  0 and qa is  0 but when dq is to qa in any other proportion than that of   to   or when dk is not to dq as   to  0 or   to  0 then the above numbers will not answer but others must be found by the same rule to construct the curve by  in the beginning of the table as far as    the value of ki is made to differ by   because the value of ic in that part increases so very slowly  other examples of given extrados might be taken but as there can scarcely ever by any real occasion for them and as the trouble of calculation would be in most cases extremely great they are omitted  section iii of the piers proposition vi to find the distance qm of the center of gravity of the given circular arc ad from dq the versed sine of the said arc qa being its right sine  solution put r  the radius z  any arc dr and x  its sine tr or qs  diagram  then by mechanics the force of a particle z of the curve placed at r is tr x z  xz and the force of all the particles will be equal to the fluent of xz which must be equal to qm drawn into the whole line that is qm x z  the fluent of xz or qm    z x fluent of xz and this is a geneneral theorem whether z be a line surface or solid supposing the two former to be affected with gravity  now by the nature of the circle  and therefore  the correct fluent of which is  consequently qm is  which when x  qa and z  the arc ad becomes  the distance from dq required  or since  the same distance qm will be expressed by r x dq  ard  or lastly since r x quoth is half the square of the chord ad the same distance qm will be equal to ad  ard or aq quoth  ard  corollary when ard is a quadrant then aq  quoth  r and the rule is qm   rrard  rr    x  r  r   0  or qm  r nearly or      r extremely near  proposition vii the figure being the same as in the last proposition in is required to find the distance qm of the center of gravity of the arc ard from the sine aq  solution as in the last proposition qm will be   ar x the fluent of sr x ar  but putting z  ar x  qs  rt r  the radius h  dq and s  qa we shall have  and  hence  the correct fluent of which is   consequently qm is  h  r  s x z  r  h  r  as  z  r and when r arrives at d it is qm  h  r  sr a  or since r is  ss hh  h the same distance qm will be  hh ss  h  hh ss  h  s a where a is the whole arc ard  corollary when ard is a quadrant then h and s are each  s and the rule is rr a the same as in the corollary to the last  proposition viii to find the distance qm of the center of gravity of the space aikdsa from kq supposing da to be a circular arc whose sine is aq its versed sine quoth and ai ik parallel to dq qa respectively  solution draw rs st parallel to dq qa and put a  dk r  vd  vw the radius of the circle x  ts

qm    a r a     r x r    a r  a     r x r  or qm is    a r  a r x r    a  r  a  r x r nearly or rather it is    a r  a    r x r     a   r   a  r x r extremely near  corollary   when a is nothing then ad being a quadrant qm is r      or it is    r very nearly  and when a is     r then qm is r      or      r very nearly  lastly when a      r which is nearly the proportion in pretty large arches then qm is  r  0  or    r very nearly  proposition ix to find the distance of the center of gravity of the space kidsa from the sine qa of the circular arc asd where ki is perpendicular to qak and the rest of the lines as in the last figure  solution put a  ka s  aq m  kq  a  s r  vw  vd the radius z  any variable space krsa and x  ts the sine of the arc sd also a  the space kidsa  then rs  m  x and by the circle  hence  consequently  the correct fluent of which is s  x   x m  s  x   wherefore the distance from vw is vm  s  x   z x m  s  x   z for the general space krsa  and when s arrives at d x is

r and the rule becomes as in corollary   to the last also the  d corollary to that may be understood here making the same suppositions as in it  scholium the four preceding propositions are premised as necessary to the examples to the following general one which determines the thickness of the piers necessary to resist the spread or shoot of any given arch and that whether the whole or part or none of it is immersed in water instances only of circular arcs are here given because that in determining the drift of the arch whatever its curve may be it will make little or no difference by supposing it to be circular  proposition x to find the thickness of the piers of an arch necessary to keep the arch in equilibrium or to resist its shoot or drift independent of any other arches  diagram  solution let ikda be the half arch and ihgl the pier to support it moveable about the point g and bisected by the perpendicular of  through the center of gravity of the arch aikd draw mn perpendicular to aq the semispan and meeting dn drawn parallel to aq in n and continue qa to meet gh in b  put a  dk h  dq  mn c  am a  the area or section aikd of the arch d  al  bg e  fe and x  ab  gl the required breadth of the pier  now by prop    emer mechan the weight of the arch is to its pressure in the direction ab as nm is to ma hence h c a ca h  the force or shoot of the arch in the direction ab which being drawn into the length of the lever bg  d we have cda h for the efficacious force of the arch to overset the pier or to turn it about the point g again ex is  the area of the section of the pier which being supposed to be collected into the middle line of it may be considered as a weight appended to the end e of the lever eg therefore ex x eg  exx will be the efficacious force of the pier to prevent its being overturned and that the arch and pier may be just kept in equilibrium we must make the force and resistance equal to each other that is exx  cda h hence then x    cda eh   amxalx adqxef will be the breadth or thickness of the pier required  in the above investigation it is supposed that the whole of the pier was out of water but if any part of it ol be supposed to be immersed in water that part will lose so much of its weight as is equal to its bulk of water and since the specific gravity of water is to that of common stone as   is to   or as   to   it is evident that ol will lose   parts in   of its weight hence then putting g  og since og x gl  gx is the area immersed therefore gx  the weight lost by the immersion which being taken from ex the whole we shall have ex     gx as the weight remaining appended to e then this being drawn into ge  x and the product equated to the efficacious force of the arch as before we have exx     gxx  cda h and hence x   0 cda h  e  g for the thickness of the pier when it is immersed in water to the height expressed by g  or because g will be nearly equal to d the theorem for the thickness may be x   0 cda h  e  d   0amxalx adqx of al  corollary   when da is a quadrant the arch is a complete semicircle and then h is  r  as in cor   to prop   and by the same corollary c or r  qm is  consequently ca is   this value being substituted in the two preceding theorems we have  thickness of the pier when it it is dry  or if n express what part a is of r or dk    nth of dq or qa the same thickness will be   and the thickness when al is under water will be   or if a  r n as before the same thickness will be   corollary   diagram  when hg is  bg in the last figure then the arch and pier will be as in this annexed figure and e being then  d the two general theorems will become x    ca h    axam  dq for the thickness of the pier when dry and x   0 ca  h   0 axam   dq  the thickness when under water  so that in this case it makes no difference of whatever height la the pier is to the springing of the arch for though the drift of the arch be increased with the length of the lever or height of the pier the weight of the pier itself which acts against it is also increased in the same proportion  scholium in the investigation of this proposition the sections of the arch and pier are used for their solidities as being evidently in the same proportion or in that of their weights since they are of the same length viz the breadth of the bridge  by the above rules together with those in the four preceding propositions the necessary thickness of a pier may be found so that it shall just balance the spread or shoot of the arch independent of any other arch on the other side of the pier but the weight of the pier ought a little to preponderate against or exceed in effect the shoot of the arch and therefore the thickness ought to be taken a little more than what will be found by these rules unless it be supposed that the pointed projections of the piers against the stream beyond the common breadth of the bridge will be a sufficient addition to the pier to give it the necessary preponderancy  but there is one very material thing on account of which the thickness of the piers may be much diminished viz by the stones of the wall above the voussoirs being bonded in with those of the pier and with one another the pier will carry part of their weight which will not only diminish the weight of the whole arch and wall but will also both add the same to the weight of the pier and lengthen the lever eg by moving the center of gravity a little nearer to l but then also m will be a little nearer to q so that am will be longer and the effects of the change of the centers of gravity may be supposed nearly to balance each other  in the foregoing propositions i have considered circular arches only as it will make no difference of any consequence to suppose the arches of any other curve of the same span and pitch but this  0th prop is general for all curves  i shall now add a few examples of the calculation in numbers to show the manner and in them also to point out the easiest methods of calculation  example   supposing the arch in the figure to the proposition to be a semicircle whose height or pitch is    feet and consequently its span  0 feet also suppose the thickness dk at top to be   feet and the height la to the springing    and let it be required to find the thickness gl of the pier necessary to resist the drift of the arch  this will be immediately found by cor   in which aq is     al     and n  r a          then the first expression  will become   0       0    or    feet nearly for the thickness of the pier when dry  and the latter expression  will give   0           feet for the thickness when    feet are under water  example   in the same figure suppose the span to be  00 feet the height  0 feet also the thickness at top   feet and the height of the pier to the springer    feet as before  here the figure either is or may be considered as a scheme arch or the segment of a circle in which the versed sine quoth is   0 and the right sine qa   0 also dk    al     of      now by the nature of the circle the radius vd  r is  qa quoth  quoth   0  0  0   0 hence vq       0     and the area of the semisegment adq will be found to be    0     or      nearly which being taken from the rectangle aikq  aq x qk   0 x       00 there remains  0   a the area aikd then by prop   qm will be  vd vq   a x vk  vd vq   a             x 0  x                x 0        and consequently ma  aq  qm   0              then the first expression  alxamx adqxef will become   x    x 0  0x         or    feet nearly  the thickness of the pier when dry  and the latter expression  0alxamx adqx of al will give   0x    x 0  0x  0       0  or    feet nearly  the thickness when    feet are under water  example   diagram  let the arch be of the gothic kind as in the annexed figure in which da is a circular arc whose center is v its sine dq   0  the height of the arch its versed sine aq   0  the semispan the thickness at top dk    and the height al of the pier to the spring     as before  here the radius va     as in the last example and the semisegment adq       also the same as in the last example then the rectangle iq is  aq x qk   0 x        0 from which taking the semisegment there remains      a for the area aikd then by prop   vm will be equal to  kddq    a x dq      0 x    x  0        and hence ma  c                    then the first expression  alxamx adqxil will become   x    x    0x         or nearly  0 feet for the thickness of the pier when when it is all out of water  and the latter one  0alxmax adqx il al will give   0x    x 0  0x  0     0 0  or  0 nearly  the thickness when    feet are under water  example   when the arch stones only are laid and the pier built no higher than the spring it will appear as in the figure to corollary   and then if in the first case the arch be a complete semicircle whose diameter is  0 feet and the thickness everywhere dk  as    feet it is required to find the breadth of the piers  the bounding arcs being quadrants the area adks will be adks    x dk   0 0   x     x        x            a now if tw be another concentric quadrant bisecting the area adks the center of gravity of tw may be taken for that of the said area and then by the corollary to prop   qm will be     qt but since the quadrants qda qtw qks are in arithmetic progression the squares of their semidiameters quoth qt qk will be in the same progression that is  qt   quoth   qk  or qt  quoth qk               0   hence then qm      qt is      x   0     0 0  and consequently ma       0        then the former of the two expressions in corollary   to this proposition will give gl or   axam  dq   0  x         0   or    feet for the thickness of the pier when out of water  and the latter one  0 axam   dq will become     x             or nearly    feet for the thickness when the pier is immersed in water  scholium or because qt is nearly an arithmetic mean between quoth and qk half the sum of od and qk might have been used instead of it without causing any sensible difference in the conclusion  we might also exhibit general theorems for the thickness in terms of the radius only for taking qt or qw  quothqk    by the corollary to prop   we have qm      qw  quothqk     x   and thence am  c  aq  qm  qa   quoth qk       quoth dk     also a  adks    x dk  quothqk    x     dk   quothdk     x   dk then these values being substituted in the expression   axam  quoth we shall have   quoth  qdxdk dk   quoth x dk for the thickness of the pier when dry and the same expression multiplied by    will give the thickness when the pier is immersed in water and farther if dk be assumed equal to any part of dq as dk  n x dq then the thickness in the former case will be quoth x     n  nn   x n and in the latter quoth x  0 0 n   nn   x n  then by assuming several values of n from   0 to which are beyond the limits of it the several breadths of the piers corresponding to the several values of the thickness of the arch both when the pier is supposed to be out of water and immersed in it will be found from these expressions as in the following table where the fractional part    or     is also given because it is the most common proportion  a table of the breadth or thickness of a pier answering to the several thicknesses of a semicircular arch as in the foregoing example quoth being the radius or

same figure in cor   to be a circular segment whose chord or span is  00 feet and height  0 feet also the thickness of the arch   feet to find the thickness of the piers  here the radius of the middle arc tw is qw qt  qt                   hence tw is an arc of      and its length will be        which being multiplied by dk  as    we have a          then by prop   qm will be found         x              and consequently am   0                hence by cor   it will be   axam  dq         x      0 the thickness of the pier when dry  and  0 axam   dq         x       0     0   the thickness in water  otherwise but if the arch be supposed to increase in thickness from the top at d where it is   feet all the way to the spring where it is as     feet suppose the height and span being  0 and  00 as before  then qs     qw     and qt     hence the radius of the arc tw will be qw qt  qt                   and therefore tw is an arc of  0  0 and its length         consequently the area adks or tw x dkas    will be        x           a and by prop   qm will be        x          0   and therefore am   0    0           hence as above      x      0        will be the thickness of the pier when dry  and      x       0         the thickness in water  example   in a gothic arch whose thickness at top is   the span  0 and height  0 feet to find the thickness of the piers  diagram  by the last example tw is         its radius        and the area adks          then by prop   we have  and hence am   0                then by cor   we shall have  x       x      0        for the thickness of the pier when dry  and        x       0    0   the thickness when in water  also if the arch stones were supposed to lengthen all the way from the top toward the lower end the calculation might be made as in the last example  having in these  d and  d sections gone through the calculations for the form of arches and the thickness of piers i shall now in the next section add some investigations of rules for determining the best form of the ends of the piers with the force of the water upon them etc  section iv the force of the water etc proposition xi to determine the form of the ends of a pier so as to make the least resistance to or be the least subject to the force of the stream of water  solution let the following figure represent a horizontal section of the pier ab its breadth cd the given length or projection of the end and adb the line required whether right or curved also let of represent the force of a particle of water acting on ad at f in the direction parallel to the axe cd produce of to meet ab in g and draw the tangent fh also draw eh perpendicular to fh hi perpendicular to of and fk perpendicular to dc  diagram  now the absolute force of of the particle of water may be resolved into the two forces eh hf and in those directions of these the latter one acting parallel to the curve is of no effect and the former eh is resolved into the two ei ih so that ei is the efficacious force of the particle to move the pier in the direction of its axe or length that is the absolute force is to the efficacious force as of is to ei  then since of is the diameter of a semicircle passing through h by the nature of the circle we shall have of ei of  eh  by similar triangles hf  hi  and the square of the fluxion of the curve or line the square of the fluxion of the ordinate fk because hf hi are parallel to the line and ordinate  wherefore putting the abscissa dk  x the ordinate kf  y and the line df  z we shall have as z  y    the force of y  z   the force of the particle at f to move the pier in the direction efg but the number of particles striking against the indefinitely small part of the line is as y this drawn into the above found force of each we have y  z   y  x  y  for the fluxion of the force or the force acting against the part z of the line  but by the proposition the whole force on dfa must be a minimum or the fluent of y  x  y  must be a minimum when that of x becomes equal to the constant quantity dc in which case it will be found that  must be always equal to a constant quantity q and hence   now in this equation it is evident that x is to y in a constant ratio but if two fluxions be always in a constant ratio their fluents x y are known to be also in a constant ratio which is the property of a right line  wherefore dfa is a right line and the end adb of the pier must be a rightlined triangle that the force of the water upon it may be the least possible  proposition xii to determine the resistance of the end of a pier against the stream of water  solution using here the figure and notation of the last proposition by the same it is found that the fluxion of the force of the stream against the face df is y  x  y  and since the fluxion of the force against the base is y it follows that the force of the stream against the base ab is to the force against the face adb as y the fluent of y is to the fluent of y  x  y  that is the the absolute force of the stream is to the efficacious force against the face of the pier as its breadth is to double the fluent of y  x  y  when y is equal to half the breadth  corollary   if the face adb be retilineal putting dc  a ca  b and  as a b x y by similar triangles hence x  ay b and x  ay b this being written for it in the general expression above we have  for the fluxion of the force on ad the fluent of which or bby cc is the force itself and consequently the force on the flat base ab is to that on the triangular end as y to bby cc or as cc to bb that is as ad  to ac   and if ac be equal to cd or adb a right angle which is generally the case then ad    ac  and the force on the base to that on the face as   to    moreover as the force on adb when adb is a right angle is only half of the absolute force so it is evident that the force will be more than onehalf when adb is greater than a right angle and less when it is less and also that the longer ad is the less the force is it being always inversely as the square of ad  corollary   if adb be a semicircle the radius ac  cd  a then   ax  xx  yy or  and  hence  becomes  the fluent of which is aa vy aa x y and therefore the force on the base is to the force on the circular end as y is to aa yy aa x y or as aa to aa  yy or as   aa to   aa  yy  and when y  a  ac the proportion becomes that of   to    so that only onethird of the absolute force is taken off by making the end a semicircle  corollary   when the face adb is a parabola then the notation being as before viz dc  a and ac  b we have a bb x yy hence x  ayy bb and x    ayy bb which being a table of the natural rise of water in proportin to the resistance or obstruction it meets with in its passage construction of a modern bridge of   arches

these numbers must everywhere be added to the depth of water below the fall to give the true height of the flood  the seven predicaments above show the excellence or imperfection of bridges of every construction and in all states of a capacity and the pernicious consequences of all such as are not so  london bridge is nearly in the  th predicament of this table and westminster bridge nearly in

mode seldom sufficient in a flood the water soon encroaches on the arches and changes the predicament this table to face page    written in the general expression the fluent of it becomes the circular are whose radius is bb  a and tangent y and so the absolute force is to the force on the parabolic end as y to the arc whose tangent is y and radius bb  a that is as the tangent of an arc is to the

abutment or butment which see in its place below  arch and opening of a bridge through or under which the water etc passes and which is supported by piers or by butments  arches are denominated circular elliptical cycloidal catenarian etc according to the figure of the curve of them there are also other denominations of circular arches according to the different parts of a circle so a semicircular arch is half the circle a scheme or skeen arch is a segment less than the semicircle and arches of the third and fourth point or gothic arches consist of two circular arcs excentric and meeting in an angle at top each being   d or   th etc of the whole circle  the chief properties of the most considerable arches with regard to the extrados they require etc may be learned from the second section it there appears that none but the arch of equilibration in the example to prop   can admit of a horizontal line at top that this arch is not only of a graceful but of a convenient form as it may be made higher or lower at pleasure with the same opening that it but no other with a horizontal top can be equally strong in all its parts and therefore ought to be used in all works of much consequence all the other arches require tops that are curved either upward or downward some more and some less of these the elliptical arch seems to be the fittest to be substituted instead of the equilibrial one with any tolerable degree of propriety it is in general also the best form for most bridges as it can be made of any height to the same span or of any span to the same height while at the same time its hanches are sufficiently elevated above the water even when it is pretty flat at top which is a property of which the other curves are not possessed in the same degree and this property is the more valuable because it is remarked that after an arch is built and the centering struck it settles more about the hanches than the other parts by which other curves are reduced near to a straight line at the hanches elliptical arches also look bolder are really stronger and require less materials and labor than the others of the other curves the cycloidal arch is next in quality to the elliptical one for all the above properties and lastly the circle as to the others the parabola hyperbola and catenary they may not at all be admitted in bridges of several arches but may in some cases be used for a bridge of one single arch which is to rise very high because then not much loaded at the hanches we may hence also perceive the falsity of those arguments which assert that because the catenarian curve supports itself equally in all its parts it will therefore best support any additional weight laid upon it for the additional building made to raise the bridge to a horizontal line or nearly such by pressing more in one part than another must force those parts down and the whole must fall whereas other curves will not support themselves at all without some additional parts built above them to balance them or to reduce their parts to an equilibrium  archivolt the curve or line formed by the upper sides of the voussoirs or arch stones it is parallel to the intrados or underside of the arch when the voussoirs are all of the same length otherwise not  by the archivolt is also sometimes understood the whole set of voussoirs  banquet the raised foot path at the sides of the bridge next the parapet this ought to be allowed in all bridges of any considerable size it should be raised about a foot above the middle or horse passage made           etc feet broad according to the size of the bridge and paved with large stones whose length is equal to the breadth of the walk  battardeau or cofferdam a case of piling etc without a bottom fixed in the bed of the river watertight or nearly so by which to lay the bottom dry for a space large enough to build the pier on when it is fixed its sides reaching above the level of the water the water is pumped out of it or drawn off by engines etc till the space be dry and it is kept so by the same means if there are leaks which cannot be stopped till the pier is built up in it and then the materials of it are drawn up again  battardeaux are made in various manners either by a single enclosure or by a double one with clay or chalk rammed in between the two to prevent the water from coming through the sides and these enclosures are also made either with piles only driven close by one another and sometimes notched or dovetailed into each other or with piles grooved in the sides driven in at a distance from one another and boards let down between them in the grooves  the method of building in battardeaux cannot well be used where the river is either deep or rapid it also requires a very good natural bottom of solid earth or clay for although the sides be made watertight if the bottom or bed of the river be of a loose consistence the water will ooze up through it in too great abundance to be evacuated by the engines  it is almost needless to remark that the sides must be made very strong and well propt or braced in the inside to prevent the ambient water from pressing the sides in and forcing its way into the battardeau  bridge a work of carpentry or masonry built over a river canal etc for the convenience of crossing the same  a stone bridge is an edifice forming a way over a river etc supported by one arch or by several arches and these again supported by proper piers or butments  a stately bridge over a large river is one of the most noble and striking pieces of art to behold huge and bold arches composed of an immense quantity of small materials as stones bricks etc so disposed and united together that they seem to form but one solid compact body affording a safe passage for men and carriages over large waters which with their navigation pass free and easy under them at the same time is a sight truly surprising and affecting indeed  to the absolutely necessary parts of a bridge already mentioned viz the arches piers and abutments may be added the paving at top the parapet wall either with or without a balustrade etc also the banquet or raised foot way on each side leaving a sufficient breadth in the middle for horses and carriages the breadth of a bridge for a great city should be such as to allow an easy passage for three carriages and two horsemen abreast in the middle way and for three foot passengers in the same manner on each banquet and for other less bridges a less breadth  as a bridge is made for a way or passage over a river etc so it ought to be made of such a height as will be quite convenient for that passage but yet so as to be consistent with the interest and concerns of the river itself easily admitting through its arches the craft that navigate upon it and all the water even at high tides and floods the neglect of this precept has been the ruin of many bridges and particularly that at newcastle over the river tyne on the   th of november      so that in determining its height the conveniences both of the passage over it and under it should be considered and the height made to answer the best for them both observing to make the convenient give place to the necessary when their interests are opposite  bridges are generally placed in a direction perpendicular to the stream in a direct line to give free passage to the water etc but some think they should be made not in a straight line but unequal toward the stream the better to resist floods etc and some such bridges have been made  again a bridge should not be made in too narrow a part of a navigable river or one subject to tides or floods because the breadth being still more contracted by the piers will increase the depth velocity and fall of the water under the arches and endanger the whole bridge and navigation  the number of arches of a bridge are generally made odd either that the middle of the stream or chief current may flow freely without the interruption of a pier or that the two halves of the bridge by gradually rising from the ends to the middle may there meet in the highest and largest arch or else for the sake of grace that by being open in the middle the eye in viewing it may look directly through there as one always expects to do in looking at it and without which opening one generally feels a disappointment in viewing it  if the bridge be equally high throughout the arches being all of a height are made all of a size which causes a great saving of centering if the bridge be higher in the middle than at the ends let the arches decrease from the middle toward each end but so as that each half have the arches exactly alike and that they decrease in span proportionally to their height so as to be always the same kind of figure and similar parts of that figure thus if one be a semicircle let the rest be semicircles also but proportionally less if one be a segment of a circle let the rest be similar segments of other circles and so for other figures the arches being equal at equal distances on both sides of the middle is not only for the strength and beauty of the bridge but that the centering of the one half may serve for the other also but if the bridge be higher at the ends than in the middle the arches ought to increase in span and pitch from the middle toward the ends  when the middle and ends are of different heights their difference however ought not to be great in proportion to the length that the ascent may be easy and then also it is more beautiful to make the top one continued curve than two inclined straight lines from the ends toward the middle  bridges should rather be of few and large arches than of many and small ones if the height and situation will possibly allow of it for this will leave more free passage for the water and navigation and be a great saving in materials and labor as there will be fewer piers and centers and the arches themselves will require less materials  for the fabric of a bridge and the proper estimation of the expense etc there are generally necessary three plans three sections and an elevation the three plans are so many horizontal sections viz the first a plan of the foundation under the piers with the particular circumstances attending it whether of gratings planks piles etc the second is the plan of the piers and arches etc and the third is the plan of the superstructure with the paved road and banquet the three sections are vertical ones the first of them a longitudinal section from end to end and through the middle of the breadth the second a transverse one or across it and through the summit of an arch and the third also across and taken upon a pier the elevation is an orthographic projection of one side or face of the bridge or its appearance as viewed at an infinite distance and shows the exterior aspect of the materials and the manner in which they are worked and decorated  other observations are to be seen in the first section  butments or abutments the extremities of a bridge by which it joins to or abuts upon the land or sides of the river etc these must be made very secure quite immovable and more than barely sufficient to resist the drift of its adjacent arch so that if there are not rocks or very solid banks to raise them against they must be well reinforced with proper walls or returns etc the thickness of them that will be barely sufficient to resist the shoot of the arch may be calculated as that of a pier by prop  0  when the foundation of a butment is raised against a sloping bank of rock gravel or good solid earth it will produce a saving of materials and labor to carry the work on by returns at different heights like steps of stairs  caisson a kind of chest or flatbottomed boat in which a pier is built then sunk to the bed of the river and the sides loosened and taken off from the bottom by a contrivance for that purpose the bottom of it being left under the pier as a foundation it is evident therefore that the bottoms of caissons must be made very strong and fit for the foundations of the piers the caisson is kept afloat till the pier be built to about the height of low water mark and for that purpose its sides must either be made of more than that height at first or else gradually raised to it as it sinks by the weight of the work so as always to keep its top above water and therefore the sides must be made very strong and kept asunder by cross timbers within lest the great pressure of the ambient water crush the sides in and so not only endanger the work but also drown the men who work within it the caisson is made of the shape of the pier but some feet wider on every side to make room for the men to work the whole of the sides are of two pieces both joined to the bottom quite around and to each other at the salient angle so as to be disengaged from the bottom and from each other when the pier is raised to the desired height and sunk it is also convenient to have a little sluice made in the bottom occasionally to open and shut to sink the caisson and pier sometimes by before it be finished to try if it bottom level and rightly for by opening the sluice the water will rush in and fill it to the height of the exterior water and the weight of the work already built will sink it then by shutting the sluice again and pumping out the water it will be made to float again and the rest of the work may be completed but it must not be sunk but when the sides are high enough to reach above the surface of the water otherwise it cannot be raised and laid dry again mr labelye tells us that the caissons in which he built some of the piers of westminster bridge contained above   0 load of fir timber of  0 cubic feet each and was of more tonnage or capacity than a  0 gun ship of war  centers are the timber frames erected in the spaces of the arches to turn them on by building on them the voussoirs of the arch as the center serves as a foundation for the arch to be built on when the arch is completed that foundation is struck from under it to make way for the water and navigation and then the arch will stand of itself from its curved figure a center must therefore be constructed of the exact figure of the intended arch unequal as the arch is concave to receive it on as a mould if the form be circular the curve is struck from a central point by a radius if it be elliptical it ought to be struck with a doubled cord passing over two pins or nails fixed in the focusses as the mathematicians describe their ellipses and not by striking different pieces or arcs of circles from several centers for these will form no ellipse at all but an irregular misshapen curve made up of broken pieces of different circular arcs but if the arch be of any other form the several abscissas and ordinates ought to be calculated then their corresponding lengths transferred to the centering will give so many points of the curve and exactly by which points bending a bow of pliable matter the curve may be drawn by it  the centers are constructed of beams etc of timber firmly pinned and bound together into one entire compact frame covered smooth at top with planks or boards to place the voussoirs on the whole supported by offsets in the sides of the piers and by piles driven into the bed of the river and capable of being raised and depressed by wedges contrived for that purpose and for taking them down when the arch is completed they ought also to be constructed of a strength more than sufficient to bear the weight of the arch  in taking the center down first let it down a little all in a piece by easing some of the wedges there let it rest a few hours or days to try if the arch make any efforts to fall or any joints open or stones crush or crack etc that the damage may be repaired before the center is entirely removed which is not to be done till the arch ceases to make any visible efforts  in some bridges the centering makes a very considerable part of the expense and therefore all means of saving in this article ought to be closely attended to such as making few arches and as nearly alike or similar as possible that the centering of one arch may serve for others and at least that the same center may be used for both of each pair of equal arches on both sides of the middle  chest the same as caisson  cofferdam the same as battardeau  drift shoot or thrust of an arch is the push or force which it exerts in the direction of the length of the bridge this force arises from the perpendicular gravitation of the stones of the arch which being kept from descending by the form of the arch and the resistance of the pier exert their force in a lateral or horizontal direction this force is computed in prop  0 where the thickness of the pier is determined that is necessary to resist it and is greater the lower the arch is coeteris paribus  elevation the orthographic projection of the front of a bridge on the vertical plane parallel to its length this is necessary to show the form and dimensions of the arches and other parts as to height and breadth and therefore has a plain scale annexed to it to measure the parts by it also shows the manner of working up and decorating the fronts of the bridge  extrados the exterior curvature or line of an arch in the propositions of the second section it is the outer or upper line of the wall above the arch but it often means only the upper or exterior curve of the voussoirs  foundations the bottoms of the piers etc or the bases on which they are built these bottoms are always to be made with projections greater or less according to the spaces on which they are built and according to the nature of the ground depth and velocity of water etc the foundations are laid and the piers built after different manners either in caissons in battardeaux on stilts with sterlings etc for the particular methods of doing which see each under its respective term  the most obvious and simple method of laying the foundations and raising the piers up to watermark is to turn the river out of its course above the place of the bridge into a new channel cut for it near the place where it makes an elbow or turn then the piers are built on dry ground and the water turned into its old course again the new one being securely banked up this is certainly the best method when the new channel can be easily and conveniently made but which however is seldom or never the case  another method is to lay only the space of each pier dry till it be built by surrounding it with piles and planks driven down into the bed of the river so close together as to exclude the water from coming in then the water is pumped out of the enclosed space the pier built in it and lastly the piles and planks drawn up this is cofferdam work but evidently cannot be practiced if the bottom be of a loose consistence admitting the water to ooze and spring up through it  when neither the whole nor part of the river can be easily laid dry as above other methods are to be used such as to build either in caissons or on stilts both which methods are described under their proper words or yet by another method which has though seldom been sometimes used without laying the bottom dry and which is thus the pier is built upon strong rafts or gratings of timber well bound together and buoyed up on the surface of the water by strong cables fixed to other flotes or machines till the pier is built the whole is then gently let down to the bottom which must be made level for the purpose but of these methods that of building in caissons is the best  but before the pier can be built in any manner the ground at the bottom must be well secured and made quite good and safe if it be not so naturally the space must be bored into to try the consistence of the ground and if a good bottom of stone or firm gravel clay etc be met with within a moderate depth below the bed of the river the loose sand etc must be removed and dug out to it and the foundation laid on the firm bottom on a strong grating or base of timber made much broader every way than the pier that there may be the greater base to press on to prevent its being sunk but if a solid bottom cannot be found at a convenient depth to dig to the space must then be driven full of strong piles whose tops must be sawed off level some feet below the bed of the water the sand having been previously dug out for that purpose and then the foundation on a grating of timber laid on their tops as before or when the bottom is not good if it be made level and a strong grating of timber two three or four times as large as the base of the pier be made it will form a good base to bulid on its great size preventing it from sinking in driving the piles begin at the middle and proceed outward all the way to the borders or margin the reason of which is that if the outer ones were driven first the earth of the inner space would be thereby so jammed together as not to allow the inner piles to be driven and besides the piles immediately under the piers it is also very prudent to drive in a single double or triple row of them around and close to the frame of the foundation cutting them off a little above it to secure it from slipping aside out of its place and to bind the ground under the pier the firmer for as the safety of the whole bridge depends on the foundation too much care cannot be used to have the bottom made quite secure  jettee the border made around the stilts under a pier being the same with sterling  impost is the part of the pier on which the feet of the arches stand or from which whey spring  keystone the middle voussoir or the arch stone in the top or immediately over the center of the arch the length of the keystone or thickness of the archivolt at top is allowed to be about    th or    th of the span by the best architects  orthography the elevation of a bridge or front view as seen at an infinite distance  parapet the breast wall made on the top of a bridge to prevent passengers from falling over in good bridges to build the parapet but a little part of its height close or solid and upon that a balustrade to above a mans height has an elegant effect  piers the walls built for the support of the arches and from which they spring as their bases  they ought to be built of large blocks of stone solid throughout and cramped together with iron which will make the whole as one solid stone their faces or ends from the base up to high water mark ought to project sharp out with a salient angle to divide the stream or perhaps the bottom of the pier should be built flat or square up to about half the height of low water mark to allow a lodgment against it for the sand and mud to cover the foundation lest by being left bare the water should in time undermine and so ruin or injure it the best form of the projection for dividing the stream is the triangle and the longer it is or the more acute the salient angle the better it will divide it and the less will the force of the water be against the pier but it may be sufficient to make that angle a right one as it will make the work stronger and in that case the perpendicular projection will be equal to half the breadth or thickness of the pier in rivers on which large heavy craft navigate and pass the arches it may perhaps be better to make the ends semicircular for although it does not divide the water so well as the triangle it will both better turn off and bear the shock of the craft  the thickness of the piers ought to be such as will make them of weight or strength sufficient to support their interjacent arch independent of any other arches and then if the middle of the pier be run up to its full height the centering may be struck to be used in another arch before the hanches are filled up the whole theory of the piers may be seen in the third section  they ought to be made with a broad bottom on the foundation and gradually diminished in thickness by offsets up to low water mark  the methods of laying their foundations and building them up to the surface of the water are given under the word foundation  piles are timbers driven into the bed of the river for various purposes and are either round square or flat like planks they may be of any wood which will not rot under water but oak and fir are mostly used especially the latter on account of its length streightness and cheapness they are shod with a pointed iron at the bottom the better to penetrate into the ground and are bound with a strong iron band or ring at top to prevent them from being split by the violent strokes of the ram by which they are driven down  piles are either used to build the foundations on or are driven about the pier as a border of defense or to support the centers on and in this case when the centering is removed they must either be drawn up or sawed off very low under water but it is perhaps better to saw them off and leave them sticking in the bottom lest the drawing of them out should loosen the ground about the foundation of the pier those to build on are either such as are cut off by the bottom of the water or rather a few feet within the bed of the river or else such as are cut off at low water mark and then they are called stilts those to form borders of defense are rows driven in close by the frame of a foundation to keep it firm or else they are to form a case or jettee about stilts to keep within it the stones that are thrown in to fill it up in this case the piles are grooved driven at a little distance from each other and plank piles let into the grooves between them and driven down also till the whole space is surrounded besides using this for stilts it is also sometimes necessary to surround a stone pier with a sterling or jettee and fill it up with stones to secure an injured pier from being still more damaged and the whole bridge ruined the piles to support the centers may also serve as a border of piling to secure the foundation cutting them off low enough after the center is removed  pile driver and engine for driving down the piles it consists of a large ram of iron sliding perpendicularly down between two guide posts which being lift up to the top of them and there let fall from a great height comes down upon the top of the pile with a violent blow it is worked either with men or horses and either with or without wheelwork that which was used at the building of westminster bridge is perhaps the best ever invented  pitch of an arch the perpendicular height from the spring or impost to the keystone  plan of any part as of the foundations or piers or superstructure is the orthographic projection of it on a plane paralled to the horizon  push of any arch the same as drift shoot etc  salient angle of a pier the projection of the end against the stream to divide it the rightlined angle best divides the stream and the more acute the better for that purpose but the right angle is generally used as making the best masonry a semicircular end though it does not divide the stream so well is sometimes better in large navigable rivers as it carries the craft the better off or bears their shocks the better  shoot of an arch the same as drift  springers are the first or lowest stones of an arch being those at its feet bearing immediately on the impost  sterlings or jettees a kind of case made about a pier of stilts etc to secure it and is particularly described under the next word stilts  stilts a set of piles driven into the space intended for the pier whose tops being sawed level of about low water mark the pier is then raised on them this method was formerly used when the bottom of the river could not be laid dry and these stilts were surrounded at a few feet distance by a row of piles and planks etc close to them like a cofferdam and called a sterling or jettee after which loose stones etc are thrown or poured down into the space till it be filled up to the top by that means forming a kind of pier of rubble or loose work and which is kept together by the sides or sterlings this is then paved level at the top and the arches turned upon it this method was formerly much used most of the large old bridges in england being erected that way such as london bridge newcastle bridge rochester bridge etc but the inconveniences attending it are so great that it is now quite exploded and disused for because of the loose composition of the piers they must be made very large or broad or else the arch would push them over and rush down as soon as the center was drawn which great breadth of piers and sterlings so much contracts the passage of the water as not only very much incommodes the navigation through the arch from the fall and quick motion of the water but from the same cause also the bridge itself is in much danger especially in time of floods when the water is too much for the passage add to this that besides the danger there is of the pier bursting out the sterlings they are also subject to much decay and damage by the velocity of the water and the craft passing through the arches  thrust the same as drift etc  voussoirs the stones which immediately form the arch their under sides constituting the intrados the middle one or keystone ought to be about    th or    th of the span as has been observed and the rest should increase in size all the way down to the impost the more they increase the better as they will the better bear the great weight which rests upon them without being crushed and also will bind the firmer together their joints should also be cut perpendicular to the curve of the intrados  the end
