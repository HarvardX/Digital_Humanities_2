the citizen  a farce  as it is performed at the theater royal in covent garden  by arthur murphy esquire  aeque neglectum pueris senibusque nocebit hor london printed for g kearsly in ludgate street  mdcclxiii  price one shilling  lincolns end   th jan      the authors compliments to miss elliot and he desires to inscribe to her the following scenes she need not be alarmed at a dedication the propriety of which will strike every reader who remembers that miss elliot and the citizen made their first appearance on the stage together and that her uncommon talents gave the piece the best and most effectual protection elegance of figure a voice of pleasing variety a strong expression of humor not impaired but rendered exquisite by delicacy these were circumstances that secured the farce at first and have since brought it into favor no author ever met with a better patronage and though the citizen like other things of this kind has many faults yet it has this peculiar merit that it produced in the character of maria a genuine comic genius the citizen claims another praise when all the little arts of theatrical malice were conspiring against her it recommended miss elliot to the notice of mr beard and obtained for her that generous treatment which that manager seems determined to extend to real merit the author therefore desires miss elliots acceptance of this farce for the defects of which he makes no apology because should the most severe judge in this kind resolve to arm himself with criticisms let him but look at the acting of maria and he will forget them all

his head with greek and latin at school he wanted to borrow of me the other day but i was too cunning   old phil ay ay  let him draw bills of exchange in greek and latin and see where he will get a pound sterling for them   g phil so i told him  i went to him to his garret in the minories and there i found him in all his misery and a fine scene it was  there was his wife in a corner of the room at a washingtub up to the elbows in suds a solitary porkstake was dangling by a bit of packthread before a melancholy fire himself seated at a threeleggd table writing a pamphlet against the german
