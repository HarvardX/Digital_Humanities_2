the chains of slavery  the chains of slavery a work wherein the clandestine and villainous attempts of princes to ruin liberty are pointed out and the dreadful scenes of despotism disclosed  to which is prefixed an address to the electors of great britain in order to draw their timely attention to the choice of proper representatives in the next parliament   vitam impendere vero london printed for t becket corner of the adelphi in the strand t pain at the mews gate j almon in piccadilly and richardson and urquhart near the royal exchange  mdcclxxiv  to the electors of great britain gentlemen in time of security when prosperity smiles upon the land the eloquence of an angel would not be attended to but when princes to become sovereign masters trample under foot without shame or remorse the most sacred rights of the people attention is excited by the most minute object and even the voice of a man so unsupported as myself may have effect upon the minds of the public  if by collecting into one point of view under your eyes the villainous measures planned by princes to attain absolute empire and the dismal scenes ever attendant on despotism i could inspire you with horror against tyranny and revive in your breasts the holy flame of liberty which burnt in those of your forefathers i should esteem myself the most happy of men  gentlemen the present parliament by law must soon expire and no dissolution was ever more earnestly wished for by an injured people your most sacred rights have been flagrantly violated by your representatives your remonstrances to the throne artfully rejected yourselves treated like a handful of disaffected persons and your complaints silenced by pursuing the same conduct which raised them such is your condition and if such it continues the little liberty which is yet left you must soon be extinguished but the time for redress is now approaching and it is in your power to obtain that justice you have so many times craved in vain  as long as virtue reigns in the great council of the nation the prerogative of the crown and the rights of the subjects are so tempered that they mutually support and restrain each other but when honor and virtue are wanting in the senate the balance is destroyed the parliament the strength and glory of britain becomes a profligate faction which partaking of the ministers bounty and seeking to share with him the spoils of their country joins those at the helm in their criminal designs and supports their destructive measures  a band of disguised traitors who under the name of guardians traffic away the national interests and the rights of a freeborn people the prince then becomes absolute and the people slaves  a truth of which we have unfortunately had but too often the sad experience  on you alone gentlemen depends the care of securing the freedom of parliament and it is still in your power to revive that august assembly which in the last century humbled the pride of a tyrant and broke your fetters but to effect this how careful must you be in your choice of those into whose hands you shall trust your authority  reject boldly all who attempt to buy your votes they are but mercenary suitors who covet only to enlarge their fortune at the expense of their honor and the interest of their country  reject all who have any place at court any employment in the disposal of the great officers of the crown any commission which the king can improve by men thus dependant and of which the senate is chiefly composed at present how can you hope to be represented with fidelity  reject all who earnestly mendicate your voice there is no good to be expected from that quarter if they had nothing at heart but the honor of serving the public do you imagine that they would submit to act such a disgraceful part those humiliating intrigues are the transactions of vice not of virtue merit indeed is fond of honorable distinctions yet satisfied with proving worthy of them it never debases itself to beg them but waits till they are offered  reject men of pompous titles among them there is little knowledge and less virtue nay what have they of nobility but the name the luxuries and the vices of it  reject the insolent opulent in this class are not to be found the few virtues which are left to stock the nation  reject young men no confidence is to be placed in them wholly given up to pleasure in this age of degeneracy dissipation amusements and debauchery are their only occupation and to support the expensive gaieties of the capital they are ever ready to act with zeal in the interests of a minister but supposing them not corrupt they are but little acquainted with the national interest besides naturally incapable of long continued attention they are impatient of restraint they would have nothing to do but to give their votes and cannot attend to what they call the dry business of the house and fulfill the duties of a good senator  select for your representatives men distinguished by their ability integrity and love for their country men versed in the national affairs men whom an independent fortune secures from the temptations of poverty and a disdain of ruinous pageantry from the allurements of ambition men who have not been corrupted by the smiles of a court men whose venerable mature age crowns a spotless life men who have ever appeared zealous for the public cause and have had in view only the welfare of their country and the observance of the laws  confine not your choice to the candidates who offer themselves invite men worthy of that trust wise men who desire to be your representatives but cannot dispute that honor with the rich without merit who labor by bribes to force it out of your hands do it in such a manner that for the pleasure of serving their country they shall have no occasion to dread the ruin of their fortune and scorn even to eat or drink at prostituted tables  the utmost efforts will be exerted as usual by the ministry to influence your choice are the alluring baits of corruption to triumph over your virtue is the british spirit so sunk that none durst scorn to receive a bribe when your great common interest ought to direct you shall the selfish passions dare to raise their voice are they worthy to be indulged at such a price behold the dismal scenes arising from neglect of national interest behold your senators busy in making altering and amending acts for securing the property of their dogs whilst half of the subjects lingering in misery from the villainy of monopolizers cry to them for bread behold your country bleeding at the feet of a minister of the wounds she has received  gentlemen the whole nation cast their eyes upon you for redress but if your heart be shut to generous feelings and justice to your fellow subjects cannot move you let your own interest at least animate you  to you is left a power to secure the liberty of the people or enslave the nation during the time you proceed to election you are it may be termed the arbiters of the state and can teach those to tremble before you who would make you tremble before them be made sensible of the importance of your functions let honor raise its voice and a becoming pride elevate your minds how can the dignity of your office be united with the infamy of corruption  most of the candidates are lavish of fawning caresses and spare no baseness to gain you to their interests but look upon you with disdain from the instant they have extorted your votes resent such affront reject their hypocritical courtesy think on the insolent contempt which follows and fix your choice upon men who are conscious of what they owe to their constituents  parliament under undue influence will do no act to promote the public welfare nay those who have carried their election with money not satisfied with neglecting your interest treat you as a mercenary gang of slaves eagerly seeking to be repaid any way they traffic away your rights and use the power you have trusted them with to ruin you are the baits of corruption so attractive as not to be counterbalanced by the solid advantages tendered by virtue but what are the bribes taken for votes to the losses suffered by a neglect of your interests to the advantages you would reap from being represented with ability and fidelity  besides what you owe to your country and yourselves consider what you owe to posterity  how careful were your ancestors although with hazard of their lives to transmit those rights as entire to their children as they had received them from their fathers what they did with labor you may do with ease what they did with danger you may do with safety will the holy flame of liberty which burnt in their breasts never burn in yours will you disgrace the names of your forefathers will you not shudder with horror at the idea of injuring your posterity is the age of liberty passed away shall your children bathing their chains with tears one day say  these are the fruits of the venality of our fathers  gentlemen  with virtue and courage a people may ever maintain their liberty but when once this inestimable treasure is lost it is almost

the fear of torments page     the chains of slavery it appears the common lot of mankind not to be allowed the enjoyment of liberty princes every where are aspiring to despotism and the people sinking to servitude  the history of despotism is replete with uncommon events on one side we survey the bold designs of some ambitious men their villainous attempts and the secret springs they put in action to attain illicit power on the other side we see the people whilst reposing under the shade of their own laws enslaved we behold the vain efforts of an unfortunate multitude to shake off oppression and the numberless evils constantly attendants on slavery scenes at once horrible and magnificent wherein alternately appear peace plenty sports pomp festivals dissentions misery artifice treachery treason banishments contests and carnage  sometimes despotism is established at once by the force of arms but this rapid progress of power to absolute empire is not the subject of my present work it is the slow and gradual efforts of policy which by degrees subject the necks of the people to the yoke depriving them at the same time both of the means and desire of shaking it off  from attentively considering the establishment of despotism it is evident that slavery is only the effect of time and the necessary consequence of the defects of political constitutions let us endeavor therefore to discover how by their means the magistrate usurps the title of master and substitutes his will for the law let us review that multiplicity of machines which the sacrilegious audacity of princes has recourse to in order to sap the foundation of liberty let us follow their dark projects their crafty proceedings their secret plots enter into a detail of their fatal policy unfold the principles of that deceitful art and reduce to one point of view the various attacks that have been made upon public freedom but in arranging my observations i shall less regard the order of time than the connection of the subject  when once the dangerous trust of public authority is committed to a prince and the care of enforcing obedience to the laws to magistrates the people see themselves sooner or later subdued by those rulers they have made choice of and their liberty their property their lives at the discretion of those who have been appointed to protect them no sooner has the prince cast his eyes upon the trust reposed on him but he endeavors to forget from what hands he received it full of himself and of his power he supports impatiently the idea of his dependence and constantly labors to free himself from every sort of restraint  the people are never voluntary slaves they yield not to power but when they believe it to be a duty or are unable to oppose it hence in a state newly founded or reformed the subjects are not at once enslaved however imperfect the constitution might be despair that prompted them at first to throw off the yoke would prompt them to throw it off anew whenever they should feel its weight to commence with open attacks upon liberty and to attempt to destroy it by violence would prove therefore a rash undertaking when those who govern daringly dispute the supreme power with open force and the people perceive their rulers attempting if we properly attend we shall find that no state is in its origin of great extent and that all owe their increase to no other cause but conquest or alliance   to enslave them the latter ever prevail and the prince in a moment loses the fruit of all his efforts at his first attempt the subjects unite against him and his authority is at stake if his conduct be not more submissive than imperious it is not therefore by open attacks princes first attempt to enslave the people they take their measures in secresy they have recourse to craft it is by slow but constant efforts by changes almost imperceptible by innovations of which it is difficult to observe the consequences and such as are scarcely taken notice of  chap i of the power of time the first attack princes make upon the public liberty is not the violating audaciously the laws but the causing them to fall into oblivion to enchain their subjects they begin by setting them asleep  whilst men have their heads heated with ideas of liberty and whilst the bloody image of tyranny is still before their eyes they detest despotism and watch with inquietude every motion of the ministry the prince at that time is cautious not to form any attacks upon public freedom he appears the father of his people and his reign the era of justice at first his administration is so mildly conducted that it might be apprehended he has a design of extending liberty far from having any intent of ruining it  having nothing to dispute relating to their privileges which are not contested nor to their liberty which is not attacked the people gradually become less watchful over the conduct of their rulers they insensibly discontinue to be upon their guard and finally lay aside all solicitude resting tranquil beneath the shade of the laws  thus in proportion as the people recede from the stormy times in which the constitution took its rise they gradually lose sight of liberty to set their minds at rest there is occasion only to let things proceed in their natural order but princes do not always rely on the power of time alone  chap ii of public entertainments the entrance of despotism is sometimes pleasing and joyous plays feasts dances and songs being its cheerful attendants to draw the attention of the nobles from matters of state the emperor manuel commenus invented the tournaments panciral lib ii cap xx   but in these feasts and plays the people perceive not the evils prepared for them they resign themselves to pleasure and their joy is unbounded but whilst the inconsiderate multitude is abandoned to joy the wise foresee the remote calamities threatening their country and by which it is at last to be overwhelmed they perceive the chains concealed with flowers ready to be fixed on the arms of their countrymen  chap iii of public enterprises to the power of time and influence of entertainments is joined an attention to national affairs some war charlemagne continually engaged his nobility in different expeditions and by obliging them thus to concur in his designs he never gave them time to examine into his conduct  ferdinand of arragon made use of this artifice during almost his whole reign first he attacked granada next expelled the moors from his dominions he then carried the war into africa italy france and by these continual enterprises entirely engaged the unquiet busy minds of his subjects  we command said charles v to francis i people of such fierce and restless dispositions that unless we were engaged in frequent wars in order to amuse them our subjects would not endure us matthieu hist de la paix lib i narrat xi   is undertaken public edifices are built highways are made etc the multitude judging from appearances alone believe the prince is attentive to the welfare of the state only whilst he is wholly taken up with his projects they grow careless more and more and at last they cease to be watchful over their enemy  while the minds of the people cease to be engaged the defects of the constitution begin to unfold the prince ever intent upon his own interests is seeking means to extend his power but now takes care not to give the least room for disturbing that profound security  chap iv of gaining the affections and confidence of the subjects amusing the people is not sufficient the prince endeavors to have them well affected toward him and what some do to divert the attention of their subjects others do to gain their affection  the roman people those absolute masters of the earth were extremely fond of public shows and the magnificence of entertainments was a mean made use of to captivate them by those who deprived them of their power and liberty  when charles ii ascended the throne of spain the first business of the minister was to restore plenty to the kingdom and to indulge the people with shows never in that country were seen so many bullfights plays and other entertainments after the taste of the nation desormeaux abreg chronol de lhist despag   to conciliate the affections of the people princes have recourse sometimes to grants etc it must be confessed that this crafty wile succeeds but too well with the multitude  a stupid animal whose affection largesses ever secure whilst from a balcony of the hotel de ville mazarine on his return to paris scattered money among the rabble it was curious to hear the people passing from the greatest imprecations to the greatest encomiums hist du card de mazarine vol iv   caesar used to confer largesses on the people and the easy multitude not perceiving the snare exhausted their gross imaginations in bestowing encomiums on the despot  louis xiv applied himself to win the hearts of his subjects by his engaging manners his prodigality and magnificence he was careful no one should depart dissatisfied from his presence he secured by lucrative employments those whom he suspected and by favors gained to himself even the insatiate crowd of courtiers at court he amused the people with feasts fireworks balls masquerades tournaments shows of every kind in his campaigns he repeated the feasts he visited in his wonted pageantry the towns that had submitted to his power he invited to his table women of quality conferred gratifications on the military scattered gold among the populace and was applauded to the skies but it is not by grants only every grant of the prince to the people ought to be suspected unless conferred at the time of any sudden calamity the only method a prince who has no designs upon liberty can make use of to relieve his people is the lessening of their taxes    that princes attempt to gain the affections of their subjects  louis i of spain signalized the beginning of his reign by loading with kindness all those who approached him  ferdinand vi on ascending the throne endeavored to gain popularity by apparent airs of goodness he ordered the prisons to be opened to all who had been committed for no capital crimes he granted a general amnesty to deserters and smugglers and appointed two days a week for receiving petitions and hearing grievances desormeaux abreg chronol de lhist despag  etc  princes oftentimes apply themselves by an affected condescension to win the hearts of the subjects  the people of venice admire the goodness of their masters when they see the doge at the head of the senate making the yearly procession to st maria formosa to discharge a promise of one of his predecessors and not scorning to accept of a straw hat and two bottles of wine that the artisans of the parish present him for his trouble when they see the doge on the  st of august accepting of a few melons presented to him by the gardeners and allowing them to kiss him when they see the senators assisting with the doge on shrovetuesday at the slaughter of a bull or at some other popular entertainment when they see the grandcouncil on corpus christi day passing in procession through st marks place each noble yielding the right hand to a beggar  how strange soever it may appear princes sometimes attain to despotism by means which in appearance tend to produce a contrary effect in order to increase their authority some by a refinement of policy assume the character of justice goodness and mercy to deceive others they take the outside of plain dealing ximenes became the idol of the castillians by an apparent purity of manners by his charity and munificence the people not suspecting him left him to make what attempts upon their liberty he pleased to keep in pay out of the revenue of his benefices mercenary troops and augment the regal authority bandier hist de ximenes   the people of terra ferma boast of the lenity of the government of the seignory when they see the popularity of the podestates and the attention given by the inquisitors of state to their complaints against the nobles they hate and from the opinion they entertain that the whole is done for their advantage alone they bless the equity of their masters  at other times those who govern that they might conceal their own corruption attempt to corrupt others that they might conceal their own ambition they flatter that of the people they speak to them perpetually of their rights affect an extreme zeal for their interests and raise themselves to tyranny by affecting to protect them  but in order to enslave mankind princes have even affected an aversion to empire some have labored to promote the public happiness and taking advantage of that moment when the subjects exulted in their wellbeing they pretended themselves tired of the scepter and resolved to abdicate expecting to be importuned to hold the reins of the empire the greatest of evils this since the prince has the blind confidence of his people and the means of abusing it  chap v of the pomp of power the majesty of princes constitutes part of their power richelieu was well convinced of this truth as he strongly blamed that weak prince louis xiii for having neglected such a material point see his political testament    hence most of them have assumed a majestic gravity an imperious air a pompous attendance it was the magnificence of the first cosmo di medici that gave him so great an ascendance over the minds of his fellowcitizens it was this that notwithstanding the democratical form of government at florence notwithstanding the attachment of the people to their privileges notwithstanding the popularity of those who were at the helm rendered him the head of the republic and so blinded the citizens as to permit him to usurp the supreme authority     whenever they appear in public it is with the attributes of sovereign power sometimes they have the fascia the scepter the sword of justice carried before them oftentimes they are attended in pomp by all the great officers of the crown or a multitude of courtiers and always by a formidable band of satellites formerly kings used to walk without guards among their subjects like the father of a family among his children but as soon as they had it in their power they formed to themselves a formidable retinue of guards and there are few monarchs at present without several regiments of satellites     they are solicitous likewise to maintain the splendor of their household and fearing if they ceased to act the masters the great who approach their presence would cease to act the subjects they ever affect an imperious tone to teach the people to approach them with ceremony and render themselves more and more the object of respect they have all introduced a degree of state dignity into their court some have even prohibited any from either serving them or speaking to them unless on their knees philip ii of spain expressly commanded this desormeaux abreg chronol de lhist despag   the eagerness of being respected princes have extended to their civil officers less attentive to display in the persons of magistrates the ministers of the laws than men constituted in dignities  among the regulations which james i enacted in the year      in the council of scotland the counselors were ordered either to ride in the streets with footcloths or to go in coaches but never to be seen on foot spotswood   philip ii of spain ordered by a particular decree all the members of his councils and the chancellors of his kingdoms never to appear in public unless clothed with a long robe and unshaven desormeaux abreg chronol de lhist despag   princes are not less attentive reciprocally to support their dignity out of their dominions  whenever they visit each other they are received with pomp treated with magnificence indulged with every honor and that the people might be the more struck with the importance of a prince great marks of distinction are ever shown to any individual of a royal family  chap vi to abase the people when once the minds of the people are seduced and given up to dissipation an attempt is made to abase them  vigilance frugality disinterestedness love of glory and ones patria all even our best authors have ever expressed the amor patriae by the love of ones country two things which ought to be carefully distinguished the one is but the love of ones native land the other is the affection or tie of a country where one enjoys all the privileges a freeman is entitled to turks have no patria though they do not want a name for it the english have a patria and no word to express it    are the virtues by which people preserve their liberty accordingly that they might enslave their subjects princes who aspired to despotism have obliged them to renounce those virtues  in order to subject the necks of the spartans to the yoke philopaemen forced them to quit the austere way of educating their children and to adopt an effeminating one thus he succeeded to extinguish plutarc in vit philopaem that elevation of spirit that greatness of soul which he so much dreaded  after edward i had united the principality of wales to his dominions from a conviction that nothing contributed so much in maintaining the warlike genius and eagerness after glory of his new subjects as the poetical traditions of their prowess which were sung in their martial feasts he ordered a strict perquisition to be made after the welsh poets and put them to death sir j win p      from a like conviction and actuated by the same motives did the ministry during the last reign oblige the highlanders to throw aside their ancient dress and renounce their martial feasts  continuation of the same subject artifice is generally made use of to abase the people violence but seldom accordingly i know none but the greeks among whom the theatrical and other public entertainments had not such aims hence they denominated their dramatic poets  the preservers of cities   places allotted for entertainments and debauchery are ordered to be erected talents which serve to amuse the people are encouraged actors musicians tumblers puppetplayers mountebanks of every kind some princes have even persecuted those who have attempted to reform the people charles i had w prynne sentenced to a cruel punishment by the star chamber for having written against theatrical amusements   are patronized etc the public being hereby wholly engaged pry not into the conduct of administration  cyrus having conquered lydia was told that the inhabitants of that country had revolted but not thinking fit to demolish their cities or secure them with strong garrisons instituted therein public plays theaters taverns houses of ill fame by these means the lydians were rendered so effeminate as never to oppose him herodot lib i   those who governed athens expended immense sums in support of the theater  at rome the emperors oftentimes entertained the people with shows and a fondness for these pleasures extinguished in the minds of the romans that idea of liberty which their ancestors so tenderly cherished  to subdue the spirit of their english subjects the kings of the house of stuart countenanced the general dissipation under james i spacious buildings were erected for exhibiting theatrical performances to the multitude masks and mummings drolls and dancings were the chief occupation of life during charles is reign the number of playbooks were immense the multitude of london playhunters so augmented that five houses were not sufficient to maintain their troops prynnes histriomastix p    and under charles ii all ranks of men were given up to dissipation debauchery and riotous banqueting  modern princes are very careful to have theaters constructed in the principal cities of their dominions the venetians especially are careful that the public attention should be continually engaged by entertainments  it is a matter of wonder how completely this artifice answers we had once found out the method of turning this artifice against its aim by performing plays which breathed a high spirit of liberty but the depravation of the age has at last spread itself over all ranks except a few who retain purity of manners and soundness of judgment debauchery has corrupted every heart luxury conquered every mind among us and in the state of abjection we are reduced to we have but a frigid admiration for heroism the image of exalted virtues makes but a slight impression on our languishing souls their heavenly attractives affect us no more  our dramatic authors depraved as the rest or degraded to servile flatterers have complied with the taste of the age and to their eternal shame are busy only in corrupting it still more instead of showing us on the stage wise men heroes protectors and benefactors of their country they show us lovers fops coquets etc instead of disclosing the dark designs of bad princes the plot of perfidious citizens the outrages of wicked men they disclose only amors broils of private families and adventures of taverns instead of rendering the theater a school of virtue they render it a school of vice  if now and then some good drama is performed its impression is wholly destroyed by the entertainment which follows the salutary reflections to which it gave birth are obliterated by the jests of an harlequin the foolings of a punchinello or the tricks of a waiting maid the noble feelings which it has produced exhale in laughing and thus the audience is dismissed  will it be said that i attribute too great an influence to theatrical representations let it be remembered that theaters are the only places in this realm where an author is not allowed to expose his ideas with freedom have not our princes been solicitous to reserve for the inspection of their ministers whatever is to be performed on the stage   the end intended when a people has once tasted these pleasures careless of every thing else they can no more forbear them and are never so much discontented as when deprived of these their favorite amusements  the civil war in england of      was not kindled till the theaters were shut and a people has been seen groaning under the weight of their misfortunes desire these shows as the only remedy of their evils the inhabitants of treves after the plunder of their city   thus plays entertainments shows are the allurements of servitude and the tools of tyranny  continuation of the same subject if to that eagerness for dissipation and frivolous entertainment that the theater affords the plays which are performed contain loose sentiments base maxims refined flattery to persons in dignity as most of the dramatic productions of foreign nations if encomiums are bestowed on the follies and vices of reigning princes as in some of those allegoric pastorals which were performed at the court of charles i or of louis xiv the stage then becomes the most fatal school of servitude  chap vii of the fine arts and sciences by encouraging the fine arts and the sciences among the romans augustus subjected them to the yoke and by the same method his successors subdued the barbarians they had vanquised it may appear strange says a celebrated historian that the progress of the arts and sciences which among the greeks and romans increased every day the number of slaves became in late times a general source of liberty and to clear this phenomenon he has recourse to a series of vain arguments whilst a simple distinction is sufficient  when the rights of mankind are not the subject of our enquiries study by fixing the mind on foreign objects necessarily causes it to lose sight of liberty but when the sanctuary of learning is opened to a barbarous people by a natural progression they must necessarily turn their thoughts to the relations nature and society have established among men the romans were acquainted only with matters of war or state and in order to divert them therefrom augustus brought the fine arts into esteem among them under feudal government the people were extremely ignorant they lost in their fetters even all sense of liberty but when they had begun to cultivate the sciences and turn their minds to meditation they at last reflected their thoughts on themselves and were made conscious of their rights     no people was ever so independent as the ancient germans without fixed establishments continually engaged in some expedition for pillaging excessively fond of liberty and ever continuing in arms they were but little restrained by laws their princes had but little authority over them and even that authority was but little respected but when once they had secured their conquests their princes in order to extending and securing their power labored to inspire them with the love of tranquil employments to acquaint them with the sweet fruits of industry to engage them to cultivate the arts of peace and devote themselves to a contemplative life  as soon as the crown of england was secured on the head of alfred this prince took great care to inspire his subjects with the love of arts and sciences and the better to encourage them to apply themselves to study he set them the example and was attentive to reward merit asser p    flor wigorn p       spain almost continually torn by factions sedition and civil wars was till the reign of ferdinand v sunk into barbarity its inhabitants being only superficially acquainted with war and politics but in order to extend his power ferdinand begun to introduce into his dominions the love of letters by distributing favors to those who addicted themselves thereto zurita annal darag tom vi p      philip ii and philip iii both eager after absolute command befriended with all their power the arts and sciences and a great number of spaniards cultivated them  not satisfied with encouraging letters by his liberality philip iv recommended the study of them by his example and as soon as philip v was firmly established on the throne he erected universities patronized the literati and rewarded those who were distinguished for eminent talents  francis i of france encouraged the sciences erected universities and attracted men of learning to his kingdom his successors chiefly louis xiv have followed his example  chap viii of corrupting the people no constitution maintains itself unaltered but by virtue if this spring be long unbent adieu liberty instead of concurring to the public welfare every one seeks his own interests only the laws fall into contempt and the magistrates themselves are the first in violating them thus the people being abased an attempt is made to corrupt them  chap ix of procuring opulence ever by ways strewed with flowers princes have begun to drive their subjects to slavery  at first the subjects are indulged with feasts and shows but as these entertainments cannot long continue unless the prince has the disposal of the spoils of the whole world a lasting source of corruption is then opened to the people industry is encouraged and commerce rendered flourishing this assertion will undoubtedly appear very strange to those who have their eyes fixed on the feudal government degenerated into despotism or oligarchy princes encourage industry and commerce in their dominions they will say in order to increase their revenues not to abase their subjects i request the reader to consider that i do not speak of a people already under the yoke but of those who are intended to be subjected thereto thus not mentioning the efforts made some centuries ago in the states of venice genoa florence in france spain england etc to encourage industry arts and commerce among the subjects let us consider what attempts in that respect have been made by princes of a free people the ancient britons like the goths and other celtic nations were almost entirely independent and as long as they remained split into many small tribes with no other possessions but their arms and flocks it proved impossible to their chieftains to become absolute but in order to subject them the romans introduced the arts of peace commerce and urbanity agricola chiefly taught them to procure themselves the conveniences of life he endeavored to render their condition pleasing and the britons so much submitted themselves to the domination of their new masters that once subdued they gave them no more uneasiness and lost all desire even all idea of their former independency tacit in agricol  thus likewise did alfred to subdue the anglo saxons    in order to procure opulence now opulence is always attended by luxury  chap x of luxury one effect of luxury is the extinguishing the heroic virtues for when men can attract notice by sumptuous equipages costly dress long retinue of servants they are no more solicitous of attracting it by upright manners noble sentiments glorious deeds  luxury is immediately attended by a looseness of manners which is the beginning of their depravation both sexes meet together in order to render their intercourse more agreeable and corrupt themselves reciprocally gallantry is introduced this produces a frivolous turn of mind puts a value on trifles depresses whatever is of any concern and duty is soon forgotten  the arts which luxury maintains and the pleasures it promises rendering society delightful hurry us away to effeminacy they soften our manners and enervate that haughtiness which endures neither fetters nor restraint  by concealing with flowers the chains which are prepared for us they extinguish in our souls the sense of liberty and make us in love with servitude  hence princes generally neglect nothing which may bring luxury into esteem they recommend it by their as luxury so much charms the multitude as to induce them to be guilty of a thousand extravagancies ever attended with the ruin of the state princes after having countenanced it were often obliged to restrain it but by a contrast not uncommon while they repressed luxury by their proclamations they encouraged it by their example  whilst lewis xiv prohibited by his edicts to the lieutenantsgeneral and other officers of his armies who kept an open table the serving up of any other dishes except pottage roastmeat and the like he himself displayed on his table the productions of all climates whilst he fixed the quantity of gold or silver to be allowed for plate furniture equipage dress etc he himself squandered the public money in magnificent extravagancies  let princes issue out as many proclamations as they please luxury will not the less prevail those ordonances act even against the purpose they are intended for as they give more value to what they prohibit and increase the desire of enjoying it from this very consideration they are sometimes made   example they display every where pageantry and magnificence and are the first to sow in the minds of their subjects those seeds of corruption the excessive love of pleasure that possessed the courts of james i charles ii louis xiv etc infected all ranks of men every day produced some feast and every night some mask in which people of fortune engaged dissipation and luxury took place of simplicity and application     if princes recommend not luxury by their example they at least countenance it or refuse to restrain it the roman senate still composed of grave magistrates proposed to augustus the reformation of the manners and of the luxury of women but though obliged by his office of censor to attend to it he ever artfully avoided the importunate request of the senators dio cassius lib live   some have gone even so far as to force their subjects to sink into effeminacy in order to subdue the inhabitants of cuma aristomenes labored to enervate the courage of the youth he ordered the boys to let their hair grow to adorn their heads with flowers and like girls to wear long gowns of various colors he commanded them when going to their dancing or singing masters to be attended by women with umbrellas and fans in the bath they were to be served with lookingglasses combs and perfumes this way of education was continued till they were twenty years of age dionys halicarn lib vii   thus by enervating and corrupting the people luxury subdues them without resistance to the will of an imperious master and forces them to purchase at the price of their liberty the quiet life and soft pleasures they are permitted to enjoy  continuation of the same subject luxury not only enervates the minds but nothing is better calculated to divide them when once introduced into a state the union of its members is destroyed every one endeavors to attract notice to become more conspicuous than his neighbor and rise above the common level careless of the good of the public they then attend to their private interests only the love of ones patria is extinguished in every heart the citizen disappears and the man remains  luxury as it extends itself ranks superfluity among necessaries at first the people abandon themselves to dissipation it becomes habitual to them pleasures are necessary and as every one cannot enjoy them equally they are actuated by various sentiments on one side are envy jealousy hatred on the other pride and contempt  new seeds of discord how many princes have fomented these divisions by their ordonances in an edict of      philip the fair prohibited the burgesses from wearing ermine gold and jewels all which were permitted to the nobility to burgesses worth  000 livres he allowed cloth of    pence a yard to the less rich cloth of   pence but prelates and barons were permitted to wear cloth of    pence a yard  other princes have made similar ordinances     continuation of the same subject when once men are corrupted by luxury new desires prey alternately on the mind if the means of indulging them are wanting every one busies himself to support the extravagances in which he delights  the evil grows worse every day since from much endeavoring to be distinguished no one at last distinguishes himself any more but as a rank is taken and as a desire of attracting the eyes of the public still continues every nerve is bent in order to get out of that intolerable uniformity from that time there is no proportion between the wants and the means every one is eager after riches and bows down in the temple of fortune how many voluntary slaves  finally a multitude of subjects needy by their new wants and vexed to be the meanest of all vainly agitate themselves to get off their humiliating poverty and are at last reduced to wish for their countrys destruction  such is the powerful influence of luxury that oftentimes nothing more is wanting to complete the destruction of liberty even in countries the most fond of it  as long as rome was inhabited by poor citizens honesty honor courage and love of liberty were enclosed within its walls but when once it was enriched with the spoils of vanquished nations these ancient virtues gave way to a multitude of vices notwithstanding the wisdom of the laws no sooner were its gates open to the riches of the enemy but rome ceased to acknowledge its degenerated offspring manners and duties became opposite to each other poverty till then honored fell into contempt gold became the object of every ones desire luxury expanded itself with rapidity all plunged headlong into voluptuousness and when pleasures had once impoverished these sybarites a multitude of lavish citizens ashamed of their poverty caballed from ambition and disturbed public tranquillity whilst some powerful men alternately put themselves at the head of the mob tore the state to pieces spilled the blood of the citizens usurped the supreme power and silenced the laws thus perished liberty at sparta and thus it will perish among us  chap xi to cherish the peoples avarice whenever riches are the price of every thing which attracts consideration they soon supply the place of birth virtue and talents and are sought after as the summum bonum thus in order to corrupt the subjects those at the helm are careful to cherish the peoples avarice by keeping up the spirit of gaming among them  such is the craft of the cabinet in france england holland but chiefly at venice not to mention lotteries which are so frequent at venice it is a fact that during the whole carnival many public ridotti are opened for games of chance but what will appear more extraordinary at each table a member of the great council in his gown sits as banker     by this artifice people are also prevented from reflecting and knowing their situation  chap xii of debauchery another method put in practice for subduing the subjects is the keeping them in idleness and not controuling their pleasures they then careless of liberty take no concern in public affairs and are ever busied in contriving the means of indulging their base passions  when once the people become fond of money if none is to be got but by giving up their birthrights they submit to the yoke and impatiently wait for their salary  if the prince is moreover attentive at times to entertain them they are base enough to bless their tyrant  in order to render the persians good slaves cyrus kept them in idleness plenty and luxury and these effeminate men called him their father xenoph cyropaed   the roman emperors using this crafty policy oftentimes entertained the people with feasts or shows and then the deluded multitude exerted themselves in exalting the goodness of their masters tacit hist lib iv   the venetians take great care to maintain their subjects in plenty to set them free from moral restraint and indulge them with shows far from controuling the pleasures of the citizens they give encouragement to lewdness by publicly protecting houses of ill fame and thus divert the subjects from taking any concern in matters of state the clergy themselves they allow to be dissolute and so greatly countenance their scandalous manners by countenancing the corruption of the clergy the senate aims likewise to render the ecclesiastics odious to the people    that these wretches highly praise the mild government of the seignory  thus this idle and lewd life which the people call liberty is one of the chief causes of their slavery  chap xiii false ideas of liberty while sports festivals merriments shows entertainments of every kind engross the mind people by degrees lose sight of liberty and think not of it any more by entirely neglecting to think of liberty the true idea of it is obliterated and false notions take place to men always engrossed by their pleasures or private affairs liberty is soon no more than the mean of amassing wealth without obstacles of possessing it with safety and making merry without opposition thus the love of independency for want of fuel is extinguished in every breast  chap xiv of getting creatures in a country where the prince disposes of benefices places and dignities though by their means he ever gets friends he at first grants none but to deserving persons but when once he has succeeded in abasing and depraving his subjects he thinks of getting creatures  the great being masters of the lower classes of people are so in some sort of the state and with them the prince begins to share authority he dazzles the sight of one by a ribbon seduces another by an employment temptations are offered every one according to his favorite passions and men eagerly present their necks to the yoke  besides the small number of powerful men who fill up the first places of the state he holds by hope those ambitious men who continually seek after favor and preferment those he cannot draw in by realities he prevails upon by promises regards and caresses he cajoles his courtiers who proud of these marks of consideration endeavor by their servility to secure them  to the number of the creatures of princes must be added the multitude which courtiers and placemen support by their credit or captivate by their fortune  thus deficient of every principle of honor and careless of their duty those at the helm are ever seeking to court the prince that they might share his authority and submit themselves to the yoke that they might impose it on others these likewise seek after favor every one aims to be exalted men of a mean condition themselves wish to rise that they might assume an imperious air  continuation of the same subject when the prince has extensive demesnes or disposes of the public money he makes use of gold to increase the number of his creatures from charles v to philip v  0000 l were paid yearly out of the royal treasury for pensions to the grandees of spain deformeaux abreg chronol de lhist despag    as luxury so the greedy desire of riches possesses every rank and both the poor and the rich more fond of money than of liberty are ever ready to give way to bribery and set a price on their honor while poverty was honored at rome the consulship and other offices of magistracy were conferred on the most deserving on those who were most able to command armies or rule the commonwealth but when opulence had once depraved the romans those only were appointed to the conduct of affairs who best entertained the people     how greatly are things already altered the love of liberty tied the heart of every one fast to his patria by confounding private in public interest now the love of pageantry of dignities of gold breaks off these sacred bands and concentrates men in their selfish views  seeing the discord avarice and venality of the people one might imagine that already liberty is undone but of so many men who seek to sell themselves the prince gets only those whom he can purchase others with regret remain faithful to their country  chap xv of rooting out the love of glory whilst the desire of acquiring fame burns in the breast of the subjects and they are greedy after glory alone liberty is never more secure they stand unshaken at dangers disheartened by no obstacle and restrained by no consideration less fearing the most horrid torture than the opprobrium of betraying their country to a tyrant  princes accordingly lose no opportunity of changing the object of glory for fame which the public dispenses they substitute honors which they alone distribute and instead of making dignities the reward of services done the patria they make honors the salary of services tendered to them thus their creatures are covered both with infamy and marks of dignity and these marks of note are soon valued at the expense of merit virtue and talents  hence arise two opposite effects men of abject principles seek after dignities men of an elevated mind despise them disgraced by the use they are made of and the persons on whom they are bestowed to become worthy of them is no more the pursuit of noble souls when once honors are discredited an incentive to generous actions to great deeds is wanting and the love of glory for want of fuel is extinguished in every heart  chap xvi of encouraging servility when the prince is the only source of consideration favor becomes the object of every ones desires to be accounted something those who approach him exert themselves to please him the inestimable advantage of being free is therefore sacrificed on all sides to dazzling servitude and the love of ones patria to ignominious marks of note  in order to be in favor with the monarch they speak emphatically of his little merit they allow him to possess virtues of every kind and extol the happiness of being under his empire it is oftentimes the case with both houses of parliament not to proportion words to things in their addresses of thanks to the throne how little soever be the desert of the monarch they always give him overstrained encomiums let him do right or wrong they praise him for every thing thank him for every thing and never so much as when he deserves neither thanks nor praises for the rulers of the british empire what a disgraceful part it will be said that these fawning addresses are but empty words but whilst praises are prostituted what remains to be said to a good king to a true father of his people where are the allurements of virtue whilst flattery bestows on others the encomiums which belong to virtuous men alone and so long as this shameful practice endures what prince will be afraid of being branded with infamy or be incited to grace the throne fortunately those base flatteries sink into contempt those venal discourses censured by the public are reduced to their just value  it is not in those addresses it is said that one must look for the spirit and love of liberty so much the worse flattery and venality are linked together the one goes rarely without the other and both are always attended with slavery     more than that all who approach him abase themselves are earnest to cringe at his feet disdain all those who scorn to imitate them and proud of their chains seek for the disgracing privilege of being his laughing stock  destitute of virtue they cannot bear it in others and exert all their address in ridiculing them on all occasions they depress glorious deeds asperse good men and by the most humiliating epithets stigmatize the lovers of liberty  at first their base discourses are despised but by constantly repeating the same without blushing they amaze their adversaries and humble them by despising their blows besides as such effrontery in facing ridicule imposes upon the multitude incapable of appraising things at their just value contempt ends and admiration begins  on his part the prince scarcely rises any to dignities but in proportion as they prove servile never sure of his favor unless ever ready to betray their engagements they are disgraced from the moment they remember their duty mean flatterers and those wretches who sell their conscience that they might sell their protection are therefore the only persons who can bear themselves up in such a thorny place thus all vices reign at courts there flattery perjury and contempt of all duty parade with effrontery  not being allowed to live as one might wish every one lives according to the times men and affairs even the wisest have but a frigid admiration for virtue and the best patriots are but little concerned for the public good  chap xvii of turning virtuous men out of places in a free but newly established government men who have best served their country are ever seated at the helm and men of avowed honesty ever sit on the bench if the prince is trusted with the power of disposing of places for the future it is on condition that he shall prefer none but deserving persons but in order to become absolute far from calling to him talents and virtue he imperceptibly removes from office men that are popular wise and incorruptible and puts in their places men of easy terms  chap xviii of disuniting the people having engaged the people to lose fight of their patria an attempt is made to annihilate the love of it in their hearts men united by liberty and for liberty must remain free as long as they remain united to be enslaved they therefore ought to be divided and time never fails to offer an opportunity for it  almost in every state there are from its foundation various ranks of people nobles ever disdain the plebeians and plebeians ever hate the nobles or rather every one who belongs to any rank hates or despises those who belong to another these base passions princes make use of to sow dissension and alienate the affections of the people from their patria  if there is originally no diversity of ranks those at the helm labor to introduce it they divide the people into different classes and to every one assign particular employments rights or privileges the one is appointed to magistracies the other to military services this to ecclesiastical benefices that to trade and mechanical arts  till the secession of the romans the patricians only were nominated to the magistracy and till the emperors every order of citizens was not admitted to military service  none but noblemen were to be admitted into the order of knights templars and none are to be admitted into that of knights of malta but those whose nobility can be proved by many descents  in france noblemen military men and the kings honorary counselors alone are free from a land tax called la taille  in order to incite jealousy among his subjects philip ii of spain settled in      by proclamation a ceremonial to be observed in regard to the grandees ministers and prelates he likewise fixed the titles by which the citizens were to be styled and ordered the refractory to be prosecuted by law  at venice the different orders of the body of the cytadini is composed of the secretaries of the commonwealth of the notaries physicians lawyers woollen and silk merchants and of the glassmakers of maron that is to say of the most powerful citizens   cytadini are distinguished the one from the other and all from the vulgar by peculiar privileges the first order is appointed to the residentship of foreign courts and to the secretaryship of counsels and embassies into their families patricians are permitted to marry sometimes some of them are incorporated into the body of the nobility instead of those families which become extinct the other cytadini are permitted to take the gown of the nobles thus they are all engaged to unite with the masters of the commonwealth against the rest of the people  but as if this craft was still insufficient the administration sows dissension among the rabble of the different wards of the city and constantly keeps up two opposite parties the nicoloti and castellani by secretly encouraging fighting among them on one particular day of the year  of their subjects of terra ferma the burgesses are treated with indulgency the nobles with severity  looking upon the paduans as the ancient masters of venice the seignory took particular care to keep them disunited for that purpose the most powerful families were transported to venice and such privileges granted to the students of the university as to incense the jealousy of the citizens  princes not satisfied with dividing the people into various orders enjoying diverse privileges artfully incite discord in every order by means of odious distinctions louis xi was continually sowing discord among his barons and to succeed in dividing them employed the most refined policy  the venetians did the same with the nobles of terra ferma peter erizza being podestate at udina as the nobility of the frioul were then in very good correspondence among themselves was ordered to set them at variance and for that purpose received from the senate the power of granting the title of count or marquis to whom he should think proper hence soon arose great jealousies between the families who claimed those titles and those that did obtain them amelot de la houssaye gouvern de venice    they grant peculiar prerogatives to individuals and give pensions to courteous officers to adulatory academicians poets comedians etc  continuation of the same subject in order to sow discord among their subjects almost all princes have tolerated different religious sects some of them have even countenanced particular sectaries others with the same views have persecuted them  these artifices prove so destructive to liberty that by their aid many princes have governed their people in an arbitrary manner  a truth of which we ourselves have more than once had the sad experience  when the reformation had extended itself among us this kingdom was divided into two parties who alternately having recourse to the king obliged him oftentimes to hold the balance between them but to crush them both with their own hands he made it incline now toward one side then toward the other  as henry viii was a slave to his furious passions each party flattered themselves that a blind compliance with the kings will would throw him fully into their interests and they implicitly put themselves into his hands  while the people were in succeeding times divided into whigs and tories and as soon as these two factions were made irreconcilable by the artifices of the court and could counterbalance the forces of each other charles ii pulled off the mask dissolved the parliament and the nation beheld with astonishment a king who had received so many mortifications from the legislative powers and had been so often obliged to submit on a sudden without fleet without army without money and without foreign assistance become absolute master of his kingdom letting his opposers feel the terrible effects of his vengeance sacrificing the most spirited patriots to his rage and governing his subjects with a tyrannical sway  chap xix of multiplying the tools of power to increase their power princes increase the number of placemen  under those princes of the austrian house who mounted the spanish throne the number of civil and military places was prodigious there were thousands of titulars and scarcely any man of some consideration without an office or dignity desormeaux abreg chronol de lhist despag   hitherto the attempts made against liberty have not alarmed the subjects as these changes have been gradual and as these new manners have taken place without offending the minds of the people far from entertaining any sinister suspicion they believe their wellbeing to be augmented but an alteration is soon to follow already there are no more public feasts no more mirthful shows sad scenes succeed the subjects feel their grievous situation and futurity offers them but an afflicting perspective  full of himself and conscious of his force the prince grows every day impatient at the idea of his dependency and hastes to rid himself of it  chap xx of placing corrupted men at the helm princes cannot alone ruin liberty they absolutely want some aid and as their ministers are to be their chief tools of tyranny they commit the execution of their dark designs to crafty men to men without honor honesty and conscience some of the most artful confer no office no place of any authority but to men of new families who being sensible that they owe every thing to royal favor are content to support the power of the crown though at the expense of justice and national privileges and the better to secure their projects they even admit but few into the cabinet  henry vii ever ruled by a faction and that by the lesser faction to give full scope to his tyrannical rapacity he nominated for his ministers empson and dudley two profligate men equally enabled by their knowledge in the law to pervert the forms of justice to the oppression of the innocent and perfectly qualified to prey upon the defenseless people  louis xi trusted none with the first places of government but men that were corrupt and of base extraction these were his sole confidents and the ministers of his ambitious designs  to become absolute charles ii established a cabinet council known by the name of the cabal composed but of few men equally destitute of honor and virtue even boasting of their own vices  when we consider what sort of men princes generally make choice of for their servants what are we to think of the masters themselves  chap xxi of securing the tools of power from the sword of justice favor always proves sufficient to render ministers zealous but impunity alone renders them audaciously enterprising princes take care therefore to protect them against the laws and free them from punishment whatever be the crimes they are guilty of  henry viii granted to wolsey the following pardon that the king out of his mere motion and especial favor did pardon all and all manner of treason misprision of treason murders felonies and outrages whatsoever by the said wolsey committed or to be hereafter committed  such was the pardon granted to the earl of somerset by james i and such the pardon granted to the earl of danby by charles ii  what did not charles i to free strafford from punishment at first he refused to sign the deathwarrant next he interceded by tears and supplications then demanded that the punishment should be commuted into perpetual imprisonment afterward prayed for a respite and in fine reluctantly submitted  has not louis xv lately snatched out of the hands of justice the duc daguillon charged with having made an attempt to poison that troublesome patriot  m de la chalotaye  chap xxii of filling the courts of judicature with corrupted men liberty is established on the laws alone but as the laws ever speak by the mouths of men in order to render them delusive and useless princes set on the benches corrupted judges or they corrupt those who are sitting  the constant policy of henry vii consisted in nominating to every place of trust churchmen lawyers and new men who were all more dependant on him than the great  louis xi studiously filled all the departments of government with men of base extraction  under james i the star chamber the council of york the high commissioncourt etc were wholly composed of the kings creatures and all causes of any concern brought before them  charles i bribed the judges of the highcourt of justice and not content with this under color of reforming abuses granted a commission to the archbishop of canterbury and other members of the privy council for regulating the jurisdiction of all the courts of judicature in the kingdom these commissioners were to examine all questions controversies and debates arising about the jurisdiction of the courts civil and ecclesiastical they were constituted with power to call before them as often as they would any of the judges of the said courts or contending parties to examine upon oath the officers and clerks to hear and debate the questions and causes to consider and advise on the subject then to lay before the king the said considerations that he might determine by his authority the matter in dispute whitlocke page    rym foed vol xix page   0 etc   after the dissolution of the parliament held in      all the magistrates judges justices of peace governors and lordslieutenants were changed and the most violent tories put in their places  charles ii used to closet the judges to serve him his own way rapin by tindal   the accounts of graham and burton the wicked solicitors of james the seconds illegal prosecutions having been inspected by the committee appointed in relation to the state prisoners it appeared that from the year      to the year      they had received near  0000 pounds out of the exchequer which they alleged to have paid to witnesses jurors solicitors counselors and other persons concerned in their prosecutions of indictments informations and trials of persons in capital and other pretended criminal causes and in the name and on behalf of the king  chap xxiii of secret practices whilst the subjects abandon themselves to dissipation the prince seeing himself surrounded with men careless of watching his motions attempts to attack liberty but he first drops some proposals calculated to support his secret views if the proposals pass they form a basis upon which he hastens to build if they pass not and yet the opposition be not strong he takes advantage of the circumstance has recourse to craft endeavors to varnish over his designs with the pretense of promoting the public good this is one of the great maxims of machiavel that in order to subdue easily their subjects princes ought to be perfect masters of the art of deceiving e necessario says he in his prince saper been colorize et esser gran simulatore e dissimulatore e sono tanto semplici gli huomini e tanto obedienti all necessita presenti che colui chi inganna tree vera sempre chi si lasciera ingannare    and begs they would rely on his word then without being ashamed of basely perjuring himself he takes god to witness the uprightness of his intentions and his reverence for the laws he is about to infringe and the people are so silly as to trust to such protestations  at other times those at the helm induce some of their tools to propose in the name of the public the projects in view deceived by appearance the people again fall into the snare  thus the ministry during pitts administration had proposed by some pretended patriots the settling of the militia and the project was executed  thus the court has since proposed by other pretended patriots the settling of the militia on the same footing with regular troops but god forbid that this project should likewise be put in execution  the prince being about to make an open attempt in order to cast a mist before the eyes of the public repeats feasts and shows he gains the public confidence by performing some engagement of his own or he keeps up the spirit of gaming as in an extensive state the proceedings of administration are seldom inquired into but by men near the court these villainous scenes of deception are commonly exhibited in the capital only     in order to prepare the people to receive mazarin the very day that this minister was to return to paris louis xiv issued out a proclamation commanding the immediate payment of all arrears on the rentes viageres sur l hotel de ville hist du card mazar vol iv   the very day of the revocation of the edict of nantes this monarch exhibited a magnificent tournament voltaire siecle de louis xiv vol i  and he used to be lavish of feasts and shows whenever he intended to invade some important branch of government or to incroach upon the subjects  if the prince is making any hazardous attempt he is ever careful to reserve some means of justification  charles ii having formed a design of rendering himself absolute engaged through the intrigues of the duke of lauderdale the parliament of scotland held in      to pass an act approving the raising of the militia and ordering that it might be employed in any county of the crowns dominions without any application to the king for his express order and that it should be obliged to obey any order from the scotch council thus taking in appearance the militia out of the royal hands to put it into those of the council it was in the kings power to order them whenever he had occasion for them without his appearing openly to call them into england and any complaint in case of a miscarriage would be brought against the council rapin by tindal   chap xxiv of making innovations in no political constitution are the rights of the people well enough established to prevent the arbitrary proceedings of administration in no political constitution has the legislature been wary enough to render innovations unnecessary and it is by means of these innovations that princes lay the foundation of tyranny  on any plausible pretense they begin by creating some office some dignity or erecting a new court of justice at first they have this court regulated as the old ones they then alter its form of proceeding and gradually make it arbitrary  the power of creating peers without the assent of parliament was contrary to the ancient laws of the realm this power was usurped by henry iii lord beauchamp was the first who took his place in parliament by virtue of a letter patent humes hist of england   under color of clearing the kingdom of banditti edward i established the commission of trialbaton with a power to research and punish all kind of disorders and crimes these commissioners took their turn in the several counties and without distinguishing the innocent from the guilty they prosecuted on the most trifling suspicion condemned on the slightest charge and filled the gaols with pretended malefactors who were permitted afterward to redeem their liberty by paying heavy fines with which the kings treasury was filled humes hist of england ann        under the specious pretense of easing those subjects who had no money to prosecute their suits in the courts of westminster henry viii without any authority from parliament erected a council at york the judicature of which extended over several shires at first this unconstitutional court acted according to the rules of other criminal courts but james i from the very beginning of his reign made it dependant on the kings instructions charles i afterward made it independent of every rule of law in the kingdom and ordered those who should fly from that bloody tribunal to be dragged before it from any part of the realm  if the prince erects no court of justice he changes the established forms of law alters the tenure by which the judges hold their places sets them above the censure of the legislative powers makes their judgments arbitrary and calls before them all causes  in a statute of henry iv it is enacted that the judgments given in the kings courts shall not be examined in parliament or elsewhere unless rym foed vol xix page     made by attaint and error  having made the power of the star chamber arbitrary charles i ordered all civil causes between himself and his subjects to be brought before that court  a bloody tribunal where right and courage were useless where bribery and villainy were seated on the bench holding the balance of justice where resentment and ferocity quenched their thirst in the blood of innocent victims  it is not however by open and violent attacks that princes commonly begin to overturn the constitution they rather undermine it they innovate by degrees and make things yield insensibly to their will if sometimes they follow violent measures it is only in relation to some notorious villain whose punishment though arbitrarily inflicted is always agreeable to the people more mindful of their own interests than jealous of their liberty and ever ready to confirm the unjust power which is at last to oppress them  chap xxv of disarming the subjects to become absolute craft without force avails but little la puissance says the card of richelieu in his political testament etant une des chooses les plus essentielles a la grandeur des roys ceux qui ont la principale conduite de letat sont particulierement obliges de ne rien obmettre qui puisse contribuer a render leur maitre si autorise quil soit par

pour se render redoutable il faut quil ait un grand nombre de gens de guerre et de largent dans ses coffres     in a free country it is with his subjects as volunteers that the prince attacks the enemy with them he makes a conquest or defends the state but at the head of men wedded to their country he dares not make any attempt against liberty mercenary troops are therefore thought necessary to subvert the government princes accordingly have all labored as soon as it was in their power to have such troops and in order to succeed they have employed many artifices  charles vii of france

subjects effected the histoire de france par velly and villaret tom xv p     etc establishment of a standing army under pretense of putting the state in a posture of defense on any sudden invasion he retained in his service a body of sixteen thousand infantry and nine thousand cavalry he appointed officers to command them and stationed them at his pleasure in different parts of the kingdom thus instead of the auxiliary tenants of the barons attached only to the chieftain whose banner they followed and accustomed to obey no other command the king had troops that were taught to acknowledge a master to obey his orders and expect from him the reward of their services  under the pious pretense of keeping always on foot a force sufficient to oppose the frequent incursions of the moors from africa and to resist the progress of the infidels ximenes regent of castile issued out a proclamation commanding every city in that kingdom to enroll a certain number of its burgesses he ordered them to be trained to the use of arms engaged officers to command them and took this new militia into his service the nobles of castile alarmed at the repeated attempts made by ximenes for extending the power of the crown began to utter loud complaints and formed many cabals but before they proceeded to extremities they deputed some of their number to the cardinal to enquire into the power in consequence of which he exercised acts of such authority in answer to their demand ximenes produced the testament of ferdinand by which he was appointed regent of the spanish monarchy then leading

rym vol ix page        under various pretenses military service for pecuniary contribution and substituted to the military tenants of the nobles a new militia much more disposed to execute his orders henrys successors pursued his plan some of them even attempted to have a standing army and at last succeeded immediately after monmouths invasion james ii demanded a subsidy for keeping on foot some regular troops under pretense of being ready at any time to face a new danger see his speech to parliament in       but a standing army properly speaking was unknown in england till the accession of the house of brunswick through the very earnest desire of george i a considerable body of troops was taken into constant pay to maintain the tranquillity of the kingdom and answer the ends of the treaty of hanover  in the other states of europe the scheme of standing armies has likewise been pursued with eagerness and executed with such success that the swiss excepted there are no patriotic soldiery every where mercenaries stand armed by tyranny against liberty  as these troops were raised under the specious pretense of defending the state men tied to their country by some establishment were at first enrolled such soldiers proved but little submissive in order to get soldiers more devoted princes were sensible that their armies ought to be composed of men who having no property no principle might be ever as ready to march against their countrymen as against the enemy  in proportion as industry increases and commerce flourishes inequality extends itself part of the people swallows up all the riches the remainder abased by misery or contemptible employments subsists only by the vices or follies of the opulent and possesses an industry which weds them to no country of this abject populace destitute of all knowledge of every virtue of every principle of honor without patrimony and ashamed of their indigence princes compose their armies  but as if national mercenaries were not sufficiently devoted to tyranny princes to oppress their subjects have recourse to foreigners  in france there are in the regal armies swiss corsicans italians scotch irish etc  in spain there are italians swiss germans etc  in prussia half of the troops are french or polish  in england there are indeed no foreign soldiery but several scotch regiments are constantly stationed there and from the good harmony which reigns between the two nations the king resigns to them the odious part of oppressing his english subjects  some princes are not satisfied with having at their command foreign troops but will even keep no others  in all their expeditions offensive or defensive the senate of venice have avoided with the greatest care arming the citizens even on the most urgent occasions in the time of the league of cambray the senate seeing the wretched state of their affairs took into service soldiers of the enemy at a zequin a day     most princes have carried their policy so far as to disarm their subjects on different pretenses fearing they should ever be made sensible of their own force and should use it to repel oppression  under color of public safety the regency of spain in      issued out a proclamation forbidding the citizens of madrid keeping firearms desormeaux abreg chronol de lhist despag   in france the peasants have been disarmed under pretense of preventing their hunting and in the whole kingdom the capital excepted only noblemen military men and honorary officers of the king are permitted to wear arms  at venice the wearing of arms is prohibited by the most severe law  thus princes having armed mercenary troops against the people under pretense of securing public tranquillity tie the hands of their subjects the more easily to enslave them  chap xxvi of providing for the pay of the military to establish standing armies avails but little if the means of keeping them are wanting accordingly princes whilst they labored to get mercenary troops have applied themselves to appropriate funds for the regular payment of them and they needed only the same pretenses  chap xxvii of acts of power against law and of judgments of law against liberty the prince having now grounded his authority forms attempts upon liberty with less caution as it is seldom the case that a whole nation is concerned for an injured subject some tools of the ministry have raised their clamours against the society of the bill of rights they have even carried their effrontery so far as to upbraid this society with the rank of its members let their rank be what it will their attempt is bold it is praiseworthy noble and generous instead of giving ear to those detractions the nation ought rather to have followed such a spirited example and established a fund for prosecuting at the public expense the minister whenever he injures any unsupported subject in order to maintain their liberty the people ought to espouse against administration the cause even of the meanest individual when oppressed whilst the members of the state separate their interest the constitution has no strength and slavery is approaching    the prince attacks the privileges of the people by incroaching upon the rights of individuals  if the injured parties make any expostulation about the violence offered them awed by power too feeble to contest with the minister or unable to bear the charges of a lawsuit they are obliged to suffer the injury and submit to oppression thus the question not being determined the outrages of the prince pass unrepressed and instead of appearing firmly in support of those who suffer in the public cause the others basely desert them and the unfortunate fall like victims devoted to their ill fate  if the prince has to do with men able to contest with him he attempts to prevail over them if his efforts prove unsuccessful he lets slip no opportunity to weary the adverse parties by formality adjournment and expenses he is intent in perplexing them by cavilling at law in order if possible to prevent the matter being finally decided  when he cannot dismiss the adverse parties he sometimes makes an attempt upon their lives  if sword and poison prove ineffectual how many resources still remain interest fear hope pride prejudice craft seduction calumny perjury all are in favor of the man arrayed with honors and constituted in power  to defend his own rights a private man has no resource but to make application to a court of judicature almost always presided over and oftentimes wholly composed of ministerial tools james i charles i charles ii and james ii used to offer violence to their subjects and then to inform against them in a corrupt court whitlocke  in our days bribery disgraces sometimes the courts of justice among us the president being commonly a creature of the prince is not wanting in prepossessing the judges in favor of the crown and in forestalling their opinion the judges themselves often yield to bribery and in every cause where administration is concerned a devoted jury may always be got of this we have a clear proof in the case of mr wilkes relating to the secretaries of slate the day before mr wilkess trial letters signed the summoning officer were sent to several of the jury acquainting them that mr wilkess trial was put off to another day which prevented those to whom these letters were sent from attending their duty at westminster hall at the real time of his trial in the interim another jury was packed which found him guilty history of the late minority    let his claim be ever so legal justice and law too weak against power and secret practices are impotent supporters of his rights even those who argue generally restrained by fear or respect are not so bold as to make good his title with spirit i confess with pleasure that such is not commonly our case there are still among us patriotic lawyers and their number is not small but amidst so many zealous supporters of the rights of the people the name of glynn will ever grace the annals of liberty    whilst the counsel of the adverse party safe under the royal banners and emboldened by favor extenuate it or put upon it a false construction cunning is opposed to justice sophism to reason falsehood to truth no pains are wanting to seduce the judges in favor of tyranny the judges themselves seduced or corrupted run into oppressive vengeance and to gratify their interested views prostitute justice to power during the fatal reigns of henry vii henry viii mary james i charles i charles ii and james ii with what shocking profligacy did the judges prostitute themselves to the crown with what unexampled insolence they oppressed the unfortunate prosecuted by those tyrants without shame scruple or remorse they followed with a blind devotion every order from the court and for the same deed condemned one day the man whom they had acquitted a day before amidst so many instances of this kind let this suffice  the kings counsel who were against the famous titus oats prosecuted by james ii had been for him in the trial of the five jesuits particularly the attorney general and solicitorgeneral    so that the unhappy sufferer is almost always not only deprived of redress but meets with new oppression even sometimes without having been suffered to offer any thing in his defense in      the attorney general exhibited an information in the exchequer against samuel vassal a merchant of london for refusing to pay the new duty of five shillings and sixpence on every hundred weight of currants to this information vassal pleaded the statutes of magna charta the statute de tallagio non concedendo and that this duty was imposed without assent of parliament the barons of the exchequer refused to hear vassals counsel argue for him and said that the king was in possession and that they would keep him in it macaulays hist of england vol ii page     in the causes brought before the high courts of justice against the crown under the stuarts the sword was always lifted up on the head of those who dared to defend the rights of the people whilst those who were for regal prerogative safe under the banners of the crown urged with effrontery the most palpable falsehoods     thus men fated to command crush those who have spirit enough to inform against arbitrary acts of power make has not the maxim that the king can do no wrong been alleged in vindication of illegal acts of power and the title of pater patriae in proof that the king loved his people at the very time he tyrannized over them parl hist vol viii page    etc   sophistry and clamor triumph over the most sacred privileges and rashly complete under the form of justice the destruction of their enemies  would the evil had been circumscribed here but these acts of injustice soon produce many others whilst any newly injured person complains against oppression he is ironically answered what do you complain of we do you no wrong  see the precedents thus outrages pass into use and as if tyranny became lawful because it remained unpunished they allege ancient usurpations as sacred prerogatives and plead violences formerly offered to the laws in vindication of those violences which are now offered to them thus the attorney general and the kings counsel undertook to vindicate the unlawful imprisonments ordered by charles i by alleging those ordered by elizabeth parl hist vol viii page     and thus the ministers who persecuted the printers and publishers of the north briton no    undertook to vindicate their illegal proceedings     chap xxviii of unconcernedness the people seldom foresee their fate render their birthrights illusive undermine their liberty they perceive their miserable servitude only when they feel it when they hear the names of the proscribed when they see the blood of their fellow subjects or when crushed under the yoke they trembling expect the punishment they are to undergo  the subjects in order to maintain their liberty ought to watch the motions of the ministry with a jealous eye men are never so easily undone as when they suspect no danger and too great security in a nation is almost always the forerunner of slavery  but as a continual attention to public affairs is above the reach of the multitude in a state jealous of its liberty there never should be wanting some men to watch the transactions of the ministers unveil their ambitious projects givean alarm at the approach of the storm rouse the people from their lethargy disclose the abyss open before them and point out those on whom the public indignation ought to fall the greatest misfortune therefore which can attend a free country where the prince is powerful and enterprising is that no party no commotion no faction agitate the minds of the subjects all is undone when the people are unconcerned for public affairs on the contrary liberty constantly springs up out of the fires of sedition  chap xxix to wear out the zeal of the people by false alarms but in order that the efforts of watchful patriots may be attended with success great care ought to be taken not to alarm the people causelessly  made dupes to many false alarms they become at last unconcerned at real dangers  great care ought to be taken likewise not to alarm them upon slight occasions if the grievances are not so apparent as to be universally assented to there is but little hope of seeing them redressed since the multitude are persuaded by evidence alone and by the efforts of the multitude only are the projects of tyranny confounded  great care ought to be taken chiefly not to incite them to the pursuit of a false or even doubtful object when the subjects proceed so far as to put themselves in a posture of defending their rights it is of great concern to liberty that they be not overcome by checks the victory of administration is only delayed but by checks the people is disheartened and abased  chap xxx of ill grounded writings when administration is censured the charges against it ought constantly to be supported by incontrovertible facts if the subjects in a just cause make any inconsiderate step it suffices to ruin their affairs the prince who at first trembled under the lash of the malcontents while they confined themselves within the bounds of prudence triumphs as soon as they go beyond he complains in his turn he prosecutes those who have handled the pen and leaving the public grievances for his private injuries he oftentimes succeeds in making the people lose sight of the principal object thus the friends of liberty who by cautious proceedings might have been victorious lose by a single act of imprudence the fruit of their past efforts  of this truth we have a convincing proof before us while the author of the north briton contented himself with censuring the government with disclosing the secret views of the favorite with pursuing and prosecuting him closely he kept the ministry in perpetual alarm and made them tremble under the lash of his spirited writings but when he disgraced his pen by employing it in grossly aspersing the character of a certain princess instead of attacking arbitrary power he furnished his enemies with weapons to his own destruction  char xxxi of satirical writings the manner in which the cause of the public is defended is not of little concern to liberty when tyranny is complained of let it be always in a grave and animated style satirical writers attack indeed the tyrant but not tyranny and far from reminding him of his duty they mortally wound his pride they exasperate and incense him the more  satirical strokes avail not but to promote servitude and although sensible men might look upon them not as upon exaggerated charges they go not the less against the aim intended for by affording fuel to public malignity it is a constant practice with the french to ease their grief about public misfortunes with songs and epigrams    they ease the peoples griefs weaken the sense of their injuries and prevent their resentment they make them laugh at their own misfortunes and patiently suffer tyranny  chap xxxii of invectives the want of decency likewise prejudices the cause of the public gross invectives indispose peaceable men scandalize well bred men and alienate all those cool patriots who are tied but by a thread to the cause of liberty  chap xxxiii of bad writings if it is of great concern that the public cause be not defended but in a serious style it is of no less concern that it be pleaded in a masterly manner all those stupid writers who stand forth as the champions of liberty only prejudice it their languid productions do not awaken do not persuade do not animate the reader and the languor they inspire prevents any spirited attempt  chap xxxiv of too great a multiplicity of writings it has been said that in a state jealous of its liberty some men ought never to be wanting to reclaim the laws when violated by the prince to rouse the people from their lethargy to guide them in difficult cases and bring them back to their rights but as the human mind when too long intent upon any object becomes weary of it all is undone if in exciting the patriotic zeal of the people their spirits be exhausted and their zeal rendered extinct  this unfortunately has happened to us in our late dissensions plagued with so many writings and exhausted by our own efforts we are at present reduced to such an apathy that nothing is able to fix our attention  chap xxxv of the excessive moderation of the people to overturn the constitution princes commonly undermine it they innovate by degrees seldom in a flagrant manner but the people are neither attentive nor sagacious enough to observe those innovations nor foresee the consequences of them and if they were they have not spirit enough to oppose them the first innovations however ought to be strongly opposed in order to maintain liberty when once abuses are grown inveterate with the more difficulty are they reformed they even many times admit of no remedy  to maintain themselves free the people ought readily to espouse the cause of any individual oppressed by the prince when subjects separate their interests they are subdued one after another and liberty is undone far from being ready to protect the rights of others every one must have seen his own rights many times flagrantly attacked before he resolves to defend them and it is difficult to conceive how great advantage the government takes from that want of spirit to oppose its criminal attempts and how much it concerns liberty that subjects be not so patient  when charles i began to put his impure hands into the purses of his subjects or to offer them the shocking scene of a savage cruelty in the persons of the unfortunate wretches who were doomed to destruction had the people taken arms marched against the tyrant and condemned the ministers of his vengeance to the scaffold they never had so long groaned under the most odious oppression  yet i would not advise a people to have recourse at every instant to violent measures but under color of not disturbing the public tranquillity quiet men do not perceive that they gain nothing by their indulgence but to be oppressed with more impunity that they encourage tyranny and that when they at last undertake to stop its progress it often proves too late  the sacrilegious ambition of princes prompts them to make attempts upon liberty but the cowardice of the people alone permits their fetters to be forged ambitious as they are princes would be less enterprizing if they were always to make themselves a way to absolute power by force and violence when we peruse attentively the history of despotism we sometimes behold with astonishment an handful of men the judges of the star chamber of the high commission court of la chamber ardente of the inquisition etc    keeping in awe a whole nation that inconsiderate moderation of the people that timidity that fatal propensity to separate their common interests are the true causes of this surprising phenomenon for where is the voice of the public when every one continues silent  chap xxxvi of concealing public grievances when the clamours of the oppressed subjects are at length excited the prince strives to prevent the voice of the public from being heard he sends his emissaries every where to seduce the meanest class of the people and engage them to present flattering addresses which are artfully put in opposition to the just remonstrances of the nation then adding mockery to injury he boasts of the lenity of his government and endeavors to make the multitude of the malcontents pass for an handful of illminded people these artifices were made use of by charles ii after the dissolution of the parliament at oxford and are even put in practice in our days unfortunately there are not now wanting hypocritical patriots ready thus to connive with the ministry     but the better to conceal national grievances the prince kindly receives those addresses which approve of his conduct and distinguishes the bringers with particular marks of favor whilst those who venture to present addresses in a contrary style are received with evident these artifices were made use of by charles ii after the dissolution of the parliament at oxford and are even put in practice in our days unfortunately there are not now wanting hypocritical patriots ready thus to connive with the ministry   tokens of displeasure if they are not even denied admittance  not satisfied with discouraging those who might have presented disagreeable addresses the prince silences the printers of news who are not devoted to him whilst others are allowed to publish daily invectives against the patriotic party and bestow encomiums on the administration  if these measures do not succeed the leaders of the malcontents are bribed and engaged to extinguish the zeal of their own adherents such were the means as reported put in practice in our late dissentions in order to make the designs of the supporters of liberty miscarry     chap xxxvii of preventing the redress of public grievances it is a maxim in the cabinet that the injuries offered to the people if they remain unredressed acquire to the crown the prerogative of offering them new ones accordingly when public grievances are brought before a supreme tribunal the prince makes use of every possible artifice to prevent its taking cognizance of them he attempts to divert therefrom the attention of the judges by laying before them new objects hurrying the subsidybill was the usual craft of our kings of the house of stuart every time the parliament took into consideration national grievances and to carry that point they employed every possible artifice they even worked upon the most tender passions of the human heart and then turned against the legislators the nobleness of their sentiments  in the year   0  the ministers of james i entreated an immediate supply to the kings necessities but as the bill for subsidies went on heavily in the lower house and the redress of grievances was thought very necessary to precede the grant in the heat of debate an alarm of the kings being murdered at oking threw the whole house into confusion the frighted members sent message after message to the council to know the truth of the various reports in a little time they became less strong then doubtful and in some hours james sent word that he intended being in london that day whilst the minds of men were yet agitated by the double surprise whilst the tide of affection ran yet high on account of the supposed accident the courtiers pushed the supply so warmly that notwithstanding all that the clearsighted could do they carried the motion and the parliament was suddenly prorogued macaul hist of engl    or prevails upon the president to dissolve the assembly when about taking any spirited resolution during the perpetual disputes of charles i with his parliament the king engaged the speaker of the commons to interrupt all debates by breaking up the meeting whenever any patriotic orator affected the house and thus to prevent any spirited resolution this artifice has been oftentimes made use of but chiefly when the commons had taken cognizance of the infraction of the petition of rights crews proceed of com     if these artifices prove abortie he labors to set the senate at variance by exciting jealousies among its charles i used to sow discord between the two houses of parliament in all his speeches he flattered the lords reminded them of their preeminence and invited them to support the throne against the commons as being nearer to it   members by bribing some and intimidating others when henry viii mary elizabeth james i and charles i met with great opposition from the lower house they used to send to the tower the members who distinguished themselves most by patriotic zeal     if this proves not sufficient he removes the patriotic members by nominating them to places in      charles i meeting with an extreme opposition from the commons in order to incapacitate sir edward coke sir robert philips sir thomas wentworth sir francis seymour the leading popular members from being chosen representatives he nominated them to serve as sheriffs in the counties and again ventured to call a parliament   which incapacitate them from having a seat in the senate or if there be no other mean he stops all proceedings by proroguing the session  when the prince dares not prorogue it from a consideration of the administration being charged with misdemeanors if called to an account he attempts to clear himself endeavors to extend a veil over all his illegal transactions by exempting his ministers from appearing before any judge charles ii fearing that the parliament should once more fall upon the earl of danby who in prevention to his own danger might be obliged to reveal the kings secret practices with the court of france which it was his interest to keep concealed granted him under the great seal as complete a pardon as could be drawn up rapin     if the prince entertains some suspicions of his creatures lest they should reveal the fatal secret they have been trusted with he is beforehand with them and himself charges them with misdemeanors charles i lest the earl of bristol should disclose the secrets of the odious administration of buckingham charged him with high treason rushworth vol i p         if any fatal discovery is made the prince throws all the blame upon bad counselors and requests the judges to be tender of his honor to prepare them in his favor he affects to reform his administration when the commons proceeded against the earl of danby by bill of attainder charles ii to extricate himself out of those extremities and make the parliament believe that he was resolved entirely to change his manner of governing with a view only to amuse the public formed a new council into which were admitted some of the patriots most opposite to him as the earls of shafresbury and essex but he took care to secure a majority of such members as were devoted to him and leaving the great number for show had few only in his confidence rapin    endeavors to clear himself promises redress of grievances entreats them to confide in his word and without shame of being guilty of perjury calls god to witness the sincerity of his intentions charles i used to assuare the parliament that he would be as careful of their rights as of his life and crown at the very time the complained of a breach of privilege     if they refuse to yield to his vague promises he offers some equivalent to the desired satisfaction or makes some specious concessions  after so many fruitless attempts to prevent the redress of public grievances if the prince is at last obliged to yield he submits but as soon as he discovers the consequence of his concessions he endeavors to recall what has been done in      the commons took the resolution of granting no subsidies to charles i until he had redressed the national grievances but instead of giving his assent to the petition of rights which was to be presented to him by both houses the king used every means to engage them to drop it at first he persuaded the lords to prevail upon the commons to be satisfied with a confirmation of magna charta or some other concession he next in order to frustrate the intent of the said petition wrote to the lower house that he could not give up the point of committing in matters of state he promised for the future to be very tender of the privileges of the people to commit none for not lending money and declared that the causes of all commitments should be exposed as soon as they could with safety he then sent them continual importunate messages for engaging them to confide in his word  when the petition had passed both houses and the commons imagined themselves at the point of receiving the fruit of their labor they received the following answer the king wills that right be done according to the laws and customs of the realm and that the statutes be put in due execution that the subjects will have no cause to complain of any wrong or oppression contrary to their just rights and liberties to the prosecution whereof he holds himself as much obliged as of his own prerogative  at last seeing that his secret design of bringing into england a body of german horse had taken vent and that he was publicly charged with the opprobrium of the darkest suspicions he complied with the request of the commons but not having been acquainted with the importance of the petition when he gave it his consent he repaired in haste to parliament protested that he had not intended to give away the profit of tonnage and poundage and ordered this protest to be entered in the journal of the commons he then proceeded to seize the goods of several merchants who denied the arbitrary imposition macaul hist of england    and again gives sull scope to his illegal proceedings  chap xxxviii of the artifices made use of in order to suppress public clamours the subjects to keep themselves free have no other means but watchfulness spirit and virtue the prince to subdue them has so many means that he is embarrassed only in his choice of them that however which he mostly makes use of is cunning people are easily deceived in many things and those at the helm take advantage of it  when the oppressed subjects are about taking some resolution in order to oppose the progress of tyranny they always meet with some obstacle let them form what design they please the prince prevents the execution of it immediately let them entreat the redress of grievances their petitions are fruitless the prince alleges his scruples refuses to comply and oftentimes returns mockery to their complaints he answers that he is always ready to hear the grievances of his subjects that he is never so much concerned as about the wellbeing of his people and dismisses them with fair words  if the subjects persist in their resolution the prince persists in his conduct ever applying their minds to the maxims of a fraudulent policy those at the helm learn the art of not being disheartened by difficulties of taking advantage of the weakness of men of cajolling into acquiescence the easy multitude and as it is their method when they mean to prevail over the people to promise them every thing with a view of performing none whilst the malcontents are earnest in their request the prince amuses their credulity with fair promises and without any shame of breaking his word repeats this mean artifice  in the time of la fronde public safety having been attacked by many arbitrary exiles and imprisonments the parliament of paris at last obtained from the king a law see an edict of the   d oct      for securing the liberty of the subject but soon after this law was infringed in the person of chavigni when the parliament remonstrated against this infraction they were answered by the queen regent that the imprisonment complained of ought to deter no body that she passed her word for public safety and that her word would be inviolable she broke however that inviolable word not long after in respect to the princes of conde and conti the parliament remonstrated again and again the regent assured them  that for the future the law should be strictly observed hist du card mazar vol iii live v chap    thus princes mock the people  if incensed at so many false promises and weary with seeing their hopes so many times baffled the malcontents exclaim loudly for justice the prince even then attempts to delay he sends them deputies to amuse them he stops the provoked multitude diverts their fury or cools it by vain consultations till the moment when he can without danger encounter them amidst the various instructions charles v delivered to his son he advised him to yield when the tempest blows high not to oppose the fury of angry destiny to eschew those strokes he cannot resist to beg quarter and watch a favorable opportunity silhons ministre detat live iii chap       if he is forced to treat he at first makes them such offers as he knows will be rejected next he makes proposals more reasonable but expressed in a vague manner calculated to conceal his duplicity and which binding him to no particular obligations leaves him always master of the terms of accommodation or he adds to clear concessions some obscure clause which renders them void if false engagements rather are not taken  alarmed at the secession of the people to the sacred mount the senate of rome seeing themselves obliged to treat made it their only business to stipulate in a vague manner the rights of the tribunes who had been just elected in order to make no grant to the plebeians or rather to secure a pretense for recovering their grants at more favorable junctures  in      charles i wanting to find for the legislative body employment of such consequence as should engross their whole attention and make the people believe he was willing to consent to whatever should be productive of a perfect reconciliation between him and his parliament whilst he was making preparations to vindicate his own terms sent them the following message that they would with all speed fall into consideration of all those particulars which they should hold necessary as well for the upholding and maintaining his majestys just and regal authority and for the settling his revenues as for the present and future establishment of their privileges the free and quiet enjoying their estates and fortunes the liberty of their persons the security of the true religion now professed in the church of england and the settling of ceremonies in such a manner as should take away all just cause of offense which when they had digested and composed into one entire body that so his majesty and themselves might be able to make the more clear judgment on them it should then appear by what his majesty should do how far he had been from intending and designing any of those things which the too great fears and jealousies of some persons apprehended and how ready he would be to exceed the greatest examples of the most indulgent princes in their acts of grace and favor to their people parliam hist   in the insurrection of      at naples as the people

abandoned their lares to go in search of an asylum far from their cruel country when menennius agrippa by command of the senate goes to the malcontents on the sacred mount delivers them a tale and brings them back to their native city tit live decad i lib     continuation of the same subject to defeat the people the prince sometimes opposes to them even their own supporters  considering the esteem of the public for their leaders as destructive of his projects mercenary scribblers are engaged for attempting to vindicate the proceedings of administration for aspersing popular men and defaming those who are so spirited as to oppose the villainous attempts of power a prostituted multitude are directed to go from place to place to spread rumors calculated to excite the people to entertain suspicions of the popular leaders and ruin the confidence of the public toward them such was the craft of the favorite in respect to mr pit hist of the late minority     sometimes attempts are made to engage the popular leaders to disgrace themselves  as manlius incited the romans to set themselves free from the tyranny of the senate the senators had him apprehended but being obliged to set him at liberty in order to suppress the sedition they labored to make him appear odious to the people accordingly they charged him with aspiring to royalty they raised him several accusers from among the populace and thus turned his adherents into judges and enemies tit live decad i lib     during the minority of louis xiv as the parliament of paris exclaimed aloud against the odious exactions made on the subjects with a view of engaging the magistrates to defend for the future their own interests only and thus to disgrace and ruin themselves in the minds of the people the regent encroached upon their rights by appropriating to government for a while their salaries hist du card mazar vol iii   when barnavelt set himself against maurice of nassau who attempted to assume a monarchic power over holland maurice caused him to be charged with being the head of the arminians and under that pretense had him dragged into a prison by his ungrateful fellow citizens and thence to a scaffold  another extraordinary artifice sometimes made use of by princes in order to confound the designs of the subjects is the setting against popular leaders some corrupted men who by going much beyond the request of the leaders labor to make them appear endowed with but little patriotic zeal  with a view of delivering the people from the oppression of the nobles the tribune c gracchus proposed a law advantageous to the plebeians but the senate abstained with great care from any opposition on the contrary they engaged l drusus to go beyond the request of his colleague and to publish in the mean while that caius was only the tool of the senate deceived by such artifice the romans were at a loss to know which they ought to adhere to and thus had their hands tied by that false protector tit live decad i   continuation of the same subject the prince has a thousand means for attacking liberty the subjects but few for defending it and it is not easy to imagine how narrow is the way whereon they can walk with safety whilst he commits with impunity so many outrages upon the laws they on the contrary are ruined by the least fault if the people show themselves but little resolute they are insulted without pity if they give proofs of great resolution they are provoked beyond the bounds of prudence if they pass over those bounds they are attacked even in their very intrenchments the prince in his turn vents complaints he has recourse to the courts of justice drags before them those malcontents who prove the most audacious and cries for vengeance  then too weak against power and secret practices justice avails them nothing and the prince completes the destruction of his enemies by the very laws which were intended to protect them  chap xxxix of the hypocrisy of princes there is no artifice however strange which those at the helm have not made use of to ruin liberty even turning against the subjects their noblest sentiments  when the prince foresees that he will be overpowered he sometimes feigns to lay down arms he expresses much concern for the public distractions makes a show of disinterestedness demands leave to resign and oftentimes the easy multitude deceived by this act of hypocrisy yield to their generous emotions the prince being then entreated to continue to hold the reins of empire at first wavers affects reluctance asks time to consider it then accepts upon certain terms and at last lays new chains upon the people or adds to their former ones  continuation of the same subject if when the people loudly reclaim their rights the prince has been obliged to make some concession in order to disperse the storm he no sooner discovers a favorable turn to his affairs but he begins to alter his tone he complains that his justice

the finances the alienations even the mortgaging of the crown lands was reduced during the disturbances of la fronde to have recourse to new ways of oppression but as the people refused to pay the taxes as the provinces were ready to rise as the confederates for want of money were on the point of breaking off as the enemy threatened the borders and the regal army was in want of every thing the regency entreated the parliament of paris that had complained loudly of the late vexations to consider the times and resolve on the means of providing for the necessities of the government in such junctures the parliament stipulated something in favor of public liberty but no sooner had the news of the victory of lens reached the court but the regency broke their engagements and thought only of

the scots had revolted against the oppressive government of charles i they sent him at york a petition for redress of grievances to which the king answered that he required the petitioners to express the particulars of their desires he having been always ready to redress their grievances but in the mean while he was studious to make a trial of the affection of the yorkshire gentlemen he endeavored to incense them by false insinuations against the scots and attempted to call together the lords of england in order to obtain a subsidy obliged finally to treat he ordered his commissioners not to stipulate any important article he wasted the time in long preliminaries demanded that both armies should be disbanded or at least reduced kept secret intelligence with the enemys party by means of the traitorous montrose and concluded not till reduced to the last extremity his perfidious duplicity did not end here scarcely had the parliament of england met but charles entreated them to declare themselves against the scots he solemnly assured them that he was resolved to gain the affection of his english subjects and promised redress of national grievances in fine all his measures proving abortive he returned to the scots labored to bribe the army to draw them to london in order to seize the tower and make themselves masters of the parliament rushworth vol ii p        james ii alarmed

pretense and the restoration of the college deferred when the dutch army had landed the king having great confidence in the superiority of his own forces upon hearing that the city of london were preparing to address him for an accommodation with the prince of orange declared publicly that he would look upon all those as his enemies who should pretend to give him such advice but the princes troops being joined by a multitude of subjects and some lords petitioning him to call a free parliament he returned answer that he most passionately desired what they asked and promised upon the faith of a king that he would have a parliament and such a one as they asked for as soon as ever the prince of orange had quitted this realm he then published a proclamation for calling a free parliament but repenting his resolution he caused the writs that were to be issued to be burnt and imagining that it would not be possible to call a lawful parliament without his concurrence he threw the great seal into the thames that nothing might be done legally in his absence then left his dominions to go and implore foreign assistance against his people tindal   if princes prepare themselves to subdue their subjects by force they complain of being obliged to have recourse to violence as if they had at heart only the welfare of the people then to get time for securing their projects they propose some ways of accommodation whilst charles i levied war against his people alarmed at the weakness of his party he attempted to delay till he had increased his forces accordingly in order to amuse the parliament he sent them the following message that the king had with unspeakable grief of heart long beheld the distraction of his kingdom that his soul was full of anguish till he could find some remedy to prevent the miseries of a civil war which were ready to overwhelm the nation he proposed to them to appoint persons to treat with a like number authorized by him that nothing should be

pleasure as charles i had met with great opposition from parliament and had resolved to be revenged on the popular leading members he issued out a proclamation which ended with an assurance of a good government but that to depend on the king and not on the strength vigor and goodness of the laws to oppose a bad one     if they meet with opposition they order troops to enforce obedience to their

ignorance which by obstructing the sight of the people prevents them from being acquainted with their own rights and vindicating them  it is ignorance which concealing from them the ambitious designs the secret practices the low artifices of princes prevents them from obviating tyranny from stopping the progress of lawless power and ruining it entirely  it is ignorance which enforcing obedience to many false maxims ties the hands of the people subjects their necks to the yoke and makes them submit with reverence to arbitrary commands  it is ignorance in a word which induces the people to pay willingly to tyrants all those duties they arrogantly require and the credulous vulgar to reverence them as if they were gods  in order to subdue his subjects the prince labors to blind them conscious of the unlawfulness of his own designs and sensible of what he has to fear from clearsighted men he endeavors to deprive the people of every means of acquiring knowledge  how many crafty devices have not princes employed to oppose the progress of learning some banish science out of their dominions others prohibit their subjects from traveling into the rigor with which the czars have banished the sciences out of their empire and prohibited their subjects from traveling into foreign countries without an express permission has very much contributed to continue that gross ignorance in which they still remain and that ignominious slavery which disgraces them  from the zeal that the reigning empress has shown in patronizing learning one might imagine that she intends to abate of her excessive power and to renounce despotism did not her mode of governing prove that such are not her views academies universities courts of judicature have indeed been erected in her dominions but it is only from a spirit of imitation she desires to establish at home what is established abroad and like other monarchs she institutes schools where all things are to be taught except the duties of princes the privileges of the people and the rights of men   foreign countries others again divert the people from reflecting by continually entertaining them for fear the subjects should become conscious of their situation it is a maxim with the venetians to engage the attention of the cytadini by shows feasts and gaming every month in the year there are some public ceremonies and a public lottery at venice and in some particular seasons the public shows are very numerous   with feasts and shows or keeping up among them the spirit of gaming for fear the subjects should become conscious of their situation it is a maxim with the venetians to engage the attention of the cytadini by shows feasts and gaming every month in the year there are some public ceremonies and a public lottery at venice and in some particular seasons the public shows are very numerous   and all stand up against men of spirit who dedicate either their voice or their pen to defend the cause of liberty  when princes cannot restrain the people from freely speaking or writing they oppose error to truth if any exclaim against their outrageous enterprises they at first endeavor to bribe the clamorous patriots and to extinguish their zeal by gifts but chiefly by promises  if the virtue of the patriots be incorruptible they oppose to them prostituted scribblers who ever ready to vindicate tyranny abuse from their obscure cells the friends of liberty exert all their malice in blackening the views of the supporters of the rights of the people and causing them to be looked upon as disturbers of the public tranquillity  if these artifices prove ineffectual in order to silence the protectors of liberty the most horrid expedients are made use of  dungeons sword poison  to silence the malcontents is indeed to prevent the people from awaking out of their lethargy but the chief point is to remove the means of extending the complaints by suppressing all correspondence between the several parts of the state princes accordingly labor to restrain the liberty of the press  at first not daring to attack it openly they wait till the subjects have furnished a plausible pretense for it and as soon as such a pretense is offered they seize it eagerly  when a book contains very striking notions respecting the rights of the people any bold reflections on the bounds of the regal power some violent strokes against tyranny they immediately prohibit the reading or selling of it under pretense that it contains pernicious maxims against religion and good manners what farce is more ridiculous than to see princes making use of such a pretense for tyrannizing over their people indeed it well becomes them to set up as the defenders of good manners when their behavior is so edifying when they are so scrupulous as not to prey upon their subjects not to debauch their wives not to bribe the magistrates not to be guilty of criminal attempts whilst their principles are so honest their actions so blameless their life so pure whilst they have such elevated minds such excellent hearts and are so fond of virtue     they rise up against all writings calculated to keep up the spirit of liberty and denominate libels all performances wherein is attempted to disclose the mysteries of administration and under color of repressing licentiousness such were the maxims of the decemviri as appears by the laws of the twelve tables actuated by the same spirit augustus condemned satirical writers to capital punishment as did tiberius nero caligula domitian etc  under james i the star chamber restrained by a decree the printing of books and prosecuted with cruelty those who were spirited enough to exclaim against tyranny the barbarous punishment inflicted on alexander leighton for having written against the abuse of power is not yet forgotten  after the commotions of la fronde louis xiv appointed a commission under the name of chamber des vacations in order to repress the spirited writings which were published against the premier  in italy france spain portugal denmark germany etc no writing is permitted to be printed without an approbation from the licensers of the press    prosecute authors of spirit they go farther in order to keep the people in ignorance and to leave no way open to important truths they appoint inspectors censors revisors licensers of the press  those base arguses who constantly guard tyranny  when any writings against their oppressive government appear in foreign countries princes cause the edition of them frederick iii king of prussia has caused lately the suppression of a pamphlet published in westphalia against his invasion of poland   to be suppressed and let no book be exposed to sale in their dominions the chancellor of france has not long ago given the fatal blow to freedom of thinking by prohibiting the sale of any book which had not previously been examined by the royal censors the same prohibition has been made in the states of rome and venice  one of the most valuable privileges of english subjects and that which most contributes to stop the progress of despotism is the liberty of the press any one among us may publicly disclose the transactions of the ministry censure their pernicious undertakings exclaim against their villainous attempts and call them to an account at the tribunal of the public  that inestimable privilege will long support liberty in england and may we ever be sensible how carefully it deserves to be maintained  if ever parliament prove so unmindful of their duty as to strike at this privilege there might be a way of making that wretched attempt prove abortive in such case no petition should be made to the throne the people without delay ought to do themselves justice by entirely disregarding the edict of their representatives all wise men all spirited men all true patriots ought at once to take up the pen against parliament itself and all the presses in the kingdom work for that good purpose astonished at the multitude of refractories the senate would decline to take cognizance of the infraction and see in silence their decree violated made sensible of their fault by so spirited an opposition they would recall the bill and let liberty be triumphant  but although such a step should be perilous it ought nevertheless to be taken when those who are appointed the guardians of the rights of the people are the first to attack them what remains to good patriots but to despise those false rulers to embrace the pillars of the temple of liberty and to bury themselves under its ruins    unless it has been previously examined by their creatures  chap xli false idea of tyranny in proportion as knowledge disappears despotism makes its progress  if the want of a true idea of liberty be a cause of slavery the want of a true idea of tyranny is likewise a cause of it  history ought to celebrate only the moderation of princes their wisdom their steadiness in enforcing obedience to the laws zeal in promoting public happiness and tenderness for the people but it celebrates almost always only their magnificent follies their villainous attempts and their outrages history ought to bestow encomiums on those princes alone who are studious of governing the people in peace but it seldom applauds any but princes skilled in the art of desolating the world  abased by fear seduced by hope or corrupted by avarice those who write history inculcate no aversion to absolute power excite in us no horror against tyranny they expatiate on the undertakings of a prince when great or bold however pernicious they be to the welfare of mankind and however wickedly supported they bestow encomiums on deeds for which the voice of all ages should brand with infamy the names of the authors and basely insinuate the maxims of slavery i know there are some historians to be excepted and with pleasure i class the names of a ralph and a macaulay with the respectable one of tacitus     when they treat of governments they declaim against the popular and extol the monarchical they represent the people in a democracy as being ever ready to yield to the seditious speeches of orators earnest in deceiving them for private views and the state as a ship without anchor on a stormy sea continually tossed by contrary winds whilst they compare the subjects of a powerful monarch as a numerous family which rests happy under the wings of a good father  when it so happens that a province shakes off the yoke they term the inhabitants rebels or revolted slaves who ought to be again put into fetters they describe the spirited efforts of a people against oppression as a rebellion a guilty revolt and the friends of liberty as perturbators of the public peace they wrest the views of good patriots blast their reputation and brand their memory instead of respecting their virtues all the spanish historians who have written of the civil wars of castile under charles v have blasted the memory of the brave padillo and almost all the writers who have mentioned the punishment of charles i have represented as barbarous parricides those spirited patriots who sentenced that tyrant to death     if a bad prince is informed against by a virtuous minister according to them he is an unfortunate master betrayed by a perfidious servant see labreg chron de lhist desp de desormeaux tom ii   but on the prince whose actions they record they always bestow exaggerated praises they emphatically speak of his little deserts extol his pretended penetration his concern for the glory of the state and his liberalities they account a conquest as a very fortunate event and describe it as the greatest epoch of his reign whilst writing the history of a great villain although from the mere force of truth they make now and then some disagreeable concessions they ever speak so faintly of his defects they so greatly palliate his vices so artfully extenuate his criminal attempts that from their descriptions no one can distinguish the tyrant who so much disgraced human nature  the miseries of the people during any fatal reign they generally attribute not to the follies or outrages of those who command but to the irresistible influence of destiny cest ainsi says the author of labrege chronol de lhist despagne on account of the oppressive administration of olivares which obliged the portuguese to shake off the spanish yoke que le maitre des empires prive de leurs lumieres et de leur sagesse ces ministres profonds ces genies percants quand il veut briser ou donner des septres     they never give to things the real names they term the art of governing that of spreading every where terror and desolation they call magnificence pageantry and odious prodigality they cover usurpations under the fair names of extension of power addition of privileges and new prerogatives acquired by the crown extortions rapacity robberies under that of conquest craft duplicity treachery perfidiousness treason under that of the art of negociating and outrages murders poisoning under that of acts of great policy thus they succeed in destroying that impression of horror which the bare sight of those actions ever excites in the spectator  but as if the false pictures offered in history were not sufficient there is every where a multitude of writers who actuated by their base passions are ever ready to vindicate tyranny authors in their dedications poets in their verses orators in their speeches every one with emulation basely offers his incense they give princes the most flattering appellations they call them fathers of the people benefactors of mankind the glory of the age and we are so silly as to credit them  it is not my design here to unveil the gross impostures of those writers it is sufficiently obvious to readers not prepossessed but i shall offer a few words on their ignorance or insincerity in those very encomiums which even men of sense have credited  popular government is represented by pensioned sophists as ever stormy and unsettled a people is restless and seditious only when leading an idle life as the greeks and romans did because for want of private affairs men are then always prompted to meddle with matters of state but men wholly engaged in private employments are unfortunately already but too much unconcerned about the affairs of administration  however let this false assertion pass undoubtedly there are now and then some disturbances in a democratical government but is there none in aristocratical and monarchical ones  besides these disturbances arise less from a popular constitution than from its corruption for if the people are generally inconsiderate if they oftentimes engage themselves in false steps and sometimes eagerly pursue their misery they are likewise when not bribed always ready to yield to men whose virtue and judgment they respect it is the fault of the constitution if such men are not constantly set at the helm if subjects are deprived of the means of being acquainted with their true interests and if any individual is permitted to be powerful enough to bribe a multitude  we are told of the frequent factions seditions and rebellions in popular governments but has a people ever took arms but to secure their liberty to oppose the pernicious designs of ambitious men and to free themselves from oppression  we are terrified at public dissensions from the fires of discord however all those laws which were made formerly at rome in favor of liberty took their origin and from the fires of discord liberty has arisen among us  men are too easily imposed upon by the noise of civil discords during the long disturbances which agitated rome from the tarquins to the gracchi there were but few banishments but few imprisonments and almost no blood shed but from those tranquil reigns which are so much boasted of let as long a period less fertile in tragic scenes be pointed out how many were incomparably more so what mischiefs were ever caused at rome by the dissensions of the forum to be compared with the horrors of the calm reigns of tiberius nero caligula what evils were ever suffered by any people under popular government to be compared with those we suffered under henry vii mary charles i and james ii and that so much extolled calm of monarchical states what is it but the sad silence of an unfortunate people who dare not vent their griefs  thus the praises bestowed on governments where the prince is too powerful are so many traits which point out their deformity  conquests are ever represented as the most happy events in a reign but not to speak of those acts of violence and injustice which are inseparable therefrom what generally are conquests but the ruin of nations even of conquerors themselves how dear the conquest of a new province to the ancient ones if the pride of a monarch is sometimes indulged by the glory of being accounted a conqueror how much is the wellbeing of the subjects lessened thereby let the benefits that a state receives from that vain glory be put in comparison with the evils it is productive of  what did the ambition of a charles v avail but to desolate europe to ruin his subjects to see the conquered provinces wrested from his hands and to force him at last to bury in a monastery his grief and shame  what the ambition of a philip ii but to kindle war every where to shed torrents of the blood of his subjects to cause the ocean to swallow up his numerous fleets to allow no rest to his people to squander the immense treasures of spain and india to ruin his extensive dominions and to bury with himself the eclat of his crown  what the ambition of a charles xii but to carry terror over europe to enlarge his empire to lose in a few hours the fruits of nine years victories and to abandon his own dominions to the sword of the enemy  such are almost constantly the fruits of the ambition of princes  a plague the most fatal with which heaven punishes those nations that dare not free themselves therefrom  writers emphatically praise the magnificence and liberalities of monarchs why not rather censure those odious prodigalities which in order that pageantry be displayed and that a few individuals may abound in riches oblige the greatest part of the nation to live sparingly or linger in misery but even were the people the constant objects of royal munificence how is it possible to give them much without taking much more from them  writers exhaust themselves in praising the generosity of princes but can princes even possess that virtue what are gifts which cost nothing but the trouble of a command  that which is gained with difficulty and labor or deducted from convenience and necessity when given with discernment that alone i say is to be accounted a valuable gift but let princes be ever so much lavish of their favors are they the less at ease for it do they repose the less on the pillows of luxury are they the less clad with purple is their table the less delicate are their palaces the less magnificent their groves the less voluptuous  when an hungry scribbler gets a pension all is well but the oppressed multitude groan in silence and whilst the sighs of the unhappy sufferers remain enclosed within the walls of their wretched habitations the praises given to bad princes by prostituted sycophants fly through every climate on the wings of fame  chap xlii of superstition it is not possible to consider the progress of power to despotism without considering at the same time the force of opinion how great its influence on the human mind  opinion formerly made the intrepid roman shiver at the sight of the sacred chickens refusing to eat  opinion penetrating the pagan with the fear of the gods made him tremble when looking at the idol he had just framed  opinion reflecting the stoic within himself surrounds his heart with ice prevents it from palpitating with joy amidst pleasures from being moved to pity at the hearing of doleful cries from shaking for fear among dangers it concenters all his passions in pride and confirming him in his passive virtue causes him to live without ties and die without weakness  opinion in a word obstructing our sight with the bandage of superstition subjects our necks to the yoke of priests and its power princes make use of in order to enchain us  if we turn our sight upon antiquity we shall every where see the prince laboring to make the subjects look upon himself as upon a favorite of heaven zoroaster published his law under the name of oromasis trismegistes under that of mercury minos made use of the name of jupiter lycurgus that of apollo numa that of egeria etc etc  every polity has some deity at its head and how many times has a ridiculous respect for the gods again plunged the people into slavery religion ought to contribute to render men good patriots when it has such a tendency it is one of the greatest pillars of liberty but when it has a contrary one it is attended with the most humiliating servitude     in order to reenter the citadel of athens whence he had been expelled pisistrates dressed a woman like minerva then mounted on a chariot with that goddess of his own making he traversed the city whilst she holding him by the hand cried aloud to the people here is pisistrates i bring him back to you and i command you to receive him hearing these words the athenians again submitted to the tyrant  at present few princes affect to be inspired but many have recourse to the voice of the ministers of religion to subdue their subjects  ambitious timid or ignorant priests cause princes to be looked upon as the representatives of deity on the earth at whose feet other men ought to prostrate themselves in silence then confounding obedience to the laws with obedience to arbitrary mandates they continually preach in the name of the gods passive submission and servitude  thus to stamp on their authority a sacred character and secure their empire all princes cause heaven to interpose  continuation of the same subject every religion countenances despotism but none so much as the christian  instead of being connected with the political system the christian religion is universal in its principle it has nothing exclusive nothing more peculiar to any country than to another it embraces equally all mankind in its charity takes away the bar which separates nations and unites all christians in a fraternity  such is the true spirit of the gospel  liberty depends on the love of the patria but the reign of christians is not of this world their patria is in heaven and to them earth is a place of pilgrimage only how then can a people longing but for things above be concerned for things below  all human institutions are grounded on human passions and supported by them only the love of liberty is united to that of wellbeing to that of temporal enjoyments but the christian doctrine inspires us with an aversion for those enjoyments and is continually combating our terrestrial inclinations wholly engrossed by another life men are but little concerned about this  to maintain themselves free the people must have an eye ever upon government they must watch all its motions oppose all its illegal attempts and curb its audacity how can men whom religion prohibits being suspicious be thus watchful how can they put a stop to the secret practices of the enemies to liberty how detect them how even suppose that such men exist without suspicion without cunning without wrath without resentment a true christian is at the discretion of the first who forms an attempt upon him  the spirit of the gospel is a spirit of lenity of charity if religion influenced the prince as well as the subjects that spirit of charity which is the great characteristic of a true christian would undoubtedly mitigate the exercise of power but when we consider that the lessons of the gospel cannot take root in a heart given up to pleasure and dissipation when we consider that its precepts cannot resist pernicious maxims constantly repeated bad examples ever under the eye temptations ever new we are made sensible that religion cannot rule those who live at court  some religious princes have however been seen it will be said if by religious princes bigots hypocrites or fanatics are meant i agree and yet these were men whose youth had been spent under the direction of priests men whose passions were not naturally violent men whose hearts worn out by pleasures or brought back by age to the timidity of infancy caused them to be credulous men in a word who separating morality from the tenets of faith like the pharisee admitted that part of religion only which indulged their vicious propensities  but if the precepts of the christian religion have but very little influence on the heart of a prince it is chiefly in catholic countries where the priests grant dispensations to the rich for money furnish them a thousand pretended means of atonement and sometimes incite them to redeem by new crimes a whole life spent in iniquities now when the sinner may hope for paradise without fearing hell religion has no more any empire    of peace its disciples are full of patience and love for their enemies when struck on one cheek they must offer the other when stripped of their gown they must give their cloak besides when forced to march a league they must march two when persecuted they must bless their persecutors they are not allowed even to protect their own lives dragged to the altar of death they have tears only to oppose to their tyrant ever resigned they suffer in silence they melt into compassion for their enemies and pray for their executioner patience tears prayers blessings are their only arms and whatever is attempted against them they never disgrace themselves with revenge they groan and humble themselves under the hand which strikes them how then would they take up arms against the disturbers of public peace how combat the usurpers of their own rights how repel by force the enemies of liberty how spill their blood for the sake of their country to so many dispositions contrary to those of a good patriot add the express command of obeying the supreme powers good or bad as being established by god is it not that fatal doctrine of passive obedience which in the last century prevented our forefathers from shaking off their yoke fortunately for liberty faith is no more our weak side     continuation of the same subject nothing is more necessary to a king than being religious says aristotle in his politics for the subjects approve of every thing as being just which is ordered by a godly prince and the malcontents are not so bold as to attempt upon one whom they believe to be under the protection of the gods accordingly most princes endeavor to be accounted pious  the statue of fortune was ever in the room of the roman emperors in order to persuade the people that the goddess watched for their safety  from a desire of regaining the affection of his people henry ii affected an extreme devotion to the ashes of becket whom he had persecuted and victory crowning soon after his arms against the scots caused this prince to be looked upon as a favorite of heaven and the audacity of opposing him to be considered as a sacrilege hoveden page       chap xliii of the confederacy between princes and priests but as if it did not suffice that the subjects should learn from the gospel to kiss the rod of power with devotion in order to render them more servile from principle there is a confederacy between priests and princes these borrow the tongue of the divine to subject the people to despotism the others borrow the arm of the magistrate to subject them to superstition  under the princes of the house of stuart who mounted the throne of england priests were instructed to teach speculative despotism and graft on religious affections systems of civil tyranny  in      orders were given by james i that no preacher of what title or denomination soever from henceforth should presume in any auditory within this kingdom to declare limit or bound out by way of positive doctrine the power prerogative and jurisdiction of sovereigns or otherwise meddle with matters of state and the differences between princes and the people than as they are instructed by precedents in the homilies of obedience  in order to render his authority absolute in scotland charles i restored episcopacy and by his command priests published several canons containing superstitious and arbitrary matter among which some asserted that the kings power and prerogative were in every thing equal to those of the jewish kings absolute and unlimited that no one should teach schools without a license from the bishop of the diocese and that no person should be admitted into holy orders or perform any ecclesiastical function without first subscribing these canons  a conformity to such doctrines was exacted through the whole kingdom and disobedience was liable to be punished by the high commission court with deprivation fines confiscation imprisonment etc  any word or writing which tended toward schism was punished by the commissioners these inquisitors were not limited to proceed by legal information rumor and suspicions were sufficient grounds to the party cited before them they administered an oath by which they were bound to answer any question that should be proposed to them and a refusal was punished with imprisonment  chap xliv fruitless efforts of the people mean while despotism makes its progress and the chains of slavery become heavier  when despotism establishes itself by slow steps the longer it is established the less it is felt it at last arrives however to such a degree as to force the people to open their eyes whenever the prince audaciously attacks rights sacred to all in a small slate where the manners of the people are not degenerated these violent outrages of princes are ever attended with the ruin of their authority  when tarquin made an attempt upon lucretias chastity as he attacked rights sacred to all the citizens every one was filled with indignation at such an outrage and his power was at an end   mankind whenever he tramples under foot the objects of public veneration or exhibits too frequently scenes of blood the minds of men are affected with indignation sighs are changed into complaints a refractory spirit prevails among persons of all ranks confusion begins to reign and murmurs clamours and seditious speeches are to be heard every where then the authority of government every instant diminishes its orders are disregarded in these moments of confusion no act seems illicit and the prince in appearance retains a vain title only but how many means still remain to support his overgrown power  if the subjects driven to despair at length take a tragic resolution it seldom avails but to expose them whilst the insurgents loudly crave justice the prince in his turn vents his complaints against them sends them deputies magistrates satellites has the most audacious apprehended treats them as disturbers of the public peace and oftentimes the disorder is hereby suppressed  the efforts made by the people for securing their liberty are commonly fruitless in almost every insurrection the populace alone hostilities men of fortune declare for no party at first and are at length only hurried along by the torrent what is to be expected from the attempts of a rabble they have never great interest for taking arms against tyranny they cannot depend one upon another and they want secrecy in their fits of resentment or despair the populace divulge their designs and ever give their enemy time to render them abortive    when the violent symptoms of universal dissatisfaction break out unless the insurgents be headed by some great personage unless the measures of an unruly and fluctuating multitude be planned by wise men and carried into execution by spirited and audacious ones the insurrection instead of being a revolt is but a sedition  ever easily suppressed and ever unsuccessful  but the engaging as a leader of the insurgents is dangerous to head a faction is to draw upon oneself all the storm and the uncertainty of the success or the apprehensions of a miscarriage always restrain the most resolute how easily did those who were masters of the commonwealth render abortive the designs the gracchi had formed of setting the plebeians free from oppression if it proved so easy to ruin these protectors of the people notwithstanding their tribunitial power how much easier is it to ruin a popular leader who having no public character may always be treated as a disturber of the public tranquillity     besides how difficult oftentimes to excite a people to take up arms when manlius endeavored to free the romans from the oppression of the senate full of zeal as long as danger was remote they displayed the greatest audacity but no sooner was manlius apprehended and brought before the dictator but they lost all resolution in vain did this unfortunate leader entreat their assistance neither the sight of those wounds he had received for the sake of their country neither the view of the capitol he had delivered neither reverence for those temples which he had prevented being profaned nor piety for the gods moved them they remained inactive spectators and beheld calmly their chief dragged into a dungeon  if much is ever wanting to excite an insurrection very little is commonly wanted to suppress it  when the sicilians weary of groaning under the oppressive domination of the viceroy los velos had revolted the inhabitants of palermo placed at their head one alexis but terrified by the warlike preparations of spain they basely attempted to purchase their pardon by murdering their captain  on the day of the first barricades as the populace flocked together to surround the hotel of the president mole  a traitor to his country and prepared to break open his doors mole himself immediately had them opened and without emotion appeared before the insurgents amazed at this bold step they retired without noise and suffered themselves to be disarmed hist du cardin mazarin   he must be very little acquainted with history who knows no instance of such want of courage in almost every revolt  when subjects prove so little resolute the prince disregards their clamours or rather silences their complaints by persisting in the same conduct which raised them and their resentment exhales in vain murmurs  but suppose the subjects want not resolution their rising avails little unless it be general when a city takes arms to defend its privileges if its example is not followed by the rest of the nation mercenary troops subdue it the prince treats the inhabitants as rebels and they feel their yoke lay heavier upon them powerful noble and wealthy men new men who owe their fortune to the prince ambitious men who look upon a court as the only source of dignities wretches who seek their fortune amidst public disorders priests academicians pedants and that prostituted herd that subsists by the extravagancies and vices of the great all generally stick to the party of the court whilst men of a middle rank sensible and wise men generous souls who will obey the laws only and elevated minds who scorn servility espouse the cause of liberty     notwithstanding the insurrection be general yet how seldom is there any union between the subjects commonly the people is divided into many parties and this want of union is one of the greatest resources of tyranny the prince then counterballances the respective forces of the different parties by each other he equally avails himself of their weakness and jealousies and crushes them with their own hands  if the people is not divided into factions it is the craft of administration to sow discord among them and foment dissension  when the representatives of the people of venice usurped the supreme authority as the most powerful families were divided between empire and servitude and this usurpation had raised a spirit of universal dissatisfaction to disunite the malcontents the usurpers opened anew the door of the council to several families that had been shut out restrained many others by hope and then audaciously faced the rest  when the castilians took arms to vindicate their rights violated by their deputies in the cortes assembled in gallicia and to obtain satisfaction for the outrages committed by the flemish ministers charles v with a view of dividing the malcontents issued circular letters to all the cities of castile that had revolted exhorting them in most gentle terms to lay down their arms published a general amnesty promised such cities as had continued faithful or should return to obedience not to exact from them the subsidy granted in the late cortes and engaged that no office of government should be conferred for the future upon foreigners on the other hand he wrote to the nobles exciting them to appear with vigor in defense of their own rights against the exorbitant claims of the people and instigating them by a mean jealousy of that spirit of independance which they saw rising among the commons to vindicate the prerogative of the crown sandov hist of civil wars in castile   in the commotions of la fronde mazarine managed for the king by his intrigues with the marshall daumont the party of the great army and engaged them to depute the earl of quince to assure his majesty in the name of all the officers of their devotion to his commands hist du cardin mazarin   in our civil wars of the last century it was the constant artifice of the court to sow dissension among the tories and whigs among papists anglicans and presbyterians  if the intrigues of the cabinet to set the malcontents at variance prove fruitless the measures fixed upon by the malcontents themselves to secure their liberties oftentimes produce the desired effect for although the subjects be all united against tyranny all have not the same views every class among them has peculiar claims the several provinces even the towns of the same province have peculiar interests and all these different pretensions are so many sources of discord see sandov hist of the civil wars in castile p     p mart epist p       subjects though united against tyranny agree very seldom in the choice of a chief but what is more surprising that which ought to render them unanimous serves oftentimes to set them at variance and this want of harmony ever ruins the interests of the people when the commons of castile in order to vindicate their liberties took the field against the king and nobles combined violent disputes arose concerning the command of the army padilla was the only person worthy of this honor but as he was the darling of the people and soldiers many of the most eminent members of the junta jealous of his merit and popularity procured don pedro de giron the office of general who being entirely destitute of abilities equal to such a trust soon gave them a fatal proof of their having ruined their affairs p mart epist p         let us suppose however that the malcontents are unanimous in their choice and that they make a good one how many resources still remain against the people  at first attempts are made to bribe their leaders which are always successful unless they be proof against every temptation  if they prove incorruptible the prince endeavors to have them delivered up to him or labors to seduce their adherents and how many times have insurgents attempted to obtain pardon or regain favor with the head of their chief in their hands  if these measures are fruitless princes are acquainted with others  sword and poison in the commotions of la fronde the court appointed four troopers to assassinate the president charton who excited the people to oppose the tyrannic administration hist du card mazarin  in the revolt of

have the treaty ratified the governor seeing the zeal of the people for their leader bestowed on him many kindnesses confirmed the title of captain general he had received from the public and as if he minded to crown the victim before sacrifice adorned aniellos neck with a golden chain then gave him a venomous drink and had him assassinated giannone hist of nap lussan hist de la revolut de naples memoires du duc de guise  while the dutch labored to shake off the tyrannical yoke of spain as philip ii could not reduce to subjection those brave confederates he had the prince of orange their captain assassinated etc etc etc     not satisfied with exterminating the leaders some princes have involved even the whole party in the same fate  charles ix of france by incessantly persecuting his protestant subjects forced them to revolt as their party increased every day and terrified the tyrant too pusillanimous to encounter the insurgents at the head of his army he took the resolution of exterminating them any way and meditated this horrid project for two years having at last fixed on the measures to carry it into execution he concluded with them a fraudulent peace amused their chiefs by false caresses neglected no pains to lull them into a fatal security and had them with sixty thousand of their adherents murdered on the night of st bartholomew  popular leaders themselves sometimes ruin their own party the great care they take to repress licentiousness and to prevent pillaging ever renders them odious to the rabble who having thus no profit by the revolt are soon weary of bearing arms for the sake of liberty alone this was seen in naples when the duke de guise attempted to crush the spanish yoke memoires du duc de guise     if a popular leader has much to dread from his severity he has no less to dread from his ill success the people who obeyed him with zeal as long as his efforts were successful lose their spirits and desert him as soon as fortune declares against him  but supposing the leaders of the malcontents well manage their party and victory befriends them yet this avails little unless they take advantage of every juncture  delay constantly ruins bold undertakings when once the moment which was to fix fortune is let slip all is lost the enemy has time for recovering from his fears and preparing himself against the intended stroke and even in these critical moments the party of tyranny has great advantage over the party of liberty  although the prince has levied war against his people if he finds himself unable to attack them in order to get time he makes proposals of accommodation and whilst preparing to crush them complains of being compelled to have recourse to violence makes the most solemn protestations of love for the public and displays marks of concern for the national disturbances thus did the deceitful charles i when he levied war against his people parliam hist vol xi    the people still dazzled by some remains of respect for royal majesty or seduced by an appearance of grief almost always feel a return of affection and oftentimes as children who dare not lift up the hand against their parent let their arms fall out of their hands the prince on the contrary has scarcely ever the tender mercy of a father but considering his opposing subjects as revolted slaves as soon as he has the power in his hands he makes them feel the most terrible effects of his vengeance  to avail themselves of favorable junctures is not yet enough unless the insurgents unite their councils and arms  when charles v ascended the spanish throne notwithstanding the spirit of dissatisfaction which universally prevailed as the inhabitants of the different kingdoms in spain still maintained the prejudices of their ancient rivalship and as the remembrance of their long hostilities was still recent their national antipathy prevented their acting in concert each kingdom choosing rather to depend on its own efforts formed a separate plan followed separate measures and each party combated for its own liberties thus for want of harmony all their efforts proved impotent sandoval hist vol i   nay although the patriots all unite in a common plan their party is not always triumphant who would believe had not experience proved it that subjects oftentimes combat with less courage for their patria than mercenary soldiers for a tyrant  if subjects oftentimes combat with less courage for their patria than mercenary soldiers for a tyrant they generally combat with less success of so many people who have risen in arms to shake off the yoke how few have recovered their liberty    for with what disadvantage must undisciplined citizens under chiefs unexperienced in war take the field against regular troops under experienced captains  but was the princes party defeated all resources are not exhausted  subjects seldom animated with a high sense of their rights fight but to free themselves from actual oppression never willing to purchase dearly the inestimable advantages of liberty when charles i attempted to enslave the nation how many times did the zeal of the patriotic party begin to subside and at what infinite pains were many spirited patriots to support it    hence oftentimes after a few efforts they lay down their arms soon tired of their own agitations they long for repose and in the tranquil leisure they are permitted to enjoy they recollect liberty but with the ideas of heavy contributions fatigues and slaughter the prince on the contrary ever animated with a violent desire of securing his power and enlarging his authority combats with steadiness and stands till the last extremity  the efforts made by the people to secure their liberty when fruitless serve only to confirm their servitude after civil wars despotism commonly makes its most rapid progress when the principal leaders have perished the people wearied by their own agitations long for repose and permit the monarch to enlarge the boundaries of prerogative or usurp a boundless authority when henry vii and charles ii came to the throne the nation tired with intestine commotions willingly submitted to every outrage rather than plunge themselves anew into a civil war     notwithstanding his repeated defeats the prince oftentimes loses nothing though vanquished and at the mercy of his subjects he maintains that haughtiness that imperious air that arrogance which he displays in his prosperity he speaks only of his prerogatives he still presumes to give law and generally the people suffer themselves to be deprived of the fruits of their victory how little was wanting to enable charles i to reascend the throne and again give law    but if once vanquished how different the fate of subjects after many vain attempts to shake off their yoke they are treated as subdued enemies the unmerciful prince dictates his orders with a menacing tone and the unfortunate wretches ever patiently suffer themselves to be enslaved they oftentimes present their necks to the yoke and are earnest to regain the favor of their master by ignominious submissions when mazarine triumphantly reassumed the reins of the government those who had inveighed most bitterly against him and most eagerly sought his ruin basely solicited his favor     chap xlv of treachery however if in a critical moment the prince makes any concession to the people it is generally delusive  too jealous of his authority not to reassume with one hand what he grants with the other  amidst the dissensions of the forum the people having obtained that a consul should be elected from among them the patricians prevented any cause being brought before him and thus rendered his magistracy useless  to calm his angry subjects the prince sometimes orders his ministers to retire into some port during the storm or even sacrifices them to public vengeance but when the frondeurs had obliged the regency to dismiss mazarine this favorite yielding to the storm retired safe into the harbor but before he took leave he left secret instructions for the conduct of affairs even from his retreat he continued to plan all the measures of the cabinet and as soon as the revolt was suppressed returned triumphant and was again set at the helm hist du card mazar   the same plan of operations is still laid down in the place of those dismissed or sacrificed ministers others of the same stamp have been substituted and the simple multitude is satisfied  but if subjects obtain any real concession the prince is at the same time considering only how to deprive them of the fruits of it  the plebeians had just obtained the privilege of sharing with the patricians the honor of the fascia when rome being afflicted with a famine coriolanus made a motion in full senate not to assist the people unless they renounced the rights granted them on the sacred mount such was the spirit of the whole body since one of its best members was animated therewith     king john being obliged by his barons to sign magna charta concealed his resentment till he had found a favorable juncture for annulling his concessions the better to deceive the people he publicly declared that his administration was henceforth to run in such a tenor as to give his people no cause of complaint he sent writs to all his sheriffs ordering them to constrain every one to swear obedience to the twentyfive barons appointed to secure the execution of the several articles of the great charter and then retired into the isle of wight to plan the measures of a fatal vengeance from his retreat he secretly sent abroad his emissaries to enlist foreign soldiers and to invite the rapacious brabancons into his service by the prospect of sharing the spoils of england he dispatched a messenger to rome in order to be absolved from all his oaths of maintaining the liberties granted to his subjects when the foreign forces arrived he pulled off the mask repealed all his grants to the subjects marched at the head of ravenous mercenaries laid waste the lands of the nobles pillaged their houses carried every where fire and sword and spread devastation all over the face of the kingdom m paris p           edward i on his return to england from his expedition into france against philip being requested to ratify solemnly the confirmation of the charters to which he had affixed his seal evaded as long as possible at length being obliged again to comply he expressly added a salvo for his royal prerogative  a clause which enervated the force of the whole charter heming vol i p       but after so many solemn engagements contracted whilst he could not give full scope to his ambition and whilst his subjects flattered themselves with having secured their liberties he applied to rome and procured an absolution from all his oaths  charles i having given his assent to the petition of rights repaired in haste to parliament and protested that he had not intended to give away the profit of tonnage and poundage ordered this protest to be entered in the journal of the commons and again proceeded to seize the goods of merchants for denying the arbitrary imposition of tonnage and poundage in the next session he ended his speech by blaming the commons for enquiring into the infraction of the petition of rights and engaged the speaker to interrupt all debates on the subject not satisfied with this and incensed that parliament had circumscribed royal power within so narrow limits he resolved to overthrow them and to accomplish his design employed the meanest artifices accordingly the patriotic party by the intrigues of the court diminished every day as soon as the king had secured a majority in the house of commons and had at his devotion almost the whole house of lords elated at the accounts of his courtiers respecting public affairs he pulled off the mask filled anew the first places of government acherl britan constit p     with his creatures attempted to strike the fatal blow to his halfvanquished enemies and in order to abrogate at once all his concessions to the people charged a member of the upper house and five of the lower house with misdemeanor hightreason and with having extorted by fear all the parl hist vol x p      acts made to secure public liberty which being proved as he pretended rendered them null ipso facto this scheme proving abortive charles spared no pains to incite discord between the english and the scots to accomplish this he at first strove to outvie the parliament in courtesy toward the scots he forwarded every motion which had been made in their favor every thing that they demanded for the security of their civil rights was granted them he afterward endeavored to corrupt their army henderson the popular covenanting preacher was appointed his chaplain the great officers of the army were treated with high marks of favor and the commissaries themselves bribed he then set out for scotland attempted in his journey to engage the army to prove refractory secured a strong party in the scotch parliament by the intrigues of his creatures and labored to induce the irish catholics to rise against england  charles ii under color that there were many conspirators against him and that there were men who under pretense that the parliament was at an end by virtue of some clause in the triennial bill fancied they might assemble themselves to choose new members desired the parliament held in      not to leave an act in being which was such a disgrace to the crown and they basely complied with his request  what a trifling cause sometimes suffices to give those at the helm an opportunity for repealing their concessions and again assuming the power into their hands  whilst m aemilius and q fabius laid waste the enemies lands the tribunes m furius and cn cornelius in order to make the agrarian laws pass refused to levy the tribute and incited the people to rise but although the army busy without was in want of every thing and the senate dreaded a revolt within the people at that juncture in appearance so favorable to their claims obtained only that a consulartribune should be selected from among the plebeians elated with this little success the popular leaders with eagerness urged on the execution of their scheme and succeeded in having at the next comitia chiefly plebeians elected consulartribunes but while the people resigned themselves to joy and boasted of their victory the senate was taking steps to deprive them of the advantage of it after their victory the multitude ever abandon themselves to security whilst they ought to be never more watchful what terrible attacks could be made then upon liberty the situation of a people jealous of their rights is extremely embarrassing since by a fatality attached to their station all is against them disheartened by defeat supine in victory they have no less to fear from good than from bad fortune    at first it engaged some of the most illustrious patricians to set up as candidates expecting that the people would not be so daring as to except against them afterward exerting their utmost efforts to carry on that scheme they vented clamours against the past comitia they said the gods were incensed that the magistracies had been prostituted by rendering them vulgar and alleged in proof the sharpness of winter that had just been felt and the plague which raged over the city and the fields the people dazzled with the eclat of the candidates and terrified at the idea of the wrath of the gods elected consulartribunes patricians only renounced the supreme power and put it trembling into the hands of the senate  soon after the waters of the lake in the forest albana being much increased without any apparent cause this phenomenon engaged the public attention and the oracle at delphos was consulted mean while the senate industriously propagated a rumor that the gods were incensed that the ranks in the commonwealth had been confounded and that the only means of disarming their wrath was the abdication of the military tribunes and an interregnum followed tit live dec i lib     chap xlvi constant pursuit of the same designs in every government a favorable juncture for the recovery of liberty sometimes offers people let it generally slip not perceiving it but the juncture for establishing slavery those at the helm seize very often to avail themselves of the opportunity is their chief care and their first maxim in politics  i and time said charles v defy any two others yo y et tempios para dos ostros hist of the duke dalba book iii c      the people have but momentary leaders and as soon as they are deprived of them their forces are dispersed but the council of princes is lasting always set up against liberty it employs its time in forming projects concerting measures contriving means of execution and this is a peculiar advantage  by watchfulness people succeed sometimes in making the attempts of princes prove abortive but how can they constantly oppose their various attacks the ministry having their eyes ever fixed on the people seize at length a favorable moment and this suffices to accomplish their designs  continuation of the same subject as soon as the cabinet council is permanent there is no truce during the slow war princes carry on against liberty not even in the beginning of their reign  a juncture where the monarch sinking under the load of his grandeur and his heart overflowing with joy entertains only sentiments of benevolence and affection lays aside all designs and gives some respite to his unfortunate subjects not even when they wholly resign to pleasure or idleness since the reins of government they abandon are trusted to ministers who that they might share the authority of their master seek continually to increase his power not even when they have no ambitious projects unless themselves be at the helm  continuation of the same subject when the cabinet is composed of powerful men rivalship jealousy pique and ambition oftentimes incite them to traverse each others projects and make them miscarry when it is composed of many members the various turn of their minds generally sets them at variance respecting designs and the means of execution hence princes impatient to attain absolute power have always composed their cabinet of few men and men of new families such was the craft of ferdinand of arragon of philip ii louis xi henry vii henry viii etc  some princes by a refinement of policy have even laid down a fixed plan of operations  it was the pursuit of the same projects during the reigns of louis xiii and louis xiv that so much increased the power of the crown for mazarine punctually followed the maxims of richelieu and le tellier those of mazarine  it was the pursuit of the same projects that so much enlarged the boundaries of the prerogative of the crown of spain from charles v to this day for a change of ministers causes no change in the spanish cabinet and although the hands that hold the reins of government be changed the mind that directs them is always the same the cabinet of madrid and that of venice are perhaps the only ones in europe where there is a fixed plan to attain despotism     it is on the contrary to a want of harmony in the council that the weakness of government during interreigns and minorities must be attributed  it is likewise to a want of harmony in the council that we owe in part the slow increase of royal power among us and this want of harmony fortunately arises from the constitution itself although the king disposes of all offices as he cannot render himself formidable he is ever obliged to keep fair with his ministers those who are in favor are therefore oftentimes traversed by those who endeavor to supplant them as he cannot satisfy all ambitious men those who are admitted into the cabinet are frequently opposed by those who seek to set themselves in their place as the designs of the king so much the less succeed as his party is the more openly attacked he is oftentimes obliged to trust the conduct of affairs to those who have most offended him and to dismiss those who have served him best in fine as his favor is limited and his hatred impotent new parties ever spring up happy discord which supplies the want of the virtues among us and like them supports liberty  chap xlvii of corrupting the legislature the most fatal blow princes strike at liberty is the subduing their subjects in the name of the law and the expedient they most willingly employ for it is the most analogous to their vile character  bribery  considering the legislature as a formidable censor of his conduct the prince labors to have them his dependents or rather earnest to see the sovereign it is a constant custom to give monarchs the title of sovereigns all even our best authors have fallen into this error the parliament itself  the representative of the real sovereign has blindly followed this practice   made his slave he endeavors to have its representatives at his disposal thus all the arts which influence popular assemblies are employed to win those members who oppose his projects temptations are offered to the vain the ambitious the needy according to their desires all those who choose to espouse the party of the crown may now have their price and the rulers of the empire soon prostitute themselves to power sell the cause of liberty to indulge their base passions betray their country in contempt of their most sacred engagements and the legislature themselves become the contemptible tools of tyranny  as soon as a senator was elected at sparta agesilaus presented him with an ox plutarch in vita agesil   charles v demanding from the cortes of castile a new donative before the time for paying the former was expired was openly refused but availing himself of a mean spirit of jealousy which instigated the nobles against the commons whom they saw endeavoring to secure their independence he employed bribes promises caresses threats and even force in order to gain members thus having secured a majority he engaged them in contempt of the fundamental laws of the constitution to vote the grant of the subsidy for which he had applied p martyr epist     sandoval hist page      how frequently have been and still are such arts employed among us to corrupt parliament in that august assembly wherein none ought to be admitted but the real friends of their country there is no less venality than elsewhere part of the members are pensioners of the court or related to pensioned persons another part are occasionally bribed by what they call douceurs a great number seek to get into office and affect to display their rhetoric against the court only in order to oblige it to stipulate a greater number dependent on the tools of the court are constantly devoted to the minister few are faithful to their constituents and the rest fluctuate alternately according to circumstances between duty and temptation such are the patres patriae the rulers of the empire the guardians of our liberties it is curious to see in whitlocke straffords letters the parliamentary history etc the artifices employed by the court to corrupt the legislative power but how much more so to see the refinements of modern policy in this respect  it will perhaps be deemed imprudent to give things their real name but i leave subterfuge to timid patriots it is the cause of truth of justice of honor that i plead and ever will even at the price of my blood  he deserves not to enjoy liberty who dares not openly espouse its cause     chap xlviii of the want of spirit and steadiness in the representatives to oppose ministerial attempts if the representatives are not all infatuated with a lust of dignities if there be some who cast not longing looks toward office if there be a few who have even such greatness of soul as to disdain a bribe yet their want of spirit and steadiness in opposing the ministerial attempts ever renders their virtue fruitless  whilst the creatures of the prince eagerly pursue some illegal scheme let the current run ever so strongly if the patriotic members were determined to strive against it to the last although they may not be able to stop or turn its course their resistance would at least restrain its fury but instead of defending with indefatigable zeal the cause of liberty the languid patriots give way satisfied with having made a feeble resistance or entered a protest  disgusted at their little influence many of them give not even a constant attendance and let their antagonists obtain the advantage of an undefended cause over a scattered party  thus from a want of spirit and steadiness in the unbribed representatives power advances with rapid steps toward despotism  chap xlix of preventing insurrections the prince when his designs prove abortive loses only his time but when the efforts of the subjects to shake off their yoke prove unsuccessful they generally lose the means of making a new attempt  after princes have plunged their dominions into the calamities of civil war instead of reforming their administration and regaining the affections of their injured people they think only how to suppress their complaints and render their efforts fruitless they cannot renounce that supreme power that boundless authority that absolute empire which has already cost them so many efforts so many crimes  from experience they learn how to prevent insurrections in the beginning of a storm the mischief is not discovered when it blows with fury the remedy is not perceived thus they have their eyes ever open on the slightest commotions careful to appease them as soon as raised  not satisfied with this they oftentimes are intent to extirpate the seeds of them under color of securing public tranquillity they forbid all routs conventicles clandestine meetings and tumultuous assemblies some even by a more refined craft will not allow any persons to crowd about popular men and are so wary as to make away with those who are the darlings

disgust they make them feel the weight of authority and artfully provoke them to furnish reasons for being dismissed or to resign a place they can hold no longer but great care is taken to leave these places vacant or to grant them as commissions under pleasure only there are at present in france no offices of any authority but in the hands of the kings commissioners the office of farmer general of

orders to the commanding officers to expose them in dangerous stations or has them dispatched in the dark  attentive to what passes out of the state the people perceive not what passes within and the prince continues to enlarge the boundaries of prerogative or rather to usurp power  to carry on the war new subsidies are demanded a part of which are carefully laid by  the war being at an end the people elated with their victories or depressed by their calamities resign themselves to joy or labor to retrieve their losses and whilst they wholly engaged by private affairs lose sight of public ones the prince eagerly pursues his ambitious projects  during the course of a long government liberty is destroyed by gradual alterations and is ever recovered by violent efforts only but the prince takes such cautious measures that once subdued the subjects may never be enabled to break their yoke again under pretense of securing the safety of the realm he undertakes to become absolute master of it accordingly he begins by having the old fortresses repaired then proceeds to have new ones constructed philip ii of spain to render himself absolute ordered a great number of fortresses to be constructed in his dominions and a citadel in every large town desormeaux abreg chronol de lhist despag  the duke dalba governor of the netherlands intending to lay a grievous tax nominated alcavala ordered a citadel to be built in almost every town idem  in france every province is thick set with strong places and there is no considerable town without a citadel almost all other countries in europe exhibit the same scene fortanately we are an exception and how carefully is this advantage to be preserved as long as administration shall consine their projects to have strong places constructed on the seacoasts let them carry them into execution undisturbed but from the instant they shall attempt under any pretense whatsoever to have any fortress or citadel built in the interior part of the kingdom we are undone unless a national opposition ensues    at first on the borders afterward in the interior part of the country in fine he orders citadels to be built in every important town increases the garrisons and renders the military establishment numerous and formidable thus under the fair name of public good the prince seizes by degrees every post which leaves a communication between the inhabitants of the several parts of the state and cuts off every means of ever uniting princes dread nothing so much as the union of their subjects when charles i under color of securing the safety of the realm exacted a loan to the full value of the subsidies voted in the parliament hold in      the following instruction among others was given to the commissioners appointed to levy the loan that they treat apart with every one of those who were to lend money and not in the presence or hearing of any other unless they see cause macaul hist england  the french administration were at infinite pains during the minority of louis xiv to prevent the conferences of the chambers of the parliament of paris on account of an edict relative to the tarif et droit annuel as in these sort of conferences said the minister the freedom of speech is not any way curbed they ought not to be held without the express permission of the king the regency added he is ready to hear the remonstrances and demands of all the chambers but of every one apart hist du card mazarine   their forces again or appearing in detached parties without being cut in pieces by mercenary troops gli huomini says machiavel in his prince si vindicano delle legiere offese delle gravi non possono si che loffesa che si fa all huomo deve effer in modo che non si tema la vendetta princes strictly follow this odious lesson and far from leaving any means to their subjects of defending their liberty they even deprive them of every mean of attempting it    when once the people can no longer appear in a body the sovereign is considered as being annihilated  chap lii of accustoming the people to military expeditions having incapacitated the inhabitants of the several provinces from ever uniting their efforts for their common defense and those of the towns from making any attempt for their own safety princes accustom the people to military expeditions and under color of securing public peace soldiery are by degrees substituted for civil officers  soldiers are appointed to arrest offenders soldiers are appointed to wait on malefactors going to execution soldiers are appointed to clear highways in places of public diversion in auction rooms in places of public exhibition sentinels are placed at the doors in all places where the people meet soldiers watch over them and for fear of any nocturnal attempt soldiers even then serve as guard i am sensible that many things in this work have no relation to our own actual situation and in this we are to be accounted happy how much more so should we be had we not so great a concern in the rest     chap liii of securing the fidelity of the army in order that those men who are placed at the head of the troops might support the overgrown power of the crown and not control it princes are not satisfied with having suppressed every military office of too great influence but divide the army into many small bodies among which they incite jealousy by means of peculiar distinctions the command of these small bodies they confer on devoted men alone and the better to secure their fidelity they establish in every body several degrees of command which officers are promoted to slowly by rotation and rapidly by preferment hence every subaltern officer not only considers him who fills the next superior degree to his own as an obstacle to advancement and looks upon him with a jealous eye but the most ambitious among them seek to rise by fawning adulations vile services and assiduity in courting the prince whilst those who are raised labor to secure favor by a blind devotion to his commands  in regard to the high military offices great care is taken not to confer them on any darling of the people and never to join them to any civil office distrust is sometimes carried so far as to place at the head of the army soldiers of fortune only to change frequently the general officers to incite between them competition to set inspectors over them and never to allow the troops to be long stationed in the same place such is the craft of the venetians   when the prince dispenses with commanding the army in person in order to trust the command without danger into other hands he gives it to several who have never a full power granted them to act as they should think fit their operations being always inspected by a council of war if not directed by the cabinet itself having modelled the army at will he caresses the military ties them to his interest by largesses and renders them the sole objects of his favor  thus princes form to themselves a devoted party ever on foot against the people and impatiently look for an opportunity of making use of it  chap live to secure the military from civil power the soldier being in a free country ever subject to the laws and restrained by the magistrates acknowledges his duty and preserves in his new station some notions of justice he is taught to respect the citizens and is prevented from being made conscious of his influence the supreme power is possessed in every society by those who have arms in their hands    hence the prince in order to teach the military to depend on in almost every state in europe the military take the following oath of fidelity the soldiers that they shall obey no other command but that of their officers and the officers that they shall defend the throne and never attack it   him only and render them the devoted instruments of his will secures them in this country the prince indeed takes no such steps but he frequently renders null the sentence passed on military malefactors and in favor of notorious villains makes use of a prerogative conferred on the crown to save unfortunate not wilful offenders   from civil power they are made accountable to him alone and if they either plot mutiny pillage commit rapes or murders always a martial court is appointed to judge the delinquents  chap lv to inspire the military with contempt for the citizens as the military are the instruments destined to enlarge the princes authority in order to prepare them to act against the people in a favorable juncture they are separated from them i am not ignorant of what has been alleged against the quartering of soldiers upon free subjects but however grievous a burden it may be to have such vicious guests i am far from assenting to the common opinion the nuisance complained of may be removed by enacting severe laws against the encroachments and violences of soldiers by not authorizing them to demand for their groat a day more than is in the power of the landlord to afford by commissioning civil officers alone to billot them and by enforcing them to do it in an impartial manner on the contrary to lodge the military in barracks is at once to divest them of that little humanity which they pick up by conversing with the honest part of the world to corrupt them the more by their abandoned intercourse and to qualify them for a military government in the first case the evil is accidental but is unavoidable in the last and since from the criminal ambition of princes we are to undergo one or the other under pretense of common safety let us submit to the least of them  when in the reign of william iii administration induced the commons to enact a law for quartering of soldiers either in public or private houses they knew not how favorable it would prove to their projects to crowd soldiers together in barracks but this they have since learned from other powers an attempt is now making to separate the soldiery from the people already troopers under pretense of keeping them near their riding houses are quartered in a sort of obscure barracks till they may be quartered in proper ones the progress is slow but god forbid we should behold such establishments with indifference    quartered in barracks and afterward inspired with contempt for every profession except their own but to render them conscious of their preeminence many marks of distinction are conferred on them in russia every body is obliged to yield the precedence to military men at berlin the same regard is paid to a detachment of soldiers passing in the streets as in catholic countries to the viaticum  in france the soldier looks upon the burgesses with contempt and believes himself privileged to insult them the officer disdains merchants men of letters and magistrates the nobility de lepee as they are called despise the nobility de la robe so likewise in spain portugal russia denmark sweden etc and in all these countries every sentinel has a scandalous prerogative to wash away the least affront with the blood of subjects    used to despise the citizens they soon become desirous to oppress them and ever ready to fall upon that part of the realm which should attempt to make an insurrection this is to be seen in turkey china indostan france spain russia etc   chap lvi of usury exactions and extortions it is a favorite maxim with the cabinet that if the people are too rich or even too much at ease it will prove impossible to keep them submissive whilst men rendered dependent by their wants destitute of the means of opposing resistance and ashamed of their poverty are conscious of their subjection and much more disposed to obey see the political testament of the cardinal of richelieu  hence far from releasing the people princes ever charge them with heavy taxes but as if this did not suffice among the various means they have recourse to in order to impoverish their subjects usury exactions and extortions are oftentimes made use of  the roman senate not satisfied with levying the taxes disposing of the public money and appropriating to themselves the lands of the vanquished enemies used to prey on the plebeians by usury  such was the craft of the ancients that of the moderns is much more refined they borrow at large interest the money of the public and these depositums of the fortunes of the subjects like chains tie the people two ways on one side they are a badge of subjection the subjects being ever afraid to furnish a pretense for forfeiture from attempting to revolt on the other side they are arms in the hands of the prince which enable him to crush those who have trusted him therewith  besides when a favorable juncture offers the prince either by retaining the interest for a long time repaying the capital when the value of money is below par or even by retaining the capital itself reduces by a single stroke his subjects to that point of misery which they could not have been reduced to but gradually by pursuing the former plan  in these points of view public funds trusted to government in france spain the kingdom of naples etc are to be considered  a truth which those people have but too often sadly experienced  in england such steps have never been taken and perhaps never will yet public loans bind us not the less strongly for by their means the government has intertwined itself with the property of the people in such a manner that it is impossible to lay the ax to the root of the former without destroying the latter  as soon as the government becomes debtor those who are creditors made sensible that the sums entrusted are lost if government securities fail are ever ready to subscribe fresh ones in order to furnish it with means for defending them and this newly raised money may be employed for a different purpose  if to secure a fund for the payment of interest any regulation destructive of liberty should be thought absolutely necessary the party concerned that is that part of the nation which is the most regarded would consent to it rather than run the risk of being ruined by a state bankruptcy if any one should treat this as a chimerical supposition let them remember the excise laws moreover as by the negotiation of loans and the creation or management of funds the interest of moneyed men is intimately connected with that of the court not only the factors for administration and those dealers in the funds who for the sake of a lucrative share in some contract are under ministerial influence turn courtiers and cringe at levees procure themselves seats in parliament and assist the prince to enslave their country but the locust tribe of subscribers brokers ticketmongers and all those who act or seek to act that dirty part on all occasions appear the avowed advocates of every corrupt minister induce the timid the weak the fickle the sordid and the indolent to follow their example furnish their patron with a pretense to urge in excuse of his misconduct raises their clamours against the complaints of true patriots smother the voice of the nation and become a dangerous faction in support of tyranny  nor are even these the worst measures that are planned by some princes to ruin the people  sometimes in order to impoverish their subjects and enrich themselves they debase the coin that is reduce its intrinsic value without altering its current one  at other times they prey upon the subjects by the most flagrant extortions they even commit them to prison in order to oblige them to recover their liberty by paying heavy ransoms  thus having induced their subjects to contract many wants by encouraging luxury it is the craft of princes to deprive them afterward of the means of indulging them or rather to drive them from dependence to servitude  chap lvii to undermine the supreme authority the prince having secured the army now labors to secure the legislature or to render its power vain when on the point of making any bold attempt if he can do without the concurrence of the representatives of the sovereign he carefully abstains from calling them together if their concurrence is absolutely necessary they are not suffered to proceed to any other transaction but that for which they have been assembled  charles v having summoned the cortes of castile to meet at compostella engaged them to grant him a subsidy with this grant the cortes laid before the king a representation of those grievances whereof his people craved redress but he having obtained from them all that he could expect paid no attention to their petition sandoval      such was the practice of charles i when he was in want of money he assembled parliament and hurried the bill for subsidies then to prevent them from taking cognizance of the public grievances he lulled them into security by fair promises assured them that he would be ever careful to preserve the liberties of his people engaged the speaker to interrupt every debate foreign to the bill for subsidy expelled out of the house the warmest patriots by incapacitating them from serving as representatives or prorogued if not dissolved the parliament  to accomplish their designs princes sometimes again put in practice their former arts they corrupt the legislature and make it speak as they please  at other times they terrify the party in opposition by threats or they have the register of the votes altered  it was by terror that henry viii kept the parliament submissive to his will the members free only in the senate were as soon as the sessions was prorogued left defenseless to the mercy of this tyrant  charles i intending to have an act passed in the parliament of scotland for the resumption of those church lands and titles which had been alienated in the minority of the former reign was careful to be present at the debate but meeting with a great opposition he pulled out of his pocket a list of all the members that composed the house adding gentlemen i have all your names on this paper and i will know who will do me service and who will not this day notwithstanding the kings threatenings the bill was rejected by the majority but the clerk of the register who gathered the votes removed this difficulty by declaring that it was carried in the affirmative burnet vol i p      princes in order to influence at will the legislative body oftentimes endeavor to procure a choice of representatives favorable to their designs thus henry viii and mary when they desired to carry any important point used to write circular letters to the lord lieutenants in the counties directing a proper choice of members mem of cramm p       actuated by the same views james ii artfully resumed the charters of all corporations in the kingdom and granted them new ones drawn up in such a form that it was in a manner left to the king to nominate the representatives  if this suffices not princes have sometimes recourse to another method they suffer none to fit in the senate but those who are known to have no virtue after having excluded all others who are suspected to have any  in the exigencies of affairs in      a parliament was summoned but cromwell finding that the majority of the members returned would be unfavourable to his interests placed guards at the doors of the house and under pretense of excluding men of corrupted principles permitted none to enter but such as produced a warrant from his council  some princes in order that the legislature should be entirely at their disposal have even by violence altered the constitution  in      charles v demanded extraordinary subsidies from the cortes of castile but having vainly employed entreaties promises and threats in order to obtain his demand he dismissed the assembly with indignation and excluded out of these assemblies the nobles and prelates under pretense that such as pay no part of the public taxes had no vote to claim in laying them on hence none were admitted to the cortes but the deputies of the towns who being in too small a number and too feeble to oppose the king were all at his devotion sandoval hist vol ii p       other princes have divided the legislative body and made the prostituted part pass for the whole  during our civil war of      charles i in order to abate the veneration paid to the patriotic representatives and avail himself of the name of the legislature with a view of levying the sums which were necessary to carry on the war summoned the parliament at oxford and having collected there all the members of either house who adhered to his interests he endeavored to insinuate that the two houses sitting at westminster were not a legal convention attempted to prevail with the earl of essex general of the parliament to treat with those proscripts and engaged that prostituted assembly to pass several acts to grant him subsidies and to declare the faithful members guilty of high treason husbands collections   the prince by engaging the legislature to yield constantly to his will and having hereby abased them has no more recourse to craft he assumes the style of a master and if he still continues to assemble them it is only to give law  chap lviii to usurp supreme power arrived to this point princes eagerly consummate their iniquitous designs earnest to see the people their slaves to reduce them to servitude they oftentimes turn against them the constitution itself  in a government wherein the activity of the legislative power depends on the will of the executive one the legislature never can appear but when the prince gives his orders and never answer but when he interrogates them in order therefore to annihilate their power they are no longer called together when once the legislature are sunk into oblivion the prince imperceptibly usurps their functions he ventures to issue by his own authority some ordinances at first on trifling objects afterward on objects more important he then by degrees repeats this practice accustoms the people to that usurpation of authority and at length finds himself invested with the power of enacting laws  thus the kings of france have usurped sovereignty at the origin of that monarchy royal prerogative was limited to the executive power the supreme power resided in the general assemblies these assemblies were denominated champs de mars or de may see pasquier mezeray le pere daniel etc of the nation which met annually at stated seasons and in which every freeman had a right the ancient annals of the francs describe the persons who were present at the assembly held a d     in these words in placito ingelheimensi convenient pontifices majores minores sacerdotes reguli duces comites prefecti cives oppidani etc sorberus art  0    to assist their authority was extended to every department of government such as electing kings granting subsidies enacting laws redressing national grievances passing judgment in the last resort with respect to every cause the capitularia that is the laws enacted in those assemblies were relating the one to political the other to oeconomical many to ecclesiastical and some to civil government see the capitular collected by baluze  in the capitulare a d     the oath louis the stammerer took at his coronation begins thus louis par la misericorde de dieu et lelection du peuple je promets etc    in a word whatever related to the general welfare of the nation was submitted to their deliberation and determined by their suffrages amoinus de gestis francor lib iv bouquet recueil iii     etc  the king having only a right to give his assent to the public resolutions and none to refuse it see capitular of charles the bald a d     and      such was the french government under the monarchs of the first race  notwithstanding the power and splendour which charlemagne added to the crown by his conquests the general assemblies of the nation continued to possess extensive authority under the kings of the second race they determined which of the royal family should be placed on the throne the prince elected consulted them regularly with respect to every affair of importance to the state and without their consent no law was passed and no new tax levied  under the degenerate posterity of charlemagne royal authority was reduced almost to nothing every baron had formed his lands into a small state almost independent of the king the kingdom being thus broken into so many small districts every one of which acknowledged a distinct lord was governed by local customs and pursued separate interests hardly any common principle of union remained hence the general assemblies scarcely considering the nation as forming one body could no longer enact common laws and thus part of the legislative power was left inactive  under the descendants of hugh capet the jurisdiction of these assemblies extended no further than to the imposition of new taxes the determination of the successor to the crown and the settling the regency when the preceding monarch had not fixed it by his will  it was left to the king to summon the national assemblies but as the ordinary charges of government were supported by the crown demesns he called them together but seldom and only when he was compelled by his wants or his fears to have recourse to their aid thus the obligation of summoning them regularly forming no essential point of the constitution in order to render their power null the prince artfully avoided assembling them  when the functions of this power had been a long while suspended the kings assumed them but ventured at first on acts of legislation with great reserve and took every precaution that could prevent the people from being alarmed at the exercise of a new power concealing their authority as much as they could they began to issue their ordinances not in a tone of command but of request they appeared to treat with their subjects they pointed out what was best and allured them to comply with it  as the power of the crown extended this humble style gave place to an imperious tone and in the beginning of the fifteenth century the king openly assumed the style of a lawgiver  the last of the capitularia collected by baluze was issued in the year     under charles the simple in the middle of the eleventh century were published some royal ordinances contained in the collection of lauriere but the first ordinance extending to the whole kingdom and being properly speaking an act of legislation is that of philip augustus issued in the year    0 the establishments of st louis were not published as general laws to the whole kingdom but as a code of laws to be of authority within the crown domains only the veneration of the people for this prince procured this code a favorable reception throughout the whole kingdom and contributed not a little to reconcile the nation to the usurpation of the legislative authority the people accustomed to see their monarch by his private authority issue ordinances in points of the greatest importance were not surprised when they saw him issue them for levying subsidies for the support of the government when charles vii and louis xi first ventured to exercise this new power the minds of the people were so well prepared by the gradual encroachments of the crown that it scarce gave rise to any murmur  in proportion as kings continued to exercise acts of legislation their subjects ceased to be surprised they forgot at last that the crown had usurped the legislative authority and at present the idea of this authority having been vested in the crown during every period of the monarchy is so universal in france that any assertion to the contrary would be deemed absurd  continuation of the same subject when the prince cannot cause the legislature to sink into oblivion he attempts to seize upon its authority by every mean whatever  justice goodness honor virtue are to be relinquished to private men alone say the abetters of tyranny those at the helm must act from other principles all is permitted to the man who attempts to ascend a throne when seated thereon all must be sacrificed to enlarge the boundaries of his prerogative on the least ground suspected persons ought to be made away with no word no engagement no oath ever so solemn ought to be regarded no blood to be spared when an obstacle to his obtaining absolute empire these horrid lessons are erected into maxims of policy and these fatal maxims have been a copious source of odious crimes covered with the specious denomination of acts of great policy people ought to be governed by wise and virtuous men alone but to their misfortune and to their shame they are almost ever ruled by fools or knaves     how many of these acts of great policy are swallowed up by time and buried in the night of oblivion yet how many are still recorded in history  in order to seize the supreme authority at syracuse agathocles summoned the senate and the people ordered all the senators and the most conspicuous citizens to be put to death by his guards and placed himself on the throne  alfonso son of ferdinand i with a view to crush at once the power of the neapolitan nobles and render himself absolute cut off the barons of the greatest reputation and influence among them giannone hist di nap lib xxviii cap     caesar borgia that he might entirely reduce the romagna to subjection deputed renaro dorca thereto with full power but fearing the shocking cruelties committed against the insurgents had rendered his authority too odious and desiring to appease the minds of the people he joined perfidy to barbarity disowned the conduct of his minister and ordered him to be quartered in the public place august niphus de regnand perit lib iii cap     the venetians weary of the long and tyrannic domination of their prince reassumed in      the reins of government they continued indeed to elect a doge but fixed such boundaries to his power that scarce any thing was left him but a title the supreme authority resided in the people at large however as the concurrence of every one to every thing was impossible they transferred the sovereignty to a council composed of   0 citizens nominated by    electors but that every one might have his turn there was to be yearly a new election on st michaels day the authority of this council was unbounded and by leaving it so the people were soon reduced to subjection by their representatives when the sovereign acts by deputies unless their power be limited by the fundamental laws of the state a single attempt is oftentimes sufficient to ruin liberty in this respect the english constitution is extremely defective our representatives are the guardians of our rights they must always defend never attack them but no boundaries have been fixed to their authority in order to secure the constitution against their attempts they enter into no engagements with their constituents after they are elected they take their place in the senate and instead of considering themselves only as the defenders of the constitution they believe themselves to be the arbiters of it they have even altered it many times  it was a fundamental law of the kingdom that parliament should be held once every year or more frequently if necessary during the reign of edward i this law was confirmed but afterward altered under henry viii the parliament passed an act for prolonging its duration to seven years this act was made triennial under charles i under charles ii it was changed to an act for the assembling and holding a parliament once in three years at least and again rendered septennial in      in every one of these acts of legislation the parliament has overpassed the boundaries of its power the right of determining the frequency of elections and sessions unquestionably belongs to the people at large and to the people at large alone for if the representatives have a right to fix the duration of their commission to three or seven years why not to extend it to fifteen twenty thirty or rather to render it perpetual that is to say a right to render themselves independent to overturn the constitution to oppress their constituents and reduce the nation to slavery  one might imagine that the fatal consequences of this abuse have escaped and still escape our notice when among our most spirited patriots many inconsiderate men are at infinite pains by their frequent motions for a triennial bill to induce the people to acknowledge as lawful the authority of the parliament on that point  what i say on the frequency of elections i say likewise on that of sessions and generally with respect to whatever belongs to the fundamental laws of the state with an unbounded power to redress public grievances the representatives of the people ought to have none to alter the constitution not even to render it perfect without previously taking the advice of the nation notwithstanding the parliament have for a long time arrogated to themselves the right of extending their authority in every point this right must be claimed by the people and the utmost influence ought to be exerted in order to put themselves in possession of it according as this point is gained or lost we are free or slaves as long as the power of our representatives is not confined within proper limits liberty may be enjoyed but is not firmly established we have no other laws but the decrees of our deputies thus absolute masters of our birthrights they may subject us to the yoke tyrannize over us and forbid us even to complain  i do not say that the legislature intends to make so iniquitous an use of their power but they can when they please as long as their power is not reduced within proper bounds but how is their power to be reduced the union of the people not the step which ought to be taken is the chief point to be attended to however our measures be planned they will always prove successful when we pursue them in concert and we may do it as soon as willing  when under henry viii the parliament passed the septennial act under charles i the triennial act and under charles ii the act for assembling and holding of parliament once in three years at least the electors might be excused for not having disavowed their deputies in those times of discord and confusion to rescue the state from the brink of destruction was the only object in view but at present that superstition no more enflames and divides the minds of the people if parliament should be ever so inconsiderate as to prolong its duration and refuse at the request of the nation to recall the act however hard be the necessity of vindicating liberty by force the nation ought not to defer a moment to take up arms this is the case of a just revolt    on pretense of reforming abuses the doge pietro gradenigo overturned the form of government he had an act passed by the criminal quarantia declaring that all those who actually composed the council or had composed it the four preceding years should they or their descendants for the future continue to compose it that act of policy the venetians have denominated il serrar del consiglio  thus investing the representatives of the people with the whole administration of affairs he wrested all authority out of the hands of the sovereign contarini hist venet lib viii   cromwell returning victorious from his expedition into scotland was honored with a deputation from parliament and other marks of distinction he then entered the capital in triumph and as every one earnestly sought his favor this crafty dissembler only thought how to reconcile to himself all parties at first he made use of his credit to obtain for the royalists better terms he captivated the affections of the presbyterians by an affected austerity of manners seduced the bigots by exclaiming against the looseness of the ministers of religion flattered the army by causing them to entertain suspicions about the parliament and gained the affections of the whole nation by earnestly soliciting a new election of representatives he afterward filled with his creatures all military places and the first civil offices incited the malcontents to rise repaired to parliament followed by a band of devoted satellites charged the patriotic members with ambitious designs and expelled them the house no sooner did cromwell become sole master of the government by this act of violence but he formed a cabinet council of the chief officers of the army who were the most in his interests placed himself at the helm and had a new parliament elected but not finding them enough submissive he engaged the prostituted members to rise and to resign into his hands their authority in fine he expelled the patriotic party and usurped the supreme power under the specious denomination of protector  whilst the senators were assembled christian iii of sweden complained to his guards of the little regard these magistrates paid him aided by them he then secured their persons obliged them to resign their places which he conferred on his creatures rewarded his adherents assembled his troops bestowed gratifications on the officers exhorted his subjects to be submissive and remained in peaceable possession of the sovereignty  chap lix of violent measures when the people incensed at such outrageous attempts make an insurrection the prince orders troops to march against them and if his own forces be not sufficient he has recourse to his neighbors there is a tacit covenant between princes they reciprocally offer their arms to each other and reciprocally unite their forces in order to crush the people who rise against oppression when our forefathers had sentenced charles i to death all the princes in europe proposed to make a league in order to vindicate their authority which as they pretended had fallen into contempt by the punishment of that bad monarch    he then exhorts his subjects to return to obedience threatens to employ force in case they should oppose and gives them to understand that they must submit without terms  thus princes begin by craft to reduce their subjects to subjection and afterward enslave them by violence  chap lx inconsideration and folly of the people not only the ambitious projects of princes their dark dealings their villainous attempts establish slavery but the inconsideration and folly of the people also prepare the way to tyranny  in a free government when care is not taken from time to time to bring back the constitution to its first principles in proportion as the epoch of its origin becomes remote the people lose sight of their rights they soon forget them in part and afterward retain no notion of them the people by long losing sight of their rights by ever seeing the prince at the helm and by ever obeying his commands at length consider themselves as mere ciphers and the prince as sole master  the only just aim of a political association is the happiness of the people and whatever be the pretensions of princes all other considerations ought to yield to public welfare but the people are inclined to look upon the princes authority alone as being sacred they never believe themselves authorized to oppose by force his arbitrary mandates to prevail with him they believe no means lawful but supplications bonos imperatores voto expetere qualescunque tolerare says tacitus himself the zealous friend of liberty    and are ever ready to submit to the most grievous oppression rather than punish the lords anointed  when subjects groan under the yoke of a cruel prince hardly any person finds fault but when a whole nation passes sentence upon a tyrant every one expresses his disapprobation it is strange to hear foreigners speak of the punishment of charles i the english they say committed an horrid crime in violating the sacred majesty of kings and how many among us think in the same way     as soon as the prince can secure malefactors from punishment duty is disregarded and protection sought after  men when protected become proud of the disgraceful yoke of a despot and are ashamed of the honorable restraint of laws the rich citizens at athens were ashamed to be looked upon as subject to magistrates     kings magistrates commanders of armies and all those who adorned with marks of power hold the reins of the empire or direct public affairs are objects of public admiration  like ancient idols stupidly admired and adored  besides pageantry the people respect in princes the advantage of birth men despise those they have once seen their equals among the invectives that the castellani and nicoloti at venice bestow on each other the former upbraided the latter with having had for their doge an artizan of the ward of st nicholas  the ancient germans themselves a people the most independent were ever determined by nobility in their choice of a prince tacit de mor germ    a fine as pepin was a short sized man the nobles of his court had not always for him the becoming regard but the majestic air of francis i and louis xiv kept those who approached them in awe and commanded their respect  the beauty of philip iv of spain rendered him the idol of the castilians desormeaux abreg chron de lhist despag  the ethiopians used to select for their king the most beautiful man among them herod thalia   stature beauty and these frivolous endowments serve not less to increase their empire than they do that of love  the good successes of princes supply their want of merit with the people for although events be ever so much accidental they always consider brilliant successes as the effects of ability in those who command and this much contributes to increase the veneration the people show to them after the duke pepin and charles martel had made the austrasia triumph twice over neustria and borgogne the francs entertained such high opinion of the vanquishers that their admiration was boundless the national enthusiasm for the family of pepin was carried so far as to elect one of his grand children although a child maire du palais and appoint him to superintend king dagobert le commentateur anonime de fregedaire sur lan     chapter iv  our forefathers so much exulted in richard the firsts heroic actions in palestine and were so elated with the glory which those military exploits reflected on their name into the farthest indies that they permitted him to reassume all those grants which he had ratified before his departure for the holy land and continued to adore him although he had reduced them to subjection hoveden page      the high reputation which edward iii acquired by the victory of cressy much contributed to render him absolute in his dominions     continuation of the same subject but nothing contributes to it so much as the stupid admiration of the people for certain striking characters  let a prince be diligent resolute valiant enterprising and magnificent no more is wanting if disgraced by a thousand vices those few good qualities are thought to be a sufficient endowment  we do not pass the same judgment upon princes as upon private persons we only consider their actions as being bold great extraordinary instead of considering them as being just good or virtuous we overlook their disregard of their word their want of honor their treachery perjury treason unmercifulness cruelty we admire their magnificent follies instead of looking upon them with indignation we praise their iniquitous undertakings instead of branding them with infamy and oftentimes are so inconsiderate as to reward with a crown crimes which merited capital punishment  let us overlook the encomiums bestowed on alexander caesar henry viii charles v and from the many instances recorded in history select that of louis xiv whom courtiers poets academicians and historians have so greatly cried up whom inconsiderate men have so stupidly admired but whose memory good men ought to detest  a good prince ought to have constantly in view the welfare of his people but if the conduct of this monarch be attentively enquired into it will appear that during the whole course of his long reign he only sought after what could be undertaken to his own glory all his desires all his discourses all his actions ever aimed at fame and to this deplorable folly he continually sacrificed the happiness of his subjects  instead of applying the public money to promote the true interests of the nation he distributed it to his creatures squandered it in feasts balls tournaments in making cascades and waterworks amidst arid plains and in forcing nature  instead of permitting his subjects to enjoy the fruits of industry and honest diligence amidst the blessings of peace he sacrificed to the ambition of being distinguished as a conqueror their tranquillity their wellbeing their blood and whilst disputing the laurels with the enemy let them starve in the career of his victories in      there was an universal famine all over the kingdom   to indulge his caprice his pride his wants ever new not content with exhausting the produce of past years he destroyed the promises of years to come deeply involved the public in debt the debts he left at his death amounted to  00000000 pounds he spent during his whole reign     00000 pounds which make near        0 yearly whilst the public revenue under colbert amounted to  0 00   pounds only the deficiency was made up by retaining the interest of public funds by circulating paper security without value by selling offices and dignities and by playing a thousand other sharping tricks    and brought the greatest calamities upon his dominions  infatuated with a lust of power he attempted to make all bow under him crushed all those who opposed his will and in order to show how unbounded was his authority exerted his tyrannic empire over even the minds of his people and armed a ferocious soldiery the dragonade against those subjects who refused to betray their consciences  he erected indeed for the public some monuments of ostentation hitherto so much celebrated but had he remitted to his people the immense sums they cost that money would have incomparably more contributed to the good of the public instead of a few infirm soldiers maintained in the invalides a multitude of husbandmen would have been preserved from beggary with those sums he exacted from them they had cultivated their fields improved their small patrimonies secured their subsistence and their unhappy issue would not now linger in misery  for a few idle persons to pass away their time in those spacious gardens which surround his palaces what a multitude of useful laborers were reduced to wretched habitations what a great number of them buried in the mud near sixty thousand laborers perished in draining the marshes of marly     he indeed promoted commerce arts and sciences but what are these advantages to the miseries he brought upon his dominions what are they to the torrents of blood shed by his boundless ambition to the indigence in which his overbearing pride plunged his people to the sufferings of the multitudes he reduced to beggary what are they to the calamities inseparable from that folly of ever keeping on foot a numerous army of idle satellites  a folly of which he first gave the example and which becoming epidemical has seized princes and almost ruined europe  monarchs are so accustomed to take advice in all public undertakings from their own passions only and this abuse is the source of so many miseries that the means of indulging such a fatal presumption cannot be too soon wrested out of their hands  the true glory of princes is the enforcing obedience to the laws preserving the blessings of peace and promoting the public welfare but for our misfortune and from our folly it is not after this glory those at the helm aspire  how inconsiderate is mankind are not the vices of princes more than enough to effect our misery without inciting them by a stupid admiration of their follies to aggravate our deplorable condition  continuation of the same subject not only an extreme propensity in the people to be dazzled by the false luster of pageantry the ensigns or pomp of power great undertakings and brilliant success but their prejudices oftentimes contribute to confer new prerogatives on princes  the vulgar proportionate their respect to the majesty of the roman senate was no longer reverenced when its authority became divided  the czar rules his dominions with a tyrannic sway supreme arbiter of life and death his commands are irresistible this boundless authority far from being odious to his subjects seems much to their liking the more powerful their prince is the more like a god he appears to them when a russian is asked a question he cannot answer god and the czar alone know it says he instantly  is not the limited power of our kings a matter of raillery to the french   power not merit they disregard monarchs who are not absolute and reverence despots obedience on the throne is according to them equally ridiculous and contemptible sovereign without power crowned slave these are the titles they give the prince who is not powerful enought to crush them but they admire him when he can silence the laws  men far from opposing the attempts of the crown to usurp absolute authority even dispute sometimes with each other who has the sad prerogative of being subject to the most powerful prince  the designs of administration must be private they cannot be made public without divulging the secrets of government and rendering its undertakings abortive hence it is inferred that the subjects glory consists in a passive obedience to the arbitrary commands of princes  the king having a right to appoint ministers the people have no right to oppose them the tory maxim   certain people entertain the dangerous opinion that the glorious authority of a prince consists in the servility the french are so much affected by royal majesty as to consider in public undertakings only the interests of their kings la gloire du roy as they express it   of his subjects others pretend to the false glory of a loyalty proof against every consideration the castilians boast of their inviolable loyalty for their princes when the emperor joseph attempted to dethrone philip v and had the archduke proclaimed in madrid king of spain no citizen joined the acclamations of the soldiery the peasants and burgesses in the night murdered all the soldiers they met with the surgeons poisoned all the enemies they had under their hands and the courtezans were purposely lavish of their virulency the curates and parishioners inlisted themselves and fled to the assistance of philip the bishops marched at the head of monks all even women fought for their king desormeaux abreg chron de lhist despag  it was a saying of charles v that all other nations wanted to be cajoled the spanish alone to be commanded    and it is the folly of all nations to exult in the pretended wisdom of their own laws  what people did ever deserve this last reproach more than ourselves we never cease boasting of the excellencies of our constitution and by continually extolling it we are not sensible of its defects and neglect to reform them  the constitution of england is no doubt a monument of political wisdom if compared to others yet it is not so perfect as we are pleased to affirm nor can it be so considering its origin and its revolutions if traced to its first principle it will be found to be very simple and such as suited uncivilized men good enough for a people who subsisted by pillaging but containing a thousand sources of anarchy  as soon as these concealed causes unfolded themselves the kingdom was tore by domestic factions remained exposed to foreign invasion became the prey of an usurper and was reduced to the most deplorable subjection by its rulers under our kings of the houses of plantagenet tudor and stuart despotism was attached to the monarchy the dispensing power the power of rendering arbitrary judgments of imprisoning of exacting forced loans and benevolences of pressing and quartering soldiers of erecting monopolies were all exercised in their turn  weary of groaning under oppression we have sometimes attempted to shake off our yoke but all our measures to recover liberty far from being free national transactions were mere acts of violence of the strongest party  during our civil dissentions every party as it prevailed has almost always been busy in crushing the others and amidst the insolence of victory erected themselves as the masters of the nation  yet if ever the triumphing party stipulated for common liberty unable in the tumult of arms and the public agitation of mind to establish it on a firm basis in order to form a regular administration of justice they have applied only a palliative remedy to the most urgent evils and brought back the constitution to its first principles or nearer its primitive institution  the only favorable juncture for securing public liberty was at the accession of the house of brunswick as the triumphant part then formed a great majority in the nation and the prince in      george i proposed to establish the freedom of the constitution by securing that part which is the most liable to abuses  the limiting the prerogative of creating peers and that prerogative so destructive to liberty and which the king was very willing to divest himself was against his will preserved to the crown   was without ambitious designs but this favorable juncture we let slip  but i leave the consideration of defects which might have been reformed for the examination of defects which still remain  in a well constituted government the people at large is the real sovereign to them belongs supreme power but among us the prince has circumscribed the boundaries of national see the tenor of all the charters upon which our birthrights are founded liberties whilst the nation ought to have circumscribed those of royal prerogative this defect in the constitution is capital several of our kings have availed themselves of it to tyrannize over the subjects it proved the cause of all the differences between parliament and james i charles i and charles ii it was likewise in virtue of it that james ii reassumed the charters of the city of london nay those of all the corporations in the kingdom  yet let a veil be drawn over this humiliating origin of our birthrights thus emancipated had we at least recovered sovereignty but we are still no more than an emancipated people in no national transactions does the parliament appear conscious of their preeminence in all their addresses to the throne respecting affairs of public concern they ever mention the kings person and prerogative in the first place the religion the laws and liberty of the kingdom ever in the last  the representatives of the people are admitted into the great council of the nation as trustees for the people as well as counselors for the king but in the oath of fidelity they take at their admission they consider themselves as the kings servants only i do promise and swear to be faithful and to bear a true allegiance to his majesty  so help me god such is the oath of fidelity of the members of the house of commons     to the people at large only the legislative power ought to belong this power they exercise either by themselves or by representatives but among us one particular class of subjects share that power independently of any constitutive authority by birth they are the kings hereditary counselors they make one of the three estates in conjunction with the lords spiritual and with them are supreme judges in the realm nay the arbiters of it they dispose of the crown when the throne becomes vacant and pronounce in last resort upon all causes that have been decided in any of the courts of justice  to such extensive power are annexed high dignity and many prerogatives equally oppressive and insulting let it not be said that these prerogatives are no more than paying them a mock reverence and sounding in their ears an empty title the laws being made to restrain them as well as others but allowing the laws to be impartial are they not eluded by men of title except a single case  murder in all others the dignity which inspires them with presumption to oppress the defenseless is joined to an estate which affords them means to support their outrages men of no large fortunes or easy circumstances are therefore not safe from their insolence and caprice   to other subjects it is for their sublime virtues and exalted merit that they are honored with a coronet no the fatal privileges which they claim and arrogate to themselves are but the inheritance of the plunders usurpations and violences of their ancestors  when the people at large cannot act by themselves to them belongs the right of nominating their representatives but among us this right is peculiar to a small part of the nation in the reign of henry iv laws were enacted limiting the electors to such as possessed forty shillings a sum equivalent to twenty pounds of our present money a year in land free from all burden within the county although the letter of this law has not been maintained we may learn from the following preamble of the statute that this defect of constitution i object to proceeds from the licentious spirit and iniquitous pretensions of the nobility  whereas the elections of knights have of late in many counties of england been made outrageous by an excessive number of people many of them of small substance and value yet pretending to a right equal to the best knights and esquires whereby manslaughters riots batteries and divisions among the gentlemen and other people of the same counties shall very likely rise and be unless due remedy be provided in this behalf and statutes at large   henry iv cap      to the prejudice of the rest nay of this part of the nation few individuals have as great influence as the most numerous corporations many small boroughs having a right to send representatives in parliament let us overlook the monstrous abuse that four or five thatched houses should be upon a level in the great council of the nation with the largest cities of the kingdom but these insignificant boroughts have been privileged by the crown for the purpose of corruption and dependency for by the influence of the court their members are always chosen  in a moment of patriotic in      fermentation a law indeed was enacted for voiding all elections of parliament men where the elected members had been at any expense in meat drink or money to procure votes but was any provision made by that law for discovering and persecuting secret offenders and do our elections the less exhibit scenes of scandalous transactions instead of seeing electors zealous to declare themselves for merit only and candidates waiting for their lot with a becoming dignity a cringing band of suitors are seen bestowing without shame flatteries and bribes on men they look upon with contempt the instant they have extorted their votes and a prostituted herd of voters glutting themselves without remorse at lawless banquetings  the peoples representatives are the defenders not the arbiters of the constitution guardians of the national rights they ought always to defend and never attack them hence although they may be entrusted with a boundless authority to redress public grievances they ought to have only a limited one to enact statutes a free legislature says a celebrated historian of ours cannot do any thing illegal according to this maxim which is true only when a people at large exercise the legislative power a whole nation is at the mercy of its representatives having not even the right of complaining when tyrannized over by them    but where are the boundaries fixed to the power of our deputies in order to secure from their attempts the sanctuary of the laws  when the representatives are entrusted with an unlimited power the people ought at least to have a constitutional authority to restrain or disown them as soon as they abuse their trust by what obligations are our deputies restrained to the observance of the duties of their office we have a right indeed to watch over their conduct but when they make iniquitous laws how are we to disown them when they attack our liberties how repress them by petitioning the prince what a fine contrivance to have recourse for redress of our grievances to the chief author of them has he not many times rendered illusive the right of remonstrating by disregarding our petitions how then are we to obviate this denial of justice we have no other law therefore than the arbitrary commands of our representatives who may at will neglect our interests attack our liberties and sell our birthrights without being called to any account or incurring any other damage than not being chosen another time even this trifling restraint is wanting in our constitution have not our commissioners taken upon themselves to determine the duration of their commission if they are authorized to extend it to seven years why not to twenty forty sixty why not to render themselves independent of their constituents thus we are reduced to the deplorable situation of seeing our liberties invaded without being able to oppose more than vain murmurs or reduced to the situation still more deplorable of vindicating our rights with arms in our hands how many times have they made it unlawful to resist their authority in any case   the representatives of the people being entrusted with the interests of the public ought to enter into an engagement with their constituents our deputies when at first admitted into the senate take indeed an oath of fidelity but in that oath there is not a single word mentioned about the nation see the form of their oath of fidelity in a preceding note   the representatives of the people ought ever to act according to the instructions of their constituents but our deputies exercise their delegated power without ever consulting us when once elected they take not any more notice of us we have therefore no hand in the laws enacted by them and how many times have the resolves of the house been directly opposite to the sentiments of the people they represent what are then our representatives but our masters  the laws enacted in the great council of the nation ought to promote public welfare but among us what a neglect of national interest how seldom does any bill but of a private nature pass even to make a motion for these bills friends in the house are always necessary and frequently such friends are bought has it not been notorious in many instances that parliament men have been induced for lucres sake to prostitute their abilities and sacrifice their country in the furtherance of any job how dirty and iniquitious soever open the journal of the british senate and there you will find many proofs of this sad truth among the many instances i confine myself to the affairs of the india company in        the representatives of the people ought to attend with diligence the duty of their office but our deputies either sit or absent themselves just as they please except in some extraordinary juncture and by their negligence ever make it the more easy for the minister to carry his point neglect of duty is even at present an artifice several of them make use of to make their best advantage of that power they are trusted with nay the most infignificant among them by thus absenting themselves have found out a method to oblige the minister to stipulate for in the great council of the nation matters are carried by the number of votes not by the weight of arguments  as the people alone have a right to select their representatives they alone have a right to declare their choice and to maintain it but our deputies have arrogated to themselves the essential privilege of judging of returns nay of excluding such members as they object to in spite of their constituents  talents and virtue ought to be the only qualifications required in representatives of the people and the man whom they grace whatever be his rank or circumstances ought to be preferred to that honorable office but our deputies constrain their constituents to select them from among a particular class of subjects which is not by virtue of an act of parliament all its members must be men of a landed interest all those who possess not three hundred a year in land free from all burden are incapacitated from representing a city or borough and all those who possess not six hundred from being knights of a shire   the least ignorant nor the least corrupted part of the nation  every englishman of an unspotted character a good understanding and an independent though small fortune might have formerly offered himself as candidate but now neither virtue patriotic zeal nor services are regarded money without merit opens the door of the senate by which fools and knaves enter commonly in such droves as leave very little room for the admission of worthy men in order to secure its freedom parliament it is said has thus lodged more or less power in the several degrees of subjects as they have greater or less interest in the common stock i confess that those ought to have the care of public affairs who ceteris paribus have the largest stake in public weal because the public have then in the property of wealthy men a security for their good conduct which is wanting in men without fortune but wealthy men are not always those who have the greatest concern for public safety and fortune alone is a very bad guarantee i appeal to precedents all those members who gave up to henry vii henry viii and mary the birthrights of the subjects all those who prostituted themselves to the will of james i charles ii and james ii all those who had by their violent proceedings relating to foreign affairs so much disgusted the whole nation and given cause to the kentish petition pr h c iii   0  were they not men of property all those likewise who have lately devoted themselves to the court are they not men of property if ever virtue has shone in parliament it was only when the iniquitous practices of the court and the very brink of destruction and when the care of public safety obliged the electors to be determined in their choice of representatives only by probity abilities and patriotic zeal  the allurements tendered to virtue are not of so palpable and striking a kind as the baits of corruption and none but the wise and virtuous are greedy of them men whose whole merit consists in their fortune covet only to enlarge their estate at the expense of their honor and the interest of their country ever ready to join those at the helm in measures ruinous to the people as long as they find in it their own interest  to select our representatives from among wealthy men is prudent if they are not destitute of merit but when luxury extravagance ignorance debauchery and venality are their only characteristics why not turn our choice upon the virtuous and wise who grace the other classes of society  besides from such an inconsiderate choice ever results a partiality in the laws when deputies exercise acts of legislation they seldom make any law which restrains themselves and often make such as they may turn to their own advantage we have no need to look for the proofs of this truth in foreign annals it is unfortunately but too obvious in those of our own country  to complain that the inferior classes of the people receive no advantage from the laws relating to property since being without fortune they have no share in lucrative establishments and nothing to lose would perhaps be deemed too great a presumption by those opulent sybarites who from their elevation look down with contempt upon the poor whom they believe not made to share their pleasures  let us then overlook the advantages of society and confine ourselves to the prospect of its disadvantages i shall not mention here the hearthmoney the gamelaws and the heavy taxes laid on the necessaries of life so oppressive to the poor they are rendered still more so to them by their incapability of buying any thing wholesale  there are more important instances of oppression  the act for raising the recruits passed in   0   empowers the justices of peace to take up such idle persons as have no calling nor means of subsistence and to deliver them to the officers of the army  in a society originally formed among men much in the same circumstances and wherein poverty should be constantly the consequence of bad conduct such an act might have the sacred character of justice but in a government established among men where the strongest and most artful have invaded almost every thing in a government where poverty is often the consequence of misfortunes nay of the injustice of knaves where the industry and diligence of parents cannot always afford their giving any education to their family or preserving their morals unspotted where without a proper capital it is almost impossible to carry on any lucrative business or even to get an honest livelihood and where poverty becomes the everlasting lot of the poor what law could be more unjust  reduced to linger in misery are the indigents besides to be forced to protect at the expense of their blood the inheritance or secure the peace of the posterity of their usurpers and at the risk of their lives to defend the power of their tyrants hear however their insolent oppressors giving without the least remorse their advice thereon wars sweep away four or five times in a century vagrants beggars and such like dregs of mankind  there are foundations for poor among us it will be said but what pen eloquent enough could describe with propriety the shocking scene of a workhouse or what man ever so savage could take a view of it without shaking with horror dismal places wherein the needy is kept alive by unwholesome food lays in nastiness breathes an infected air and groans under the severe hand of a warden wretched habitations wherein abuses diseases and hunger reign constantly of those who are confined there how many fall victims to their hard fate and how few rather than reenter therein unless compelled by intolerable necessity prefer not starving at the door of the rich  the poor almost entirely destitute of assistance against hunger find as little against disease who does not know that letters of recommendation are necessary among us to be admitted into hospitals thus whilst the door of them is ever open to the servants of our gentry and nobility it is almost constantly shut against the needy the unsupported the friendless wretch  among the many dismal and horrid scenes of oppression which in our so much exalted government are but too often disclosed respecting the poor let one more suffice  the injured member of society whom the jury acquit or whom the villain by whose machination he was confined dares not appear to prosecute is dragged back to his dungeon where he is again confined without mercy by the tyrant of the gaol till he has paid what he demands of him under the specious denomination of fees thus unjustly condemned to suffer punishments which ought to be inflicted on profligate malefactors alone and reduced in the horrors of his mind incessantly to curse the day of his birth  a few a very few benevolent members after having received intimation of these cruelties have indeed sometimes made a motion to enquire into the state of the gaols but to no effect the legislators remote as they are from such a wretched condition behold without concern those abominable abuses and never think them worth being reformed who are the friends to the poor in a senate composed of rich men only who are the members acquainted with the sufferings of the needy the misery wherein he lingers and the injuries he undergoes or if they are acquainted with them who are the members eager to rescue and relieve him but they do not thus forget their own interests and whilst leaving without pity a vast number of their fellow creatures to groan under the weight of the most cruel oppression they without shame make alter and amend acts for securing the property of their dogs  be it again said as long as the members that compose the legislature are selected from among one particular class of people it must never be expected to see them applying themselves to promote common welfare and like the parliament under mary   and   philip and mary c    having secured their own possessions they will be unconcerned for all the rest  but let us draw with indignation a veil over these mysteries of iniquity to continue our examination  although at the mercy of our representatives yet we have much more to dread from our prince  our forefathers indeed have taken much care to circumscribe the prerogative of the crown but not enought to curb its power  the king ought to be only the prime magistrate of the people but he is the arbiter of the nation  sole master of calling and dissolving parliament if he but refuses to assemble them legislature is annihilated in such case what constitutional authority has a right to interpose the law has provided for it it is said as it obliges the king by his own wants to call a parliament but should a crafty prince lay by during many years the fruit of his economy as well as the produce of selling the forest woods creating dignities what a large sum did james i raise by selling the dignities of baronet knight of nova scotia baron viscount earl etc winwood vol iii p      granting letters patents for monopoly and grants of concealments or have recourse to the expedient of levying loans and shutting the exchequer who can answer that a mean could not be thus contrived for doing without the legislature  did not charles i govern for twelve years together without a parliament yes but he got money by levying arbitrary taxes and forcing loans did not charles ii become absolute master of his kingdom without army without money without foreign assistance and govern us with tyrannic sway how little was then wanting to reduce us to perpetual servitude was it the wisdom of our constitution or even our virtue that rescued the state from the brink of destruction  but let us suppose that what has once happened never will happen again  the session of parliament holds as long as the king pleases and we are too well acquainted with the use our princes of the stuart line made of this prerogative not to dread the consequences of it  the king has no legislative power but can procure a legislature at his devotion by his great influence in the election of representatives when a new parliament is called besides the votes procured by the money which is privately distributed for that purpose the minister disposes of all the votes of the tradesmen who serve his majesty in the several towns and of all those that placemen and other creatures of the court command in the several boroughs the lord lieutenants and other persons in authority in the counties and towns exert moreover all their interests and address to get such members chosen as are favorable to the designs of the crown  not satisfied with secret practices the administration even employs violence in order to fill the great council of the nation with court dependants it is illegal to bring troops into the neighborhood of an election but the minister byasses the electors by hiring a band of determinate villains to frighten them into a choice of a ministerial candidate and of what crime soever such villains may be guilty the prince is not ashamed to screen them from punishment  as the placebill does not regard the upper house by creating peers of the realm such commoners as have greatest influence in elections and securing these new peers it is in the power of the court ever to command a majority in the lower house  if the king neglects to influence a choice of representatives when they are chosen he may influence their resolutions at his will  the king has no demesnes within the kingdom but he is the fountain of all honors and disposes of all places ecclesiastical civil and military hence a great number of hirelings in parliament this number he can ever increase it being in his power to multiply places and offices nay by only augmenting the number of the officers of his household he may dispose at his will of the whole senate  the placebill it is said prevents in that respect the influence of the king and is the great bulwark of parliamentary independence a gross error this  does a commission in the army the navy or the militia vacate a seat in parliament does even the place of attorney or solicitor general lord lieutenant of the counties receiver of the kings customs keeper of his majestys gates roads and bridges director and clerk of the royal hospitals lord of the board of trade and plantations lord of the admiralty member of the court of exchequer and board of green cloth commissioner of the treasury groom of their majesties bedchambers and any other office of the household nay does a place of privy councellor or of secretary of state incapacitate from being a representative suppose however that the placebill incapacitates persons who have an office or place of profit under the king or receive a pension from the crown to serve as a member of the house of commons does it incapacitate those who receive marks of dignity or titles of honor does it incapacitate those whose relations and friends have places of profit under the court those who receive secret douceurs those who are dependant on placemen and creatures of the court does it regard the house of peers although it be well known that the lords dispose of a third part of the house of commons in fine that great bulwark of parliamentary independence was no sooner erected than subverted by private contracts no provision having been made by that law for discovering secret offenders  besides the places and dignities of which the king disposes the exorbitant sums assigned for the maintenance of his household the pensions he grants the douceurs his ministers manage for his tools in negotiating public loans public lotteries  a measure which the distresses of government alone ought to force are commonly undertook in england for the noble purpose not only of keeping up the spirit of gaming among the people but to secure members of the lower house by negotiating the loans in a way beneficial to the subscribers and thus to buy friends to the ministry with the nations money    the promises with which they feed the hopes of those hungry harpies who seek to feast on the vitals of their country the tricks of craft the clearsighted have too much sense to trust to bare promises or accept of tenures unstable and resting upon uncertainties with them the minister deals ready money but how many are so silly as to accept of any terms having supported by their dead vote the interests of the court they afterward see themselves at the discretion of its the minister using them as dogs as they deserve gives them but a bare bone to pick their twelve or six hundred a year dwindle to three or two without their daring to complain for fear of proving their prostitution those who are skilled in the tricks of policy know that there are few places of one thousand pounds a year but have two or three pensioners quartered upon them   with which they deceive the simple the smiles of the court which lull the vain into obsequiousness the interested but warm rhetoric of his creatures which draws into his party all those who have not an understanding clear enough to secure their virtue these means i say enable him to have at his disposal the greatest number of votes in the great council of the nation to corrupt the members of the legislature gradually make them speak as he pleases and convert tyranny into law  the commons nominate their speaker but their choice is void unless approved by the king and the influence of a speaker on the proceedings and resolves of the whole house is too well known to consider this prerogative as of no consequence  even the polity of the legislature is favorable to the views of the crown in parliament every member gives his vote openly this method of voting is excellent it itself but as the ministers are admitted into the senate it serves but to force the corrupted members to become traitors to their country  although the king cannot call to an account the members for freedom of speech in parliament yet if any of them in giving full scope to his patriotic zeal drops a few inconsiderate expressions the creatures of the prince exclaim against this want of consideration for royal majesty and cry out the tower the tower on the contrary if the hirelings retained by the court display in their fawning speeches the most odious flatteries they have nothing to fear but the bitter smiles of the friends of liberty  when the commons have disregarded their duty was there ever found any virtue among the lords but we know too much of their proceedings to turn on that side our fond hopes even in the most critical junctures and when the commons were struggling against the encroachments of the crown under the stuarts the lords remained idle and seemed to show little concern at the fears and jealousies expressed by the people besides there is in their house a sacred tribe ever blindly devoted from principle to the court  however supposing there were in the upper house many virtuous members as the placebill does not regard it by making new peers the court may always secure a majority as has been oftentimes the case  the legislature is indeed a check upon the crown yet only when it is entirely independent for as soon as selfish interested views prevail among its members the parliament  the strength and glory of britain turns a profligate faction who partaking of the princes bounty and hoping to share with him the spoils of their country join those at the helm in their criminal designs and support their destructive measures  a band of disguised traitors who under the name of guardians traffic away the national interest and the rights of a freeborn people  a king of england will ever endeavor to make his progress to absolute empire by a pensionary parliament i have shown what considence the people may place in the great council of the nation as long as our so much exalted constitution shall remain as it is under charles ii the parliament was filled with a band of abject pensioners and the nation wept at the sight of their senators clothed with the badges of slavery what once was seen may be seen again alas is it not in some sort already the case peruse the list of the house of commons and you will find it chiefly composed of men who have offices or places of profit under the king nor is even this the worst of the dismal prospect which lies before us  the king has no right to lay any tax but the crown has the prerogative of disposing of the public money when deposited in an aggregated fund in the treasury to prevent the misapplication of public revenue it has been resolved to allow out of it separate incomes for the support of the government and the maintenance of the crown dignity the rest is under the command of the parliament and the commons examine the current service of each year but as the sum allotted for secret services has not been limited by law a pretense of squandering the nations money is left to the ministry if not a safe and easy mean of filling up the kings coffers and enriching themselves  a warrant for paying money out of the treasury must indeed go through the hands of proper officers but the king nominates these officers and removes them at pleasure  to prevent abuses the commons have the right of inquiring into the disposal of public money but this prerogative of the crown is liable to the control of the house only when parliament is assembled  the house has a right to call the great officers of the crown to an account but with money which has been embezzled the minister can engage them not to take cognizance of his misdemeanor and plundering an enormous defect in our constitution this of which we had lately the sad experience  royal prerogative is not circumscribed here the king alone has a right to make war peace and treaties even without consulting the nation independently of that monstrous abuse of intrusting a sole individual with a power to sacrifice to his caprices the blood of a multitude of diverting the public attention in a critical juncture evading the redress of national grievances and making away with many troublesome patriots by nominating them to perilous employments how many other inconveniences  the kings designs when they have received the sanction of both houses are ever carried into execution at the nations expense the sum they require may be employed against its destination how many instances of this under charles ii  no war is made but a treaty follows and few treaties are concluded without money thus when the prince sells to the enemy the fruits of national victories or to any power the weight of his influence on the affairs of europe the sums remitted remain in his hands but the charges of ill success are always placed to the account of the public did not james i receive     000 florins for the ransom of the towns that the dutch had pawned to elizabeth for  000000 of florins borrowed of the nation  did not charles ii sell dunkirk to louis xiv for  000000 of livres and did not the louis dors of the french monarch engage charles to sacrifice the interests of his allies and the freedom of europe     the king is the generalissimo that these powers must be lodged somewhere is an objection which naturally offers itself i agree they must but the fault is that they are united in the same hand a due balance of independency in the several parts of a constitution is absolutely necessary for its stability but in the constitution of england the royal prerogative so much overbalances the rest that when a subtle audacious enterprizing prince shall ascend the throne the government will be subverted   of the army and though the parliament grants him subsidies for a year only yet during that interval what could not be done by an audacious monarch who having secured for a long time the affections both of soldiers and officers should on a sudden pull off the mask  the soldiers are patriots it is objected the officers are men of honor and those at the head of the army men of great property what an objection this the soldiers are patriots but they are raised out of the most necessitous the most ignorant the most vicious part of the nation what trust can be placed in such an abandoned race whom idleness debauchery or crimes have driven to enlist for bread is it to be supposed that mercenaries who sell themselves for sixpence a day would not be ready to obey any command of a prince who should flatter them with the hope of rendering their condition comfortable with the spoils of the citizens  the officers are men of honor such among them who should prove incorruptible might be removed yet how few would refuse to purchase the smiles of a court at the expense of public liberty and prefer duty to favor riches and dignities besides when once the soldiers are secured what is more easy than making officers  those at the head of the army are men of great property well were they not men of property who at the head of armies have joined with princes to reduce the people to subjection  were they not men of property who at the head of the army of charles i attempted to enslave the nation  are they not men of property who at the head of the army keep their fellow subjects in foreign countries submissive to the government  if the prince should begin by bestowing on officers dazzling tokens of favor is it to be imagined that they would refuse present profit from a fear of future disadvantage  if the power of the crown be formidable to the people at large it is much more so to individuals  a minister can when he pleases have persons arbitrarily seized together with their papers and books or oppress them other ways but when a plaintiff brings an action against a minister how difficult for him to obtain justice although we boast of having the best digested and most excellent body of laws which any nation on the face of the globe could ever possess yet our laws are so prodigiously multiplied and many of them so inaccurate so obscure that the subtle politics of a jesuistical ministry may very often evade the letter of them whenever the crown has incroached upon the subjects in how many important points has the matter entirely rested upon the opinion of the judges but how clear and indisputable soever the claim of the plaintiff may be besides the secret dealings of the government to support their arbitrary proceedings how many means are employed to avoid trying the legality of their proceedings casting essoigns pleading privilege standing out in contempt of the court evading the judgment by bills of exception special verdicts motions for a new trial writs of error etc are all made use of in their turn thus they prevent the cause being finally decided by delaying until the poor prosecutor be overborn in the long run by dint of expense or until an accidental event if not some dark expedient deprive him of any further need of a court of justice however supposing it to be as easy as it is difficult to obtain redress the arbitrary proceedings of the government although condemned are but little if the least restrained let the encroachments of a minister be ever so outrageous instead of meeting with a just retaliation or having a severe censure passed on him the punishment he suffers is but apparent for the only satisfaction that the injured party can pretend to is damages which are ever defrayed at the public expense thus administration having trampled under foot the rights of the subjects mocks the sword of justice  these are enormous defects in our constitution and more than sufficient to ruin liberty yet how many more remain add to the foregoing that the prince actually on the throne is of himself powerful and keeps on foot in his electorate a large body of troops which without obstacle might be embarked for these his dominions   we have laws it is perpetually objected but of what use are laws the execution of which we have no power to secure  did they prevent edward ii from tyrannically exerting the pretended prerogative of the crown such as the dispensing power the extension of the forests the erecting monopolies the exacting of loans the stopping of justice by particular warrants the renewal of the commission of the trailbaton the extending the authority of the privy council and star chamber to the decision of private causes see cottons abridg  etc  did the great charter so many times solemnly ratified prevent the kings from violating it so frequently and so flagrantly  did the petition of rights restrain charles i from levying ship money exacting of loans and governing his people with a tyrannical sway  did all our laws prevent charles ii from enslaving the nation and whilst we were groaning under the oppressive hand of james ii was it not accidentally that liberty sprung up from its ruins if the audacity alone of some of our princes proved sufficient to subject us to servitude how much more so when aided by refined artifice times have changed i allow but the constitution is much the same  be it said therefore notwithstanding all those encomiums bestowed on our constitution liberty is precarious among us it depends on the want of genius and audacity of our princes and chiefly on that spirit of independency which prevails in these times all over the nation  as long as this spirit shall prevail liberty may be enjoyed we are undone as soon as it becomes extinct  chap lxi inconsiderate vanity of the people the inconsiderate vanity of the subjects likewise gives way to tyranny  at the death of a despot the only instant when subjects might display their true sentiments instead of acclamations they wear mourning as courtiers  what hence will it be said alas is it not selfevident enough by that inconsiderate vanity you have deprived yourselves of the only mean which remained of being openly revenged of a bad prince and the only mean of honoring the memory of a good one for if you display such marks of respect for a tiberius a louis xi a henry viii what remains for a marcus aurelius a louis ix a henry v  by that inconsiderate vanity you have wrested from your own hands the only rod which remained to repress the audacity of the successor to the crown the only reward to encourage him to the pursuit of virtue of the princes who mounted the egyptian throne how many turned virtuous from the consideration alone that sepulture was refused to a bad one   by that absurd vanity you have deprived yourselves of the only mean of distinguishing the secret enemies to their country you have placed yourselves upon a level with the creatures of the court and you blindly act the part of servile flatterers  by such inconsiderate marks of respect you have confounded the real relations of things for the loss of a prince who could scarce lisp the whole state assumes a melancholy face all is mournful feasts cease places of public entertainment are shut whilst for the loss of the benefactors of the patria of those who have defended it at the expense of their blood of those who have enriched it by their knowledge of those who have honored it with their virtues no marks of public grief are seen feasts continue and all appear gay nay when an allied prince dies the subjects imitating the court wear black whilst in those public calamities when the plague lays waste the provinces when the fire of heaven consumes the cities when famine drives to despair useful laborers no mourning no public marks of affliction are seen  in fine from that servile spirit princes proceed to enforce as a duty those exterior marks of veneration and establishing their tyrannic empire in our very hearts they command us to bemoan when they bemoan and to laugh when they laugh  henceforth political relations are subverted the prince is all the nation nothing  chap lxii of flattery in order to obtain their demand it is the constant practice of those who solicit any favor from princes to tell them they have a boundless power as god himself  in order to share their authority it is likewise the constant custom of the minister to tell them that they are absolute that every thing must yield to their will that they may dispose of the fortune of their subjects and that every measure to render their power irresistible is permitted when well planned or attended with success  on another side pensioned lawyers and philosophers confounding all notions of sound politics continually repeat in their fawning speeches that princes alone have a right to command and subjects none but to obey they build systems of injustice and basely prostitute their incense  vile authors publish these odious maxims and as if endeavoring to go beyond their own meanness they assert that there is no hobbes

conducive to the interests of the public without taking advice of the nation nay in opposition to the laws bracton de legib anglor philipe de comines memoires etc  that they are accountable to god alone from whom they have received their authority then searching into antiquity they show all nations under the yoke and allege those horrid abuses in vindication of tyranny  poets in their turn display these maxims in their verses men engaged in the conduct of public affairs begin to spread them at first with caution and afterward with effrontery the creatures of the prince and all those villains who build their fortune on the ruins of their country join their prostituted voices thus dictated by flattery and treason and repeated by interest fear hope or stupidity these maxims take place  by continually hearing that princes are absolute the people at last believe it the credulous father gives with devotion these lessons to his children and children following blindly the prejudices of their father royal prerogative establishes itself in every mind and every one thinks himself bound in duty to submit to the yoke  thus these scandalous tenets servilely propagated and stupidly received become the firmest support of tyranny  chap lxiii the subjects forge their own chains the people not only suffer themselves to be enchained but oftentimes offer their necks to the yoke  when a crafty man gains their confidence he inspires them with what sentiment he pleases and masters them at will  having assisted at the obsequies of caesar antony ascends the rostra and holding the bloody gown of the emperor moves the populace who instantly ran with the torches of the funeral pile in their hands to set on fire the houses of cassius and brutus  but considering what mahomet and other founders of sects have done what need is there for any example  not satisfied with being dupes the people run sometimes to servitude and lend their own hands to forge their chains never thinking that in a free country every subject has a right to inform against the servants of the public they ever blindly abandon themselves to their zeal for those who have appeared in their defense and yielding to gratitude ever strike at that very liberty the defender of which they mean to vindicate  as timoleon charged with misdemeanors by some orators of syracusa was summoned to appear before the people to clear himself his fellow citizens were on the point of tearing his accusers to pieces plutarch in vita timoleon   in order to maintain themselves free the people ought never to suffer the law to be made delusive but they oftentimes obstinately violate it in favor of those they respect zaleuchus legislator of the locrians having enacted a severe law against adultery and his own son being soon after convicted of that crime the people moved by the paternal sorrow repeatedly entreated his pardon  how many times with a view to secure their liberty have the people trusted in the princes own hands a tyrannic sway the persecutions of the protestant subjects under mary i rendered her domination odious accordingly when elizabeth mounted the throne as she professed the reformed religion the people transported by an indiscreet zeal vested her with an extensive power to extirpate papism but the fear of religious persecutions was soon changed into fear of civil slavery and the protestants with regret felt themselves crushed under the weight of that power they had erected to crush their enemies  nay in order to reform the government or vindicate the state they have trusted a few individuals with an absolute power of this the decemviri marius and sylla are famous instances vested with the whole power of the commonwealth rome beheld with astonishment the authority it had entrusted them with in their presence the people cast their eyes down the laws laid in silence the names of the proscribed resounded every where and blood was shed in abundance  the dutch delivered from the domination of their master by the death of william ii again trusted the supreme authority into the hands of his son murdered the zealous patriots who opposed such a rash step and again erected a prince against liberty  have we not ourselves many times forged our chains when the people incensed by the tax of three groats imposed by richard ii on every person male or female above fifteen years of age had risen against their oppressors resolutely bent to better their condition they required the abolition of slavery freedom of commerce in market towns without tolls or imposts and a fixed rent on lands instead of the services due by villenage all these requests were complied with and charters to that purpose were granted them soon after the nobility and gentry hearing of these transactions flocked to london with their adherents and retainers richard took the field the charters of enfranchisement were revoked by parliament and the inferior class of people were reduced to the same slavish condition as before froissart live ii cap      the parliament like a vile instrument destined to enlarge royal authority subjected the whole nation to henry viii in the most scandalous manner  at first they conferred on the king the title of the only supreme head on earth of the church of england and invested him with all the real power belonging to it or rather acknowledged his pretended inherent power to visit repress redress reform correct restrain and amend all errors heresies abuses offenses contempt and enormities which fall under any spiritual authority and jurisdiction and as if it was not enough to trust him with these terrible weapons they passed a law by which they ratified all the tenets which the commission appointed by the crown to choose a religion for the people should establish with the kings consent not being ashamed of expressly declaring that they had no other rule in religious concerns but the arbitrary will of their master  having thus resigned all their ecclesiastical liberties they proceeded to an entire surrender of their civil rights and without scruple or deliberation made by one act a total subversion of the english constitution  they gave to the kings proclamations the same force as to statutes enacted by parliament    hen viii cap    they even framed this law as if it were only intended to explain the natural extent of royal authority and to facilitate the execution of it appointed that any one of the kings counselors should form a legal court for punishing all disobedience to proclamations but to prove the more ready to gratify even the most lawless passions of the king they ratified his divorce from anne boleyn declared the issue of their marriage illegitimate settled the crown on the kings issue by his new mistress and in case he should die without children empowered him by his will or letters patent to dispose of the crown not satisfied with this scandalous prostitution to the will of the monarch a species of civil inquisition was established over the kingdom whoever refused to answer upon oath to any article of the act of settlement was declared guilty of high treason  but there are in our history other instances of baseness still more humiliating  when charles ii was recalled to the crown with what eagerness did every order of the people run to meet him and endeavor to outvie each other in their assurance of loyalty  the nobility papists and tories united in their insult over an assembly whose patriotic spirit had hitherto foiled their combined efforts to reduce their country under the yoke of ancient tyranny and celebrated the happy event the presbyterians stupidly imagining they were exulting in their own triumph cordially joined their voice the patriotic party themselves giving up all those liberties they had purchased at the expense of their blood imitated the crowd  every one was busy in removing whatever might offend the eyes of their new master the arms of the commonwealth were pulled down and those of the king put up in their place the scotch colors taken at dunbar and worcester were removed and the great seals broken whatever bore any stamp of liberty or revived any idea of independance was destroyed and public thanksgivings were ordered  no sooner was the prince landed but the people from every quarter of the kingdom flocked to him the senate of the nation threw themselves at his feet he entered the capital in pomp amidst public acclamations rejoicings and illuminations were seen every where whilst in the transports of their joy the stupid multitude cursed the names of those who had so long deprived them of a king threw in the flames the sad remains of the commonwealth and racked their gross imaginations for invention to insult a government by whose paternal regard they could only hope to have been emancipated from that abject state of servitude they were subject to  hardly was the prince ascended the throne but the parliament deemed as the most execrable rebels the opposers of charles the firsts usurpations they decreed proscription confiscation or imprisonment against the members of the tribunal that had sentenced the tyrant by their order the bodies of cromwell ireton bradshaw and pride were taken out of their graves drawn upon an hurdle to tyburn hanged there and then buried under the gallows by their order the walls of gloucester coventry northampton leicester  towns which had distinguished themselves by their zeal for parliament were rased to the ground  not satisfied with restoring charles to his prerogative the parliament proceeded to invest him with an unlimited power having settled on the king a greater revenue than that of his predecessor they passed an act declaring the right of disposing of the militia and land forces to be in the kings hands only recalled at his desire the triennial bill enacted a law to prevent disaffected persons from being admitted into office to have the succession of corporations perpetuated in the hands of the creatures of the court and to oblige all their officers to take a new oath of allegiance and supremacy declaring it unlawful upon any pretense whatsoever to rise in arms against the king or those commissioned by him  they vested in the crown new prerogatives and did not cease to enlarge its authority till they themselves crushed under the weight of that power they had erected beheld with trembling the work of their own hands  but as if ever fated through want of knowledge or virtue to effect their own misery one idol was no sooner fallen down but our forefathers erected another and adored it with greater devotion  as james ii ascended the throne the parliament earnestly cringed at his feet and amidst the several tokens of zeal they displayed for him it was uncertain which of both houses was most earnest to run to slavery the lower house voted that all the revenue enjoyed by the late king should be granted to his majesty during life and thus settling upon him an immense revenue enabled the crown to maintain an army and fleet without the assistance of the people and subdue those who should dare to oppose whilst the upper house at the request of the attorney general entirely discharged the earl of danby and the popish lords who upon indictment had been prisoners in the tower for the plot annulled their former order of the   th of march       and brought in a bill to reverse the attainder of the viscount stafford in the year    0  on their side all the magistrates judges justices of the peace served the king his own way and as if those who were appointed to hold the balance of justice would leave no right in the state they gave it as their opinion that the laws of england are the kings laws and that it is a prerogative of the crown to dispense with them  the clergy of the church of england likewise distinguished themselves by their devotion to the maxims of the court the pulpit every where refounded with the doctrine of passive obedience and this doctrine was supported in the courts of justice by the judges and lawyers to the utmost of their power  at length to render at once the king absolute all the corporations in the kingdom made a general surrender of their charters and abandoned themselves to his mercy  thus except a few men of a sound understanding and exalted mind the people are commonly composed of simple and timid persons ever ready to accelerate their own servitude  chap lxiv of despotism as soon as the prince has usurped the supreme power the object of all public undertakings is no more the welfare of the people but the display of his authority of the dignity of his crown or the gratification of his pride and caprice hence he considers the state as his patrimony and the public money as his revenue he sells offices and dignities traffics away towns provinces subjects and disposes at pleasure of all the national forces  if incensed at such outrages the people utter aloud complaints the prince pulls off the mask assumes the imperious style of a master orders them to be submissive and to their remonstrances answers such is our good pleasure if he meets with opposition he speaks but of punishing the audacity of his enemies complaints are then useless and as the prince has secured his authority whatever be his arbitrary mandates there remains only passive obedience  already public liberty exists no more the prince is all and the nation nothing however certain individuals corporations or orders of people still retain particular privileges which stand in his way and as so many barriers confine his power within certain limits  when once the legislative power is vested in the crown the prince labors to become absolute beholds with concern the enemies of his iniquitous empire and makes away with them he sees with a jealous eye those who still retain personal preeminences and is earnest to deprive them of their prerogatives he restrains the privileges of corporations usurps those of towns and adds oftentimes mockery to injury thus james ii having extorted from his subjects their charters returned them thanks in a proclamation for the great confidence they had reposed in him adding that he for that mark of honor thought himself more than ordinarily obliged to continue as he had hitherto begun to show the greatest moderation and benignity in the exercise of so great a trust  when the prince is arrived at this point his ambition has no limits every day he ventures on new steps toward extending his power every day commits new outrages and if he continues to have recourse to pretenses it is less from necessity than salving appearances  chap lxv of the fear of torments the prince having engrossed every power which can be exerted in government would that he were just but woe to those who dare still to complain of his tyrannic empire as he has spared no crime to get possession of the supreme power he spares none to maintain it thus when once the chains of the people are forged they are afterward riveted and riveted so close that the fate of their liberty is sealed for ever  the last blow princes strike at liberty is the overturning the constitution under color of defending it and the punishing as rebels those who should attempt really to defend it  armed with the whole public force invested with all authority and interpreters of the laws they make of them an arm defensive and offensive which renders them sacred to their subjects and terrible to their enemies  if in the courts of judicature before which the unfortunate victims of his vengeance are dragged there is still a remain of humanity they compose tribunals of their creatures such were the commission of trailbaton the star chamber the high commission court the council of york the chamber ardente etc  the sword of tyranny is suspended over every head and if any one dares to murmur he is massacred in an instant the people then live in perpetual anguish and every one trembling for his life beholds in silence the outrages of the despot  when the prince has exterminated all those powerful men who opposed his usurpations all those spirited men who refused to submit to his odious empire all men jealous of their liberty when he has overthrown all the barriers which set bounds to his ambition silenced all the laws and sacrificed every thing to his elevation he gives then a little respite to the people grants rewards to his creatures bestows donations on the armies procures abundance and indulges the populace with such was the conduct of augustus when he became master of the commonwealth shows  a fallacious image of public happiness  to rise an usurper depresses every one but to support his overgrown power he must engage the people to be concerned for him by the mildness of his government alone he may attain this end accordingly he seems for a while as if he meant to restore public liberty caesar having usurped the sovereign power said with insolence that the commonwealth was nothing and that his orders were laws but when augustus had placed himself at the helm he affected to be no more than the first magistrate of the people and attempted to persuade the romans they were still free    he makes such regulations as may prevent the disorders which have caused the ruin of the state before he was the sole master of it he restores the magistrates to the functions of their office sometimes he permits a phantom of the sovereign to subsist and takes its advice on every law he intends to enact after he has dictated him its answer  if he commits any violence to indulge his passions it is under the forms of justice if he sacrifices any subject to his resentment it is by means of the magistrates and thus gratifies his desires without being loaded with public hatred but in order that the tribunals be ever blind instruments of his command he confers no office but to men destitute of principle and fills the courts with detestable villains what was the roman senate under caesar augustus and tiberius a beggarly corrupt and servile set of men the most part of them appointed by the emperors absolutely their creatures and equally ready to be the creatures of any other fortunate usurper the senate however still became more contemptible for a caligula claudius nero appointed for senators emancipated slaves  louis xi louis xiii charles i etc conferred no commission of judges but to men disposed to prostitute themselves to power but charles ii and james ii appointed lord chief justices and judges the most prostigate villains that ever existed etc     at other times to calm his fears or indulge his avarice he engages ruffians to make away with troublesome subjects and then to appease the minds of the people disowns the ministers of his vengeance lays on them all the blame for the crimes he has committed such was the craft of augustus tiberius nero and such is the craft of the venetians tacit ann amelot de la houssaye gouvernement de venice    abandons them to their ill fate or punishes them himself for having obeyed his orders  seduced by such artifices the people rush to servitude confirm to the prince his usurpations abandon themselves to his mercy and confer on him the power of ordering what he thinks most conducive to the interests of his dominions without taking advice of any but of himself  but this appearance of justice soon vanishes when once the despot has secured his authority he renounces moderation he sinks into pleasure and abandons himself to every sort of debauchery and extravagance the public revenue becomes the prey of this minions of musicians mimicks curtezans and even of the rabble who no longer subsist but by his scandalous prodigalities  to such odious wastefulness is joined licentiousness the creatures scandalously traffic the power of their master they sell offices and even dispensations from discharging the duty of them  by constantly squandering public money in indulging his passions and caprices the despot exhausts at last his treasury when exhausted he labors to fill it again and recovers by crimes what he has wasted in extravagances  yet he does not begin by violent extortions he at first employs craft and covering his wants with the exigencies of government he lays heavy taxes on the subjects  these resources being drained he has recourse to extortions confiscations and pillaging we cannot refrain from wonder when considering what a great number of persons were put to death by the roman emperors in order to confiscate their fortunes we are filled with indignation in seeing the detestable artifices philip the fair made use of in order to rob the knightstemplars but we lose all temper in perusing the infinite instances of the rapacity of henry vii and henry viii     in order to have a pretense for preying upon his subjects to the punishments of those who are guilty of high treason he adds the forfeiture of their wealth and in order to find a multitude of criminals he denominates high treason an infinite number of guiltless actions and is wholly busy in contriving new crimes and finding out informers  at the sight of the outrages of the tyrant murmurs are revived plots are formed and again blood is shed in abundance the reader is incensed at the recital of the murders ordered by augustus tiberius caligula domitian or nero and feels with forrow the deplorable lot of a people abandoned to the mercy of a tyrant but how nature shudders at the horrid slaughter ordered by james ii after monmouths invasions     as he becomes more odious his alarms increase and blood is shed in greater abundance  to the care of personal safety tyrants join that of securing their empire and their cruelty augments with their terrors to secure themselves against attempts they know of no other mean but proscription imprisonment torture maintaining one cruelty by another and washing their bloody hands in blood is their sole employment  to banish their fears it is not enough to exterminate all jealous men all malcontents all suspected persons if their children their friends their relations be not butchered thus the blood of the subjects is continually sacrificed to the pretended peace of the state  seeing none less worthy of the empire than themselves they dread subjects who still maintain any virtue are offended at any one displaying any merit are jealous of those who enjoy the public esteem of captains who have any influence over the soldiers of magistrates who discharge the duties of their office of placemen who are not deemed infamous whatever announces a greatness of mind is to them matter of anguish whatever appears with eclat offends their eyes whatever excites admiration awakens their jealousy they are alarmed by the very appearance of audacity and to banish their terrors their base hearts suggest murders only  dreading even the shadow of independence they issue out proclamations against freedom of speech they see with concern those who turn their eyes toward the calamities of their country are incensed that any one should dare to recollect the fortunate but past days of liberty or speak with respect of good citizens they rank the love of the patria among crimes and punish it as such  when any one dares to write against tyranny his performance is ignominiously burnt by public authority cordus having praised brutus in his annals the senate with a view to please sejanus condemned that book to the flames  in      lord lucas delivered a speech in parliament against the prodigality of subsidies granted by the commons to charles ii and the king ordered it to be burnt by the executioner  the abbe du renald published lately in france a work wherein there are some strokes against the government and louis xv ordered it to be publicly burnt etc    and himself punished as a malefactor if he escapes his head is demanded from foreign powers and he is persecuted till death  arrived at this point they carry their suspicious caution farther they will not allow any one to turn his eyes on matters of state gallienus in order to pay his court to tiberius made a motion in the senate for admitting the pretorian soldiers into the equestrian places of the amphitheatre for his reward the emperor had him expelled the senate tacit ann lib vi  in      james i published a proclamation which forbad any one to censure the scandalous conduct of his ministers rushworth  as it was the common talk that charles ii instead of beholding with concern the growing greatness of louis xiv saw it with pleasure charles by a proclamation suppressed all the coffeehouses on pretense of their being the places where all disaffected persons met and devised their calumnies against the king and ministers rapin  in      the counselor de st maure presented to the minister a plan of the resources of the state and was sent to the bastile for his reward    they endeavor to annihilate all notions of public interest even the very name of the laws  not satisfied with punishing those who complain against tyranny they deter those who might be tempted to follow the same example and as they dread no less private discourses than public ones they impose silence on every one  in order to prevent their conduct from being inquired into and to reign peaceably in the name of the laws it is too little according to them to have recourse to terror but have their eyes ever open on their subjects they have them continually watched and this base employment they resign to a band of infamous villains  thus under pretense to secure public tranquillity and enforce respect to the majesty of the throne they maintain legions of spies among their subjects they erect secret tribunals and inquisitions of every kind the doors of which are ever open to informers this was to be seen under tiberius caligula domitian and nero rome was then full of informers the slave was a spy on his master the client on his patron the friend on his friends the son on his father  this is to be seen in turkey china japan and almost in every state of europe  in france the ministry pay yearly out of the public money  00000 pounds to spies and informers  in spain immense sums are likewise applied to the same purpose  at venice besides the infinite number of spies who haunt the coffeehouses the churches the theaters and those who are maintained in the bosom of private families the council of the ten allures from time to time by rewards all those who choose to act the part of informers  there were likewise a great number of spies among us under henry vii henry viii mary charles i charles ii and james ii but they have disappeared with these tyrants     nay some princes have carried distrust so far as to force their subjects to become informers in      james i issued out a proclamation by which he forbad the conversing upon state affairs and threatened to inflict severe penalties both on the concealers and utterers of those speeches  in      charles i exacting a loan from his subjects the following instructions among others were given to the commissioners appointed to levy it that if any shall refuse to lend and make delay or excuse they examine such persons upon oath whether they have been dealt withal to refuse to lend or make an excuse for not lending who has dealt so with them and what speeches have been used tending to that purpose and that they shall also charge every such person in his majestys name upon his allegiance not to disclose to any or alter what his answer was    and even to accuse themselves that is to say to become the victims or satellites of tyranny hence every one entertains suspicions brothers and friends distrust each other but if any one is so bold as to murmur against oppression he is instantly apprehended loaded with chains dragged into a dungeon and all desert him like a victim devoted to its ill fate thus by crushing those who resist and deterring those who have a mind to it none are willing to defend the patria and there remain in the state only abject slaves and an insolent master  despots in order the more easily to tyrannize over the people endeavor to render them stupid every discourse or writing which elevates the mind or tends toward engaging men to reflect is fatal to its author as if designing to annihilate every thing that bears the stamp of genius or virtue these tyrants banish out of their dominions distinguished orators celebrated philosophers and brand their works with infamy thus did caligula domitian nero charles i etc   nothing is guiltless in the eyes of a despot ever surrounded with villains who feed his suspicions cherish his avarice and incense his pride villains protected and enriched with the spoils of unfortunate victims henceforth tyranny is unbounded all those who become suspected by the despot are sacrificed to his cowardice all those whose riches he covets are sacrificed to his avarice all those who cringe not at his feet are sacrificed to his pride they are charged with having insulted the majesty of the prince disregarded his authority uttered disrespectful words of his ministers etc the sword is then lifted up against every head and the state exhibits scenes of horror and slaughter thus at the mercy of a tyrant every one is sensible that he must not be talked of and that his safety depends upon his obscurity every one conceals his fears his hopes his desires murmurs complaints sighs are no more to be heard a melancholy silence reigns consternation seizes every heart subjects groan in secret and under the most racking anxieties of mind lament like malefactors having death ever before their eyes  after the despot has sacrificed his subjects to his fears avarice and pride he sacrifices them to his lust he takes away from them their wives their daughters their sons and abandons himself to the most odious debauchery  the subjects once subdued and conscious of the impossibility of shaking off the yoke think only how to render their condition tolerable and seek safety in baseness unable to be free any longer they soon despise liberty  good patriots if there are still any sensible that they should be deserted by every one venture not on measures which would serve only to bring destruction on themselves thus reduced to wish for a better condition without daring to attempt any thing to rescue the subjects from their misery and to applaud that which it would prove dangerous to blame they as the rest resolve to be submissive hence a base servility prevails among the people and every one offers incense to the idol they detest no sooner did tiberius ascend the throne but the knights senators and consuls endeavored to outvie each other in servility tiberius affecting to refuse the supreme authority the senate immediately issued out a decree commanding that every thing which the emperor shall do be deemed well done a senator having in favor of tiberius made a motion not to denote henceforth the year by the consul another directly moved to engrave the decree for that purpose in golden letters young old all with emulation extolled tiberius even those who bent under the weight of years could reap from their baseness only eternal opprobrium  otho being proclaimed emperor the romans flocked to the field endeavoring to outrun each other in order to be the first to applaud the choice of the army and to cringe at his feet     when the prince is the supreme arbiter of the state to be accounted something every one endeavors to prove the most servile the courtiers vile flatterers of his passions and vices seek with eagerness the privilege of being his sport  on pretense of maintaining his authority but really to pay court to him all who approach him denominate the love of independance licenciousness rank among crimes patriotic zeal torture and become the apologists of tyranny  writers on their side represent the prince as a sovereign master and subjects as his slaves they inculcate that every one must kiss the rod and take pains to spread that fatal doctrine whilst in order to show their zeal ambitious villains set up as informers and look every where for victims whose condemnation might be agreeable to the prince in fine to carry infamy to its height the grave magistrates join their voices to that of the public and are earnest to outvie courtiers in servility the roman knights courted the servants of tiberius and valued it as an honor to be acquainted with the doorkeeper of sejanus tacit ann lib vi  in france noblemen cringe in the antichamber of the minister and are proud to be his favorite slaves     reduced to such an abject state the people sink still lower extreme ignorance ever produces extreme credulity when once the subjects are utterly unacquainted with their rights and used to hear pompous titles sublime names divine honors ever conferred on the despot they soon consider him as the representative of deity his orders as oracles from heaven and they rank blind submission among their duties  the despot then uncontrouled master of his dominions caligula put to death in a military manner all those who displeased him  ceases to have recourse to pretenses in order to varnish over his outrages but tramples laws under foot and preys upon the subjects at pleasure having taken away their fortunes their wives he takes away their children and sells them by auction caligula converted his palace into a place of debauchery and there sold to the rabble of rome the young boys and girls he had wrested from noble families  stains the courts of judicature disgraces the offices caligula dishonored the consular gown and nero the senatorial one by using them as covering for their horses  forces the magistrates to prostitute themselves by performing the part of buffoons it may be seen in dio cassius how nero forced the senators to perform on the stage the disgracing part of a mimic  and crushes every one who opposes his will  despots when their power is no more susceptible of any increase are only intent how to make their subjects feel its weight they issue out as laws the most arbitrary mandates and far from allowing those they oppress to complain forbid them even tears and sighs tiberius enacted a law against those relations who should bewail the victims of his tyranny tacit ann lib    whilst sentencing them to death they force the unfortunate victims of their rage to pierce their own hearts approve when philip the fair seized all the wealth of the knightstemplars he was earnest in wresting from them by the most severe tortures a confession of the pretended crimes he had charged them with trevotconc lxxxi    it was the constant practice of charles i to constrain those he persecuted to acknowledge crimes they had not committed rushworth vol i page   0   of their sufferings praise their tyrantsi cannot close these horrid scenes i shudder with horror and the pen falls out of my hand  prompted by a detestable pride the tyrant adds oftentimes insult to outrage applauding himself that he inspires terror he walks in public places where consternation preceeds him on his appearance the people cast down their eyes fall at his feet and resound in his ears the highest encomiums whilst he insults without pity over the state he keeps oppressed nay vexed at not being able to satiate his rage he oftentimes regrets his not doing more mischief  caligula wished that the roman people had but one head that he might have the pleasure to cut it off at a single stroke but why produce instances of this too many unfortunately are known  in proportion as tyranny advances to its last period the servility of the subjects proceeds to its lowest degree how many whilst crushed under the weight of their yoke are not satisfied with kissing their chains but become the vilest apologists of tyranny  nero having committed a horrid parricide the citizens of rome immediately flocked to the temples to thank the gods for an action which demanded their vengeance the senators themselves ascended the capitol ordered a thanksgiving for the safety of the prince placed the birthday of his mother among the days of ill omen and offered their incense for a crime they ought to have punished with the utmost severity tacit annal   but what excesses have not tyrants committed  after they have engrossed whatever power mortal beings can engross they affect to be more than men they have the insolent folly to pass for gods and as if the abjection of the people would go beyond its own bounds these slaves are heard conferring on the tyrant titles more pompous than he dares to assume  such are commonly the steps by which princes advance to despotism thus liberty has the fate of all other human things it yields to time which destroys every thing to vice which corrupts every thing to ignorance which confounds every thing and to force which crushes every thing  finis
