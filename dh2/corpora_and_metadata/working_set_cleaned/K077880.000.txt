the virtues and excellency of the american tobacco plant for cure of diseases and preservation of health and the noxious qualities of the tobacco growing in northern countries  london printed for r parker at the unicorn under the royal exchange and sold by j morphew near stationers hall      price   d  the virtues and excellency of the american tobacco plant the discovery and conquest of america by the spaniards enriched europe with not only vast treasures of gold and silver but also discovered and furnished us with perhaps much more useful and valuable things to wit many excellent specific remedies for the cure of diseases and preservation of health  nature had been so kind to the poor ignorant natives of that country as to direct them to and experience taught them the peculiar virtues of many herbs roots plants etc growing amongst them and how to apply them  the learned physicians in no age had ever the knowledge of a more celebrated specific remedy for any distemper than we in this last have found the peruvian bark to be for a never failing and sudden cure of intermitting fevers and agues and to which alone since it has been generally used more lives have been owing than to any other medicine whatsoever so wonderful is it in its operation that it looks almost like a charm  but above all their tobacco plant deserves to be placed in the first rank for its many amicable qualities and usefulness to human bodies for the cure of several distempers preservation of health and prolongation of life besides the agreeable diversion and entertainment it affords to those that use it the indians by their plentiful smoking and chawing it find great relief for their inward diseases and in case of wounds or ulcers etc they apply the leaf which eats away the proud flesh and inclines the sore to heal  it is an opiat to those that are in pain makes the poor forget their necessities supplies food to the hungry making them bear the want of it easily it is well known how armies have been enabled to undergo tedious marches and seamen long voyages with hardly any other provision when well supplied with this  it is endued with a salutiferous sulphur and has also a narcotic composing quality which gives ease refreshment and tranquillity both to the body and mind insomuch that it may seem to resemble the famous herb mentioned by homer that had the power to turn sadness into joy  the frequent smoking of tobacco discharges phlegm and other watery peccant humors out of the glands it removes obstructions in the vessels by dissolving the coagulated juices it promotes a due circulation of the blood and a free perspiration through the pores of the whole body so necessary to health it not only purges the head but with very many operates downwards rendering the bowels soluble whereby costive constitutions find great benefit  it destroys worms in human bodies and is likewise by experience found to be a remedy against leprosies scurvy and itch to which the poor heretofore inhabiting the seacoast of this island were by their eating too much fish very much subject but since the smoking of tobacco came to be much in use among them they have been totally free from  chawing tobacco is by many preferred to smoking it as being a greater drain and communicating its virtues and warmth more effectually to the stomach and brain preserving the teeth killing the worms and altering the juices that occasion pain and rottenness in them  by the chawing it the glands of the jaws throat and vessels being continually moved and compressed dismiss or spue out great quantities of rheum the cause of defluctions coughs catarrhs and consumptions it communicates also a certain impulse to the membranes of the lungs which helps their discharge of vicious phlegm and other matter apt to breed ulcers astmas and other distempers it is observed by many that those who from their youth have been accustomed to chaw tobacco are never afflicted or at least very rarely with gout rheumatisms scurvy or toothache which proceeds from an acrimony in the blood or juices that this plant wonderfully helps to correct and sweeten  as smoking and chawing of tobacco by experience is found to have these good effects so the using it by way of snuff is beneficial as well as diverting to many persons especially to such as have weak eyes affected with too much moisture by its gently pricking and stimulating the membranes it causes sneezing or contractions whereby the glands and channels like so many squeezed sponges dismiss their serosities and filth and as it serves for a drain to excessive moisture in the eyes or head so when a sufficient moisture is wanting its quick and noble spirit opens the vessels that afford supplies thereto and pure snuff put into the corners of the eyes is found to alter and destroy the sharp humors that occasion bloodshot etc so beneficial is this powder for the preservation of that most dear and valuable of all our senses the sight  but care ought to be taken that the snuff made use of in all these cases be made of only pure clean tobacco leaves without any mixture of stiptic earths or rotten wood which common snuffmakers put thereto to deaden color or else increase the quantity  tobacco also is often a remedy for deafness by putting a drop of its oil into the ear with cotton wool  but its most useful and excellent quality is still to be mentioned to wit that it is the most sovereign antidote and greatest preservative against the plague or other pestilential diseases the smallpox or other infection  the turks and others among whom the plague often rages have recourse to nothing more effectual to avoid it than constant smoking of tobacco chawing snuffing and burning it in their rooms and streets and when the pestilence is among them many stuff their bedding and pillows with it the indians where it grows hang it about their necks and are seldom seen without a pipe in their hand  when the plague raged so violently in london in the year      it is well known to many now living how very few it seized of those that were constant smoakers and chawers of tobacco and what was more remarkable not any of those poor people whose employment was to manufacture roll or cut tobacco of which there were many hundreds at work in several houses within this city were infected  by these and many other instances which might be given it is evident that tobacco wonderfully helps to purify the air and prevent infection so that it were very much to be wished that in time of pestilence and other infectious distempers the rich would be so charitable as to supply the poor with great stores of this most useful drug and sovereign antidote in such cases which may be a means to put a stop to the raging of such distempers and preserve whole families  but it is to be noted there are many sorts and degrees of tobacco plants and those highly preferable which grow in climates and soils natural to them having a light earth and warm sun which gives that noble flavor strength and virtue to that tobacco produced in brazil newspain virginia and maryland whereas that plant raised in northern regions where tobaccoplantations have of late mightily increased has not only a faint earthy taste and smell but is also very unwholsom and pernicious to those that use it instead of preserving it destroys health which though not so immediately and sensibly felt by poor people of strong and robust constitutions yet it is certainly so much poison sucked into their veins which by degrees consumes the body and often immediately causes vomitings vertigos and convulsions  to conclude all persons who love long life and health will daily have recourse to the american tobacco as a noble remedy and shun that of the european growth as poison  finis
