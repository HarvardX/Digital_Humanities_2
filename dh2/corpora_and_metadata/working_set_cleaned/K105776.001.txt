the parents assistant or stories for children part i containing the little dog trusty or the liar and boy of truth the orange man or the honest boy and the thief tarlton lazy lawrence the false key and barringout to which is prefixed an address to parents  the second edition  london printed for j johnson in st pauls churchyard       preface addressed to parents all who have meditated on the art of governing mankind have been convinced that the fate of empires depended on the education of youth  aristotle a motto from aristotle may appear pedantic but it was chosen merely to oppose such high authority to the following assertions of dr johnson  education says he is as well known and has long been as well known as ever it can be endeavoring to make children prematurely wise is useless labor suppose they have more knowledge at five or six years old than other children what use can be made of it it will be lost before it is wanted and the waste of so much time and labor of the teacher is never to be repaid boswells life of johnson   the remainder of this passage contains such an illiberal attack upon a celebrated female writer as ought surely to have been suppressed by dr johnsons biographer when the doctor attempted to ridicule this lady for keeping an infant boardingschool and for condescending to write elementary books for children he forgot his own eulogium upon dr watts of whom he speaks thus  for children he condescended to lay aside the philosopher the scholar and the wit to write little poems of devotion and systems of instruction adapted to their wants and capacities from the dawn of reason to its gradation of advance in the morning of life every man acquainted with the common principles of human action will look with veneration on the writer who is at one time combating lock and at another time making a catechism for chilaren in their fourth year a voluntary descent from the dignity of science is perhaps the hardest lesson which humility can teach  it seems however a very easy task to write for children those only who have been interested in the education of a family who have patiently followed children through the first processes of reasoning who have daily watched over their thoughts and feelings those only who know with what ease and rapidity the early associations of ideas are formed on which the future taste character and happiness depend can feel the dangers and difficulties of such an undertaking  for a length of time education was classed amongst the subjects of vague and metaphysical speculation but of late it has attained its proper station in experimental philosophy  the sober sense of lock and the enthusiastic eloquence of rousseau have directed to this object the attention of philosophers and men of genius many theories have been invented several just observations have been made and some few facts have been established  dr reid remarks that if we could obtain a distinct and full history of all that has passed in the mind of a child from the beginning of life and sensation till it grows up to the use of reason how its insant faculties began to work and how they brought forth and ripened all the various notions opinions and sentiments which we find in ourselves when we come to be capable of reslection this would be a treasure of natural history which would probably give more light into the human faculties than all the systems of philosophers about them since the beginning of the world dr reid on the intellectual powers of man   indeed in all sciences the grand difficulty has been to ascertain sacts  a difficulty which in the science of education peculiar circumstances conspire to increase here the objects of every experiment are so interesting that we cannot hold our minds indifferent to the result nor is it to be expected that many registers of experiments successful and unsuccessful should be kept much less should be published when we consider that the combined powers of affection and vanity of partiality to his child and to his theory will act upon the mind of a parent in opposition to the abstract love of justice and the general desire to increase the wisdom and happiness of mankind  notwithstanding these difficulties an attempt to keep such a register has actually been made it was begun in the year      long before doctor reids book was published the design has from time to time been pursued to this present year and though much has not been collected every circumstance and conversation that has been preserved is faithfully and accurately related  these notes have been of great advantage to the writer of the following stories and will probably at some future time be laid before the public as a collection of experiments upon a subject which has been hitherto treated theoretically  the following tales have been divided into two parts as they were designed for different classes of children the question whether society could subsist without the distinction of ranks is a question involving a variety of complicated discussions which we leave to the politician and the legislator at present it is necessary that the education of different ranks should in some respects be different they have few ideas few habits in common their peculiar vices and virtues do not arise from the same causes and their ambition is to be directed to different objects but justice truth and humanity are confined to no particular rank and should be enforced with equal care and energy upon the minds of young people of every station and it is hoped that these principles have never been forgotten in the following pages  the two first stories the orange man and trusty were written for a much earlier age than any of the others and with such a perfect simplicity of expression as to many may appear insipid and ridiculous this degree of simplicity is however necessary sor very young children who when they begin to learn to read should be rewarded for the trouble of decyphering every word by being enabled to understand the sense of the whole since these two stories were written a number of excellent little books have supplied the deficiency which was then complained of by all parents it was not therefore thought necessary to write any more for that age in the tales which succeed to them in this collection the same simplicity of language has not been observed the use of elementary books is to store the minds of children with facts and to enlarge their vocabulary after these purposes have been effected it is waste of time and a mere useless exercise of the memory to continue this species of reading as the ideas of children multiply the language of their books should become less simple else their taste will quickly be disgusted or will remain stationary children that live with people who converse with elegance will not be contented with a style inferior to what they hear from every body near them  it may be remarked that almost all language is metaphorick  from the conversation of the maid in the nursery who lulls a cross infant to sleep to that of the lady in the drawing room who with silly civility takes a child upon her lap to entertain it by a repetition of fashionable phrases slang the term is disgracefully naturalized in our vocabulary contains as much and as abstract metaphor as can be found in the most refined literary language nor have we reason to suppose that one kind of metaphor is more difficult than another to be understood by children they frequently hear the most complicated metaphorical expressions in conversation such as allude to our fashions and the prejudices of society with which they are utterly unacquainted  all poetical allusions have however been avoided in this book  only such situations are described as children can casily imagine and which may consequently interest their feelings  such examples of virtue are painted as are not above their conception of excellence and their powers of sympathy and emulation  it is not easy to give rewards to children which shall not indirectly do them harm by fostering some hurtful taste or passion in the story of lazy lawrence where the object was to excite a spirit of industry care has been taken to proportion the reward to the exertion and to point out that people feel cheerful and happy whilst they are employed the reward of our industrious boy though it be money is only money considered as the means of gratifying a benevolent wish in a commercial nation it is especially necessary to separate as much as possible the spirit of industry and avarice and to beware lest we introduce vice under the form of virtue  in the story of tarlton and loveit are represented the danger and the folly of that weakness of mind and easiness to be led which too often pass for goodnature and in the story of the false key are pointed out some of the evils to which a welleducated boy when he first goes to service is exposed from the profligacy of his fellow servants  in the birthday present in the history of mademoiselle panache and in the character of mrs theresa tattle in the second part the parents assistant has pointed out the dangers which may arise in education from a bad servant a silly governess and a common acquaintance  in the barringout the errors to which a high spirit and the love of party are apt to lead have been made the subject of correction and it is hoped that the common fault of making the most mischievous characters appear the most active and the most ingenious has been as much as possible avoided unsuccessful cunning will not be admired and cannot induce imitation  it has likewise been attempted in these stories to provide antidotes against illhumour the epidemic rage for dissipation and the fatal propensity to admire and imitate whatever the fashion of the moment may distinguish were young people either in public schools or in private families absolutely free from bad examples it would not be advisable to introduce despicable and vicious characters in books intended for their improvement but in real life they must see vice and it is best that they should be early shocked with the representation of what they are to avoid there is a great deal of difference between innocence and ignorance  to prevent precepts of morality from tiring the ear and the mind it was necessary to make the stories in which they are introduced in some measure dramatic to keep alive hope and fear and curiosity by some degree of intricacy at the same time care has been taken to avoid inflaming the imagination or exciting a restless spirit of adventure by exhibiting false views of life and creating hopes which in the ordinary course of things cannot be realised  dr johnson  to recur to him not from a spirit of contradiction but from a fear that his authority should establish dangerous errors  dr johnson says that babies do not like to hear stories of babies like themselves that they require to have their imaginations raised by tales of giants and fairies and castles and enchantments  the fact remains to be proved but supposing that they do prefer such tales is this a reason why they should be indulged in reading them it may be said that a little experience in life would soon convince them that fairies and giants and enchanters are not to be met with in the world but why should the mind be filled with fantastic visions instead of useful knowledge why should so much valuable time be lost why should we vitiate their taste and spoil their appetite by suffering them to feed upon sweetmeats it is to be hoped that the magic of dr johnsons name will not have power to restore the reign of fairies  but even when the improbability of fairy tales is avoided care should be taken to keep objects in their just proportions when we attempt an imitation of real life  love hatred fear and anger are to be raised in the soul says an eminent poet by showing their objects out of their true proportion either greater than the life or less but instruction is to be given by showing them what they really are  and surely a writer who sincerely wishes to increase the happiness of mankind will find it easy to give up the fame that might be acquired by eloquence when it is injurious to the cause of truth  the little dog trusty or the liar and the boy of truth very very little children must not read this story for they cannot understand it they will not know what is meant by a liear and a boy of truth  very little children when they are asked a question say yes and no without knowing the meaning of the words but you children who can speak quite plain and who can tell by words what you wish for and what you want and what you have seen and what you have done you who understand what is meant by the words i have done it or i have not you may read this story for you can understand it  frank and robert were two little boys about eight years old whenever frank did anything wrong he always told his father a mother of it and when any body asked him about any thing which he had done or said he always told the truth so that every body who knew him believed him but nobody who knew his brother robert believed a word which he said because he used to tell lies whenever he did any thing wrong he never ran to his father and mother to tell them of it but when they asked him about it he denied it and said he had not done the things which he had done the reason that robert told lies was because he was afraid of being punished for his faults if he confessed them he was a coward and could not bear the least pain but frank was a brave boy and could bear to be punished for little faults his mother never punished him so much for such little faults as she did robert for the lies which he told and which she found out afterward  one evening these two little boys were playing together in a room by themselves their mother was ironing in a room next to them and their father was out at work in the fields so there was nobody in the room with robert and frank but there was a lttle dog trusty ving by the fireside trusty was a pretty playful little dog and the children were very fond of him  come said robert to frank there is trusty lying beside the fire asleep let us go and waken him and he will play with us  o yes do let us said frank so they both ran together toward the hearth to waken the dog now there was a basin of milk standing upon the hearth and the little boys did not see whereabouts it stood for it was behind them as they were both playing with the dog they kicked it with their fet and threw it down and the basin broke and all the milk ran out of it over the hearth and about the floor and when the little boys saw what they had done they were very sorry and frightened but they did not know what to do they stood for some time looking at the broken basin and the milk without speaking robert spoke first  so we shall have no milk for supper tonight said he and he sighed   no milk for supper  why not said frank is there no more milk in the house yes but we shall have none of it for do not you remember last monday when we threw down the milk my mother said we were very careless and that the next time we did so we should have no more  and this is the next time so we shall have no milk for supper tonight  well then said frank we must do without it that is all we will take more care another time there is no great harm done come let us run and tell my mother you know she bid us always tell her directly when we broke any thing so come said he taking hold of his brothers hand i will come just now said robert dont be in such a hurry frank  cannot you stay a minute so frank stayed and then he said come now robert but robert answered stay a little longer for i dare not go yet  i am afraid  little boys i adise you never be afraid to tell the truth never say stay a minute and stay a little longer but run directly and tell of what you have done that is wrong the longer you stay the more afraid you will grow till at last perhaps you will not dre to tell the truth at all  hear what happened to robert  the longer he stayed the more unwilling he was to go to tell his mother that he had thrown the milk down and at last he pulled his hand away from his brother and cried i will not go at all frank cannot you go by yourself  yes said frank so i will i am not afraid to go by myself i only waited for you out of goodnature because i thought you would like to tell the truth too  yes so i will i mean to tell the truth when i am asked but i need not go now when i do not choose it  and why need you go either  cannot you wait here  surey my mother can see the milk when she comes in  frank said no more but as his brother would not come he went without him he opened the door of the nex room where he thought his mother was ironing but when he went in he saw that she was gone and he thought she was gone to fetch some more clothes to iron the clothes he knw were hanging on the bushes in the garden so he thought his mother was gone there and he ran after her to tell what had happened  now whilst frank was gon robert was left in the room by himself and all the while he was alone he was thinking of some excuses to make to his mother and he was sorry that frank was gone to tell her the truth he said to himself if frank and i both were to say that we did not throw down the basin she would believe us and we should have milk for supper i am very sorry frank would go to tell her about it just as he said this to himself he heard his mother coming down stairs oh ho said he to himself then my mother has not been out in the garden and so frank has not met her and cannot have told her so now i may say what i please  then this naughty cowardly boy determined to tell his mother a lie  she came into the room but when she saw the broken basin and the milk spilled she stopped short and cried   so so  what a piece of work is here  who did this robert  i dont know maam said robert in a very low voice  you dont know robert  tell me the truth  i shall not be angry with you child  you will only lose the milk at supper and as for the basin i would rather have you break all the basins i have than tell me one lie  so dont tell me a lie  i ask you robert did you break the basin   no maam i did not said robert and he colored as red as fire  then where is frank  did he do it  no mother he did not said robert for he was in hopes that when frank came in he should persuade him to say that he did not do it  how do you know said his mother that frank did not do it  because  because  because maam said robert hesitating as liars do for an excuse  because i was in the room all the time and i did not see him do it  then how was the basin thrown down if you have been in the room all the time you can tell  then robert going on from one lie to another answered   i suppose the dog must have done it  did you see him do it says his mother yes said this wicked by trusty trusty said his mother turning round and trusty who was lying before the fire drying his legs which were wet with the milk jumped up and came to her then she said fie fie trusty and she pointed to the milk get me a switch out of the garden robert trusty must be bent for this robert ran for the switch and in the garden he met his brother he stopped him and told him in a great hurry all that he had said to his mother and he begged of him not to tell the truth but to say the same as he had done  no i will not tell a lie said frank  what and is trusty to be beat  he did not throw down the milk and he shall not be beat for it  let me go to my mother  they both ran toward the house robert got first home and he locked the house door that frank might not come in he gave the switch to his mother poor trusty he looked up as the switch was lfted over his head but he could not speak to tell the truth just as the blow was falling upon him franks voice was heard at the window  stop stop dear mother stop cried he as loud as ever he could call trusty did not do it  let me n  i and robert did it  but do not ba robert  let us in let us in cried another voice which robert kew to be his fathers i am just come from work and here is the do locked robert turned as pale as ashes when he heard his fathers voice for his father always whipped him when he told a lie  his mother went to the door and unlocked it what is all this cried his father as he came in so his mother told him all that had happened  how the milk had been thrown down how she had asked robert whether he had done it and he said that he had not nor that frank had not done it but that trusty the dog had done it how she was just going to beat trusty when frank came to the window and told the truth where is the switch with which you were going to beat trusty said the father  then robert who saw by his fathers looks that he was going to beat him fell upon his knees and cried for mercy saying forgive me this time and i will never tell a lie again  but his father caught hold of him by the arm  i will whip you now said he and then i hope you will not so robert was whipped till he cried so loud with the pain that the whole neighborhood could hear him  there said his father when he had done now go to supper you are to have no milk to night and you have been whipped see how liars are served then turning to frank come here and shake hands with me frank you will have no milk for supper but that does not signify you have told the truth and have not been whipped and every body is pleased with you and now i will tell you what i will do for you  i will give you the little dog trusly to be your own dog you shall feed him and take care of him and he shall be your dog you have saved him a beating and i will answer for it you will be a good master to him trusty trusty come here trusty came then franks father took off trustys collar tomorrow i will go to the braziers added he and get a new collar made for your dog from this day forward he shall always be called after you frank  and wife whenever any of the neighbors children ask you why the dog trusty is to be called frank tell them this story of our two boys let them know the difference between a liar and a boy of truth  the orange man or the honest boy and the thief charles was the name of the honest boy and ned was the name of the thief charles never touched what was not his own this is being an honest boy ned often took what was not his own this is being a thief charless father and mother when he was a very little boy had taught him to be honest by always punishing him when he meddled with what was not his own but when ned took what was not his own his father and mother did not punish him so he grew up to be a thief  early one summers morning as charles was going along the road to school he met a man leading a horse which was laden with panniers the man stopped at the door of a publichouse which was by the road fide and he said to the landlord who came to the door i will not have my horse unloaded i shall only stop with you whilst i eat my breakfast give my horse to some one to hold here on the road and let the horse have a little hay to eat the landlord called but there was no one in the way so he beckoned to charles who was going by and begged him to old the horse oh said the man but can you engage him to be an honest boy for these are oranges in my baskets and it is not every little boy one can leave with oranges  yes said the landlord i have known charles from the cradle upwards and i never caught him in a lie or a theft all the parish knows him to be an honest boy i will engage your oranges will be as safe with him as if you were by yourself  can you so said the orange man then i will engage my lad to give you the finest orange in my basket when i come from breakfast if you will watch the red whilst i am away  yes said charles i will take care of your oranges so the man put the bridle into his hand and he went into the house to eat his breakfast  charles had watched the horse and the oranges about five minutes when he saw one of his schoolfellows coming toward him as he came nearer charles saw that it was ned ned stopped as he passed and said   good morrow to you charles what are you doing there whose horse is that and what have you got in the baskets  there are oranges in the baskets said charles and a man who has just gone into the inn here to eat his breakfast bid me take care of them and so i did because he said he would give me an orange when he came back again  an orange cried ned are you to have a whole orange  i wish i was to have one however let me look how large they are saying this ned went toward the pannier and lifted up the cloth that covered it la what fine oranges he exclaimed the moment he saw them let me touch them to feel if they are ripe  no said charles you had better not what signifies it to you whether they are ripe you know since you are not to eat them you should not meddle with them they are not yours  you must not touch them not touch them surely said ned there is no harm in touching them you dont think i mean to steal them i suppose so ned put his hand into the orangemans basket and he took up an orange and he felt it and when he had felt it he smelled it it smells very sweet said he and it feels very ripe i long to taste it i will only just suck one drop of juice at the top saying these words he put the orange to his mouth  little boys who wish to be honest beware of temptation do not depend too much upon yourselves and remember that it is easier to resolve to do right at first than at last people are led on by little and little to do wrong  the sight of the oranges tempted ned to touch them the touch tempted him to smell them and the smell tempted him to taste them  what are you about ned cried charles taking hold of his arm you said you only wanted to smell the orange do put it down for shame  dont say for shame to me cried ned in a surly tone the oranges are not yours charles  no they are not mine but i promised to take care of them and so i will  so put down that orange  oh if it comes to that i will not said ned and let us see who can make me if i dont choose it  i am stronger than you  i am not afraid of you for all that replied charles for i am in the right then he snatched the orange out of neds hand and he pushed him with all his force from the basket ned immediately returning hit him a violent blow which almost stunned him still however this good boy without minding the pain persevered in defending what was left in his care he still held the bridle with one hand and covered the basket with his other arm as well as he could ned struggled in vain to get his hands into the pannier again he could not and finding that he could not win by strength he had recourse to cunning so he pretended to be out of breath and to desist but he meant as soon as charles looked away to creep softly round to the basket on the other side cunning people though they think themselves very wise are almost always very silly  ned intent upon one thing the getting round to steal the oranges forgot that if he went too close to the horses heels he should startle him the horse indeed disturbed by the bustle near him had already left off eating his hay and began to put down his ears but when he felt something touch his hind legs he gave a sudden kick and ned fell backwards just as he had seized the orange  ned screamed with the pain and at the scream all the people came out of the public house to see what was the matter and amongst them came the orangeman  ned was now so much ashamed that he almost forgot the pain and wished to run away but he was so much hurt that he was obliged to sit down again the truth of the matter was soon told by charles and as soon believed by all the people present who knew him for he had the character of being an honest boy and ned was known to be a thief and a liar  so nobody pitied ned for the pain he felt he deserves it says one why did he meddle with what was not his own  pugh he is not much hurt i will answer for it said another and if he was it is a lucky kick for him if it keeps him from the gallows says a third charles was the only person who said nothing he helped ned away to a bank for brave boys are always goodnatured  oh come here said the orangeman calling him come here my honest lad what you got that black eye in keeping my oranges did you  that is a flout little fellow said he taking him by the hand and leading him into the midst of the people men women and children had gathered around and all the children fixed their eyes upon charles and wished to be in his place  in the mean time the orange man took charless hat off his head and filled it with fine china oranges there my little friend said he take them and god bless you with them if i could but afford it you should have all that is in my basket  then the people and especially the children shouted for joy but as soon as there was silence charles said to the orangeman thanks master with all my heart but i cannot take your oranges only that one i earned take the rest back again as for a black eye that is nothing but i will not be paid for it no more than for doing what is honest so i cannot take your oranges master but i thank you as much as if i had them saying these words charles offered to pour the oranges back into the basket bat the man would not let him  then said charles if they are honestly mine i may give them away so he emptied the hat amongst the children his companions divide them amongst you said he and without waiting for their thanks he pressed through the crowd and ran toward home the children all followed him clapping their hands and thanking him  the little thief came limping after nobody praised him nobody thanked him he had no oranges to eat nor had he any to give away people must be honest before they can be generous ned sighed as he went toward home and all this said he to himself was for one orange it was not worth while no it is never worth while to do wrong little boys who read this story consider which would you rather have been the honest boy or the thief  tarlton young hardy was educated by mr freeman a very good master at one of the sunday schools in  shire he was honest obedient active and goodnatured so that he was esteemed and beloved by his master and by his companions beloved by all his companions who were good he did not desire to be loved by the bad nor was he at all vexed or ashamed when idle mischievous or dishonest boys attempted to plague or ridicule him his friend loveit on the contrary wished to be universally liked and his highest ambition was to be thought the best natured boy in the school  and so he was he usually went by the name of poor loveit and every body pitied him when he got into disgrace which he frequently did for though he had a good disposition he was often led to do things which he knew to be wrong merely because he could never have the courage to say no because he was afraid to offend the illnatured and could not bear to be laughed at by fools  one fine autumn evening all the boys were permitted to go out to play in a pleasant green meadow near the school loveit and another boy called tarlton began to play a game at battledore and shuttlecock and a large party stood by to look on for they were the best players at battledore and shuttlecock in the school and this was a trial of skill between them when they had kept it up to three hundred and twenty the game became very interesting the arms of the combatants grew so tired that they could scarcely wield the battledores  the shuttlecock began to waver in the air now it almost touched the ground and now to the astonishment of the spectators mounted again high over their heads yet the strockes became febler and feebler and now loveit now tarlton resounded on all sides for another minute the victory was doubtful but at length the setting sun shining full in loveits face so dazzled his eyes that he could no longer see the shuttlecock and it fell at his feet  after the first shout for tarltons triumph was over every body exclaimed poor loveit  he is the best natured fellow in the world  what a pity that he did not stand with his black to the sun  now i dare you all to play another game with me cried tarlton vauntingly and as he spoke he tossed the shuttlecock up with all his force with so much force that it went over the hedge and dropped into a lane which went close beside the field heyday said tarlton what shall we do now  the boys were strictly forbidden to go into the lane and it was upon their promise not to break this command that they were allowed to play in the adjoining field  no other shuttlecock was to be had and their play was stopped they stood on the top of the bank peeping over the hedge i see it yonder said tarlton i wish any body would get it one could get over the gate at the bottom of the field and be back again in half a minute added he looking at loveit but you know we must not go into the lane said loveit hesitatingly pugh said tarlton why now what harm could it do  i dont know said loveit drumming upon his battledore but   you dont know man why then what are you afraid of i ask you  loveit colored went on drumming and again in a lower voice said he didnt know but upon tarltons repeating in a more insolent tone i ask you man what youre afraid of he suddenly left off drumming and looking round said he was not afraid of any thing that he knew of  yes but you are said hardy coming forward am i said loveit of what pray am i afraid of doing wrong afraid of doing wrong repeated tarlton mimicking him so that he made every body laugh now had not you better say afraid of being flogged  no said hardy coolly after the laugh had somewhat subsided i am as little afraid of being flogged as you are tarlton but i meant   no matter what you meant why should you interfere with your wisdom and your meanings nobody thought of asking you to stir a step for us but we asked loveit because he is the best fellow in the world  and for that very reason you should not ask him because you know he cannot refuse you any thing indeed though cried loveit piqued  there youre mistaken for i could refuse if i chose it hardy smiled and loveit half afraid of his contempt and half afraid of tarltons ridicule stood doubtful and again had recourse to his battledore which he balanced most curiously upon his fore finger look at him  now do look at him cried tarlton did you ever in your life see any body look so silly  hardy has him quite under thumb he is so mortally afraid of parson prig that he dare not for the soul of him turn either of his eyes from the tip of his nose look how he squints  i dont squint said loveit looking up and nobody has me under his thumb and what hardy said was only for fear i should get into disgrace  he is the best friend i have loveit spoke this with more than usual spirit for both his heart and his pride were touched come along them said hardy taking him by the arm in an affectionate manner and he was just going when tarlton called after him ay go along with its best friend and take care it does not get into a scrape  good by little panado  who do they call little panado said loveit turning his head hastily back never mind said hardy what does it signify  no said loveit to be sure it does not signify but one does not like to be called little panado besides added he after going a few steps farther they will all think it so illnatured  i had better go back and just tell them that i am very sorry i cannot get their shuttlecock  do come back with me  no said hardy i cannot go back and you would better not but i assure you i will not stay a minute wait for me added loveit and he slunk back again to prove that he was not little panado  once returned the rest followed of course for to support his character for goodnature he was obliged to yield to the entreaties of his companions and to show his spirit leapt over the gate amidst the acclamations of the little mob  he was quickly out of sight  here cried he returning in about five minutes quite out of breath i have got the shuttlecock and i will tell you what i have seen cried he panting for breath what cried every body eagerly why just at the turn of the corner at the end of the lane panting well said tariton impatiently do go on  let me just take breath first pugh never mind your breath  well then just at the turn of the corner at the end of the lane as i was looking about for the shuttlecock i heard a great rustling somewhere nearme and so i looked where it could come from and i saw in a nice little garden on the opposite side of the way a boy about as big as tarlton sitting in a great tree shaking the branches and at every shake down there came such a shower of sine large rosy apples they made my mouth water so i called to the boy to beg one but he said he could not give me one for that they were his grandfathers and just at that minute from behind a gooseberry bush up popped the uncle  the grandfather poked his head out of the window so i ran off as fast as my legs would carry me though i heard him bawling after me all the way  and let him bawl cried tarlton he shall not bawl for nothing i am determined well have some of his fine large rosy apples before i sleep tonight  at this speech a general silence ensued every body kept their eyes fixed upon tarlton except loveit who looked down apprehensive that he should be drawn on much farther than he intended  oh indeed said he to himself as hardy told me i had better not have come back  regardless of this confusion tarlton continued but before i say any more i hope we have no spies amongst us if there is any one of you afraid to be slogged let him march off this instant  loveith colored bit his lips wished to go but had not the courage to move first  he waited to see what every body else would do  nobody stirred  so loveit stood still  well then cried tarlton giving his hand to the boy next him then to the next your word and honor that you will not betray me but stand by me and iil stand by you  each boy gave his hand and his promise repeating stand by me and i will stand by you  loveit hung back till the last and had almost twisted off the butten of the boys coat who sereened him when tarlton came up holding out his hand come loveit lad youre in for it stand by me and i will stand by you   indeed tarlton expostulated he without looking him in the sace i do wish you would give up this seheme i dare say all the apples are gone by this time  i wish you would  do pray give up this scheme  what seheme man you havnt heard it yet you may as well know your text before you begin preaching the corners of loveits mouth could not refuse to smile though in his heart he felt not the slightest inclination to laugh why i dont know you i declare i dont know you today said tarlton you used to be the best natured most agreeable lad in the world and would do any thing one asked you but youre quite altered of late as we were saying just now when you skulked away with hardy come do man pluck up a little spirit and be one of us or you will make us all have you  hate me repeated loveit with terror no surely you will not all hate me and he mechanically stretched out his hand which tarlton shook violently saying ay now that is right  ay now that is wren whispered loveits conscience but his conscience was of no use to him for it was always overpowered by the voice of numbers and though he had the wish he never had the power to do right poor loveit i knew he would not refuse us cried his companions and even tarlton the moment he shook hands with him despised him it is certain that weakness of mind is despised both by the good and by the bad  the league being thus formed tarlton assumed all the airs of a commander explained his schemes and laid the plan of attack upon the poor old mans apple tree it was the only one he had in the world we shall not dwell upon their confultation for the amusement of contriving such expeditions is often the chief thing which induces idle boys to engage in them  there was a small window at the end of the back stairease through which between nine and ten oclock at night tarlton accompanied by loveit and another boy crept out it was a moonlight night and after crossing the field and climbing the gate directed by loveit who now resoled to go through the affair with spirit they proceeded down the lane with rash yet fearful shops at a distance loveit sw the writewashed cottage and the apple tree beside it they quickened their pace and with some difficulty scrambled through the hedge which fenced the garden though not without being scratched and o by the briars every thing was silent yet now and then at every rustling of the leaves they started and their hearts beat violently once as loveit was climbing the apple tree he thought he heard a door in the cottage open and earnestly begged his companions to desist and return home this however he could by no means persuade them to do until they had filled their pockets with apples then to his great joy they returned crept in at the staircase window and each retired as softly as possible to his own apartment  love it slept in the room with hardy whom he had left taste asleep and whom he now was extremely afraid of wakening all the apples were emptied out of loverits pockets and lodged with tarlton till the morning for fear the smell should betray the secret to hardy the oom door was apt to creak but it was opened with such precaution that no noise could be heard and loveit found his friend as fast asleep as when he left him  ah said he to himself how quietly he sleeps i wish i had been sleeping too the reproaches of loveits conscience however served no other purpose but to torment him he had not sufficient strength of mind to be good the very next night in spite of all his fears and all his penitence and all his resolutions by a little fresh ridicule and persuasion he was induced to accompany the same party on a similar expedition we must observe that the necessity for continuing their depredations became stronger the third day for though at first only a small party had been in the secret by degrees it was divulged to the whole school and it was necessary to secure secresy by sharing the booty  every one was astonished that hardy with all his quickness and penetration had not yet discovered their proceedings but loveit could not help suspecting that he was not quite so ignorant as he appeared to be loveit had strictly kept his promise of secresy but he was by no means an artful boy and in talking to his friend conscious that he had something to conceal he was perpetually on the point of betraying himself then recollecting his engagement he blushed stammered bungled and upon hardys asking what he meant would answer with a filly guilty countenance that he did not know or abruptly break off saying oh nothing nothing at all  it was in vain that he urged tarlton to permit him to consult his friend a gloom overspread tarltons brow when he began to speak on the subject and he always returned a peremptory refusal accompanied with some such taunting expression as this  i wish we had nothing to do with such a sneaking sellow he will betray us all i see before we have done with him  well said loveit to himself so i am abused after all and called a sneaking fellow for my pains that is rather hard to be sure when lve got so little by the job  in truth he had not got much for in the division of the booty only one apple and a half of another which was only half ripe happened to fall to his share though to be sure when they had all eaten their apples he had the satisfaction to hear every body declare they were very sorry they had forgotten to offer some of theirs to poor loveit  in the mean time the visits to the apple tree had been now too frequently repeated to remain concealed from the old man who lived in the cottage he used to examine his only tree very frequently and missing numbers of osy apples which he had watched ripening he though not much prome to suspicion began to think that there was something going wrong especially as a gap was made in his hedge and there were several small footsteps in his flower beds  the good old man was not at all inclined to give pain to any living creature much less to children of whom he was particularly fond nor was he in the least avaricious for though he was not rich he had enough to live upon because he had been very industrious in his youth and he was always very ready to part with the little he had nort was he a cross old man if any thing would have made him angry it would have been the seeing his favorite tree ro bed as he had promised himself the pleasure of gaving his red apples to his grandchildren on his birthday however he looked up at the tree in sorrow rather than in anger and leaning upon his staff he began to consider what he had best do  if i complain to their master said he to himself they will certainly be flogged and that i should be sorry for yet they must not be let to go on stealing that would be worse still for that would surely bring them to the gallows in the end let me see  oh ay that will do i will borrow farmer kents dog barker he will keep them off i will answer for it  father kent lent his dog barker cautioning his neighbor at the same time to be sure to chain him well for he was the fiercest mastiff in england the old man with farmer kents assistance chained him fast to the trunk of the apple tree  night came and tarlton loveit and his companions returned at the usual hour grown bolder now by frequent success they came on talking and laughing but the moment they had set their soot in the garden the dog started up and shaking his chain as he sprang forward barked with unremitting fury they stood still as if fixed to the spot there was just moonlight enough to see the dog let us try the other side of the tree said tarlton but to which ever side they turned the dog flew round in an instant barking with increased fury  he will break his chain and tear us to pieces cried tarlton and struck with ter or he immediately threw down the basket he had brought with him and betook himself to flight with the greatest precipitation  help me oh pray help me i cantt get through the he ge cried loveit in a lamentable tone whilst the dog growled hideously and sprang forward to the extremity of his chain  i cannot get out oh for gods sake stay for me one minute dear tarlton  he called in vain he was left to struggle through his difficulties by himself and of all his dear friends not one turned back to help him at last torn and terrified he got through the hedge and ran home despising his companions for their selfishness nor could he help observing that tarlton with all his vaunted prowess was the first to run away from the appearance of danger the next morning he could not help reproaching the party with their conduct  why could not you any of you stay one minute to help me said he we did not hear you call answered one i was so frightened said another i would not have turned back for the whole world  and you tarlton  i said tarlton had not i enough to do to take care of myself you blockhead every one for himself in this world so i see said loveit gravely well man is there any thing strange in that  strange why yes i thought you all loved me lord love you lad so we do but we love ourselves better  hardy would not have served me so however said loveit turning away in disgust tarlton was alarmed  pugh said he what nonsense have you taken into your brain think no more about it we are all very sorry and beg your pardon come shake hands for give and forget loveit gave his hand but gave it rather coldly  i forgive it with all my heart said he but i cannot forget it so soon  why then you are not such a goodhumoured follow as we thought you were surely you cannot bear malice loveit loveit smiled and allowed that n certainly could not bear malice well then come you know at the bottom we all love you and would do any thing in the world for you poor loveit flattered in his foible began to believe that they did love him at the bottom as they said and even with i eyes open consented again to be duped  how strange it is thought he that i should set such value upon the love of those i despise when i am once out of this scrape i will have no more to do with them i am determined  compared with his friend hardy his new associates did indeed appear contemptible for all this time hardy had treated him with uniform kindness avoided to pry into his secrets yet seemed ready to receive his confidence if it had been offered  after school in the evening as he was standing silently beside hardy who was ruling a sheet of paper for him tarlton in his brutal manner came up and seizing him by the arm cried come along with me loveit i have something to say to you  i cannot come now said loveit drawing away his arm  ah do come now said tarlton in a voice of persuasion  well i will come presently  nay but do pray there is a good fellow come now because i have something to say to you  what is it you have got to say to me i wish you would let me alone said loveit yet at the same time he suffered himself to be led away  tarlton took particular pains to humor him and bring him into temper again and even though he was not very apt to part with his playthings went so far as to say loveit the other day you wanted a top i will give you mine if you desire it  loveit thanked him and was overjoyed at the thoughts of possessing this top but what did you want to say to me just now  aye well talk of that presently  not yet  when we get out of hearing  nobody is near us said loveit  come a little farther however said tarlton looking round suspiciously  well now well you know the dog that frightened us so last night  yes  it will never frighten us again  will not it how so  look here said tarlton drawing from his pocket something wrapped in a blue handkerchief  what is that tarlton opened it raw meat exclaimed loveit how came you by it  tom the servant boy tom got it for me and i am to give him sixpence  and is it for the dog  yes i vowed i would be revenged on him and after this he will never bark again  never bark again  what do you mean  is it poison exclaimed loveit sing back with horror only poison for  said tarlton confused you could not look more shocking if it was poison for a stia loveit stood for nearly a minute in profound silence tarlton said he at lasts in a changed tone and altered manner i did not know you i will have no more to do with you  nay but stay said tarlton catching hold of his arm stay i was only joking  let go my arm you were in earnest  but then that was before i knew there was any harm if you think there is any harm   if said loveit why you know i might not know for tom told me it is a thing that is often done ask tom  i will ask nobody surely we know better what is right and wrong than tom does  but only just ask him to hear what he will say  i dont want to hear what he will say cried loveit vehemently the dog will die in agonies  in horrid agonies there was a dog poisoned at my fathers i saw him in the yard  poor creature he lay and howled and writhed himself  poor creature  well there is no harm done now cried tarlton in an hypocritical tone but though he thought sit to dissemble with loveit he was thoroughly determined in his purpose  poor loveit in haste to get away returned to his friend hardy but his mind was in such agitation that he neither talked nor moved like himself and two or three times his heart was so full that he was ready to burst into tears  how goodnatured you are to me said he to hardy as he was trying vainly to entertain him but if you knew  here he stopped short for the bell for evening prayer rang and they all took their places and knelt down after prayers as they were going to bed loveit stopped tarlton  well asked he in an inquiring manner fixing his eyes upon him  well replied tarlton in an audacious tone as if he meant to set his inquiring eye at defiance  what do you mean to do to night  to go to sleep as you do i suppose i plied tarlton turning away abruptly and whistling as he walked off  oh he has certainly changed his mind said leveit to himself else he could not whistle about tn minutes after this as he and herdy were undressing hardy suddenly recollected that he had left his new kite out upon the grass oh said he it will be quite spoiled before morning  call tom said loveit and bid him bring it in for you in a minute they both went to the top of the stairs to call tom no one answered they called again louder is tom below  i am here answered he at last coming out of tarltons room with a look of mixed embarrassment and effrontery and as he was receiving hardys commission loveit saw the corner of the blue handkerchief hanging out of his pocket this excited fresh suspicions in loveits mind but without saying one word he immediately stationed himself at the window in his room which looked out toward the lane and as the moon was risen he could see if any one passed that way what are you doing there said hardy after he had been watching some time why dont you come to bed loveit returned no answer but continued standing at the window nor did he watch long in vain presently he saw tom gliding slowly along a bypath and get over the gate into the lane  he is gone to do it exclaimed loveit aloud with an emotion which he could not command who is gone to do what cried hardy starting up how cruel how wicked continued loveit what is cruel  what is wicked speak out at once returned hardy in that commanding tone which in moments of danger strong minds feel themselves entitled to assume toward weak ones loveit instantly though in an incoherent manner explained the affair to him scarcely had the words passed his lips when hardy sprang up and began dressing himself without saying one syllable for gods sake what are you going to do said loveit in great anxiety they will never forgive me dont betray me they will never forgive me pray speak to me only say you will not betray us  i will not betray you trust to me said hardy and he left the room and loveit stood in amazement whilst in the mean time hardy in hopes of overtaking tom before the fate of the poor dog was decided ran with all possible speed across the meadow and then down the lane he came up with tom just as he was climbing the bank into the old mans garden hardy too much out of breath to speak seized hold of him dragged him down detaining him with a firm grasp whilst he panted for utterance  what master hardy is it you what is the matter what do you want  i want the poisoned meat that you have in your pocket  who told you that i had any such thing said tom clapping his hand upon his guilty pocket give it me quietly and i will let you off  sir upon my word i havnt i didnt i dont know what you mean said tom trembling though he was by far the strongest of the two indeed i dont know what you mean  you do said hardy with great indignation and a violent struggle immediately commenced the dog now alarmed by the voices began to bark outrageously tom was terrified lest the old man should come out to see what was the matter his strength forsook him and flinging the handkerchief and meat over the hedge he ran away with all his speed the handkerchief fell within the reach of the dog who instantly shapped at it luckily it did not come untied hardy saw a pitchfork on a dunghill close beside him and seizing upon it stuck it into the handkerchief the dog pulld tore growled grappled yelled it was impossible to get the handkerchief from between his teeth but the knot was loosed the meat unperceived by the dog dropped out and while he dragged off the handkerchief in triumph hardy with inexprele joy plunged the pitchfork into the poisoned meat and bore it away  never did hero retire with more satisfaction from a field of battle full of the pleasure of successful benevolence hardy tripped joyfully home and vaulted over the windowfill when the first object he beheld was mr power the usher standing at the head of the stairs with his candle in his hand  come up whoever you are said mr william power in a stern voice i thought i should find you out at last come up whoever you are hardy obeyed without reply  hardy exclaimed mr power starting back with astonishment is it you mr hardy repeated he holding the light to his face why sir said he in a sneering tone i am sure if mr trueman was here he wouldnt believe his own eyes but for my part i saw through you long since i never liked saints for my share will you please to do me the favor sir if it is not too much trouble to empty year pockets  hardy obeyed in silence hey day meat raw meat what next  that is all said hardy emptying his pockets inside out this is all said mr power taking up the meat  pray sir said hardy eagerly let that meat be burned it is poisoned  poisoned cried mr william power letting it drop out of his fingers you wretch looking at him with a menacing air what is all this speak hardy was silent why dont you speak cried he shaking him by the shoulder impatiently still hardy was silent down upon your knees this minute and confess all tell me where you have been what you have been doing and who are your accomplices for i know there is a gang of you so added he pressing heavily upon hardys shoulder down upon your knees this minute and confess the whole that is your only way now to get off yourself if you hope for my pardon i can tell you it is not to be had without asking for  sir said hardy in a firm but respectful voice i have no pardon to ask i have nothing to confess i am innocent but if i were not i would never try to get off myself by betraying my companions  very well sir very well very fine stick to it stick to it i advise you  and we shall see and how will you look tomorrow mr innocent when my uncle the doctor comes home as i do now sir said hardy unmoved his composure threw mr power into a rage too great for utterance sir continued hardy ever since i have been at school i never told a lie and therefore sir i hope you will believe me now upon my word and honor sir i have done nothing wrong  nothing wrong better and better what when i catched you going out at night   that to be sure was wrong said hardy recollecting himself but except that   except that sir i will except nothing come along with me young gentleman your time for pardon is past saying these words he pulled hardy along a narrow passage to a small closet set apart for desperate offenders and usually known by the name of the black hole there sir take up your lodging there for tonight said he pushing him in tomorrow i will know more or i will know why added he double locking the door with a tremendous noise upon his prisoner and locking also the door at the end of the passage so that no one could have access to him so now i think i have you safe said mr william power to himself stalking off with steps which made the whole gallery resound and which made many a guilty heart tremble the conversation which had passed between hardy and mr power at the head of the stairs had been anxiously listened to but only a word or two here and there had been distinctly overheard the locking of the black hole door was a terrible sound  some knew not what it portended and others knew too well all assembled in the morring with faces of anxiety tarltons and loveits were the most agitated tarlton for himself loveit for his friend for himself for every body every one of the party and tarlton at their head surrounded him with reproaches and considered him as the author of the evils which hung over them how could you do so and why did you say any thing to hardy about it when you had promised too oh what shall we all do what a serape you have brought us into loveit it is all your fault  all my fault repeated poor loveit with a sigh well that is hard  goodness there is the bell exclaimed a number of voices at once now for it they all stood in a half circle for morning prayers they listened here he is coming no  yes  here he is and mr william power with a gloomy brow appeared and walked up to his place at the head of the room they knelt down to prayers and the moment they rose mr william power laying his hand upon the table cried stand still gentlemen if you please every body stood stok still he walked out of the circle they guessed that he was gone for hardy and the whole room was in commotion each with eagerness asked each what none could answer has be tld   what has he tld  who has he told of  i hope he has not told of me cried they i will answer for it he has told of all of us said tarlton and i will answer for it he has told of none of us answered loveit with a sigh you dont think he is such a fool when he can get himself off said tarlton  at this instant the prisoner was led in and as he passed through the circle every eye was fixed upon him his eye turned upon no one not even upon loveit who pulled him by the coat as he passed  every one felt almost afraid to breathe  well sir said mr power sitting down in mr truemans ellow chair and placing the prisoner opposite to him well sir what have you to say to me this morning  nothing sir answered hardy in a decided yet modest manner nothing but what i said last night  nothing more  nothing more sir  but i have something more to say to you sir then and a great deal more i promise you before i have done with you and then seizing him in a fury he was just going to give him a severe flogging when the schoolroom door opened and mr trueman appeared followed by an old man whom loveit immediately knew he leaned upon his stick as he walked and in his other hand carried a basket of apples when they came within the circle mr trueman stopped short  hardy exclaimed he with a voice of unseigned surprise whilst mr william power stood with his hand suspended  aye hardy sir repeated he i told him you would not believe your own eyes  mr trueman advanced with a slow step now sir give me leave said the usher eagerly drawing him aside and whispering  so sir said mr t when the whisper was done addressing himself to hardy with a voice and manner which had he been guilty must have pierced him to the heart i find i have been deceived in you  it is but three hours ago that i told your uncle i never had a boy in my school in whom i placed so much confidence but after all this show of honor and integrity the moment my back is turned you are the first to set an example of disobedience to my orders why do i talk of disobeying my commands you are a thief  i sir exclaimed hardy no longer able to repress his feelings  you sir  you and some others said mr trueman looking round the room with a penetrating glance  you and some others   aye sir interrupted mr william power get that out of him if you can  ask him  i will ask him nothing i shall neither put his truth or his honor to the trial truth and honor are not to be expected amongst thieves i am not a thief i have never had any thing to do with thieves cried hardy indignantly have not you robbed this old man dont you know the taste of these apples said mr trueman taking one out of the basket no sir i do not i never touched one of that old mans apples  never touched one of them i suppose this is some vile equivocation you have done worse you have had the barbarity the baseness to attempt to poison his dog the poisoned meat was found in your pocket last night  the poisoned meat was found in my pocket sir i but i never attempted to poison the dog i saved his life  lord bless him said the old man nonsense cunning said mr power i hope you will not let him impose upon you so sir no he cannot impose upon me i have a proof he is little prepared for sad mr trueman producing the blue handkerchief in which the meat had been wrapped  tariton turned pale hardys countenance never changed  dont you know this handkerchief sir  i do sir  is it not your  no sir  dont you know whose it is cried mr power hardy was silent  now gentlemen said mr trueman i am not fond of punishing you but when i do it yu know it is always in earnest i will begin with the eldest of you i will begin with hardy and flog you with my own hands till this handkerchief is owned i am sure it is not mine and i am sure it is none of mine burst from every mouth whilst they looked at each other in dismay for none but hardy loveit and tarlton knew the secret  my cane said mr trueman and power handed him the cane  loveit groaned from the bottom of his heart  tarlton lened back against the wall with a black countenance  hardy looked with a steady eye at the cane  but first said mr trueman laying down the cane let us see perhaps we may find out the owner of this handkerchief another way examining the corners it was torn almost to pieces but luckily the corner that was marked remained  j t cried mr trueman every eye turned upon the guilty tarlton who now as pale as ashes and trembling in every limb sunk down upon his knees and in a whining voice begged for mercy upon my word and honor sir i will tell you all i should never have thought of stealing the apples if loveit had not first told me of them and it was tom who first put the poisoning the dog into my head it was he that carried the meat was not it said he appealing to hardy whose word he knew must be believed  oh dear sir continued he as mr trueman began to move toward him do let me off  do pray let me off this time i am not the only one indeed sir i hope you will not make me an example for the rest  it is very hard i am to be flogged more than they i am not going to flog you  thank you sir said tarlton getting up and wiping his eyes you need not thank me said mr trueman take your handkerchief  go out of this room  out of this house  let me never see you more  if i had any hopes of him said mr trueman as he shut the door after him if i had any hopes of him i would have punished him but i have none  punishment is meant only to make people better and those who have any hopes of themselves will know how to submit to it  at these words loveit first and immediately all the rest of the guilty party stepped out of the ranks confessed their fault and declared themselves ready to bear any punishment their master thought proper  oh they have been punished enough said the old man forgive them sir  hardy looked as if he wished to speak  not because you ask it said mr trueman though i should be glad to oblige you  it wouldnt be just  but there pointing to hardy there is one who has merited a reward the highest i can give him is the pardon of his companions  hardy bowed and his face glowed with pleasure whilst every body present sumpathised in his feelings  i am sure thought loveit this is a lesson i shall never forget  gentlemen said the old man with a faultering voice it was not for the sake of my apples that i spoke and you sir said he to hardy i thank you for saving my dog if you please i will plant on that mount opposite the window a young apple tree from my old one i will water it and take care of it with my own hands for your sake as long as i am able  and may god bless you laying his trembling hand on hardys head may god bless you  i am sure god will bless all such boys as you are  lazy lawrence in the pleasant valley of ashton there lived an elderly woman of the name of preston she had a small neat cottage and there was not a weed to be seen in her garden it was upon her garden that she chiefly depended for support it consisted of strawberry beds and one small border for flowers the pinks and roses she tied up in nice nosegays and sent either to clifton or bristol to be sold as to her strawberries she did not send them to market because it was the custom for numbers of people to come from clifton in the summer time to eat strawberries and cream at the gardens in ashton  now the widow preston was so obliging active and good humoured that every one who came to see her was pleased she lived happily in this manner for several years but alas one autumn she fell sick and during her illness every thing went wrong her garden was neglected her cow died and all the money which she had saved was spent in paying for medicines the winter passed away while she was so weak that she could earn but little by her work and when the summer came her rent was called for and the rent was not ready in her little purse as usual she begged a few months delay and they were granted to her but at the end of that time there was no resource but to sell her horse lightfoot now lightfoot though perhaps he had seen his best days was a very great favorite in his youth he had always carried the dame to market behind her husband and it was now her little son jems turn to ride him it was jems business to seed lightfoot and to take care of him a charge which he never neglected for besides being a very goodnatured he was a very industrious boy  it will go near to break my jems heart said dame preston to herself as she sat one evening beside the fire stirring the embers and considering how she had best open the matter to her son who stood opposite to her eating a dry crust of bread very heartily for supper  jem said the old woman what art hungry  that i am brave and hungry  aye no wonder you have been brave hard at work  eh  brave hard i wish it was not so dark mother that you might just step out and see the great bed i have dug i know you would say it was no bad days work  and oh mother i have good news farmer truck will give us the giantstrawberries and i am to go for em tomorrow morning and i will be back before breakfast  god bless the boy how he talks  four mile there and four mile back again before breakfast  aye upon lightfoot you know mother very easily may not i  aye child  why do you sigh mother  finish thy supper child  i have done cried jem swallowing e last mouthful hastily as if he thought he had been too long at supper  and now for the great needle i must see and mend lightfoots bridle before i go to bed  to work he set by the light of the fire and the dame having once more stirred it began again with jem dear does he go lame at all now  what lightfoot oh la no not he  never was so well of his lameness in all his life  he is grown quite young again i think and then he is so fat he can hardly wag  god bless him  that is right  we must see jem and keep him fat  for what mother  for monday fortnight at the fair he is to be  sold  lightfoot cried jem and let the bridle fall from his hand and will mother sell lightfoot   will no but i must jem  must who says you must why must you mother  i must i say child  why must not i pay my debts honestly  and must not i pay my rent and was not it called for long and long ago and have not i had time and did not i promise to pay it for certain monday fortnight and am not i two guineas short  and where am i to get two guineas so what signifies talking child said the widow leaning her head upon her arm lightfoot must go  jem was silent for a sew minutes  two guineas that is a great great deal  if i worked and worked and worked ever so hard i could no ways earn two guineas before monday fortnight  could i mother  lord help thee no not an work thyself to death  but i could earn something though i say cried jem proudly and i will earn something  if it be ever so little it will be something  and i shall do my very best so i will  that i am sure of my child said his mother drawing him toward her and kissing him you were always a good industrious lad that i will say before your face or behind your back  but it will not do now  lightfoot must go  jem turned away struggling to hide his tears and went to bed without saying a word more but he knew that crying would do no good so he presently wiped his eyes and ly awake considering what he could possibly do to save the horse  if i get ever so little he still said to himself it will be something and who knows but landlord might then wait a bit longer and we might make it all up in time for a penny a day might come to two guineas in time  but how to get the first penny was the question  the he recollected that one day when he had been sent to clifton to sell some flowers he had seen an old woman with a board beside her covered with various sparkling stones which people stopped to look at as they passed and he remembered that some people bught the stones one paid twopence another threepence and another sixpence for them and jem heard her say that she got them amonst the neighboring rocks so he thought that if he tried he might find some too and sell them as she had done  early in the morning he wakened full of this scheme jumped up dressed himself and having given one look at poor lightfoot in his stabe st off to clifton in search of the old woman to enquire where she found her sparkling stones but it was too early in the morning the old woman was not at her seat so he turned back again disappointed  he did not waste his time waiting for her but saddled and bridled lightfoot and went to farmer trucks for the gtstrawberries a great part of the morning was spent in putting them into the ground a as soon as that was finished e let out again in quest of the old woman who to his great joy he spied sitting at her corner of the street with her board before her but this old woman was deaf and cross and when at last jem made her hear his questions he could get no answer from her but that she found the fossils where he would never find any more but cannot i look where you looked  look away nobody hinders you replied the old woman and these were the only words she would say  jem was not however a boy to be easily discouraged he went to the rocks and walked slowly along looking at all the stones as he passed presently he came to a place where a number of men were at work loosening some large rocks and one amongst the workmen was stooping down looking for something very eagerly jem ran up and asked if he could help him yes said the man you can i have just dropped amongst this heap of rubbish a fine piece of crystal that i got today  what kind of a looking thing is it said jem white and like glass said the man and went on working whilst jem looked very carefully over the heap of rubbish for a great while come said the man it is gone for ever dont trouble yourself any more my boy   it is no trouble i will look a little longer well not give it up so soon said jem and after he had looked a little longer he found the piece of crystal thanke said the man you are a fine little industrious fellow jem encouraged by the tone of voice in which the man spoke this ventured to ask him the same questions which he had asked the old woman one good turn deserves another said the man we are going to dinner just now and shall leave off work  wait for me here and i will make it worth your while  jem waited and as he was very attentively observing how the workmen went on with their work he heard somebody near him give a great yawn and turning round he saw stretched upon the grass beside the river a boy about his own age who he knew very well went in the village of ashton by the name of lazy lawrence a name which he most justly deserved for he never did any thing from morning to night he neither worked nor played but sauntered or lounged about restless and yawning his father was an alehousekeeper and being generally drunk could take no care of his son so that lazy lawrence grew every day worse and worse however some of the neighbors said that he was a goodnatured poor fellow enough and would never do any one harm but himself whilst others who were wiser often shook their heads and told him that idleness was the root of all evil  what lawrence cried jem to him when he saw him lying upon the grass  what are you asleep  not quite  are you a wake  not quite  what are you doing there  nothing  what are you thinking of  nothing  what makes you lie there  i dont know  because i cannot find any body to play with me today  will you come and play  no i cannot i am busy  busy cried lawrence stretching himself you are always busy  i would not be you for the world to have so much to do always  and i said jem laughing would not be you for the world to have nothing to do so they parted for the workman just then called jem to follow him he took him home to his own house and showed him a parcel of fossils which he had gathered he said on purpose to sell but had never had time yet to sort them he set about it however now and having picked out those which he judged to be the best he put them in a small basket and gave them to jem to sell upon condition that  should bring him half of what he got jem pleased to be employed was ready to agree to what the man proposed provided his mother had no objection to it when he went home to dinner he told his mother his scheme and she smiled and said he might do as he pleased for she was not afraid of his being from home you are not an idle boy said she so there is little danger of your getting into any mischief  accordingly jem that evening took his stand with his little basket upon the bank of the river just at the place where people land from a ferryboat and where the walk turns to the wells where numbers of people perpetually pass to drink the waters he chose his place well and waited almost all evening offering his fossils with great assiduity to every passenger but not one person bought any holla cried some sailors who had just rowed a boat to land bear a hand here will you my little fellow and carry these parcels for us into yonder house jem ran down immediately for the parcels and did what he was asked to do so quickly and with so much good will that the master of the boat took notice of him and when he was going away stopped to ask him what he had got in his little basket and when he saw that they were fossils he immediately told jem to follow him for that he was going to carry some shells he had brought from abroad to a lady in the neighborhood who was making a grotto she will very likely buy your stones into the bargain come along my lad we can but try  the lady lived but a very little way off so that they were soon at her house she was alone in her parlour and was sorting a bundle of feathers of different colors they lay on a sheet of pasteboard upon a windowseat and it happened that as the sailor was bustling round the table to show off his shells he knocked down the sheet of pasteboard and scattered all the feathers the lady looked very sorry which jem observing he took the opportunity whilst she was busy looking over the sailors bag of shells to gather together all the feathers and sort them according to their different colors as he had seen them sorted when he first came into the room  where is the little boy you brought with you i thought i saw him here just now  and here i am maam cried jem creeping from under the table with some few remaining feathers which he had picked from the carpet i thought added he pointing to the others i had better be doing something than standing idle maam she smiled and pleased with his activity and simplicity began to ask him several questions such as who he was where he lived what employment he had and how much a day he earned by gathering fossils this is the first day i ever tried said jem i never sold any yet and if you dont buy em now maam i am afraid nobody else will for i have asked every body else  come then said the lady laughing if that is the case i think i had better buy them all so emptying all the fossils out of his basket she put half a crown into it jems eyes sparkled with joy oh thank you maam said he i will be sure and bring you as many more tomorrow  yes but i dont promise you said she to give you half a crown tomorrow  but perhaps though you dont promise it you will  no said the lady do not deceive yourself i assure you that i will not that instead of encouraging you to be industrious would teach you to be idle jem did not quite understand what she meant by this but answered i am sure i dont wish to be idle what i want is to earn something every day if i knew how i am sure i dont wish to be idle if you knew all you would know i did not  how do you mean if i knew all  why i mean if you knew about lightfoot  who is lightfoot  why mammys horse added jem looking out of the window i must make haste home and feed him before it get dark he will wonder what is gone with me  let him wonder a few minutes longer said the lady and tell me the rest of your story  i have no story maam to tell but as how mammy says he must go to the fair monday fortnight to be sold if she cannot get the two guineas for her rent and i should be main sorry to part with him for i love him and he loves me so i will work for him i will all i can to be sure as mammy says i have no chance such a little fellow as i am of earning two guineas before monday fortnight  but are you in earnest willing to work said the lady you know there is a great deal of difference between picking up a few stones and working steadily every day and all day long  but said jem i would work every day and all day long  then said the lady i will give you work come here tomorrow morning and my gardener will set you to weed the shrubberies and i will pay you sixpence a day remember you must be at the gates by six oclock jem bowed thanked her and went away it was late in the evening and he was impatient to get home to feed lightfoot yet he recollected that he had promised the man who had trusted him to sell the fossils that he would bring him half of what he got for them so he thought that he had better go to him directly and away he went running along by the water side about a quarter of a mile till he came to the mans house he was just come home from work and was surprised when jem showed him the halfcrown saying look what i got for the stones you are to have half you know  no said the man when he had heard his story i shall not take half of that it was given to you i expected but a shilling at the most and the half of that is but sixpence and that i will take  wife give the lad two shillings and take this halfcrown so wife opened an old glove and took out two shillings and the man as she opened the glove put in his fingers and took out a little silver penny  there he shall have that into the bargain for his honesty  honesty is the best policy  there is a lucky penny for you that i have kept ever since i can remember  dont you ever go to part with it do ye hear cried the woman let him do what he will with it wife said the man but argued the wife another penny would do just as well to buy ginger bread and that is what it will go for  no that it shall not i promise you said jem and so he ran away home fed lightfoot stroaked him went to bed jumped up at five oclock in the morning and went singing to work as gay as a lark  four days he worked every day and all day long and the lady every evening when she came out to walk in her gardens looked at his work at last she said to her gardener this little boy works very hard  never had so good a little boy about the grounds said the gardener he is always at his work let me come by when i will and he has got twice as much done as another would do yes twice as much maam for look here  he began at this here rose bush and now he is got to where you stand maam and here is the days work that the other boy and he is three years older too did today  i say measure jems fairly and it is twice as much i am sure  well said the lady to her gardener show me how much is a fair good days work for a boy of his age  come at six oclock and go at six why about this much maam said the gardener marking off a piece of the border with his spade then little boy said the lady so much shall be your task every day the gardener will mark it off for you and when you have done the rest of the day you may do what you please jem was extremely glad of this and the next day he had finished his task by four oclock so that he had all the rest of the evening to himself jem was as fond of play as any little boy could be and when he was at it played with all the eagerness and gaiety imaginable so as soon as he had finished his task fed lightfoot and put by the sixpence he had earned that day he ran to the playground in the village where he found a party of boys playing and amongst them lazy lawrence who indeed was not playing but lounging upon a gate with his thumb in his mouth the rest were playing at cricket jem joined them and was the merriest and most active amongst them till at last when quite out of breath with running he was obliged to give up to rest himself and sat down upon the style close to the gate on which lazy lawrence was swinging and why dont you play lawrence said he  i am tired said lawrence  tired of what  i dont know well what tires me grandmother says i am ill and i must take something  i dont know what ails me  oh pugh take a good race one two three and away and you will find yourself as well as ever come run  one two three and away  ah no i cannot run indeed said he hanging back heavily you know i can play all day long if i like it so i dont mind play as you do who have only one hour for it  so much the worse for you come now i am quite fresh again will you have one game at ball do  no i tell you i cannot i am as tired as if i had been working all day long as hard as a horse  ten times more said jem for i have been working all day long as hard as a horse and yet you see i am not a bit tired only a little out of breath just now  that is very odd said lawrence and yawned for want of some better answer then taking out a handful of halfpence  see what i got from father today because i asked him just at the right time when he had drank a glass or two then i can get any thing i want out of him  see a penny twopence threepence fourpence  there is eightpence in all would not you be happy if you had eightpence  why i dont know said jem laughing for you dont seem happy and you have eightpence  that does not signify though  i am sure you only say that because you envy me  you dont know what it is to have eightpence  you never had more than twopence or threepence at a time in all your life jem smiled oh as to that said he you are mistaken for i have at this very time more than twopence threepence or eightpence either i have  let me see  stones two shillings then five days work that is five sixpences that is two shillings and sixpence in all makes four shillings and sixpence and my silver penny is four and sevenpence  four and sevenpence  you have not said lawrence roused so as absolutely to stand upright four and sevenpence have you show it me and then i will believe you  follow me then cried jem and i will soon make you believe me come  is it far said lawrence following half running half hobbling till he came to the stable where jem showed him his treasure and how did you come by it honestly  honestly to be sure i did i earned it all  lord bless me earned it well i have a great mind to work but then it is such hot weather besides grandmother says i am not strong enough yet for hard work and besides i know how to coax daddy out of money when i want it so i need not work  but four and sevenpence let us see what will you do with it all  that is a secret said jem looking great i can guess i know what i would do with it if it was mine  first i would buy pockets full of gingerbread then i would buy ever so many apples and nuts dont you love nuts i would buy nuts enough to last me from this time to christmas and i would make little newton crack em for me for that is the worst of nuts there is the trouble of cracking em  well you never deserve to have a nut  but you will give me some of yours said lawrence in a fawning tone for he thought it easier to coax than to work  you will give me some of your good things will not you  i shall not have any of those good things said jem then what will you do with all your money  oh i know very well what to do with it but as i told you that is a secret and i shall not tell it any body  come now let us go back and play  their games up i dare say  lawrence went back with him full of curiosity and out of humor with himself and his eightpence  if i had four and sevenpence said he to himself i certainly should be happy  the next day as usual jem jumped up before six oclock and went to his work whilst lazy lawrence sauntered about without knowing what to do with himself in the course of two days he laid out sixpence of his money in apples and gingerbread and as long as these lasted he sound himself well received by his companions but at length the third day he spent his last halfpenny and when it was gone unfortunately some nuts tempted him very much but he had no money to pay for them so he ran home to coax his father as he called it when he got home he heard his father talking very loud and at first he thought he was drunk but when he opened the kitchen door he saw that he was not drunk but angry  you lazy dog cried he turning suddenly upon lawrence and gave him such a violent box on the ear as made the light flash from his eyes you lazy dog see what you have done for me  look  look look i say lawrence looked as soon as he came to the use of his senses and with fear amazement and remorse beheld at least a dozen bottles burst and the fine worcestershire cider streaming over the floor now did not iorder you three days ago to carry these bottles to the cellar and did not i charge you to wire the corks answer me you lazy rascal did not i  yes said lawrence scratching his head and why was not it done i ask you cried his father with renewed anger as another bottle burst at the moment what do you stand there for you lazy brat why dont you move i say  no no catching hold of him i believe you cannot move but i will make you and he shook him till lawrence was so giddy he could not stand what had you to think of what had you to do all day long that you could not carry my cider my worcestershire cider to the cellar when i bid you but go you will never be good for any thing you are such a lazy rascal  get out of my sight so saying he pushed him out of the house door and lawrence sneaked off seeing that this was no time to make his petition for halfpence  the next day he saw the nuts again and wishing for them more than ever went home in hopes that his father as he said to himself would be in a better humor but the cider was still fresh in his recollection and the moment lawrence began to whisper the word halfpenny in his ear his father swore with a loud oath i will not give you a halfpenny no not a farthing for a month to come if you want money go work for it i have had enough of your laziness  go work at these terrible words lawrence burst into tears and going to the side of a ditch sat down and cried for an hour and when he had cried till he could cry no more he exerted himself so far as to empty his pockets to see whether there might not happen to be one halfpenny left and to his great joy in the farthest corner of his pocket one halfpenny was found with this he proceeded to the fruit womans stall she was busy weighing out some plums so he was obliged to wait and whilst he was waiting he heard some people near him talking and laughing very loud the fruit womans stall was at the gate of an innyard and peeping through the gate in this yard lawrence saw a postilion and a stableboy about his own size playing at pitchfarthing he stood by watching them for a few minutes i begun but with one halfpenny cried the stableboy with an oath and now i have got twopence added he jingling the halfpence in his waistcoat pocket lawrence was moved at the sound and said to himself if i begin with one halfpenny i may end like him with having twopence and it is easier to play at pitchfarthing than to work  so he stepped forward presenting his halfpenny offering to toss up with the stableboy who after looking him full in the face accepted the proposal and threw his halfpenny into the air head or tail cried he head replied lawrence and it came up head he seized the penny surprised at his own success and would have gone instantly to have laid it out in nuts but the stableboy stopped him and tempted him to throw again this time he lost he threw again and won and so he went on sometimes losing but most frequently winning till half the morning was gone at last however he chanced to win twice running and finding himself master of three halfpence said he would play no more the stableboy grumbling swore he would have his revenge another time and lawrence went and bought the nuts it is a good thing said he to himself to play at pitchfarthing the next time i want a halfpenny i will not ask my father for it nor go to work neither satisfied with this resolution he sat down to crack his nuts at his leisure upon the horseblock in the innyard here whilst he eat he overheard the conversation of the stableboys and postilions at first their shocking oaths and loud wrangling frightened and shocked him for lawrence though a lazy had not yet learned to be a wicked boy but by degrees he was accustomed to their swearing and quarrelling and took a delight and interest in their disputes and battles as this was an amusement which he could enjoy without any sort of exertion on his part he soon grew so fond of it that every day he returned to the stableyard and the horseblock became his constant seat here he sound some relief from the insupportable fatigue of doing nothing and here hour after hour with his elbows on his knees and his head on his hands he sat the spectator of wickedness gaming cheating and lying soon became familiar to him and to complete his ruin he formed a sudden and close intimacy with the stableboy with whom he had first began to game  a very bad boy the consequences of this intimacy we shall presently see but it is now time to inquire what little jem has been doing all this while  one day after he had finished his task the gardener asked him to stay a little while to help him to carry some geranium pots into the hall jem always active and obliging readily stayed from play and was carrying in a heavy flowerpot when his mistress crossed the hll what a terrible litter said the you are making here  why dont you wipe your shoes upon the mat jem turned round to look for the mat but he saw none oh said the lady recollecting herself i cannot blame you for there is no mat  no maam said the gardener nor i dont know when if ever the man will bring home those mats you bespoke maam  i am very sorry to hear that said the lady i wish we could find somebody who would do them if he cannot  i should not care what sort of mats they were so that one could wipe ones feet on them jem as he was sweeping away the litter when he heard these last words said to himself perhaps i could make a mat and all the way home as he trudged along whistling he was thinking over a scheme for making mats which however bold it may appear he did not despair of executing with patience and industry many were the difficulties which his prophetic eye foresaw but he felt within himself that spirit which spurs men on to great enterprises and makes them trample on impossibilities  he recollected in the first place that he had seen lacy lawrence whilst he lounged upon the gate twist a bit of heath into different shapes and he thought that if he could find some way of plaiting heath firmly together it would make a very pretty green soft mat which would do very well for one to wipe ones shoes on about a mile from his mothers house on the common which jem rode over when he went to farmer trucks for the giantstrawberries he remembered to have seen a great quantity of this heath and as it was now only six oclock in the evening he knew that he should have time to feed lightfoot stroke him go to the common return and make one trial of his skill before he went to bed  lightfoot carried him swiftly to the common and there jem gathered as much of the heath as he thought he should want but what toil what time what pains did it cost him before he could make any thing like a mat twenty times he was ready to throw aside the heath and give up his project from impatience of repeated disappointments but still he persevered nothing truly great can be accomplished without toil and time two hours he worked before he went to bed all his play hours the next day he spent at his mat which in all made five hours of fruitless attempts  the sixth however repaid him for the labors of the other five he conquered his grand difficulty of fastening the heath substantially together and at length completely finished a mat which far surpassed his most sanguine expectations he was extremely happy  sung danced round it  whistled  looked at it again and again and could hardly leave off looking at it when it was time to go to bed he laid it by his bedside that he might see it the moment he wakened in the morning  and now came the grand pleasure of carrying it to his mistress she looked full as much surprised as he expected when she saw it and when she heard who made it after having duly admired it she asked him how much he expected for his mat expect  nothing maam said jem i meant to give it you if you would have it i did not mean to sell it i made it at my play hours and i was very happy making it and i am very glad too that you like it and if you please to keep it maam  that is all  but that is not all said the lady spend your time no more in weeding in my garden you can employ yourself much better you shall have the reward of your ingenuity as well as of your industry make as many more such mats as you can and i will take care and dispose of them for you  thanke maam said jem making his best bow for he thought by the ladys looks that she meant to do him a favor though he repeated to himself dispose of them what does that mean  the next day he went to work to make more mats and he soon learned to make them so well and quickly that he was surprised at his own success in every one he made he found less difficulty so that instead of making two he could soon make sour in a day in a fortnight he made eighteen it was saturday night when he finished and he carried at three journeys his eighteen mats to his mistresss house piled them all up in the hall and stood with his hat off with a look of proud humility beside the pile waiting for his mistresss appearance presently a folding door at one end of the hall opened and he saw his mistress with a great many gentlemen and ladies rising from several tables  oh there is my little boy and his mats cried the lady and followed by all the rest of the company she came into the hall jem modestly retired whilst they looked at his mats but in a minute or two his mistress beckoned to him and when he came into the middle of the circle he saw that his pile of mats had disappeared well said the lady smiling what do you see that makes you look so surprised  that all my mats are gone said jem but you are very welcome  are we said the lady well take up your hat and go home then for you see that it is getting late and you know lightfoot will wonder what is become of you jem turned round to take up his hat which he had left on the floor  but how his countenance changed the hat was heavy with shillings every one who had taken a mat had put in two shillings so that for the eighteen mats he had got thirtysix shillings thirtysix shillings said the lady five and sevenpence i think you told me you had earned already  how much does that make i must add i believe one other sixpence to make out your two guineas  two guineas exclaimed jem now quite conquering his bashfulness for at the moment he forgot where he was and saw nobody that was by two guineas cried he clapping his hands together  oh lightfoot  oh mother then recollecting himself he saw his mistress whom he now looked up to quite as a friend will you thank them all said he scarcely daring to glance his eye round upon the company will you thank em for you know i dont know how to thank em rightly every body thought however that they had been thanked rightly  now we will not keep you any longeronly said his mistress i have one thing to ask you that i may be by when you show your treasure to your mother  come then said jem come with me now  not now said the lady laughing but i will come to ashton tomorrow evening perhaps your mother can find me a few strawherries  that she will said jem i will search the garden myself he now went home but felt it a great restraint to wait till tomorrow evening before he told his mother to console himself he flew to the stable lightfoot youre not to be sold tomorrow poor fellow said he patting him and then could not refrain from counting out his money whilst he was intent upon this jem was startled by a noise at the door somebody was trying to pull up the latch it opened and there came in lazy lawrence with a boy in a red jacket who had a cock under his arm they started when they got into the middle of the stable and when they saw jem who had been at first hidden by the horse  we  we  we came  stammered lazy lawrence  i mean i came to  to  to   to ask you continued the stableboy in a bold tone whether you will go with us to the cockfight on monday see i have a fine cock here and lawrence told me you were a great friend of his so i came  lawrence now attempted to say something in praise of the pleasures of cockfighting and in recommendation of his new companion but jem looked at the stableboy with dislike and a sort of dread then turning his eyes upon the cock with a look of compassion said in a low voice to lawrence shall you like to stand by and see its eyes pecked out  i dont know said lawrence as to that but they say a cockfights a fine fight and it is no more cruel in me to go than another and a great many go and i have nothing else to do so i shall go  but i have something else to do said jem laughing so i shall not go  but continued lawrence you know monday is the great bristol fair and one must be merry then of all days in the year  one day in the year sure there is no harm in being merry said the stableboy i hope not said jem for i know for my part i am merry every day in the year  that is very odd said lawrence but i know for my part i would not for all the world miss going to the fair for at least it will be something to talk of for half a year after  come you will go will not you  no said jem still looking as if he did not like to talk before the illlooking stranger then what will you do with all your money  i will tell you about that another time whispered jem and dont you go to see that cocks eyes pecked out it will not make you merry i am sure  if i had any thing else to divert me said lawrence hesitating and yawning  come cried the stableboy seizing his stretching arm come along cried he and pulling him away from jem upon whom he cast a look of extreme contempt leave him alone he is not the sort  what a sool you are said he to lawrence the moment he got him out of the stable you might have known he would not go  else we should soon have trimmed him out of his four and sevenpence but how came you to talk of four and sevenpence i saw in the manger a hat full of silver  indeed exclaimed lawrence yes indeed  but why did you stammer so when we first got in you had like to have blown us all up  i was so ashamed said lawrence hanging down his head ashamed but you must not talk of shame now you are in for it and i shall not let you off you owe us half a crown recollect and i must be paid tonight so see and get the money some how or other after a considerable pause he added i will answer for it he would never miss half a crown out of all that silver  but to steal said lawrence drawing back with horror  i never thought i should come to that  and from poor jem too  the money that he has worked so hard for too  but it is not stealing we dont mean to steal only to borrow it and if we win as we certainly shall at the cockfight pay it back again and he will never know any thing of the matter and what harm will it do him besides what signifies talking you cannot go to the cockfight or the fair either if you dont and i tell ye we dont mean to steal it well pay it again monday night lawrence made no reply and they parted without his coming to any determination  here let us pause in our story  we are almost afraid to go on  the rest is very shocking  our little readers will shudder as they read but it is better that they should know the truth and see what the idle boy came to at last  in the dead of the night lawrence heard somebody tap at his window he knew well who it was for this was the signal agreed upon between him and his wicked companion he trembled at the thoughts of what he was about to do and lay quite still with his head under the bedclothes till he heard the second tap then he got up dressed himself and opened his window it was almost even with the ground his companion said to him in a hollow voice are you ready he made no answer but got out of the window and followed when he got to the stable a black cloud was just passing over the moon and it was quite dark where are you whispered lawrence groping about where are you speak to me  i am here give me your hand lawrence stretched out his hand is that your hand said the wicked boy as lawrence laid hold of him how cold it felt  let us go back said lawrence it is time yet  it is no time to go back replied the other opening the door you have gone too far now to go back and he pushed lawrence into the stable  have you found it  take care of the horse  have you done  what are you about  make haste i hear a noise said the stableboy who watched at the door i am feeling for the half crown but i cannot find it  bring all together he brought jems broken flowerpot with all the money in it to the door  the black cloud was now passed over the moon and the light shone full upon them  what do we stand here for said the stableboy snatching the flowerpot out of lawrences trembling hands and pulled him away from the door good god cried lawrence you will not take all  you said you would only take half a crown and pay it back on monday  you said you would only take half a crown  hold your tongue replied the other walking on deaf to all remonstrances  if i am to be hanged ever it shant be for half a crown lawrences blood ran cold in his veins and he felt as if all his hair stood on end not another word passed his accomplice carried off the money and lawrence crept with all the horrors of guilt upon him to his restless bed all nigh he was starting from frightful dreams or else broad awake he lay listening to every small noise unable to stir and scarcely daring to breathe  tormented by that most dreadful of all kinds of fear that fear which is the constant companion of an evil conscience he thought the morning would never come but when it was day when he heard the birds sing and saw every thing look cheerful as usual he selt still more miscrable it was sunday morning and the bell rang for church all the children of the village dressed in their sunday clothes innocent and gay and little jem the best and gayest amongst them went flocking by his door to church well lawrence said jem pulling his coat as he passed and saw lawrence leaning against his fathers door what makes you look so black  i said lawrence starting why do you say that i look black  nay then said jem you look white enough now if that will please you for youre turned as pale as death  pale replied lawrence not knowing what he said and turned abruptly away for he dared not stand another look of jems conscious that guilt was written in his sace he shunned every eye he would now have given the world to have thrown off the load of guilt which lay upon his mind he longed to follow jem to fall upon his knees and confess all dreading the moment when jem should discover his loss lawrence dared not stay at home and not knowing what to do or where to go he mechanically went to his old haunt at the stableyard and lurked thereabouts all day with his accomplice who tried in vain to quiet his fears and raise his spirits by talking of the next days cockfight it was agreed that as soon as the dusk of the evening came on they should go together into a certain lonely field and there divide their booty  in the mean time jem when he returned from church was very full of business preparing for the reception of his mistress of whose intended visit he had informed his mother and whilst she was arranging the kitchen and their little parlour he ran to search the strawberrybeds why my jem how merry you are today said his mother when he came in with the strawberries and was jumping about the room playfully now keep those spirits of yours jem till you want em and dont let it come upon you all at once have it in mind that tomorrows fair day and lightfoot must go i bid farmer truck call for him tonight he said he would take him along with his own and he will be here just now  and then i know how it will he with you jem  so do i cried jem swallowing his secret with great difficulty and then tumbling head over heels four times running a carriage passed the window and stopped at the door jem ran out it was his mistress she came in smiling and soon made the old woman smile too by praising the neatness of every thing in the house but we shall pass over however important they were deemed at the time the praises of the strawberries and of my grandmothers china plate another knock was heard at the door run jem said his mother i hope it is our milkwoman with cream for the lady no it was farmer truck come for lightfoot the old womans countenance fell fetch him out dear said she turning to her son but jem was gone he flew out to the stable the moment he saw the flap of farmer trucks greatcoat sit ye down farmer said the old woman after they had waited about five minutes in expectation of jems return you would best sit down if the lady will give you leave for he will not hurry himself back again my boys a fool madam about that there horse trying to laugh she added i knew how lightfoot and he would be loath enough to part  he will not bring him out till the last minute so do sit ye down neighbor the sarmer had scarcely sat down when jem with a pale wild countenance came back what is the matter said his mistress god bless the boy said his mother looking at him quite frightened whilst he tried to speak but could not she went up to him and then leanng his head against her he cried it is gone  it is all gone and bursting into tears he sobbed as if his little heart would break what is gone love said his mother my two guineas  lightfoots two guineas i went to fetch em to give you mammy but the broken flowerpot that i put them in and all is gone  quite gone repeated he checking his sobs i saw them safe last night and was showing em to lightfoot and i was so glad to think i had earned them all myself and i thought how surprised you would look and how glad you would be and how you would kiss me and all  his mother listened to him with the greatest surprise whilst his mistress stood in silence looking first at the old woman and then at jem with a penetrating eye as if she suspected the truth of his story and was afraid of becoming the dupe of her own compassion this is a very strange thing said she gravely how came you to leave all your money in a broken flowerpot in the stable how came you not to give it to your mother to take care of  why dont you remember said jem looking up in the midst of his tears why dont you remember you your own self bid me not tell her about it till you were by  and did you not tell her  nay ask mammy said jem a little offended and when afterward the lady went on questioning him in a severe manner as if she did not believe him he at last made no answer oh jem jem why dont you speak to the lady said his mother i have spoke and spoke the truth said jem proudly and she did not believe me  still the lady who had lived too long in the world to be without suspicion maintained a cold manner and determined to wait the event without interfering saying only that she hoped the money would be found and advised jem to have done crying i have done said jem i shall cry no more and as he had the greatest command over himself he actually did not shed another tear not even when the farmer got up to go saying he could wait no longer jem silently went to bring out lightfoot  the lady now took her seat where she could see all that passed at the open parlour window  the old woman stood at the door and several idle people of the village who had gathered round the ladys carriage examining it turned about to listen in a minute or two jem appeared with a steady countenance leading lightfoot and when he came up without saying a word put the bridle into farmer trucks hand he has been a good horse said the farmer he is a good horse cried jem and threw his arm over lightfoots neck hiding his own face as he leaned upon him  at this instant a party of milkwomen went by and one of them having set down her pail came behind jem and gave him a pretty smart blow upon the back  he looked up  and dont you know me said she i forget said jem i think i have seen your face before but i forget  do you so and you will tell me just now said she half opening her hand that you forget who gave you this and who charged you not to part with it too here she quite opened her large hand and on the palm of it appeared jems silver penny where exclaimed jem seizing it oh where did you find it and have you  oh tell me have you got the rest of my money  i know nothing of your money  i dont know what you would be at said the milkwoman but where pray tell me where did you find this  with them that you gave it to i suppose said the milkwoman turning away suddenly to take up her milkpail but now jems mistress called to her through the window begging her to stop and joining in his entreaties to know how she came by the silver penny  why madam said she taking up the corner of her apron i came by it in an odd way too  you must know my betty is sick so i come with the milk myself though it is not what i am used to for my betty  you know my betty said she turning round to the old woman my betty serves you and she is a tight and stirring lassy maam i can assure   yes i dont doubt it said the lady impatiently but about the silver penny  why that is true as i was coming along all alone for the rest came round and i came a short cut across yon field  no you cannot see it madam where you stand  but if you were here   i see it  i know it said jem out of breath with anxiety well  well  i rested my pail upon the style and sets me down awhile and there comes out of the hedge  i dont know well how for they startled me so i would like to have thrown down my milk  two boys one about the size of he said she pointing to jem and one a matter taller but illlooking like so i did not think to stir to make way for them and they were like in a desperate hurry so without waiting for the style one of em pulled at the gate and when it would not open for it was tied with a pretty stout cord one of em whips out with his knife and cuts it   now have you a knife about you sir continued the milkwoman to the farmer he gave her his knife  here now maam just sticking as it were here between the blade and the haft was the filver penny he took no notice but when he opened it out it falls still he takes no heed but cuts the cord as i said before and through the gate they went and out of sight in half a minute i picks up the penny for my heart misgave me that it was the very one husband had had a long time and had given against my voice to he pointing to jem and i charged him not to part with it and maam when i looked i knew it by the mark so i thought i would show it to he again pointing to jem and let him give it back to those it belongs to  it belongs to me said jem i never gave it to any body  but   but cried the farmer those boys have robbed him  it is they who have all his money  oh which way did they go cried jem i will run after them  no no said the lady calling to her servant and she desired him to take his horse and ride after them aye added farmer truck do you take the road and i will take the fieldway and i will be bound well have em presently  whilst they were gone in pursuit of the thieves the lady who was now thoroughly convinced of jems truth desired her coachman would produce what she had ordered him to bring with him that evening out of the boot of the carriage the coachman immediately produced a new saddle and bridle  how jems eyes sparkled when the saddle was thrown upon lightfoots back put it on your horse yourself jem said the lady  it is yours  consused reports of lightfoots splendid accoutrements of the pursuit of thieves and of the fine and generous lady who was standing at dame prestons window quickly spread through the village and drew every body from their houses they crowded round jem to hear the story the children especially who were all fond of him expressed the strongest indignation against the thieves every eye was on the stretch and now some who had run down the lane came back shouting here they are they have got the thieves  the footman on horseback carried one boy before him and the farmer striding along dragged another the latter had on a red jacket which little jem immediately recollected and scarcely dared lift his eyes to look at the boy on horseback good god said he to himself it must be  yet surely it cannot be lawrence the footman rode on as fast as the people would let him the boys hat was flouched and his head hung down so that nobody could see his face  at this instant there was a disturbance in the crowd a man who was half drunk pushed his way forwards swearing that nobody should stop him that he had a right to see and he would see and so he did for forcing through all resistance he staggered up to the footman just as he was lifting down the boy he had carried before him i will  i tell you i will see the thief cried the drunken man pushing up the boys hat  it was his own son  lawrence exclaimed the wretched father the shock sobered him at once and he hid his face in his hands  there was an awful silence lawrence fell on his knees and in a voice that could scarcely be heard made a full confession of all the circumstances of his guilt such a young creature so wicked what could put such wickedness into your head  bad company said lawrence and how came you  what brought you into bad company  i dont know  except it was idleness while this was saying the farmer was emptying lazy lawrences pockets and when the money appeared all his former companions in the village looked at each other with astonishment and terror their parents grasped their little hands closer and cried thank god he is not my son  how often when he was little we used as he lounged about to tell him that idleness was the root of all evil  as for the hardened wretch his accomplice every one was impatient to have him sent to gaol he had put on a bold insolent countenance till he heard lawrences confession till the money was found upon him and he heard the milkwoman declare that she would swear to the silver penny which he had dropped then he turned pale and betrayed the strongest signs of fear we must take him before the justice said the farmer and he will be lodged in bristol gaol oh said jem springing forwards when lawrences hands were going to be tied let him go  will not you  cannot you let him go  yes madam for mercys sake said jems mother to the lady think what a disgrace to his family to be sent to gaol his father stood by wringing his hands in an agony of despair it is all my fault cried he i brought him up in idleness  but he will never be idle any more said jem will not you speak for him maam  dont ask the lady to speak for him said the farmer it is better he should go to bridewell now than to the gallows by and by  nothing more was said for every body felt the truth of the farmers speech lawrence was sent to bridewell for a month and the stableboy was transported to botany bay  during lawrences confinement jem often visited him and carried him such little presents as he could afford to give and jem could afford to be generous because he was industrious lawrences heart was touched by his kindness and his example struck him so forcibly that when his confinement was ended he resolved to set immediately to work and to the astonishment of all who knew him soon became remarkable for industry he was found early and late at his work established a new character and for ever lost the name of lazy lawrence  the false key mr spencer a very benevolent and sensible man undertook the education of several poor children amongst the rest was a boy of the name of franklin whom he had bred up from the time he was five years old franklin had the misfortune to be the son of a man of infamous character and for many years this was a disgrace and reproach to his child when any of the neighbors children quarrelled with him they used to tell him he would turn out like his father but mr spencer always assured him that he might make himself whatever he pleased that by behaving well he would certainly sooner or later secure the esteem and love of all who knew him even of those who had the strongest prejudice against him on his fathers account  this hope was very delightful to franklin and he showed the strongest desire to learn and to do every thing that was right so that mr spencer soon grew fond of him and took great pains to instruct him and to give him all the good habits and principles which might make him a useful respectable and happy man  when he was about thirteen years of age mr spencer one day sent for him into his closet and as he was folding up a letter which he had been writing said to him with a very kind look but in a graver tone than usual franklin you are going to leave me  sir said franklin you are now going to leave me and to begin the world for yourself you will carry this letter to my sister mrs churchill in queens square  you know queens square franklin bowed you must expect continued mr spencer to meet with several disagreeable things and a great deal of rough work at your first setting out but be faithful and obedient to your mistress and obliging to your fellow servants and all will go well mrs churchill will make you a very good mistress if you behave properly and i have no doubt but you will  thank you sir  and you will always i mean as long as you deserve it find a friend in me  thank you sir  i am sure you are   there franklin stopped short for the recollection of all mr spencers goodness rushed upon him at once and he could not say another word bring me a candle to seal this letter said his master and he was very glad to get out of the room he came back with the candle and with a stout heart stood by whilst the letter was sealing and when his master put it into his hand said in a cheerful voice i hope you will let me see you again sir sometimes  certainly whenever your mistress can spare you i shall be very glad to see you and remember if ever you get into any difficulty dont be afraid to come to me i have sometimes spoken harshly to you but you will not meet with a more indulgent friend franklin at this turned away with a full heart and after making two or three attempts to express his gratitude left the room without being able to speak  he got to queens square about three oclock the door was opened by a large redfaced man in a blue coat and scarlet waistcoat to whom he felt afraid to give his message lest he should not be a servant well what is your business sir said the butler i have a letter for mrs churchill sir said franklin endeavoring to pronounce his sir in a tone as respectful as the butlers was insolent the man having examined the direction seal and edges of the letter carried it up stairs and in a few minutes returned and ordered franklin to rub his shoes well and follow him he was then shown into a handsome room where he found his mistress an elderly lady she asked him a few questions examining him attentively as she spoke and her severe eye at first and her gracious smile afterward made him feel that she was a person to be both loved and feared i shall give you in charge said she ringing a bell to my housekeeper and i hope she will have no reason to be displeased with you  the housekeeper when she first came in appeared with a smiling countenance but the moment she cast her eyes on franklin it changed to a look of surprise and suspicion her mistress recommended him to her protection saying pomfret i hope you will keep this boy under your own eye and she received him with a cold very well maam which plainly showed she was not disposed to like him in fact mrs pomfret was a woman so fond of power and so jealous of favor that she would have quarrelled with an angel who had got so near her mistress without her introduction she smothered her displeasure however till night when as she attended her mistress toilette she could not refrain from expressing her sentiments she began cautiously maam is not this the boy mr spencer was talking of one day  that has been brought up by the villaintropic society i think they call it  philanthropic society yes and my brother gives him a high character i hope he will do very well  i am sure i hope so too but i cannot say for my part i have no great notion of those low people they say all those children are taken from the very lowest drugs and refugees of the town and surely they are like enough maam to take after their own fathers and mothers  but they are not suffered to be with their parents and therefore cannot be hurt by their example this little boy to be sure was unfortunate in his father but he has had an excellent education  oh edication to be sure maam i know  i dont say but what edication is a great thing but then maam edication cannot change the nature that is in one they say and one that is born naturally bad and low they say all the edication in the world will not do no good and for my part maam i know you knows best but i should be afraid to let any of those villaintropic folks get into my house for nobody can tell the nature of them aforehand i declare it frights me  pomfret i thought you had better sense how would this poor boy earn his bread he would be forced to starve or steal if every body had such prejudices pomfret who really was a good woman was softened at this idea and said god forbid he should starve or steal and god forbid i should say any thing prejudiciary of the boy for there may be no harm in him  well said mrs churchill changing her tone but pomfret if we dont like the boy at the end of a month we have done with him for i have only promised mr spencer to keep him a month upon trial  there is no harm done  dear no maam to be sure  and cook must put up with her disappointment that is all  what disappointment  about her nephew maam the boy she and i was speaking to you for  when  the day you called her up about the almond pudding maam if you remember you said you should have no objections to try the boy and upon that cook bought him new shirts but they are to the good as i tell her  but i did not promise to take her nephew  oh no maam not at all she does not think to say that else i should be very angry but the poor woman never let fall a word any more than frets that the boy should miss such a good place  well but since i did say that i should have no objection to try him i shall keep my word let him come tomorrow let them both have a fair trial and at the end of the month i can decide which i like best and which we have better keep  dismissed with these orders mrs pomfret hastened to report all that had passed to the cook like a favorite minister proud to display the extent of her secret influence in the morning felix the cooks nephew arrived and the moment he came into the kitchen every eye even the scullions was fixed upon him with approbation and afterward glanced upon franklin with contempt  contempt which franklin could not endure without some confusion though quite unconscious of having deserved it nor upon the most impartial and cool selfexamination could be comprehend the justice of his judges he perceived indeed for the comparisons were minutely made in audible and scornful whispers that felix was a much handsomer or as the kitchenmaid expressed it a much more genteeler gentlemanlylooking like sort of person than he was and he was made to understand that he wanted a frill to his shirt a cravat a pair of thin shoes and above all shoestrings besides other nameless advantages which justly made his rival the admiration of the kitchen however upon calling to mind all that his friend mr spencer had ever said to him he could not recollect his having warned him that shoestrings were indispensable requisites to the character of a good servant so that he could only comfort himself with resolving if possible to make amends for these deficiencies and to dissipate the prejudices which he saw were formed against him by the strictest adherence to all that his tutor had taught him to be his duty he hoped to secure the approbation of his mistress by scrupulous obedience to all her commands and faithful care of all that belonged to her at the same time he flattered himself he should win the good will of his fellow servants by showing a constant desire to oblige them he pursued this plan of conduct steadily for nearly three weeks and found that he succeeded beyond his expectations in pleasing his mistress but unfortunately he found it more difficult to please his fellow servants and he sometimes offended when he least expected it  he had made great progress in the affections of corkscrew the butler by working indeed very hard for him and doing every day at least half his business but one unfortunate night the butler was gone out  the bell rang  he went up stairs and his mistress asking where corkscrew was he answered that he was gone out where to said his mistress i dont know answered franklin and as he had told exactly the truth and meant to do no harm he was surprised at the butlers return when he repeated to him what had passed to receive a sudden box on the ear and the appellation of a mischievous impertinent meanspirited brat mischievous impertinent mean repeated franklin to himself but looking in the butlers face which was of a deeper scarlet than usual he judged that he was far from sober and did not doubt but that the next morning when he came to the use of his reason he would be sensible of his injustice and apologize for this box of the ear but no apology coming all day franklin at last ventured to request an explanation or rather to ask what he had best do on the next occasion why said corkscrew when mistress asked for me how came you to say i was gone out  because you know i saw you go out  and when she asked you where i was gone how came you to say that you did not know  because indeed i did not  you are a stupid blockhead could not you say i was gone to the washerwomans  but were you said franklin was i cried corkscrew and looked as if he would have struck him again how dare you give me the lie  mr hypocrite you would be ready enough i will be bound to make excuses for yourself  why are not mistresss clogs cleaned go along and blacken em this minute and send felix to me  from this time forward felix alone was privileged to enter the butlers pantry felix became the favorite of corkscrew and though franklin by no means sought to pry into the mysteries of their private conferences nor ever entered without knocking at the door yet it was his fate once to be sent of a message at an unluckly time and as the door was half open he could not avoid seeing felix drinking a bumper of red liquor which he could not help suspecting to be wine and as the decanter which usually went up stairs after dinner was at this time in the butlers grasp without any stopper in it he was involuntarily forced to suspect they were drinking his mistresss wine  nor were the bumpers of port of the only unlawful rewards which felix received his aunt the cook had occasion for his assistance and she had many delicious douceurs in her gift many a handful of currants many a half custard many a triangular remnant of pie besides the choice of his own meal at breakfast dinner and supper fli to the share of the favorite felix whilst franklin was neglected though he took the utmost pains to please the cook in all honorable service and when she was hot angry or hurried he was always at hand to help her and in the hour of adversity when the clock struck five and no dinner was dished and no kitchen maid with twenty pair of hands was to be had franklin would answer to her call with flowers to garnish her dishes and presence of mind to know in the midst of the commotion where every thing that was wanting was to be found so that quick as lightning all difficulties vanished before him yet when the danger was over and the hour of adversity passed the ungrateful cook would forget her benefactor and when it came to be his supper time would throw him with a carelessness which touched him sensibly any thing which the other servants were too nice to eat all this franklin bore with fortitude nor did he envy felix the dainties which he eat sometimes close beside him for said he to himself i have a clear conscience and that is more than felix can have i know how he wins cooks favor too well and i fancy i know how i have offended her for since the day i saw the basket she has done nothing but huff me  the history of the basket was this mrs pomfret the housekeeper had several times directly and indirectly given the world below to understand that she and her mistress thought there was a prodigious quantity of meat eaten of late now when she spoke it was usually at dinnertime she always looked or franklin imagined that she looked suspiciously at him other people looked still more maliciously but as he felt himself perfectly innocent he went on eating his dinner in silence but at length it was time to explain one sunday there appeared a handsome sirloin of beef which before noon on monday had shrunk almost to the bare bone and presented such a deplorable spectacle to the opening eyes of mrs pomfret that her long smothered indignation burst forth and she boldly declared she was now certain there had been foul play and she would have the beef found or she would know why she spoke but no beef appeared till franklin with a look of sudden recollection cried did not i see something like a piece of beef in a basket in the dairy  i think   the cook as if somebody had smote her a deadly blow grew pale but suddenly recovering the use of her speech turned upon franklin and with a voice of thunder gave him the lie direct and forthwith taking mrs pomfret by the ruffle led the way to the dairy declaring she could defy the world  that so she could and would  there maam said she kicking an empty basket which lay on the floor  there is malice for you  ask him why he dont show you the beef in the basket  i thought i saw   poor franklin began you thought you saw cried the cook coming close up to him with kimboed arms and looking like a dragon  and pray sir what business have such a one as you to think you see  and pray maam will you be pleased to speak  perhaps maam he will condescend to obey you  maam will you be pleased to forbid him my dairy  for here he comes prying and spying about  and how maam am i to answer for my butter and cream or any thing at all  i am sure it is what i cannot pretend to unless you do me the justice to forbid him my places  mrs pomfret whose eyes were blinded by her prejudices against the folks of the villaintropic society and also by her secret jealously of a boy whom she deemed to be a growing favorite of her mistresss took part with the cook and ended as she began with a firm persuasion that franklin was the guilty person let him alone let him alone said she he has as many turns and windings as a hare but we shall catch him yet i will be bound in some of his doublings i knew the nature of him well enough from the first time i ever set my eyes upon him but mistress shall have her own way and see the end of it these words and the bitter sense of injustice drew tears at length fast down the proud cheek of franklin which might possibly have touched mrs pomfret if felix with a sneer had not called them crocodile tears felix too thought he this is too much in fact felix had till now professed himself his firm ally and had on his part received from franklin unequivocal proofs of friendship for it must be told that every other morning when it was felixs turn to get breakfast felix never was up in decent time and must inevitably have come to public disgrace if franklin had not got all the breakfast things ready for him the bread and butter spread and the toast toasted and had not moreover regularly when the clock struck eight and mrs pomfrets foot was heard overhead ran to call the sleeping felix and helped him constantly through the hurry of getting dressed one instant before the housekeeper came down stairs all this could not but be present to his memory but scorning to reproach him franklin wiped away his crocodile tears and preserved a magnanimous silence  the hour of retribution was however not so far off as felix imagined cunning people may go on cleverly in their devices for some time but though they may escape once twice perhaps ninetynine times what does that signify for the hundredth they come to shame and lose all their character grown bold by frequent success felix became more careless in his operations and it happened that one day he met his mistress full in the passage as he was going on one of the cooks secret errands where are you going felix said his mistress to the washerwomans maam answered he with his usual effrontery very well said she call at the booksellers in  stay i must write down the direction  pomfret said she opening the housekeepers room door have you a bit of paper pomfret came with the writingpaper and looked very angry to see that felix was going out without her knowledge so while mrs churchill was writing the direction she stood talking to him about it whilst he in the greatest terror imaginable looked up in her face as she spoke but was all the time intent upon parrying on the other side the attacks of a little french dog of his mistress which unluckily for him had followed her into the passage manchon was extremely fond of felix who by way of pleasing his mistress had paid most assiduous court to her dog yet now his caresses were rather troublesome manchon leaped up and was not to be rebuffed poor fellow poor fellow  down down poor fellow cried felix and put him away but manchon leaped up again and began smelling near the fatal pocket in a most alarming manner you will see by this direction where you are to go said his mistress manchon come here  and you will be so good as to bring me  down down manchon be quiet but manchon knew better he had now got his head into felixs pocket and would not be quiet till he had drawn from thence rustling out of its brown paper half a cold turkey which had been missing since morning my cold turkey as i am alive exclaimed the housekeeper darting upon it with horror and amazement what is all this said mrs churchill in a composed voice i dont know maam answered felix so confused that he knew not what to say  but   but what cried mrs pomfret indignation flashing from her eyes but what repeated his mistress waiting for his reply with a calm air of attention which still more disconcerted felix for though with an angry person he might have some chance of escape he knew that he could not invent any excuse in such circumstances which could stand the examination of a person in her sober senses he was struck dumb speak said mrs churchill in a still lower tone i am ready to hear all you have to say in my house every body shall have justice  speak  but what  but stammered felix and after in vain attempting to equivocate confessed that he was going to take the turkey to his cousins but he threw all the blame upon his aunt the cook who he said had ordered him upon this expedition the cook was now summoned but she totally denied all knowledge of the affair with the same violence with which she had lately confounded franklin about the beef in the basket not entirely however with the same success for felix perceiving by his mistress eye that she was upon the point of desiring him to leave the house immediately and not being very willing to leave a place in which he had lived so well with the butler did not hesitate to confront his aunt with assurance equal to her own he knew how to bring his charge home to her he produced a note in her own handwriting the purport of which was to request her cousins acceptance of some delicate cold turkey and to beg she would send her by the return of the bearer a little of her cherrybrandy  mrs churchill coolly wrote upon the back of the note her cooks discharge and informed felix she had no further occasion for his services but upon his pleading with many tears which franklin did not call crocodile tears that he was so young and that he was under the dominion of his aunt he touched mrs pomfrets compassion and she obtained for him permission to stay till the end of the month to give him yet a chance of redeeming his character  mrs pomfret now seeing how far she had been imposed upon resolved for the future to be more upon her guard with felix and felt that she had treated franklin with great injustice when she accused him of malpractices about the sirloin of beef good people when they are made sensible that they have treated any one with injustice are impatient to have an opportunity to rectify their mistake and mrs pomfret was now prepared to see every thing which franklin did in the most favorable point of view especially as the next day she discovered that it was he who every morning boiled the water for her tea and buttered her toast services for which she had always thought she was indebted to felix besides she had rated felixs abilities very highly because he made up her weekly accounts for her but unluckily once when franklin was out of the way and she brought a bill in a hurry to her favorite to cast up she discovered that he did not know how to cast up pounds shillings and pence and he was obliged to confess that he must wait till franklin came home  but passing over a number of small incidents which gradually unfolded the character of the two boys we must proceed to a more serious affair  corkscrew frequently after he had finished taking away supper and after the housekeeper was gone to bed sallied forth to a neighboring alehouse to drink with his friends the alehouse was kept by that cousin of felixs who was so fond of  delicate cold turkey and who had such choice cherrybrandy corkscrew kept the key of the house door so that he could return home at what hour he thought proper and if he should by accident be called for by his mistress after supper felix knew where to find him and did not scruple to make any of those excuses which poor franklin had too much integrity to use all these precautions taken the butler was at liberty to indulge his favorite passion which so increased with indulgence that his wages were by no means sufficient to support him in this way of life every day he felt less resolution to break through his bad habits for every day drinking become more necessary to him his health was ruined with a red pimpled bloated face emaciated legs and a swelled diseased body he appeared the victim of intoxication in the morning when he got up his hands trembled his spirits slagged he could do nothing till he had taken a dram an operation which he was obliged to repeat several times in the course of the day as all those wretched people must who once acquire this custom  he had run up a long bill at the alehouse which he frequented and the landlord who grew urgent for his money refused to give him further credit one night when corckscrew had drank enough only to make him fretful he leaned with his elbow surlily upon the table began to quarrel with the landlord and swore that he had not of late treated him like a gentleman to which the landlord coolly replied that as long as he had paid like a gentleman he had been treated like one and that was as much as any one could expect or at any rate as much as any one would meet with in this world for the truth of this assertion he appealed laughing to a party of men who were drinking in the room the men however took part with corkscrew and drawing him over to their table made him sit down with them they were in high good humor and the butler soon grew so intimate with them that in the openness of his heart he soon communicated to them not only all his own affairs but all that he knew and more than all that he knew of his mistresss  his new friends were by no means uninterested in his conversation and encouraged him as much as possible to talk for they had secret views which the butler was by no means sufficiently sober to discover mrs churchill had some fine old family plate and these men belonged to a gang of housebreakers before they parted with corkscrew they engaged him to meet them again the next night their intimacy was still more closely cemented one of the men actually offered to lend corkscrew three guineas toward the payment of his debt and hinted that if he thought proper he could easily get the whole cleared off upon this hint corkscrew be came all attention till after some hesitation on their part and repeated promises of secresy on his they at length disclosed their plans to him they gave him to understand that if he would assist in letting them into his mistress house they would let him have an ample share in the booty the butler who had the reputation of being an honest man and indeed whose integrity had hitherto been proof against every thing but his mistress port turned pale and trembled at this proposal drank two or three bumpers to drown thought and promised to give an answer the next day  he went home more than half intoxicated his mind was so full of what had passed that he could not help bragging to felix whom he found awake at his return that he could have his bill paid off at the alehouse whenever he pleased dropping besides some hints which were not lost upon felix in the morning felix reminded him of the things which he had said and corkscrew alarmed endeavored to evade his questions by saying that he was not in his senses when he talked in that manner nothing however that he could urge made any impression upon felix whose recollection on the subject was perfectly distinct and who had too much cunning himself and too little confidence in his companion to be the dupe of his dissimulation the butler knew not what to do when he saw that felix was absolutely determined either to betray their scheme or to become a sharer in the booty  the next night came and he was now to make a final decision either to determine on breaking off entirely with his new acquaintance or taking felix with him to join in the plot  his debt his love of drinking the impossibility of indulging it without a fresh supply of money all came into his mind at once and conquered his remaining scruples it is said by those whose fatal experience give them a right to be believed that a drunkard will sacrifice any thing every thing sooner than the pleasure of habitual intoxication  how much easier is it never to begin a bad custom than to break through it when once formed  the hour of rendezvous came and corkscrew went to the alehouse where he found the housebreakers waiting for him and a glass of brandy ready poured out he sighed  drank  hesitated  drank again  heard the landlord talk of his bill  saw the money produced which would pay it in a moment  drank again  cursed himself and giving his hand to the villain who was whispering in his ear swore that he could not help it and must do as they would have him they required of him to give up the key of the housedoor that they might get another made by it he had left it with felix and was now obliged to explain the new difficulty which had arisen felix knew enough to ruin them and must therefore be won over this was no very difficult task he had a strong desire to have some worked cravats and the butler knew enough of him to believe that this would be a sufficient bribe the cravats were bought and shown to felix he thought them the only things wanting to make him a complete fine gentleman and to go without them especially when he had once seen himself in the glass with one tied on in a splendid bow appeared impossible even this paltry temptation working upon his vanity at length prevailed with a boy whose integrity had long been corrupted by the habits of petty pilfering and daily falsehood it was agreed that the first time his mistress sent him out on a message he should carry the key of the house door to his cousins and deliver it into the hands of one of the gang who were there in waiting for it such was the scheme felix the night after all this had been planned went to bed and fell fast asleep but the butler who had not yet stifled the voice of conscience felt in the silence of the night so insupportably miserable that instead of going to rest he stole softly into the pantry for a bottle of his mistresss wine and there drinking glass after glass he stayed till he became so far intoxicated that though he contrived to find his way back to bed he could by no means undress himself without any power of recollection he flung himself upon the bed leaving his candle half hanging out of the candlestick beside him franklin slept in the next room to him and presently wakening thought he perceived a strong smell of something burning he jumped up and seeing a light under the butlers door gently opened it and to his astonishment beheld one of the bed curtains in flames he immediately ran to the butler and pulled him with all his force to rouse him from his lethargy he came to his senses at length but was so terrified and so helpless that if it had not been for franklin the whole house would soon inevitably have been on fire felix trembling and cowardly knew not what to do and it was curious to see him obeying franklin whose turn it was now to command franklin ran up stairs to waken mrs pomfret whose terror of fire was so great that she came from her room almost out of her senses whilst he with the greatest presence of mind recollected where he had seen two large tubs of water which the maids had prepared the night before for their washing and seizing the wet linen which had been left to soak threw them upon the flames he exerted himself with so much good sense that the fire was presently extinguished every thing was now once more safe and quiet mrs pomfret recovering from her fright postponed all enquiries till the morning and rejoiced that her mistress had not been wakened whilst corkscrew flattered himself that he should be able to conceal the true cause of the accident dont you tell mrs pomfret where you found the candle when you came into the room said he to franklin if she asks me you know i must tell the truth replied he must repeated felix sneeringly what you must be a telltale  no i never told any tales of any body and i should be very sorry to get any one into a scrape but for all that i shall not tell a lie either for myself or any body else let you call me what names you will  but if i were to give you something that you would like said corkscrew  something that i know you would like repeated felix nothing you can give me will do answered franklin steadily so it is useless to say any more about it  i hope i shall not be questioned in this hope he was mistaken for the first thing mrs pomfret did in the morning was to come into the butlers room to examine and deplore the burnt curtains whilst corkscrew stood by endeavoring to exculpate himself by all the excuses he could invent mrs pomfret however thought sometimes blinded by her prejudices was no fool and it was absolutely impossible to make her believe that a candle which had been left on the hearth where corkscrew protested he had left it could have set curtains on fire which were at least six foot distance turning short round to franklin she desired that he would show her where he found the candle when he came into the room he begged not to be questioned but she insisted he took up the candlestick but the moment the housekeeper cast her eye upon it she snatched it from his hands  how did this candlestick come here this was not the candlestick you found here last night cried she yes indeed it was answered franklin that is impossible retorted she vehemently for i left this candlestick with my own hands last night in the hall the last thing i did after you said she turning to the butler was gone to bed  i am sure of it  nay dont you recollect my taking this japanned candlestick out of your hand and making you go up to bed with the brass one and i bolted the door at the stair head after you  this was all very true but corkscrew had afterward gone down from his room by a bak staircase unbolted that door and upon his return from the alehouse had taken the japanned candlestick by mistake up stairs and had left the brass one in its stead upon the hall table  oh maam said felix indeed you forget for mr corkscrew came into my room to desire me to call him betimes in the morning and i happened to take particular notice and he had the japanned candlestick in his hand and that was just as i heard you bolting the door  indeed maam you forget  indeed sir retorted mrs pomfret rising in angr i do not forget i am not come to be supperannuated yet i hope  how do you dare to tell me i forget  oh maam cried felix i beg your pardon i did not  i did not mean to say you forgot  but only i thought perhaps you might not particularly remember for it you please to recollect   i will not please to recollect just whatever you please sir  hold your tongue  why should you poke yourself into this scrape  what have you to do with it i should be glad to know  nothing in the world oh nothing in the world i am sure i beg your pardon maam answered felix in a soft tone and sneaking off left his friend corkscrew to fight his own battle secretly resolving to desert in good time if he saw any danger of the alehouse transactions coming to light  corkscrew could make but very blundering excuses for himself and conscious of guilt he turned pale and appeared so much more terrified than butlers usually appear when detected in a lie that mrs pomfret resolved as she said to sift the matter to the bottom impatiently did she wait till the clock struck nine and her mistresss bell rang the signal for her attendance at her levee  how do you find yourself this morning maam said she undrawing the curtains very sleepy indeed answered her mistress in a drowsy voice i think i must sleep half an hour longer  shut the curtains  as you please maam but i suppose i had better open a little of the window shutter for it is past nine  but just struck  oh dear maam it struck before i came up stairs and you know we are twenty minutes slow  lord bless us exclaimed mrs pomfret as she let fall the bar of the window which roused her mistress  i am sure i beg pardon a thousand times  it is only the bar  because i had this great key in my hand  put down the key then or you will knock something else down and you may open the sthutters now for i am quite awake  dear me i am so sorry to think of disturbing you cried mrs pomfret at the same time throwing the shutters wide open but to be sure maam i have something to tell you which will not let you sleep again in a hurry i brought up this here key of the house door for reasons of my own which i am sure you will approve of  but i am not come to that part of my story yet  i hope you were not disturbed by the noise in the house last night maam  i heard no noise  i am surprised at that though continued mrs pomfret and now proceeded to give a most ample account of the fire of her fears and her suspicions  to be sure maam what i say is that without the spirit of prophecy one can no ways account for what has passed i am quite clear in my own judgment that mr corkscrew must have been out last night after i went to bed for besides the japanned candlestick which of itself i am sure is strong enough to hang a man there is another circumstance maam that certifies it to me  though i have not mentioned it maam to no one yet lowering her voice  franklin when i questioned him told me that he left the lantern in the outside porch in the court last night and this morning it was on the kitchen table now maam that lantern could not come without hands and i could not forget about that you know for franklin says he is sure he left the lantern out  and do you believe him  to be sure maam  how can i help believing him i never found him out in the least symptom of a lie since ever he came into the house so one cannot help believing in him like him or not  without meaning to tell a falsehood however he might make a mistake  no maam he never makes mistakes it is not his way to go gossipping and tattling he never tells any thing till he is asked and then it is fit he should about the sirloin of beef and all he was right in the end i found to do him justice and i am sure he is right now about the lantern  he is always right mrs churchill could not help smiling  if you had seen him maam last night in the midst of the fire  i am sure we may thank him that we were not burned alive in our beds  and i shall never forget his coming to call me  poor fellow he that i was always scolding and scolding enough to make him hate me but he is too good to hate any body and i will be bound i will make it up to him now  take care that you dont go from one extreme into another pomfret dont spoil the boy  no maam there is no danger of that but i am sure if you had seen him last night yourself you would think he deserved to be rewarded  and so he shall be rewarded said mrs churchill but i will try him more fully yet  there is no occasion i think for trying him any more maam said mrs pomfret who was as violent in her likings as as in her dislikes pray desire continued her mistress that he will bring up breakfast this morning and leave the key of the house door pomfret with me  when franklin brought the urn into the breakfast parlour his mistress was standing by the fire with the key in her hand she spoke to him of his last nights exertions in terms of much approbation how long have you lived with me said she pausing three weeks i think  three weeks and four days madam  that is but a short time yet you have conducted yourself so as to make me think i may depend upon you you know this key  i believe madam it is the key of the house door  it is i shall trust it in your care it is a great trust for so young a person as you are franklin stood silent with a firm but modest look if you take the charge of this key continued his mistress remember it is upon condition that you never give it out of your own hands in the daytime it must not be left in the door you must not tell any body where you keep it at night and the house door must not be unlocked after eleven oclock at night unless by my orders will you take charge of the key upon these conditions  i will madam do any thing you order me said franklin and received the key from her hands  when mrs churchills orders were made known they caused many secret marvellings and murmurings corkscrew and felix were disconcerted and dared not openly avow their discontent and they treated franklin with the greatest seeming kindness and cordiality every thing went on smoothly for three days the butler never attempted his usual midnight visits to the alehouse but went to bed in proper time and paid particular court to mrs pomfret in order to dispel her suspicions she had never had any idea of the real fact that he and felix were joined in a plot with housebreakers to rob the house but thought he only went out at irregular hours to indulge himself in his passion for drinking  so stood affairs the night before mrs churchills birthday corkscrew by the housekeepers means ventured to present a petition that hemight go to the play the next day and his request was granted franklin came into the kitchen just when all the servants had gathered round the butler who with great importance was reading aloud the playbill every body present soon began to speak at once and with great enthusiasm talked of the playhouse the actors and actresses and then felix in the first pause turned to franklin and said lord you know nothing of all this you never went to a play did you  never said franklin and felt he did not know why a little ashamed and he longed extremely to go to one how should you like to go to the play with me tomorrow said corkscrew oh exclaimed franklin i should like it exceedingly  and do you think mistress would let you if i asked  i think  may be she would if mrs pemfret asked her  but then you have no money have you  no said franklin sighing but stay said corkscrew what i am thinking of is that if mistress will let you go i will treat you myself rather than that you should be disappointed  delight surprise and gratitude appeared in franklins face at these words corkscrew rejced to see that now at least he had found a most powerful temptation well then i will go just now and ask her in the mean time lend me the key of the house door for a minute or two  the key answered franklin starting i am sorry but i cannot do that for i have promised my mistress never to let it out of my own hands  but how will she know any thing of the matter  run run and get it for us  no i cannot replied franklin resisting the push which the butler gave his shoulder you cannot cried corkscrew changing his tone then sir i cannot take you to the play  very well sir said franklin sorrowfully but with steadiness very well sir said felix mimicking him you need not look so important nor fancy yourself such a great man because youre master of a key  say no more to him interrupted corkscrew let him alone to take his own way  felix you would have no objection i suppose to going to the play with me  oh i should like it of all things if i did not come between any body else  but come come added the hypocrite assuming a tone of friendly persuasion you will not be such a blockhead franklin as to lose going to the play for nothing it is only just obstinacy what harm can it do to lend mr corkscrew the key for five minutes he will give it to you back again safe and sound i dont doubt that answered franklin then it must be all because you dont wish to oblige mr corkscrew  no but i cannot oblige him in this for as i told you before my mistress trusted me i promised never to let the key out of my own hands and you would not have me break my trust mr spencer told me that was worse than robbing at the word robbing both corkscrew and felix involuntarily cast down their eyes and turned the conversation immediately saying that he did very right that they did not really want the key and had only asked for it just to try if he would keep his word shake hands said corksorew i am glad to find you out to be an honest fellow  i am sorry you did not think me one before mr corkscrew said franklin giving his hand rather proudly and he walked away  we shall make no hand of this prig said corkscrew but well have the key from him in spite of all his obstinacy said felix and let him make his story good as he can afterward he shall repent of these airs tonight i will watch him and find out where he hides the key and when he is asleep well get it without thanking him  this plan felix put in execution they discovered the place where franklin kept the key at night stole it whilst he slept took off the impression in wax and carefully replaced it in franklins trunk exactly where they found it  probably our young readers cannot guess what use they could mean to make of this impression of the key in wax knowing how to do mischief is very different from wishing to do it and the most innocent persons are generally the least ignorant by means of the impression which they had thus obtained corkscrew and felix proposed to get a false key made by picklock a smith who belonged to their gang of housebreakers and with this false key they knew they could open the door whenever they pleased  little suspecting what had happened franklin the next morning went to unlock the housedoor as usual but finding the key entangled in the lock he took it out to examine it and perceived a lump of wax sticking in one of the wards struck with this circumstance it brought to his mind all that had passed the preceding evening and being sure that he had no wax near the key he began to suspect what had happened and he could not help recollecting what he had once heard felix say that give him but a halfpenny worth of wax and he could open the strongest lock that ever was made by hands  all these things considered franklin resolved to take the key just as it was with the wax sticking in it to his mistress i was not mistaken when i thought i might trust you with this key said mrs churchill after she had heard his story my brother will be here to day and i shall consult him in the mean time say nothing of what has passed  evening came and after tea mr spencer sent for franklin up stairs so mr franklin said he i am glad to find you are in such high trust in this family franklin bowed but you have lost i understand the pleasure of going to the play tonight  i dont think any thing  much i mean  of that sir answered franklin smiling are corkscrew and felix gone to the play  yes half an hour ago sir  then i shall look into his room and examine the pantry and the plate that is under his care  when mr spencer came to examine the pantry he found the large salvers and cups in a basket behind the door and the other things placed so as to be easily carried off nothing at first appeared in corkscrews bedchamber to streng then their suspicions till just as they were going to leave the room mrs pomfret exclaimed why if there is not mr corkscrews dress coat hanging up there and if here is not felixs fine cravat that he wanted in such a hurry to go to the play  why sir they cannot be gone to the play  look at the cravat  ha upon my word i am afraid they are not at the play  no sir no you may be sure that they are plotting with their barbarous gang at the alehouse  and they will certainly break into the house tonight  we shall all be murdered in our beds as sure as i am a living woman sir  but if you will only take my advice   pray good mrs pomfret dont be alarmed  nay sir but i will not pretend to sleep in the house if franklin is not to have a blunderbuss and i a baggonet  you shall have both indeed mrs pomfret but dont make such a noise for every body will hear you  the love of mystery was the only thing which could have conquered mrs pomfrets love of talking she was silent and contented herself the rest of the evening with making signs looking ominous and stalking about the house like one possessed with a secret  escaped from mrs pomfrets fears and advice mr spencer went to a shop within a few doors of the alehouse which he heard corkscrew frequented and sent to beg to speak to the landlord he came and when mr spencer questioned him confessed that corkscrew and felix were actually drinking in his house with two men of suspicious appearance that as he passed through the passage he heard them disputing about a key and that one of them said since we have got the key well go about it tonight this was sufficient information mr spencer lest the landlord should give them information of what was going forwards took him along with him to bowstreet  a constable and proper assistance was sent to mrs churchills they stationed themselves in a back parlour which opened on a passage leading to the butlers pantry where the plate was kept a little after midnight they heard the halldoor corkscrew and his accomplices went directly to the pantry and there mr spencer and the constable immediately secured them as they were carrying off their booty  mrs churchill and pomfret had spent the night at the house of an acquaintance in the same street well maam said mrs pomfret who had heard all the news in the morning the villains are all safe thank god i was afraid to go to the window this morning but it was my luck to see them all go by to gaol  they looked so shocking  i am sure i never shall forget felixs look to my dying day  but poor franklin maam that boy has the best heart in the world  i could not get him to give a second look at them as they passed  poor fellow i thought he would have dropped and he was so modest maam when mr spencer spoke to him and told him he had done his duty  and did my brother tell him what reward i intend for him  no maam and i am sure franklin thinks no more of reward than i do  i intend continued mrs churchill to sell some of my old useless plate and to lay it out in an annuity for franklins life  la maam exclaimed mrs pomfret with unfeigned joy i am sure you are very good and i am very glad of it  and continued mrs churchill here are some tickets for the play which i shall beg you pomfret to give him and to take him with you  i am very much obliged to you indeed maam and i will go with him with all my heart and choose such plays as will not do no prejudice to his morality  and maam said mrs pomfret the night after the fire i left him my great bible and my watch in my will for i never was more mistaken at the first in any boy in my born days but he has won me by his own deserts and i shall from this time forth love all the villaintropic folks for his sake  the barring out or party spirit the mother of mischief says an old proverb is no bigger than a midges wing  at doctor middletons school in england there was a great tall dunce of the name of fisher who never could be taught how to look out a word in a dictionary he used to torment every body with  do pray help me i cannot make out this one word  the person who usually helped him in his distress was a very clever goodnatured boy of the name of de gray de gray had been many years under dr middletons care and by his abilities and good conduct did him great credit the doctor certainly was both proud and fond of him but he was so well beloved or so much esteemed by his companions that nobody had ever called him by the odious name of favorite until the arrival of a new scholar of the name of archer  till archer came the ideas of favorites and parties were almost unknown at dr middletons but he brought all these ideas fresh from a great publicschool at which he had been educated  at which he had acquired a sufficient quantity of greek and latin and a superabundant quantity of partyspirit his aim the moment that he came to a new school was to get to the head of it or at least to form the strongest party his influence for he was a boy of considerable abilities was quickly felt though he had a powerful rival as he thought proper to call him in de gray and with him a rival was always an enemy de gray so far from giving him any cause of hatred treated him with a degree of cordiality which would probably have had an effect upon archers mind if it had not been for the artifices of fisher  it may seem surprising that a great dunce should be able to work upon a boy like archer who was called a great genius but when genius is joined to a violent temper instead of being united to good sense it is at the mercy even of dunces  fisher was mortally offended one morning by de greys refusing to translate his whole lesson for him he went over to archer who considering him as a partisan deserting from the enemy received him with open arms and translated his whole lesson without expressing much contempt for his stupidity from this moment fisher forgot all de greys former kindness and considered only how he could in his turn mortify the person whom he felt to be so much his superior  de gray and archer were now reading for a premium which was to be given in their class fisher betted on archers head who had not sense enough to despise the bet of a blockhead on the contrary he suffered him to excite the spirit of rivalship in its utmost fury by collecting the bets of all the school  so that this premium now became a matter of the greatest consequence and archer instead of taking the means to secure a judgment in his favor was listening to the opinions of all his companions it was a prize which was to be won by his own exertions but he suffered himself to consider it as an affair of chance the onsequence was that he trusted to chance  his partisans lost their wagers and he the premium  and his temper  mr archer said dr middleton after the grand affair was decided you have done all that genius alone could do but you de gray have done all that genius and industry united could do  well cried archer with affected gaiety as soon as the doctor had left the room  well i am content with my sentence  genius alone for me  industry for those who want it  added he with a significant look at de gray  fisher applauded this as a very spirited speech and by insinuations that dr middleton always gave the premium to de gray and that those who had lost their bets might thank themselves for it for being such simpletons as to bet against the favorite he raised a murmur highly flattering to archer amongst some of the most credulous boys whilst others loudly proclaimed their belief in dr middletons impartiality these warmly congratulated de gray at this archer grew more and more angry and when fisher was proceeding to speak nonsense for him pushed forward into the circle to de gray crying  i wish mr fisher you would let me fight my own battles  and i wish said young townsend who was fonder of diversions than of premiums or battles or of any thing else   i wish that we were not to have any battles after having worked like horses dont set about to fight like dogs come said he tapping de greys shoulder let us see your new playhouse do  it is a holiday and let us make the most of it  let us have the school for scandal do and i will play charles for you and you de gray shall be my little premium  come do open this new playhouse of yours tonight  come then said de gray and he ran across the playground to a waste building at the farthest end of it in which at the earnest request of the whole community and with the permission of doctor middleton he had with much pains and ingenuity erecte a theater  the new theater is going to be opened follow the manager  follow the manager  echoed a multitude of voices  follow the manager echoed very disagreeably in archers ear but as he could not be left alone he was also obliged to follow the manager the moment that the door was unlocked the crowd rushed in the delight and wonder expressed at the sight was great and the applauses and thanks which were bestowed upon the manager were long and loud  archer at least thought them long for he was impatient till his voice could be heard when at length the exclamations had spent themselves he walked across the stage with a knowing air and looking round contemptuously   and is this your famous playhouse cried he i wish you had any of you seen the playhouse i have been used to  these words made a great and visible change in the feelings and opinions of the public who would be a servant of the public or who would toll for popular applause  a few words spoken in a decisive tone by a new voice operated as a charm and the playhouse was in an instant metamorphosed in the eyes of the spectators all gratitude for the past was forgotten and the expectation of something better justified to the capricious multitude their disdain of what they had so lately pronounced to be excellent  every one now began to cricise one observed that the green certain was full of holes and would not draw up  another attacked the scenes  scenes they were not like real scenes  archer must know best because he was used to these things  so every body crowded to hear something of the other playhouse they gathered round archer to hear the description of his playhouse and at every sentence insulting comparisons were made when he had done his auditors looked round  dighed  and wished that archer had been their manager they turned from de gray as from a person who had done them an injury some of his friends  for he had friends who were not swayed by the popular opinion  felt indignation at this ingratitude and were going to express their feelings but de gray stopped them and begged that he might speak for himself  gentlemen said he coming forward as soon as he felt that he had sufficient command of himself   my friends i see you are discontented with me and my playhouse i have done my best to please you but if any body else can please you better i shall be glad of it i did not work so hard for the glory of being your manager you have my free leave to tear down  here his voice faultered but he hurried on  you have my free leave to tear down all my work as fast as you please  archer shake hands first however to show that there is no malice in the case  archer who was touched by what his rival said and stopping the hand of his new partisan fisher cried no fisher no  no pulling down we can alter it there is a great deal of ingenuity in it considering  in vain archer would now have recalled the public to reason the time for reason was past enthusiasm had taken hold of their minds  down with it  down with it archer for ever cried fisher and tore down the curtain the riot once begun nothing could stop the little mob till the whole theater was demolished the love of power prevailed in the mind of archer he was secretly flattered by the zeal of his party and he mistook their love of mischief for attachment to himself de gray looked on superior i said i could bear to see all this and i can said he  now it is all over  and now it was all over there was silence the rioters stood still to take breath and to look at what they had done there was a blank space before them  in this moment of silence there was heard something like a female voice  hush  what strange voice is that said archer fisher caught fast hold of his arm  every body looked round to see where the voice came from it was dusk  two windowshutters at the farthest end of the building were seen to move slowly inwards de gray and in the same instant archer went forward and as the shutters opened there appeared through the hole the dark face and shrivelled hands of a very old gypsey she did not speak but she looked first at one and then at another at length she fixed her eyes upon de gray  well my good woman what do you want with me  want  nothing  with you said the old woman do you want nothing with me  nothing said de gray her eye immediately turned upon archer   you want something with me said she with emphasis  i  what do i want replied archer  no said she changing her tone you want nothing  nothing will you ever want or i am much mistaken in that face  in that watchchain she should have said for her quick eye had espied archers watchchain he was the only person in company who had a watch and she therefore judged him to be the richest  had you ever your fortune told sir in your life  not i said he looking at de gray as if he was afraid of his ridicule if he listened to the gypsey  not you  no  for you will make your own fortune and the fortune of all that belong to you  there is good news for my friends cried archer  and i am one of them remember that cried fisher  and i  and i  joined a number of voices  good luck to them cried the gypsey good luck to them all  then as soon as they had acquired sufficient confidence in her good will they pressed up to the window  there cried townsend as he chanced to stumble over the carpenters mitrebox which stood in the way  there is a good omen for me i have stumbled on the mitrebox i shall certainly be a bishop  happy he who had sixpence for he bid fair to be a judge upon the bench and happier he who had a shilling for he was in the high road to be one day upon the woolsack lord high chancellor of england no one had half a crown or no one would surely have kept it in his pocket upon such an occasion for he might have been an archbishop a king or what he pleased  fisher who like all weak people was extremely credulous had kept his post immovable in the front row all the time his mouth open and his stupid eyes fixed upon the gypsey in whom he felt implicit faith  those who have least confidence in their own powers and who have least expectation from the success of their own exertions are always most disposed to trust in fortune tellers and fortune they hope to win when they cannot earn and as they can never be convinced by those who speak sense it is no wonder they are always persuaded by those who talk nonsense  i have a question to put said fisher in a solemn tone put it then said archer what hinders you but they will hear me said he looking suspiciously at de gray  i shall not hear you said de gray i am going every body else drew back and left him to whisper his question in the gypseys ear  what is become of my livy  your sister livy do you mean said the gypsey  no my latin livy  the gypsey paused for further information  it had a leaf torn out in the beginning and i hate dr middleton   written in it interrupted the gypsey   right  the very book cried fisher with joy but how could you know it was dr middletons name i thought i had scratched it so that nobody could make it out  nobody could make it out but me replied the gypsey but never think to deceive me said she shaking her head at him in a manner that made him tremble  i dont deceive you indeed i tell you the whole truth i lost it a week ago  true  and when shall i find it  meet me here at this hour tomorrow evening and i will answer you  no more  i must be gone  not a word more tonight  she pulled the shutters toward her and left the youth in darkness all his companions were gone he had been so deeply engaged in this conference that he had not perceived their departure he found all the world at supper but no entreaties could prevail upon him to disclose his secret townsend rallied in vain as for archer he was not disposed to destroy by ridicule the effect which he saw that the old womans predictions in his favor had had upon the imagination of many of his little partisans he had privately slipped two good shillings into the gypseys hand to secure her for he was willing to pay any price for any means of acquiring power  the watchchain had not deceived the gypsey for archer was the richest person in the community his friends had imprudently supplied him with more money than is usually trusted to boys of his age doctor middleton had refused to give him a larger monthly allowance than the rest of his companions but he brought to school with him secretly the sum of five guineas this appeared to his friends and to himself an inexhaustible treasure  riches and talents would he flattered himself secure to him that ascendancy of which he was so ambitious am i your manager or not was now his question i scorn to take advantage of a hasty moment but since last night you have had time to consider if you desire me to be your manager you shall see what a theater i will make for you in this purse said he showing through the network a glimpse of the shining treasure  in this purse is aladdins wonderful lamp  am i your manager  put it to the vote  it was put to the vote about ten of the most reasonable of the assembly declared their gratitude and high approbation of their old friend de gray but the numbers were in favor of the new friend and as no metaphysical distinctions relative to the idea of a majority had ever entered their thoughts the most numerous party considered themselves as now beyond dispute in the right they drew off on one side in triumph and their leader who knew the consequence of a name in party matters immediately distinguished his partisans by the gallant name of archers stigmatising the friends of de gray by the odious epithet of greybeards  amongst the archers was a class not very remarkable for their mental qualifications but who by their bodily activity and by the peculiar advantages annexed to their way of life rendered themselves of the highest consequence especially to the rich and enterprising the judicious reader will apprehend that i allude to the persons called dayscholars amongst these fisher was distinguished by his knowledge of all the streets and shops in the adjacent town and though a dull scholar he had such reputation as a man of business that whoever had commissions to execute at the confectioners were sure to apply to him some of the youngest of his employers had it is true at times complained that he made mistakes of halfpence and pence in their accounts but as these affairs could never be brought to a public trial fishers character and consequence were undiminished till the fatal day when his aunt barbara forbad his visits to the confectioner  or rather till she requested the confectioner who had his private reasons for obeying her not to receive her nephews visits as he had made himself sick at his house and mrs barbaras fears for his health were incessant  though his visits to the confectioners were thus at an end there were many other shops open to him and with officious zeal he offered his services to the new manager to purchase whatever might be wanting for the theater  since his fathers death fisher had become a boarder at dr middletons but his frequent visits to his aunt barbara afforded him opportunities of going into the town the carpenter de greys friend was discarded by archer for having said lackadaisy when he saw that the old theater was pulled down a new carpenter and paperhanger recommended by fisher were appointed to attend with their tools for orders at two oclock archer impatient to show his ingenuity and his generosity gave his plan and his orders in a few minutes in a most decided manner  these things he observed should be done with some spirit  to which the carpenter readily assented and added that gentlemen of spirit never looked to the expense but always to the effect upon this priciple mr chip set to work with all possible alacrity in a few hours time he promised to produce a grand effect high expectations were formed  nothing was talked of but the new playhouse and so intent upon it was every head that no lessons could be got archer was obliged in the midst of his various occupations to perform the part of grammar and dictionary for twenty different people  oh ye athenians he exclaimed how hard do i work to obtain your praise  impatient to return to the theater the moment the hours destined for instruction or as they are termed by schoolboys school hours were over each prisoner started up with a shout of joy  stop one moment gentlemen if you please said dr middleton in an aweful voice mr archer return to your place  are you all here  the names of all the boys were called over and when each had answered to his name dr middleton said  gentlemen i am sorry to interrupt your amuements but till you have contrary orders from me no one on pain of my serious displeasure must go into that building pointing to the place where the theater was erecting  mr archer your carpenter is at the door you will be so good as to dismiss him  i do not think proper to give my reasons for these orders but you who know me said the doctor and his eye turned toward de gray will not suspect me of caprice  i depend gentlemen upon your obedience  to the dead silence with which these orders were received succeeded in a few minutes an universal groan  so said townsend all our diversion is over  so whispered fisher in the managers ear this is some trick of the greybeards did you not observe how he looked at de gray  fired by this idea which had never entered his mind before archer started from his reverie and striking his hand upon the table swore that he would not be outwitted by any greybeard in europe  no nor by all of them put together the a chefs were surely a match for them  he would stand by them if they would stand by him he declared with a loud voice against the whole world and dr middleton himself with little premium at his right hand  every body admired archers spirit but were a little appalled at the sound of standing against dr middleton  why not resumed the indignant manager dr middleton nor no doctor upon earth shall treat me with injustice this you see is a stroke at me and my party and i will not bear it  oh you are mistaken said de gray who was the only one who dared to oppose reason to the angry orator  it cannot be a stroke aimed at you and your party for he does not know that you have a party  i will make him know it and i will make you know it too said archer before i came here you reigned alone now your reign is over mr de gray remember my majority this morning and your theater last night  he has remembered it said fisher you see the moment he was not to be our manager we were to have no theater  no playhouse  no plays we must all sit down with our hands before us  all for good reasons of dr middletons which he does not vouchsafe to tell us  i will not be governed by any mans reasons that he will not tell me cried archer he cannot have good reasons or why not tell them  nonsense we shall not suspect him of caprice  why not  because we who know him said de gray have never known him capricious  perhaps not i know nothing about him said archer  no said de gray for that very reason i speak who do know him  dont be in a passion archer  i will be in a passion  i will not submit to tyranny  i will not be made a fool of by a few soft words  you dont know me de gray  i will go through with what i have begun  i am manager and i will be manager and you shall see my theater finished in spite of you and my party triumphant  party repeated de gray  i cannot imagine what is in the word party that seems to drive you mad we never heard of parties till you came amongst us  no before i came i say nobody dared oppose you but i dare and i tell you to your face  take care of me  a warm friend and a bitter enemy is my motto  i am not your enemy  i believe you are out of your senses archer said he laughing  out of my senses  no  you are my enemy  are not you my rival  did not you win the premium  did not you want to be manager  answer me are not you in one word a greybeard  you called me a greybeard but my name is de gray said he still laughing  laugh on cried the other furiously come archers sollow me  we shall laugh by and by i promise you  at the door archer was stopped by mr chip  oh mr chip i am ordered to discharge you  yes sir and here is a little bill   bill mr chip  why you have not been at work for two hours  not much over sir but if you will please to look into it you will see it is for a few things you ordered the stuff is all laid out and delivered the paper and the festoonbordering for the drawing room scene is cut out and left yander within  yander within  i wish you had not been in such a confounded hurry  sixandtwenty shillings cried he but i cannot stay to talk about it now  i will tell you mr chip said archer lowering his voice what you must do for me my good fellow  then drawing mr chip aside he begged him to pull down some of the woodwork which had been put up and to cut it into a certain number of wooden bars of which he gave him the dimensions with orders to place them all when ready under a haystack which he pointed out mr chip scrupled and hesitated and began to talk of the doctor archer immediately began to talk of the bill and throwing down a guinea and a half the conscientious carpenter pocketed the money directly and made his bow  well master archer said he there is no refusing you nothing  you have such a way of talking one out of it  you manage me just like a child  aye aye said archer knowing that he had been cheated and yet proud of managing a carpenter  aye aye i know the way to manage every body  let the things be ready in an hours time  and harke leave your tools by mistake behind you and a thousand of twentypenny nails  ask no questions and keep your own counsel like a wise man  off with you and take care of the doctor  archers archers  to the archers tree follow your leader cried he sounding his well known whistle as a signal  his followers gathered round him and he raising himself upon the mount at the foot of the tree counted his numbers and then in a voice lower than usual addressed them thus  my friends is there a greyberad amongst us if there is let him walk off now  he has my free leave  no one stirred  then we are all archers and we will stand by one another  join hands my friends  they all joined hands  promise me not to betray me and i will go on  i ask no security but your honor  they all gave their honor to be secret and faithful as he called it and he went on   did you ever hear of such a thing as a barring out my friends  they had heard of such a thing but they had only heard of it  archer gave the history of a barring out in which he had been concerned at his school in which the boys stood out two days against the master and gained their point at last which was a weeks more holidays at easter  but if we should not succeed said they dr middleton is so steady he never goes back from what he has said  did you ever try to push him back  let us be steady and he will tremble  tyrants always tremble when   oh interrupted a number of voices but he is not a tyrant is he  all schoolmasters are tyrants are not they replied archer and is not he a schoolmaster  to this logic there was no answer but still reluctant they asked what they should get by a barring out  get  every thing  what we want  which is every thing to lads of spirit  victory and liberty  bar him out till he repeals his tyrannical law  till he lets us in to our own theater again or till he tells us his good reasons against it  but perhaps he has reasons for not telling us  impossible cried archer that is the way we are always to be governed by a man in a wig who says he has good reasons and cannot tell them  are you fools  go  go back to de gray  i see you are all greybeards  go  who goes first  nobody would go first  i will have nothing to do with ye if ye are resolved to be slaves  we will not be slaves they all exclaimed at once  then said archer stand out in the right and be free  the right  it would have taken up too much time to examine what the right was archer was always sure that the right was what his party chofe to do  that is what he chose to do himself and such is the influence of numbers upon each other in conquering the feelings of shame and in confusing the powers of reasoning that in a few minutes the right was forgotten and each said to himself  to be sure archer is a very clever boy and he cannot be mistaken  or to be sure townsend thinks so and he would not do any thing to get us into a scrape  or to be sure every body will agree to this but myself and i cannot stand out alone to be pointed at as a greybeard and a slave every body thinks it is right and every body cannot be wrong  by some of these arguments which passed rapidly through the mind without his being conscious of them each boy decided and deceived himself  what none would have done alone none scrupled to do as a party  it was determined then that there should be a barring out the arrangement of the affair was left to their new manager to whom they all pledged implicit obedience  obedience it seems is necessary even from rebels to their ringleaders  not reasonable but implicit obedience  scarcely had the assembly adjourned to the ballalley when fisher with an important length of face came up to the manager and desired to speak one word to him   my advice to you archer is to do nothing in this till we have consulted you know who about whether it is right or wrong  you know who  who do you mean  make haste and dont make so many faces for i am in a hurry  who is you know who  the old woman said fisher gravely the gypsey  you may consult the old woman said archer bursting out a laughing about what is right and wrong if you please but no old woman shall decide for me  no but you dont take me said fisher you dont take me by right and wrong i mean lucky and unlucky  whatever i do will be lucky replied archer my gypsey told you that already  i know i know said fisher and what she said about your friends being lucky  that went a great way with many added he with a sagacious nod of his head i can tell you that  more than you think  do you know said he laying hold of archers button i am in the secret there are nine of us have crooked our little fingers upon it not to stir a step till we get her advice and she has appointed me to meet her about particular business of my own at eight so i am to consult her and to bring her answer  archer knew too well how to govern fools to attempt to reason with them and instead of laughing any longer at fishers ridiculous superstition he was determined to take advantage of it he affected to be persuaded of the wisdom of the measure  looked at his watch urged him to be exact to a moment conjured him to remember exactly the words of the oracle and above all things to demand the lucky hour and minute when the barring out should begin  with these instructions archer put his watch into the solemn dupes hand and left him to count the seconds till the moment of his appointment whilst he ran off himself to prepare the oracle at a little gate which locked into a lane through which he guessed that the gypsey must pass he stationed himself saw her gave her half a crown and her instructions made his escape and got back unsuspected to fisher whom he found in the attitude in which he had left him watching the motion of the minutehand  proud of his secret commission fisher slouched his hat he knew not why over his face and proceeded toward the appointed spot to keep as he had been charged to do by archer within the letter of the law he stood behind the forbidden building and waited some minutes through a gap in the hedge the old woman at length made her appearance muffled up and looking cautiously about her  there is nobody near us said fisher and he began to be a little afraid  what answer said he recollecting himself about my livy  lost  lost  lost said the gypsey lifting up her hands never never never to be found  but no matter for that now  that is not your errand tonight  no tricks with me  speak to me of what is next your heart  fisher astonished put his hand upon his heart told her all that she knew before and received the answers which archer had dictated  that the archers should be lucky as long as they stuck to their manager and to one another that the barring out should end in woe if not begun precisely as the clock should strike nine on wednesday night but if begun in that lucky moment and all obedient to their lucky leader all should end well  a thought a provident thought now struck fisher for even he had some foresight where his favorite passion was concerned  pray in our barring out shall we be starved  no said the gypsey not if you trust to me for food and if you give me money enough  silver will not do for so many gold is what must cross my hand  i have no gold said fisher and i dont know what you mean by so many  i am only talking of number one you know  i must take care of that first  so as fisher thought that it was possible that archer clever as he was might be disappointed in his supplies he determined to take secret measures for himself his aunt barbaras interdiction had shut him out of the confectioners shop but he flattered himself that he could outwit his aunt he therefore begged the gypsey to procure him twelve buns by thursday morning and bring them secretly to one of the windows of the schoolroom  as fisher did not produce any money when he made this proposal it was at first absolutely rejected but a bribe at length conquered his difficulties and the bribe which fisher found himself obliged to give  for he had no pocket money left of his own he being as much restricted in that article as archer was indulged  the bribe that he found himself obliged to give to quiet the gypsey was half a crown which archer had entrusted to him to buy candles for the theater  oh thought he to himself archers so careless about money he will never think of asking me for the half crown again and now he will want no candles for the theater  or at any rate it will be some time first and may be aunt barbara may be got to give me that much at christmas  then if the worst comes to the worst one can pay archer  my mouth waters for the buns and have em i must now  so for the hope of twelve buns he sacrificed the money which had been entrusted to him  the meanest motives in mean minds often prompt to the commission of those great faults to which one should think nothing but some violent passion could have tempted  the ambassador having thus in his opinion concluded his own and the public business returned well satisfied with the result after receiving the gypseys reiterated promise to tap three times at the window on thursday morning  the day appointed for the barring out at length arrived and archer assembling the confederates informed them that all was prepared for carrying their design into execution that he now depended for success upon their punctuality and courage he had within the last two hours got all the bars ready to fasten the doors and window shutters of the schoolroom he had with the assistance of two of the dayscholars who were of the party sent into the town for provisions at his own expense which would make a handsome supper for that night he had also negociated with some cousins of his who lived in the town for a constant supply in future  bless me exclaimed archer suddenly stopping in this narration of his services there is one thing after all i have forgot we shall be undone without it  fisher pray did you ever buy the candles for the playhouse  no to be sure replied fisher extremely frightened you know you dont want candles for the playhouse now  not for the playhouse but for the barringout  we shall be in the dark man  you must run this minute run  for candles said fisher confused how many  what sort  stupidity exclaimed archer you are a pretty fellow at a dead list  lend me a pencil and a bit of paper do i will write down what i want myself  well what are you fumbling for  for money said fisher coloring  money man didnt i give you half a crown the other day  yes replied fisher stammering but i was not sure that that might be enough  enough yes to be sure it will  i dont know what you are at  nothing nothing said fisher here write upon this then said fisher putting a piece of paper into archers hand upon which archer wrote his orders  away away cried he  and away went fisher  he returned but not until a considerable time afterward  they were at supper when he returned  fisher always comes in at suppertime observed one of the greybeards carelessly  well and would you have him come in after suppertime said townsend who always supplied his party with ready wit  i have got the candles whispered fisher as he passed by archer to his place  and the tinderbox said archer  yes i got back from my aunt barbara under pretense that i must study for repetitionday an hour later tonight  so i got leave  was not that clever  a dunce always thinks it clever to cheat even by sober lies  how mr fisher procured the candles and the tinderbox without money and without credit for he had no credit we shall discover in future  archer and his associates had agreed to stay the last in the schoolroom and as soon as the greybeards were gone out to bed he as the signal was to shut and lock one door townsend the other a third conspirator was to strike a light in case they should not be able to secure a candle a fourth was to take charge of the candle as soon as lighted and all the rest were to run to their bars which were secreted in the room then to fix them to the common fastening bars of the window in the manner in which they had been previously instructed by the manager thus each had his part assigned and each was warned that the success of the whole depended upon their order and punctuality  order and punctuality it appears are necessary even in a barring out and even rebellion must have its laws  the long expected moment at length arrived de gray and his friends unconscious of what was going forward walked out of the schoolroom as usual at bed time the clock began to strike nine there was one greybeard left in the room who was packing up some of his books which had been left about by accident it is impossible to describe the impatience with which he was watched especially by fisher and the nine who depended upon the gypsey oracle  when he bad got all his books together under his arm he let one of them fall and whilst he stooped to pick it up archer gave the signal the doors were shut locked and doublelocked in an instant a light was struck and each ran to his post the bars were all in the same moment put up to the windows and archer when he had tried them all and seen that they were secure gave a loud huzza  in which he was joined by all the party most manfully  by all but the poor greybeard who the picture of astonishment stood stock still in the midst of them with his books under his arm at which spectacle townsend who enjoyed the srolic of the fray more than any thing else burst into an immoderate fit of laughter  so my little greybeard said he holding a candle full in his eyes what think you of all this  how came you amongst the wicked ones  i dont know indeed said the little boy very gravely you shut me up amongst you  will not you let me out  let you out no no my little greybeard said archer catching hold of him and dragging him to the window bars  look ye here  touch these  put your hand to them  pull push kick  put a little spirit into it man  kick like an archer if ye can  away with ye it is a pity that the king of the greybeards is not here to admire me  i should like to show him our fortifications but come my merrymen all now to the feast  out with the table into the middle of the room  good cheer my jolly archers  i am your manager  townsend delighted with the bustle rubbed his hands and capered about the room whilst the preparations for the feast were hurried forward  four candles  four candles on the table let us have things in style when we are about it mr manager cried townsend places  places there is nothing like a fair scramble my boys  let every one take care of himself  halloo greybeard i have knocked greybeard down here in the scuffle  get up again my lad and see a little of life  no no cried pisher he shall not sup with us  no no cried the manager he shall not live with us a greybeard is not sit company for archers  no no cried townsend evil communication corrupts good manners  so with one unanimous hiss they hunted the poor little gentle boy into a corner and having pent him up with benches fisher opened his books for him which he thought the greatest mortification and set up a candle beside him  there now he looks like a greybeard as he is cried they  tell me what is the latin for cold roast beef said fisher exulting and they returned to their feast  long and loud they revelled they had a few bottles of cider give me the corkscrew the cider shall not be kept till it is sour cried townsend in answer to the manager who when he beheld the provisions vanishing with surprising rapidity began to fear for the morrow  hang tomorrow cried townsend let greybeards think of tomorrow mr manager here is your good health  the archers all stood up as their cup were filled to drink the health of their chief with an universal cheer  but at the moment that the cups were at their lips and as archer bowed to thank the company a sudden shower from above astonished the whole assembly they looked up and beheld the rose of a watering engine whose long neck appeared through a trapdoor in the ceiling  your good health mr manager said a voice which was known to be the gardeners and in the midst of their surprise and dismay the candles were suddenly extinguished  the trapdoor shut down and they were left in utter darkness  the devil said archer   dont swear mr manager said the same voice from the ceiling i hear every word you say  mercy upon us exclaimed fisher the clock added he whispering must have been wrong for it had not done striking when we began  only you remember archer it had just done before you had done locking your door  hold your tongue blockhead said archer  well boys were ye never in the dark before you are not afraid of a shower of rain i hope  is any body drowned  no said they with a faint laugh but what shall we do here in the dark all night long and all day tomorrow  we cannot unbar the shuters it is a wonder nobody ever thought of that trapdoor said townsend  the trapdoor had indeed escaped the managers observation as the house was new to him and the ceiling being newly whitewashed the opening was scarcely perceptible vexed to be outgeneralled and still more vexed to have it remarked archer poured forth a volley of incoherent exclamations and reproaches against those who were thus so soon discouraged by a trifle and groping for the tinder box he asked if any thing could be easier than to strike a light again  the light appeared but at the moment that it made the tinderbox visible another shower from above aimed and aimed exactly at the tinderbox drenched it with water and rendered it totally unfit for further service  archer in a fury dashed it to the ground and now for the first time he flt what it was to be the unsuccessful head of a party he heard in his turn the murmurs of the discontented changeable populace and recollecting all his bars and bolts and ingenious contrivances he was more provoked at their blaming him for this one only oversight than he was grieved at the disaster itself  oh my hair is all wet cried one dolefully  wring it then said archer  my hands cut with your broken glass cried another  glass cried a third mercy is there broken glass and it is all about i suppose amongst the supper  and i d but one bit of bread all the time  bread cried archer   eat if you want it  here is a piece here and no glass near it  it is all wet  and i dont like dry bread by itself  that is no feast  heighday  what nothing but moaning and grumbling  if these are the joys of a barring out cried townsend i would rather be snug in my bed i expected that we should have sat up till twelve oclock talking and laughing and singing  so you may still what hinders you said archer  sing and well join you and i should be glad those fellows overhead heard us singing begin townsend  come now all ye social powers spread your influence over us  or else  rule britannia britannia rule the waves britons never will be slaves   nothing can be more melancholy than forced merriment in vain they roared in chorus in vain they tried to appear gay  it would not do the voices died away and dropped off one by one they had each provided himself with a great coat to sleep upon but now in the dark there was a peevish scrambling contest for the coats and half the company in very bad humor stretched themselves upon the benches for the night  there is great pleasure in bearing any thing that has the appearance of hardship as long as there is any glory to be acquired by it but when people feel themselves foiled there is no further pleasure in endurance and if in their misfortune there is any mixture of the ridiculous the motives for heroism are immediately destroyed dr middleton had probably considered this in the choice he made of his first attack  archer who had spent the night as a man who had the cares of government upon his shoulders rose early in the morning whilst every body else was fast asleep in the night he had revolved the affair of the trapdoor and a new danger had alarmed him it was possible that the enemy might descend upon them through the trapdoor the room had been built high to admit a free circulation of air it was twenty feet high to that it was in vain to think of reaching to the trapdoor as soon as the daylight appeared archer rose softly that he might reconnoitre and devise some method of guarding against this new danger luckily there were round holes in the top of the window shutters which admitted sufficient light for him to work by the remains of the soaked feast wet candles and broken glass spread over the table in the middle of the room looked rather dismal this morning  a pretty set of fellows i have to manage said archer contemplating the groupe of sleepers before him  it is well they have somebody to think for them now if i wanted  which thank goodness i dont  but if i did want to call a call cabinetcouncil to my assistance who could i pitch upon  not this stupid snorer who is dreaming of gypseys if he is dreaming of any thing continued archer as he looked into fishers open mouth  this next chap is quick enough but then he is so fond of having every thing his own way  and this curlpated monkey who is grinning in his sleep is all tongue and no brains  here are brains though nobody would think it in this lump said he looking at a fat rolled up heavybreathing sleeper but what signify brains to such a lazy dog i might kick him for my football this halfhour before i should get him awake  this lankjawed harlequin beside him is a handy fellow to be sure but then if he has hands he has no head  and he would be afraid of his own shadow too by this light he is such a coward  and townsend why he has puns in plenty but when there is any work to be done he is the worst fellow to be near one in the world  he can do nothing but laughed at his own puns  this poor little fellow that we hunted into the corner has more sense than all of them put together but then he is a greybeard  thus speculated the chief of a party upon his sleeping friends  and how did it happen that he should be so ambitious to please and govern this set when for each individual of which it was composed he felt such supreme contempt  he had formed them into a party had given them a name and he was at their head  if these be not good reasons none better can be assigned for archers conduct  i wish ye could all sleep on said he but i must waken ye though you will be only in my way the sound of my hammering must waken them  so i may as well do the thing handsomely and flatter some of them by pretending to ask their advice  accordingly he pulled two or three to waken them  come townsend waken my boy  here is some diversion for you  up up  diversion cried townsend i am your man  i am up  up to any thing  so under the name of diversion archer set townsend to work at four oclock in the morning they had nails a few tools and several spars still left from the wreck of the playhouse these by archers directions they sharpened at one end and nailed them to the ends of several forms all hands were now called to clear away the supper things and to erect these forms perpendicularly under the trapdoor and with the assistance of a few braces a chevauxdefrise was formed upon which nobody could venture to descend at the farthest end of the room they likewise formed a penthouse of the tables under which they proposed to breakfast secure from the pelting storm if it should again assail them through the trapdoor they crowded under the penthouse as soon as it was ready and their admiration of its ingenuity paid the workmen for the job  lord i shall like to see the gardeners phiz through the trapdoor when he beholds the spikes under him cried townsend  now for breakfast  aye now for breakfast said archer looking at his watch past eight oclock and my town boys not come  i dont understand this  archer had expected a constant supply of provisions from two boys who lived in the town who were cousins of his and who had promised to come every day and put food in at a certain hole in the wall in which a ventilator usually turned this ventilator archer had taken down and had contrived it so that it could be easily removed and replaced at pleasure but upon examination it was now perceived that the hole had been newly stopped up by an iron back which it was impossible to penetrate or remove  it never came into my head that any body would ever have thought of the ventilator but myself exclaimed archer in great perplexity  he listened and waited for his cousins but no cousins came and at a late hour the company were obliged to breakfast upon the scattered fragments of the last nights feast that feast had been spread with such imprudent profusion that little now remained to satisfy the hungry guests archer who well knew the effect which the apprehension of a scarcity would have upon his associates did every thing that could be done by a bold countenance and reiterated assertions to persuade them that his cousins would certainly come at last and that the supplies were only delayed  the delay however was alarming  fisher alone heard the managers calculations and saw the public fears unmoved secretly rejoicing in his own wisdom he walked from window to window slily listening for the gypseys signal  there it is cried he with more joy sparkling in his eyes than had ever enlightened them before come this way archer  but dont tell any body  hark do ye hear those three taps at the window  this is the old woman with twelve buns for me  i will give you one whole one for yourself if you will unbar the window for me  unbar the window interrupted archer no that i will not for you or the gypsey either but i have head enough to get your buns without that but stay there is something of more consequence than your twelve buns  i must think for ye all i see regularly  so he summoned a council and proposed that every one should subscribe and trust the subscription to the gypsey to purchase a fresh supply of provisions archer laid down a guinea of his own money for his subscription at which sight all the company clapped their hands and is popularity roe to a high pitch with their renewed hopes of plenty now having made a list of their wants they folded the money in the paper put it into a bag which archer tied to a long string and having broken the pane of glass behind the round hole in the window shutter he let down the bag to the gypsey she promised to be punctual and having filled the bag with fishers twelve buns they were drawn up in triumph and every body anticipated the pleasure with which they should see the same bag drawn up at dinnertime the buns were a little squeezed in being drawn through the hole in the window shutter but archer immediately sawed out a piece of the shutter and broke the corresponding panes in each of the other windows to prevent suspicion and to make it appear that they had all been broken to admit air  what a pity that so much ingenuity should have been employed to no purpose it may have surprised the intelligent reader that the gypsey was so punctual to her promise to fisher but we must recollect that her apparent integrity was only cunning she was punctual that she might be employed again  that she might be entrusted with the contribution which she foresaw must be raised amongst the famishing garrison no sooner had she received the money than her end was gained  dinnertime came  it struck three four five six they listened with hungry ears but no signal was heard the morning had been very long and archer had in vain tried to dissuade them from devouring the remainder of the provisions before they were sure of a fresh supply and now those who had been the most confident were the most impatient of their disappointment  archer in the division of the food had attempted by the most scrupulous exactness to content the public and he was both astonished and provoked to perceive that his impartiality was impeached so differently do people judge in different situations  he was the first person to accuse his master of injustice and the least capable of bearing such an imputation upon himself from others he now experienced some of the joys of power and the delight of managing unreasonable numbers  have not i done every thing i could to please ye  have not i spent my money to buy ye food  have not i divided the last morsel with ye  i have not tasted one mouthful today  did not i set to work for ye at sunrise did not i lie awake all night for ye  have not i had all the labor all the anxiety  look round and see my contrivances my work my generosity  and after all you think me a tyrant because i want you to have common sense  is not this bun which i hold in my hand my own  did not i earn it by my own ingenuity from that selfish dunce pointing to fisher who could never have gotten one of his twelve buns if i had not shown him how eleven of them he has eaten since morning for his own share without offering any mortal a morsel but i scorn to eat even what is justly my own when i see so many hungry creatures longing for it i was not going to touch this last morsel myself i only begged you to keep it till supper time when perhaps you will want it more and townsend who cannot bear the slightest thing that crosses his own whims and who thinks there is nothing in this world to be minded but his own diversion calls me a tyrant  you all of you promised to obey me  the first thing i ask you to do for your own good and when if you had common sense you must know i can want nothing but your good you rebel against me  traitors  fools  ungrateful fools  archer walked up and down unable to command his emotion whilst for the moment the discontented multitude was silenced  here said he striking his hand upon the little boys shoulder here is the only one amongst ye who has not uttered one word of reproach or complaint and he has had but one bit of bread  a bit that i gave him myself this day  here said he snatching the bun which nobody had dared to touch  take it  it is mine  i give it to you though you are a greybeard  you deserve it  eat it and be an archer  you shall be my captain  will you said he listing him up in his arms above the rest  i like you now said the little boy courageously but i love de gray better he has always been my friend and he advised me never to call myself any of those names archer or gray beard so i will not  though i am shut in here i have nothing to do with it  i love dr middleton he was never unjust to me and i dare say that he has very good reasons as de gray said for forbidding us to go into that house  besides it is his own  instead of admiring the good sense and steadiness of this little lad archer suffered townsend to snatch the untasted bun out of his hands he flung it at the hole in the window but it fell back the archers scrambled for it and fisher eat it  archer saw this and was sensible that he had not done handsomely in suffering it a few moments ago he had admired his own generosity and though he had felt the injustice of others he had not accused himself of any he turned away from the little boy and sitting down at one end of the table hid his face in his hands he continued immovable in this posture for some time  lord said townsend it was an excellent joke  pooh said fisher what a fool to think so much about a bun  never mind mr archer if you are thinking about me said the little boy trying gently to pull his hands from his face  archer stooped down and lifted him up upon the table at which sight the enraged partisans set up a general hiss  he has forsaken us  he deserts his party  he wants to be a greybeard  after he has got us all into this scrape he will leave us  i am not going to leave you cried archer  no one shall ever accuse me of deserting my party i will stick by the archers right or wrong i tell you to the last moment but this little fellow  take it as you please mutiny if you will and throw me out of the window  call me traitor coward greybeard  this little fellow is worth you all put together and i will stand by him against whoever dases to lay a finger upon him  and the next morsel of food that i see shall be his  touch him who dares  the commanding air with which archer spoke and looked and the belief that the little boy deserved his protection silenced the crowd but the storm was only hushed  no sound of merriment was now to be heard no battledore and shuttlecock  no ball  no marbles some sat in a corner whispering their wishes that archer would unbar the doors and give up others stretching their arms and gaping as they sauntered up and down the room wished for air or food or water fisher and his nine who had such firm dependence upon the gypsey now gave themselves up to utter despair it was eight oclock growing darker and darker every minute and no candles no light could they have the prospect of another long dark night made them still more discontented townsend at the head of the yawners and fisher at the head of the hungry malcontents gathered round archer and the few yet unconquered spirits demanding how long he meant to keep them in this dark dungeon and whether he expected that they should starve themselves to death for his sake  the idea of giving up was more intolerable to archer than all the rest he saw that the majority his own convincing argument was against him he was therefore obliged to condescend to the arts of persuasion he flattered some with hopes of food from the townboys some he reminded of their promises others he praised for former prowess and others he shamed by the repetition of their high vaunts in the beginning of the business  it was at length resolved that at all events they would hold out with this determination they stretched themselves again to sleep for the second night in weak and weary obstinacy  archer slept longer and more soundly than usual the next morning and when he awoke  he found his hands tied behind him three or four boys had just got hold of his feet which they pressed down whilst the trembling hands of fisher were fastening the cord round them with all the force which rage could inspire archer struggled and roared to his archers  his friends  his party  for help against the traitors  but all kept aloof townsend in particular stood laughing and looking on  i beg your pardon archer but really you look so droll  all alive and kicking  dont be angry  i am so weak i cannot help laughing to day  the packthread cracked  his hands are free  he is loose cried the least of the boys and ran away whilst archer leaped up and seizing hold of fisher with a powerful grasp sternly demanded what he meant by this  ask my party  said fisher terrified  they set me on  ask my party  your party cried archer with a look of ineffable contempt  you reptile  your party  can such a thing as you have a party  to be sure said fisher settling his collar which archer in his surprise had let go  to be sure  why not  any man who chooses it may have a party as well as yourself i suppose  i have my nine fishermen   at these words spoken with much sullen importance archer in spite of his vexation could not help laughing  fishermen cried he fishermen  and why not fishermen as well as archers cried they  one party is just as good as another it is only a question which can get the upper hand  and we had your hands tied just now  that is right townsend said archer laugh on my boy  friend or foe it is all the same to you i know how to value your friendship now you are a mighty good fellow when the sun shines but let a storm come and how you slink away  at this instant archer felt the difference between a good companion and a good friend a difference which some people do not discover till late in life  have i no friend  no real friend amongst ye all and could ye stand by and see my hands tied behind me like a thiefs what signifies such a party  all mute  we want something to eat answered the fishermen  what signifies such a party indeed  and such a manager who can do nothing for one  and have i done nothing  dont let us hear any more prosing said fisher  we are too many for you i have advised my party if they have a mind not to be starved to give you up for the ringleader as you were and dr middleton will let us all off i dare say  so depending upon the sullen silence of the assembly he again approached archer with a cord a cry of no  no  no  dont tie him  was seebly raised  archer stood still  but the moment fisher touched him he knocked him down to the ground and turning to the rest with eyes sparkling with indignation  archers cried he  a voice at this instant was heard at the door  it was de greys voice  i have got a large basket of provisions for your breakfast  a general shout of joy was sent forth by the voracious public  breakfast  provisions  a large basket  de gray lor ever  huzza  de gray promised upon his honor that if they would unbar the door nobody should come in with him and no advantage should be taken of them this promise was enough even for archer  i will let him in said he myself for i am sure he will never break his word  he pulled away the bar  the door opened  and having bargained for the liberty of melsom the little boy who had been shut in by mistake de gray pushed in his basket of provisions and locked and barred the door instantly  joy and gratitude sparkled in every face when he unpacked his basket and spread the table with a plentiful breakfast a hundred questions were asked him at once  eat first said he and we will talk afterward this business was quickly dispatched by people who had not tasted food for several hours their curiosity increased as their hunger diminished  who sent us breakfast  does dr middleton know  were questions reiterated from every mouth  he does know answered de gray and the first thing i have to tell you is that i am your fellow prisoner i am to stay here till you give up this was the only condition on which dr middleton would allow me to bring you ood and he will allow no more  every one looked at the empty basket but archer in whom halfvanquished partyspirit revived with the strength he had got from his breakfast broke into exclamations in praise of de greys magnanimity as he now imagined that de gray was become one of themselves  and you will join us will you  that is a noble fellow  no answered de gray calmly but i hope to persuade or rather to convince you that you ought to join me  you would have found it no hard task to have persuaded or convinced us whichever you pleased said townsend if you had appealed to archers fasting but archers feasting are quite other animals even caesar himself after breakfast is quite another thing added he pointing to archer  you may speak for yourself mr townsend replied the insulted hero but not for me or for archers in general if you please we unbarred the door upon the faith of de greys promise  that was not giving up and it would have been just as difficult i promise you to persuade or convince me either that i should give up against my honor before breakfast as after  this spirited speech was applauded by many who had now forgotten the feelings of famine not so fisher whose memory was upon this occasion very distinct  what nonsense  and the orator paused for a synonymous expression but none was at hand what nonsense and  nonsense is here  why dont you remember that dinnertime and suppertime and breakfasttime will come again  so what signifies mouthing about persuading and convincing  we will not go through again what we did yesterday  honor me no honor i dont understand it  i would rather be flogged at once as i have been manys the good time for a less thing  i say wed better all be flogged at once which must be the end of it sooner or later than wait here to be without dinner breakfast and supper all only because mr archer will not give up because of his honor and nonsense  many prudnt faces amongst the fishermen seemed to deliberate at the close of this oration in which the arguments were brought to home to each mans business and bosom  but said de gray when we yield i hope it will not be merely to get our dinner gentlemen  when we yield archer    dont address yourself to me interrupted archer struggling with his pride you have no farther occasion to try to win me  i have no power no party you see  and now i find that i have no friends i dont care what becomes of myself  i suppose i am to be given up as ringleader  here is this fisher and a party of his fishermen were going to tie me hand and foot if i had not knocked him down just as you came to the door de gray and now perhaps you will join fishers party against me  de gray was going to assure him that he had no intention of joining any party when a sudden change appeared in archers countenance  silence cried archer in an imperious tone and there was silence some one was heard to whistle the beginning of a tune that was perfectly new to every body present except to archer who immediately whistled the conclusion  there cried he looking at de gray with triumph  that is a method of holding secret correspondence whilst a prisoner which i learned from richard coeur de lion i know how to make use of every thing  holla friend are you there at last cried he going to the ventilator  yes but we are barred out here  round to the window then and fill our bag well let it down my lad in a trice bar me out who can  archer let down the bag with all the expedition of joy and it was filled with al the expedition of fear   ull away  make hste for heavens sake said the voice from without the gardener will come from dinner else and we shall be caught he mounted grd all yesterday at the ventilator and though i watched and watched till it was darker than pitch i could not get near you  i dont know what has taken him out of the way now  make haste pull away  the heavy bag was soon pulied up  have you any more said archer  yes plenty  let down quick iv got the taylors bag full which is three times s large as yours and i have changed clothes with the taylors boy so nobody took notice of me as i came down the street  there is my own cousin exclaimed archer  there is a noble fellow  there is my own cousin i acknowledge  fill the bag then  several times the bag descended and ascended and at every unlading of the crane fresh acclamations were heard  i have no more at length the boy with the taylors bag cried  off with you then we have enough and thank you  a delightful review was now made of their treasure busy hands arranged and sorted the heterogeneous mass archer in the height of his glory looked on the acknowledged master of the whole townsend who in prosperity as in adversity saw and enjoyed the comic foibles of his friends pushed de gray who was looking on with a more goodnatured and more thoughtful air  friend said he you look like a great philosopher and archer like a great hero  and you townsend said archer may look like a wit if you will but you will never be a hero  no no replied townsend wits are never heroes because they are wits  you are out of your wits and therefore may set up for a hero  laugh and welcome  i am not a tyrant  i dont want to restrain any bodys wit but i cannot say i admire puns  nor i neither said the timeserving fisher sidling up to the manager and picking the ice off a piece of plumbcake nor i neither  i hate puns i can never understand townsends puns besides any body can make puns and one does not want wit either at all times for instance when one is going to settle about dinner or business of consequence  bless us all archer continued he with sudden familiarity  what a sight of good things are here  i am sure we are much obliged to you and your cousin  i never thought he would have come  why now we can hold out as long as you please  let us see said he dividing the provisions upon the table we can hold out today and all tomorrow and part of next day may be  why now we may defy the doctor and the greybeards  and the doctor will surely give up to us for you see he knows nothing of all this and he will think we are starving all this while and he would be afraid you see to let us starve quite in reality for three whole days because of what would be said in the town my aunt barbara for one would be at him long before that time was out and besides you know in that there case he would be hanged for murder which is quite another thing in law from a barring out you know  archer had not given to this harangue all the attention which it deserved for his eye was fixed upon de gray  what is de gray thinking of he asked impatiently  i am thinking said de gray that dr middleton must believe that i have betrayed his confidence in me the gardener was ordered away from his watchpost for one halfhour when i was admitted this halfhour the gardener has made nearly an hour i never would have come amongst you if i had foreseen all this dr middleton trusted me and now he will repent of his confidence in me  de gray cried archer with energy he shall not repent of his confidence in you nor shall you repent of coming amongst us you shall find that we have some honor as well as yourself and i will take care of your honor as if it were my own  heyday interrupted townsend are heroes allowed to change sides pray and does the chief of the archers stand talking sentiment to the chief of the greybeards  in the middle of his own party too  party repeated archer disdainfully i have done with parties  i see what parties are have done with parties  i see what parties are made of  i have felt the want of a friend and i am determined to make one if i can  that you may do said de gray stretching out his hand  unbar the doors  unbar the windows  away with all these things  i give up for de greys sake he shall not lose his credit on my account  no said de gray you shall not give up for my sake  well then i will give up to do what is honorable said archer  why not to do what is reasonable said de gray   reasonable  oh the first thing that a man of spirit should think of is what is honorable  but how will he find out what is honorable unless he can reason  oh said archer his own feelings always tell him what is honorable  have not your feelings changed within these few hours  yes with circumstances but right or wrong as long as i think it honorable to do so and so i am satisfied  but you cannot think any thing honorable or the contrary without reasoning and as to what you call feeling it is only a quick sort of reasoning  the quicker the better said archer  perhaps not said de gray we are apt to reason best when we are not in quite so great a burry  but said archer we have not always time enought to reason at first  you must however acknowledge replid de gray smiling that no man but a fool thinks it honorable to be in the wrong at last is it not therefore best to begin by reasoning to find out the right at first  to be sure  and did you reason with yourself at first and did you find out that it was right to bar dr middleton out of his own schoolroom because he desired you not to go into one of his own houses  no but i should never have thought of heading a barring out if he had not shown partiality and if you had flown into a passion with me openly at once for pulling down your scenery which would have been quite natural and not have gone slily and forbid us the house out of revenge there would have been none of this work  why said de gray should you suspect me of such a mean action when you have never seen or known me do any thing mean and when in this instance you have no proofs  will you give me your word and honor now de gray before every body here that you did not do what i suspected  i do assure you upon my honor i never directly or indirectly spoke to dr middleton about the playhouse  then said archer i am as glad as if i had found a thousand pounds  now you are my friend indeed  and dr middleton  why should you suspect him without reason any more than me  as to that said archer he is your friend and you are right to defend him and i will not say another word against him  will that satisfy you  not quite  not quite  then indeed you are unreasonable  no for i dont wish you to yield out of friendship to me any more than to honor  if you yield to reason you will be governed by reason another time  well but then dont triumph over me because you have the best side of the argument  not i  how can i said de gray for now you are on the best side as well as myself are not you so we may triumph together  you are a good friend said archer and with great eagerness be pulled down the fortifications whilst every hand assisted the room was restored to order in a few minutes the shutters were thrown open the cheerful light let in the windows were thrown up and the first feeling of the fresh air was delightful the green playground appeared before them and the hopes of exercise and liberty brightened the countenances of these voluntary prisoners  but alas they were not yet at liberty the idea of dr middleton and the dread of his vengeance smote their hearts when the rebels had sent an ambassador with their surrender they stood in pale and silent suspense waiting for their doom  ah said fisher looking up at the broken panes in the windows the doctor will think the most of that  he will never forgive us for that  hush here he comes  his steady step was heard approaching nearer and nearer  archer threw open the door and dr middleton entered  fisher instantly fell on his knees  it is no delight to me to see people on their knees stand up mr fisher  i hope you are all conscious that you have done wrong  sir said archer they are conscious that they have done wrong and so am i i am the ringleader  punish me as you think proper  i submit your punishments  your vengeance ought to fall on me alone  sir said dr middleton calmly i perceive that whatever else you may have learned in the course of your education you have not been taught the meaning of the word punishment punishment and vengeance do not with us mean the same thing punishment is pain given with the reasonable hope of preventing those on whom it is inflicted from doing in future what will hurt themselves or others vegance never looks to the future but is the exion of anger for an injury that is past i ein anger  you have done me no injury  here many of the little boys looked timidly up to the windows  yes i se that you have broken my windows that is a small evil  oh sir how good how merciful exclaimed those who had been most panicsruck  he forgives us  stay resumed dr middleton i cannot forgive you  i shall never reveng but it is my duty to punish  you have rbned against the just authority wien is necessary to conuct and govern you whilst you have not sufficient reason to govern and conduct yourselves  without obedience to your master as children you cannot be educate   out obedience to the laws added he turning to archer as men you cannot be suffered in society  you sir think yourself a man i observe and you think it the part of a man not to submit to the will of another i have no pleasure in making others whether men or children submit to my will but my reason and experience are superior to yours  your parents at least think so or they would not have entrusted me with the care of your education as long as they do entrust you to my care and as long as i have any hops or maing you wiser and better by punishment i shall steadily inflict it whenever i judge it to ben cessary and i judge it to be necessary now this is a long sermon mr archer not preached to show my own eloquence but to convince your understanding  now as to your punishment    name it sir said archer whatever it is i will cheerfully submit to it  name it yourselt said dr middleton and show me that you now understand the nature of punishment  archer proud to be treted like a reasonable creature and sorry that he had behaved like a foolish schoolboy was silent for some time but at length replied that he would rather ot name his own punishment he repeated however that he trusted he should bear it well whatever it might be  i shall then said dr middleton deprive you for two months of pocket money as you have had too much and have made a bad use of it  sir said archer i brought five guineas with me to school  this guinea is all that i have left  dr middleton received the guinea which archer offered him with a look of approbation and told him that it should be applied to the repairs of the schoolroom the rest of the boys waited in silence for the doctors sentence against them but not with those looks of abject fear with which boys usually expect the sentence of a schoolmaster  you shall return from the playground all of you said dr middieton one quarter of an hour sooner for two months to come than the rest of your companions a bell shall ring at the appointed time i give you an opportunity of recovering my confidence by your punctuality  oh sir we will come the instant the very instant the bell rings  you shall have confidence in us cried they eagerly  i deserve your confidence i hope said dr middleton for it is my first wish to make you all happy  you do not know the pain that it has cost me to deprive you of food for so many hours  here the boys with one accord ran to the place where they had deposited their last supplies  archer delivered them up to the doctor proud to show that they were not reduced to obedience merely by necessity  the reason resumed dr middleton ving now returned to the usual benignity of his manner  the reason why i desired that ne of you should go to that building pointing out of the window was this i had been informed that a gang of gypsies had slept there the night before i spoke to you one of whom was dangerously ill of a putrid sever i did not choose to mention my reason to you at that time for fear of alarming you or your friends i have had the place cleaned and you may return to it when you please the gypsies were yesterday removed from the town  de gray you were in the right whispered archer and it was i that was unjust  the old woman continued the doctor whom you employed to buy food has escaped the fever but she has not escaped a gaol whither she was sent yesterday for having defrauded you of your money  mr fisher said dr middleton as to you i shall not punish you  i have no hope of making you either wiser or better  do you know this paper  the paper appeared to be a bill for candles and a tinderbox  i desired him to buy those things sir said archer coloring  and did you desire him not to pay for them  no said archer he had half a crown on purpose to pay for them  i know he had but he chose to apply it to his own private use and gave it to the gypsey to buy twelve buns for his own eating to obtain credit for the tinderbox and candles he made use of this name said he turning to the other de of the bill and pointing to de greys name which was written at the end of a copy of one of de greys exercises  i assure you sir cried archer   you need not assure me sir said dr middleton i cannot suspect a boy of your temper of having any part in so base an action  when the people in the shop refused to let mr fisher have the things without paying for them he made use of de greys name who was known there suspecting some mischief however from the purchase of the tinderbox the shopkeeper informed me of the circumstance nothing in this whole business gave me half so much pain as i felt for a moment when i suspected that de gray was concerned in it  a loud cry in which archers voice was heard most distinctly declared de greys innocence dr middleton looked round at their eager honest faces with benevolent approbation  archer said he taking him by the hand i am heartily glad to see that you have got the better of your partyspirit  i wish you may keep such a friend as you have now beside you  one such friend is worth two such parties  as for you mr fisher  depart  you must never return hither again  in vain he solicited archer and de gray to intercede for him every body turned away with contempt and he speaked out whimpering in a doleful voice  what shall i say to my aunt barbara  end of part the first
