eloisa to abelard     eloisa to abelard  written by mr pope  the second edition  london printed for bernard lintot at the crosskeys between the templegates in fleet street mdccxx  the argument abelard and eloisa flourished in the twelsth century they were two of the most dislinguishd persons of their age in learning and beauty but for nothing more famous than for their unfortunate passon after a long course of calamities they retired each to a several convent and consecrated the remainder of their days to religion it was many years after this separation that a letter of abelards to a friend which contained the history of his misfortunes fell into the hands of eloisa this awakening all her tenderness occasioned those celebrated letters out of which the following is partly extracted which give so lively a picture of the struggles of grace and nature virtue and passion  eloisa to abelard in these deep solitudes and awful cells where heavenly pensive contemplation dwells and evermusing melancholy reigns what means this tumult in a vestals veins why rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat vhy feels my heart its longforgotten heat yet yet i love  from abelard it came and eloisa yet must kiss the name dear fatal name rest ever unreveald nor pass these lips in holy silence sealed hide it my heart within that close disguise where mixed with gods his loved idea lies oh write it not my hand  the name appears already written  wash it out my tears in vain lost eloisa weeps and prays her heart still dictates and her hand obeys relentless walls whose darksom round contains repentant sighs and voluntary pains ye rugged rocks which holy knees have worn ye grots and caverns shaggd with horrid thorn shrines where their vigils paleeyd virgins keep and pitying saints whose statues learn to weep though cold like you unmoved and silent grown i have not yet forgot my self to stone heaven claims me all in vain while he has part still rebel nature holds out half my heart nor prayers nor fasts its stubborn pulse restrain nor tears for ages taught to flow in vain soon as thy letters trembling i unclose that wellknown name awakens all my woes o name for ever sad for ever dear still breathed in sighs still ushered with a tear i tremble too wherever my own i find some dire misfortune follows close behind line after line my gushing eyes overflow led through a sad variety of woe now warm in love now withering in thy bloom lost in a convents solitary gloom there stern religion quenched the unwilling flame there died the best of passions love and fame yet write oh write me all that i may join griefs to thy griess and echo sighs to thine nor foes nor fortune take this power away and is my abelard less kind than they tears still are mine and those i need not spare love but demands what else were shed in prayer no happier task these faded eyes pursue to read and weep is all they now can do then share thy pain allow that sad relief ah more than share it give me all thy grief heaven first taught letters for some wretches aid some banished lover or some captive maid they live they speak they breathe what love inspires warm from the soul and faithful to its fires the virgins wish without her fears impart excuse the blush and pour out all the heart speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul and waft a sigh from indus to the pole thou know how guiltless first i met thy flame when love approached me under friendfhips name my fancy formed thee of angelick kind some emanation of the allbeauteous mind those smiling eyes attempring every ray shone sweetly lambent with celestial day guiltless i gazed heaven listened while you sung and truths he was her preceptor in philosophy and divinity divine came mended from that tongue from lips like those what precept failed to move too soon they taught me twas no sin to love back through the paths of pleasing sense i ran nor wished an angel whom i loved a man dim and remote the joys of saints i fee nor envy them that heaven i lose for thee how often when pressed to marriage have i said curse on all laws but those which love has made love free as air at sight of human ties spreads his light wings and in a moment flies let wealth let honor wait the wedded dame august her deed and sacred be her fame before true passion all thofe views remove fame wealth and honor what are you to love the jealous god when we profane his fires those restless passions in revenge inspires and bids them make mistaken mortals groan who seek in love for ought but love alone should at my feet the worlds great master fall himself his throne his world i would scorn em all not caesars empress would i deign to prove no make me mistress to the man i love if there be yet another name more free more fond than mistress make me that to thee o happy state when souls each other draw when love is liberty and nature law all then is full possessing and possessed no craving void left aching in the breast even thought meets thought ever from the lips it part and each warm wish springs mutual from the heart this sure is bliss if bliss on earth there be and once the lot of abelard and me alas how changed what sudden horrors rise a naked lover bound and bleeding lies where where was eloise her voice her hand her poniard had opposed the dire command barbarian stay that bloody hand restrain the crime was common common be the pain i can no more by shame by rage suppressed let tears and burning blushes speak the rest can thou forget that sad that solcmn day when victims at yon altars foot we lay can thou forget what tears that moment fell when warm in youth i bade the world farewell as with cold lips i kissed the sacred veil the shrines all trembled and the lamps grew pale heaven scarce believed the conquest it surveyed and saints with wonder heard the vows i made yet then to those dread altars as i drew not on the cross my eyes were fixed but you not grace or zeal love only was my call and if i lose thy love i lose my all come with thy looks thy words relieve my woe those still at least are left thee to bestow still on that breast enamored let me lie still drink delicious poison from thy eye pant on thy lip and to thy heart be pressed give all thou can  and let me dream the rest ah no instruct me other joys to prize with other beauties charm my partial eyes full in my view set all the bright abode and make my soul quit abelard for god ah think at least thy flock deserve thy care plants of thy hand and children of thy prayer from the false world in early youth they fled by thee to mountains wilds and deserts led you he founded the monastery raised these hallowed walls the desert smiled and paradise was opened in the wild no weeping orphan saw his fathers stores our shrines irradiate or emblaze the floors no silver saints by dying misers given here bribed the rage of illrequited heaven but such plain roofs as piety could raise and only vocal with the makers praise in these lone walls their days eternal bound these mossgrown domes with spiry turrets crowned where awful arches make a noonday night and the dim windows shed a solemn light thy eyes diffused a reconciling ray and gleams of glory brightened all the day but now no face divine contentment wears it is all blank fadness or continual tears see how the force of others prayers i try oh pious fraud of amorous charity but why should i on others prayers depend come thou my father brother husband friend ah let thy handmaid sister daughter move and all those tender names in one thy love the darksom pines that over yon rocks reclined wave high and murmur to the hollow wind the wandering streams that shine between the hills the grots that echo to the tinkling rills the dying gales that pant upon the trees the lakes that quiver to the curling breeze no more these scenes my meditation aid or lull to rest the visionary maid but over the twilight groves and dusky caves longfounding isles and intermingled graves black melancholy sits and round her throws a deathlike silence and a dread repose her gloomy presence saddens all the scene shades every flower and darkens every green deepens the murmur of the falling floods and breathes a browner horror on the woods yet here for ever ever must i stay sad proof how well a lover can obey death only death can break the lasting chain and here even then shall my cold dust remain here all its frailties all its flames resign and wait till it is no sin to mix with thine ah wretch believed the spouse of god in vain confessed within the slave of love and man assist me heaven but whence arose that prayer sprung it from piety or from despair even here where frozen chastity retires love finds an altar for forbidden fires i ought to grieve but cannot what i ought i mourn the lover not lament the fault i view my crime but kindle at the view repent old pleasures and solicit new now turned to heaven i weep my past offense now think of thee and curse my innocence of all affliction taught a lover yet it is sure the hardesl science to forget how shall i lose the sin yet keep the sense and love the offender yet detest the offense how the dear object from the crime remove or how distinguish penitence from love unequal task a passion to resign for hearts so touched so pierced so lost as mine ever such a soul regains its peaceful state how often must it love how often hate how often hope despair resent regret conceal disdain  do all things but forget but let heaven seize it all at once it is fired not touched but rapt not wakened but inspired oh come oh teach me nature to subdue renounce my love my life my self  and you fill my fond heart with god alone for he alone can rival can succeed to thee how happy is the blameless vestals lot the world forgetting by the world forgot eternal sunshine of the spotless mind each prayer accepted and each wish resigned labor and rest that equal periods keep  obedient slumbers that can wake and weep desires composed affections ever even tears that delight and sighs that waft to heaven grace shines around her with serenest beams and whispering angels prompt her golden dreams for her the spouse prepares the bridal ring for her white virgins hymenaeals sing for her the unfading rose of eden blooms and wings of seraphs shed divine perfumes to founds of heavenly harps she dies away and melts in visions of eternal day far other dreams my erring soul employ far other raptures of unholy joy when at the close of each sad sorrowing day fancy restores what vengeance snatched away then conscience sleeps and leaving nature free all my loose soul unbounded springs to thee o cursed dear horrors of allconscious night how glowing guilt exalts the keen delight provoking demons all restraint remove and stir within me every source of love i hear thee view thee gaze over all thy charms and round thy phantom glue my clasping arms i wake  no more i hear no more i view the phantom flies me as unkind as you i call aloud it hears not what i say i stretch my empty arms it glides away to dream once more i close my willing eyes ye soft illusions dear deceits arise alas no more  methinks we wandering go through dreary wastes and weep each others woe where round some mouldering tower pale ivy creeps and lowbrowd rocks hang nodding over the deeps sudden you mount you becken from the skies clouds interpose waves roar and winds arise i shriek start up the same sad prospect find and wake to all the griefs i left behind for thee the fates severely kind ordain a cool suspense from pleasure and from pain thy life a long dead calm of fixed repose no pulse that riots and no blood that glows still as the sea ever winds were taught to blow or moving spirit bade the waters flow soft as the slumbers of a saint forgiven and mild as opening gleams of promised heaven come abelard for what have thou to dread the torch of venus burns not for the dead cut from the root my perished joys i see and loves warm tide for ever stopped in thee nature stands checked religion disapproves even thou art cold  yet eloisa loves ah hopeless lasting flames like those that burn to light the dead and warm the unfruitful urn what scenes appear wherever i turn my view the dear ideas where i fly pursue rise in the grove before the altar rise stain all my soul and wanton in my eyes i waste the matin lamp in sighs for thee thy image steals between my god and me thy voice i seem in every hymn to hear with evrv bead i drop too soft a tear when from the censer clouds of flagrance roll and swelling organs lift the rising soul one thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight priestis tapers temples swim before my fight in seas of flame my plunging soul is drowned while altars blaze and angels tremble round while prostrate here in humble grief i lie kind virtuous drops just gathering in my eye while praying trembling in the dust i roll and dawning grace is opening on my soul come if thou dare all charming as thou art oppose thy self to heaven dispute my heart come with one glance of those deluding eyes blot out each bright idea of the skies take back that grace those sorrows and those tears take back my fruitless penitence and prayers snatch me just mounting from the blessed abode assit the fiends and tear me from my god no fly me fly me far as pole from pole rise alps between us and whole oceans roll ah come not write not think not once of me nor share one pang of all i felt for thee thy oaths i quit thy memory resign forget renounce me hate whatever was mine fair eyes and tempting looks which yet i view long loved adored ideas all adieu o grace serene oh virtue heavenly fair divine oblivion of lowthoughted care fresh blooming hope gay daughter of the sky and faith our early immortality enter each mild each amicable guest receive and wrap me in eternal rest see in her cell sad eloisa spread propt in some tomb a neighbor of the dead in each low wind methinks a spirit calls and more than echoes talk along the walls here as i watched the dying lamps around from yonder shrine i heard a hollow sound come sister come it said or seemed to say thy place is here sad sister come away once like thy self i trembled wept and prayed loves victim then though now a sainted maid but all is calm in this eternal sleep here grief forgets to groan and love to weep even superstition loses every fear for god not man absolves our frailties here i come ye ghosts prepare your roseate bowers celestial palms and ever blooming flowers thither where sinners may have rest i go where flames refined in breasts seraphic glow thou abelard the last sad office pay and smooth my passage to the realms of day see my lips tremble and my eye balls roll suck my last breath and catch the flying soul ah no  in sacred vestments may thou stand the hallowed taper trembling in thy hand present the cross before my lifted eye teach me at once and learn of me to die ah then thy oncelovd eloisa see it will be then no crime to gaze on me see from my cheek the transient roses fly see the last sparkle languish in my eye till every motion pulse and breath be over and even my abelard beloved no more o death alleloquent you only prove what dust we dote on when it is man we love then too when fate shall thy fair frame destroy that cause of all my guilt and all my joy in trance ecstatic may thy pangs be drowned bright clouds descend and angels watch thee round from opening skies may streaming glories shine and saints embrace thee with a love like mine may abelard and eloisa were interred in the same grave or in monuments adjoining in the monastery of the paraclete he died in the year      she in      one kind grave unite each hapless name and graft my love immortal on thy same then ages hence when all my woes are over when this rebellious heart shall beat no more if ever chance two wandering lovers brings to paracletes white walls and silver springs over the pale marble shall they join their heads and drink the falling tears each other sheds then sadly say with mutual pity moved oh may we never love as these have loved from the full quire when loud hosannas rise and swell the pomp of dreadful sacrifice amid that scene if some relenting eye glance on the stone where our cold relics lie devotions self shall steal a thought from heaven one human tear shall drop and be forgiven and sure if fate some future bard shall join in sad similitude of griefs to mine condemned whole years in absence to deplore and image charms he must behold no more such if there be who loves so long so well let him our sad our tender story tell the wellsung woes shall sooth my pensive ghost he best can paint em who shall feel em most verses to the memory of an unfortunate lady verses to the memory of an unfortunate lady what beckning ghost along the moonlight shade invites my steps and points to yonder glade it is she  but why that bleeding bosom gored why dimly gleams the visionary sword oh ever beauteous ever friendly tell is it in heaven a crime to love too well to bear too tender or too firm a heart to act a lovers or a romans part is there no bright reversion in the sky for those who greatly think or bravely die why bade ye else ye powers her soul aspire above the vulgar flight of low desire ambition first sprung from your blessed abodes the glorious fault of angels and of gods thence to their images on earth it flows and in the breasts of kings and heroes glows most souls it is true but peep out once an age dull sullen prisoners in the bodys cage dim lights of life that burn a length of years useless unseen as lamps in sepulchers like eastern kings a lazy state they keep and close confined in their own palace sleep from these perhaps ever nature bade her die fate snatched her early to the pitying sky as into air the purer spirits flow and separate from their kindred dregs below so flew the soul to its congenial place nor left one virtue to redeem her race but thou false guardian of a charge too good thou mean deserter of thy brothers blood see on these ruby lips the trembling breath these cheeks now fading at the blast of death cold is that breast which warmed the world before and those lovedarting eyes must roll no more thus if eternal justice rules the ball thus shall your wives and thus your children fall on all the line a sudden vengeance waits and frequent herses shall besiege your gates there passengers shall stand and pointing say while the long funrals blacken all the way lo these were they whose souls the furies steeled and cursed with hearts unknowing how to yield thus unlamented pass the proud away the gaze of fools and pageant of a day so perish all whose breast never learned to glow for others good or melt at others woe what can atone oh everinjurd shade thy fate unpitied and thy rites unpaid no friends complaint no kind domnestic tear pleased thy pale ghost or graced thy mournful bier by foreign hands thy dying eyes were closed by foreign hands thy decent limbs composed by foreign hands thy humble grave adorned by strangers honored and by strangers mourned what though no friends in sable weeds appear grieve for an hour perhaps then mourn a year and bear about the mockery of woe to midnight dances and the public show what though no weeping loves thy ashes grace nor polished marble emulate thy face what though no sacred earth allow the room nor hallowed dirge be uttered over thy tomb yet shall thy grave with rising flowers be dressed and the green turf lie lightly on thy breast there shall the morn her earliest tears bestow there the first roses of the year shall blow while angels with their silver wings oershade the ground now sacred by thy relics made so peaceful rests without a stone a name what once had beauty titles wealth and fame how loved how honored once avails thee not to whom related or by whom begot a heap of dust alone remains of thee it is all thou art and all the proud shall be poets themselves must fall like those they sung deaf the praised ear and mute the tuneful tongue even he whose soul now melts in mournful lays shall shortly want the generous tear he pays then from his closing eyes thy form shall part and the last pang shall tear thee from his heart lifes idle business at one gasp be over the muse forgot and thou beloved no more florelio a pastoral lamenting the death of the late marquis of blandford by mr fenton ask not the cause why all the tuneful swains who used to fill the vales with tender strains in deep despair neglect the warbling reed and all their bleating flocks refuse to feed ask not why greens and flowers so late appear to cloth the glebe and deck the springing year why sounds the lawn with loud laments and cries and swollen with tears to floods the rivlets rise the fair florelio now has left the plain and is the grief who was the grace of every british swain for thee loved youth on every vale and lawn the nymphs and all thy fellowshepherds moan the little birds now cease to sing and love silent they sit and droop on every grove no mounting lark now warbles on the wing nor linnets chirp to cheer the sullen spring only the melancholy turtles coo and philomel by night repeats her woe o charmer of the shades the tale prolong nor let the morning interrupt thy song or softly tune thy tender notes to mine forgetting tereus make my sorrows thine now the dear youth has left the lonely plain and is the grief who was the grace of every british swain say all ye shades where late he used to rest if ever your beds with lovelier swain were pressed say all ye silver streams if ever ye bore the image of so fair a face before but now ye streams assist me whilst i mourn for never must the lovely swain return and as these flowing tears increase your tide o murmur for the shepherd as ye glide be sure ye rocks while i my grief disclose let your sad echos lengthen out my woes ye breezes bear the plaintive accents on and whispering tell the woods florelios gone for ever gone and left the lonely plain and is the grief who was the grace of every british swain ripe strawberries for thee and peaches grew sweet to the taste and tempting red to view for thee the rose put sweeter purple on preventing by her haste the summersun but now the flowers all pale and blighted lie and in cold sweats of sickly mildew die nor can the bees suck from the shriveld blooms aetherial sweets to store their golden combs ort on thy lips they would their labors leave and sweeter odours from thy mouth receive sweet as the breath of flora when she lies in jesmin shades and for young zephyr sighs but now those lips are cold relentless death has chilled their charms and stopped thy balmy breath those eyes where cupid tippd his darts with fire and kindled in the coldest nymphs desire robbed of their beams in everlasting night are closed and give us woe as once delight and thou dear youth have left the lonely plain and art the grief who were the grace of every british swain as in his bower the dying shepherd lay the shepherd yet so young and once so gay the nymphs that swim the stream and range the wood and haunt the flowery meads around him stood there tears down each fair cheek unbounded fell and as he gaspd they gave a sad farewell softly they cried as sleeping flowers  by night be thy dear eyes by  a gentle fall may thy young beauties have and golden slumbers wait thee in thy grave yearly thy hearse with garlands well adorn and teach young nightingales for thee to mourn bees love the blooms the flocks the bladed grain nor less were thou beloved by every swain come shepherds come perform the funeral due for he was ever good and kind to you on every smoothest beech in every grove in weeping characters record your love and as in memory of adoms slain when for the youth the syrian maids complain his river to record the guilty day with freshly bleeding purple stains the sea so thou dear came contribute to our woe and bid thy stream in plaintive murmurs flow thy head with thy own willow boughs adorn and with thy tears supply the frugal urn the swains their sheep the nymphs shall leave the lawn and yearly on their banks renew their moan his mother while they there lament shall be the queen of love the loved adonis he on her like venus all the graces wait and he too like adonis in his fate for fresh in fragrant youth he left the plain and is the grief who was the grace of every british swain no more the nymphs that over the brooks preside dress their gay beauties by the crystal tide nor fly the wintry winds nor scorching sun now he for whom they strove to charm is gone often they beneath their reedy coverts sighed and looked and longed and for florelio died of him they sang and with soft ditties strove to sooth the pleasing agonies of love but now they roam distracted with despair and cypress twined with mournful willows wear thus hand in hand around his grave they go and saffion buds and fading lillies strew with sprigs of myrtle mixed and scattering cry so sweet and soft the shepherd was so soon decreed to die there fresh in dear remembrance of their woes his name the young anemonies disclose nor strange they should a double grief avow then venus wept and pastorella now breathe soft ye winds long let them paint the plain unhurt untouched by every passing swain and when ye nymphs to make the garlands gay with which ye crown the mistress of the may ye shall these flowers to bind her temples take o pluck them gently for florelios sake and when through woodstocks green retreats ye stray or altrops flowery vales invite to play over which young pastorellas beauties bring elyzium early and improve the spring when evening gales attentive silence keep and heaven its balmy dew begins to weep by the soft fall of every warbling stream sigh your said airs and bless the shepherds name there to the tender lute attune your woe while hyacinths and myrtles round you grow so may sylvanus ever tend your bowers and zephyr brush the mildew from the flowers bid all the swans from came and isis haste in the melodious quire to breath their last o colin colin could i there complain like thee when young philisides was slain thou sweet frequenter of the muses stream why have i not thy voice or thou my theme though weak my voice though lowly be my lays they shall be sacred to the shepherds praise to him my voice to him my lays belong and bright myrtilla now must live unsung even she whose artless beauty blessed me more than ever swain was blessed by nymph before while every tender sigh to seal our bliss brought a kind vow and every vow a kiss fair chaste and kind yet now no more can move so much my grief is stronger than my love now the dear youth has left the lonely plain and is the grief who was the grace of every british swain as when some cruel hind has born away the turtles nest and made the yuung his prey sad in her native grove she sits alone there hangs her wings and murmurs out her moan so the bright shepherdess who bore the boy beneath a baleful yew does weeping lie nor can the fair the weighty woe sustain but bends like roses crushed with falling rain nor from the silent earth her eyes removes that weeping languish like a dying doves not such her look severe reverse of fate when little loves in every dimple sat and all the smiles delighted to resort on the calm heaven of her soft cheeks to sport soft as the clouds mild aprilevnings wear which drop fresh flourets on the youthful year the fountains fall cannot lull her wakeful woes nor poppygarlands give the nymph repose through prickly brakes and unfrequented groves over hills and dales and craggy cliffs she roves and when she spies beneath some silent shade the daisies pressed where late his limbs were laid to the cold print there close she joins her face and all with gushing tears bedews the grass there with loud plaints she wounds the pitying skies and oh return my lovely youth she cries return florelio with thy wonted charms fill the soft circles of my longing arms  cease fair affliction cease the lovely boy in deaths cold arms must pale and breathless lie the fates can never change their first decree or sure they would have changed this one for thee pan for his syrinx makes eternal moan ceres her daughter lost and thou thy son the son for ever now has left the plain and is the grief who was the grace of every british swain adieu ye mossy caves and shady groves once happy scenes of our successful loves ye hungry herds and bleating flocks adieu flints be your beds and browze the bitter yew two lambs alone shall be my charge to feed for yearly on his grave two lambs shall bleed this pledge of lasting love dear shade receive it is all alas a shepherds love can give but grief from its own power will set me free will send me soon a willing ghost to thee cropped in the flowery spring of youth i will go with hasty joy to wait thy shade below in everfragrant meads and jesminbowrs well dwell and all elyzium shall be ours where citron groves aetherial odours breath and streams of flowing crystal purl beneath where all are everyoung and heavenly fair as here above thy sister graces are upon the death of her husband by mrs elizabeth singer in what soft language shall my thoughts get free my dear alexis when i talk of thee ye muses graces all ye gentle train of weeping loves assist the pensive strain but why should i implore your moving art it is but to speak the dictates of my heart and all that knew the charming youth will join their friendly sighs and pious tears to mine for all that knew his merit must confess in grief for him there can be no excess his soul was formed to act each glorious part of life unstained with vanity or art no thought within his generous mind had birth but what he might have owned to heaven and earth practiced by him each virtue grew more bright and shone with more than its own native light whatever noble warmth could recommend the just the active and the constant friend was all his own but oh a dearer name and softer ties my endless sorrow claim lost in despair distracted and forlorn the lover i and tender husband mourn whatever to such superior worth was due whatever excess the fondest passion knew i felt for thee dear youth my joys my care my prayers themselves were thine and only where thou wast concerned my virtue was sincere whenever i begged for blessings on thy head nothing was cold or formal that i said my warmest vows to heaven were made for thee and love still mingled with my piety oh thou wast all my glory all my pride through lifes uncertain paths my constant guide regardless of the world to gain thy praise was all that could my just ambition raise why has my heart this fond engagement known or why has heaven dissolved the tie so soon why was the charming youth so formed to move or why was all my soul so turned for love but virtue here a vain defense had made where so much worth and eloquence could plead for he could talk  twas ecstasy to hear twas joy twas harmony to every ear eternal music dwelt upon his tongue sost and transporting as the muses song listening to him my cares were charmed to rest and love and silent rapture filled my breast unheeded the gay moments took their flight and time was only measured by delight i hear the loved the melting accent still and still the warm the tender transport feel again i see the sprightly passions rise and life and pleasure kindle in his eyes my fancy paints him now with every grace but ah the dear resemblance mocks my fond embrace the flattering vision takes its hasty flight and scenes of horror swim before my sight grief and despair in all their terrors rise a dying lover pale and gasping lies each dismal circumstance appears in view the fatal object is for ever new his anguish with the quickest sense i feel and hear this sad this moving language still my dearest wife my last my fondest care sure heaven for thee will hear a dying prayer be thou the charge of sacred providence when i am gone be that thy kind defense ten thousand smiling blessings crown thy head when i am cold and numbered with the dead think on thy vows be to my memory just my future fame and honor are thy trust from all engagements here i now am free but that which keeps my lingering soul with thee how much i love thy bleeding heart can tell which does like mine the pangs of parting feel but haste to meet me on the happy plains where mighty love in endless triumph reigns he ceased then gently yielded up his breath and fell a blooming sacrifice to death but oh what words what numbers can express what thought conceive the height of my distress why did they tear me from thy breathless clay i should have stayed and wept my life away yet gentle shade whether thou now do rove through some blessed vale or ever verdant grove one moment listen to my grief and take the softest vows that ever love can make for thee all thoughts of pleasure i forego for thee my tears shall never cease to flow for thee at once i from the world retire to feed in silent shades a hopeless fire my bosom all thy image shall retain the full impression there shall still remain as thou have taught my tender heart to prove the noblest height and elegance of love that sacred passion i to thee confine my spotless faith shall be for ever thine a ballad by mr gay i twas when the seas were roaring with hollow blasts of wind a damsel lay deploring all on a rock reclined wide over the rolling billows she cast a wistful look her head was crowned with willows that tremble over the brook ii twelve months are gone and over and nine long tedious days why did thou venurous lover why did thou trust the seas cease cease thou cruel ocean and let my lover rest ah what is thy troubled motion to that within my breast iii the merchant robbed of pleasure sees tempests in despair but what is the loss of treasure to losing of my dear should you some coast be laid on where gold and dimonds grow you would find a richer maiden but none that loves you so iv how can they say that nature has nothing made in vain why then beneath the water should hideous rocks remain no eyes the rocks discover that lurk beneath the deep to wreck the wandering lover and leave the maid to weep v all melancholy lying thus waild she for her dear repaid each blast with sighing each billow with a tear when over the white wave stooping his floating corpse she spied then like a lilly drooping she bowed her head and

ought thy favorite  sandy such troubles might with much more ease be born what is goblins wethers or what is womans scorn our loss is greater far for addys dead addy who sang so sweetly on the mead  richy dead is he say thou guard my heart oh pan what burdens gods ye lay on feeble man alack i cannot blame thee for thy grief nor hope i more than thou to find relief a better lad never leaned on shepherds crook nor after game hallood his dog to look how glad where ews give milk have we three been merry on hills and gay upon the green  sandy that is true indeed but now alas in vain we seek for pleasure on the rural plain i never thought a summersday too long to hear his couplets or his tuneful song how sweet he sang where vines and myrtles grow and winding streams which in old latium flows titry the mantuan herd who long ago sang best on oaten reed the lovers woe did he famed bard but live in these our days he would with addy freely share his bays as long as shepherds amaryllis hear so long his rosamond shall please the ear while spangled daisie near the rivlet grows and tender lambs seek after bleating ews his fame shall last last shall his song of wars while british youngsters boast of ancestors much shall we miss his merry witty jests at weaningtimes and at our lambmass feasts oh richy richy death has been unkind to take the good and leave the ill behind bow down your heads ye hills weep dry ye springs for on your banks no more the shepherd sings  richy then he had always good advice to give and could my thoughts like as my self conceive when i have been drooping vexed or in the spleen in one half hour with him i have merry been had jenny froward been or raynard bold worried my lamb or were my shoes grown old kindly he would smile when he observed me grieve and by his talk divine my breast relieve addy did all things to perfection know saw by the moon how tides would ebb or flow he knew what knew he not even to a hair he would tell oernight if next day would be fair the famed blind bard sang in mysterious phrase how envious satan did first mischief raise but often beneath the wellspread birchentree the beauties of that song he made me see the lasses often flung down their rakes and pails and held their tongues oh strange to hear his tales  sandy sound be his sleep and soft his waking be more happy is he far than thee or me too good he was for us the gods but lent him here below when hither he was sent let us be good if virtue be our aim then we may meet above the skies again but see how toward the glade the fatlings go thomas has taken the oxen from the plough joan has prepared the supper against we come and late calfd cows stand lowing near their home then let us have done and to our rest repair and what we cannot help with patience bear  finis to mr allan ramsey on his richy and sandy by mr burchet well fare thee allan who in mother tongue so sweetly has of breathless addy sung his endless fame thy natural genius fired and thou have written as if he inspired richy and sandy who do him survive long as thy rural stanzas last shall live the grateful swains thoust made in tuneful verse mourn sadly over their late  lost patrons hearse nor would the mantuan bard if living blame thy pious zeal or think thoust hurt his fame since addisons inimitable lays give him an equal title to the bays when he of armies sang in lofty strains it seemed as if he in the hostile plains had present been his pen has to the life traced every action in the sanguine strife in council now sedate the chief appears then loudly thunders in bavarian ears and still pursuing the destructive theme he pushes them into the rapid stream thus beaten out of blenheims neighboring fields the gallic general to the victor yields who as britannias virgil has observed from threatened fate all europe then preserved nor do thou ramsey sightless milton wrong by ought contained in thy melodious song for none but addy could his thoughts sublime so well unriddle or his mystic rhyme and when he deigned to let his fancy rove where sunburned shepherds to the nymphs make love no one ever told in softer notes the tales of rural pleasures in the spangled vales so much oh allan i thy lines revere such veneration to his memory bear that i no longer could my thanks refrain for what thoust sung of the lamented swain
