the emigrants  the emigrants a poem in two books  by charlotte smith  london printed for t cadell in the strand       to william cowper esquire dear sir there is i hope some propriety in my addressing a composition to you which would never perhaps have existed had i not amid the heavy pressure of many sorrows derived infinite consolation from your poetry and some degree of animation and of confidence from your esteem  the following performance is far from aspiring to be considered as an imitation of your inimitable poem  the task i am perfectly sensible that it belongs not to a feeble and feminine hand to draw the bow of ulysses  the force clearness and sublimity of your admirable poem the felicity almost peculiar to your genius of giving to the most familiar objects dignity and effect i could never hope to reach yet having read the task almost incessantly from its first publication to the present time i felt that kind of enchantment described by milton when he says the angel ended and in adams ear so charming left his voice that he awhile thought him still speaking    and from the force of this impression i was gradually led to attempt in blank verse a delineation of those interesting objects which happened to excite my attention and which even pressed upon an heart that has learned perhaps from its own sufferings to feel with acute though unavailing compassion the calamity of others  a dedication usually consists of praises and of apologies my praise can add nothing to the unanimous and loud applause of your country she regards you with pride as one of the few who at the present period rescue her from the imputation of having degenerated in poetical talents but in the form of apology i should have much to say if i again dared to plead the pressure of evils aggravated by their long continuance as an excuse for the defects of this attempt  whatever may be the faults of its execution let me vindicate myself from those that may be imputed to the design  in speaking of the emigrant clergy i beg to be understood as feeling the utmost respect for the integrity of their principles and it is with pleasure i add my suffrage to that of those who have had a similar opportunity of witnessing the conduct of the emigrants of all descriptions during their exile in england which has been such as does honor to their nation and ought to secure to them in ours the esteem of every liberal mind  your philanthropy dear sir will induce you i am persuaded to join with me in hoping that this painful exile may finally lead to the extirpation of that reciprocal hatred so unworthy of great and enlightened nations that it may tend to humanize both countries by convincing each that good qualities exist in the other and at length annihilate the prejudices that have so long existed to the injury of both  yet it is unfortunately but too true that with the body of the english this national aversion has acquired new force by the dreadful scenes which have been acted in france during the last summer  even those who are the victims of the revolution have not escaped the odium which the undistinguishing multitude annex to all the natives of a country where such horrors have been acted nor is this the worst effect those events have had on the minds of the english by confounding the original cause with the wretched catastrophes that have followed its ill management the attempts of public virtue with the outrages that guilt and folly have committed in its disguise the very name of liberty has not only lost the charm it used to have in british ears but many who have written or spoken in its defense have been stigmatized as promoters of anarchy and enemies to the prosperity of their country perhaps even the author of the task with all his goodness and tenderness of heart is in the catalogue of those who are reckoned to have been too warm in a cause which it was once the glory of englishmen to avow and defend  the exquisite poem indeed in which you have honored liberty by a tribute highly gratifying to her sincerest friends was published some years before the demolition of regal despotisin in france which in the fifth book it seems to foretell  all the truth and energy of the passage to which i allude must have been strongly felt when in the parliament of england the greatest orator of our time quoted the sublimest of our poets  when the eloquence of fox did justice to the genius of cowper  i am dear sir with the most perfect esteem your obliged and obedient servant charlotte smith brighthelmstone may  0      lately

faint gleam upon the troubled waves their foaming tops as they approach the shore and the broad surf that never ceasing breaks on the innumerous pebbles catch the beams of the pale sun that with reluctance gives to this cold northern isle its shortened day alas how few the morning wakes to joy how many murmur at oblivious night for leaving them so soon for bearing thus their fancied bliss the only bliss they taste on her black wings away  changing the dreams that soothed their sorrows for calamities and every day brings its own sad proportion for doubts diseases abject dread of death and faithless friends and fame and fortune lost fancied or real wants and wounded pride that views the day star but to curse his beams yet he whose spirit into being called this wondrous world of waters he who bids the wild wind lift them till they dash the clouds and speaks to them in thunder or whose breath low murmuring over the gently heaving tides when the fair moon in summer night serene irradiates with long trembling lines of light their undulating surface that great power who governing the planets also knows if but a seamew falls whose nest is hid in these incumbent cliffs he surely means to us his reasoning creatures whom he bids acknowledge and revere his awful hand nothing but good yet man misguided man mars the fair work that he was bid enjoy and makes himself the evil he deplores how often when my weary soul recoils from proud oppression and from legal crimes for such are in this land where the vain boast of equal law is mockery while the cost of seeking for redress is sure to plunge the already injured to more certain ruin and the wretch starves before his counsel pleads how often do i half abjure society and sigh for some lone cottage deep embowerd in the green woods that these steep chalky hills guard from the strong south west where round their base the beach wide flourishes and the light ash with slender leaf half hides the thymy turf  there do i wish to hide me well content if on the short grass strewn with fairy flowers i might repose thus sheltered or when eve in orient crimson lingers in the west gain the high mound and mark these waves remote lucid though distant blushing with the rays of the farflaming orb that sinks beneath them for i have thought that i should then behold the beauteous works of god unspoild by man and less affected then by human woes i witnessed not might better learn to bear those that injustice and duplicity and faithlessness and folly fix on me for never yet could i derive relief when my swoln heart was bursting with its sorrows from the sad thought that others like myself live but to swell afflictions countless tribes  tranquil seclusion i have vainly sought peace who delights in solitary shade no more will spread for me her downy wings but like the fabled danaids  or the wretch who ceaseless up the steep acclivity was doomed to heave the still rebounding rock onward i labor as the baffled wave which you rough beach repulses that returns with the next breath of wind to fail again  ah mourner  cease these wailings cease and learn that not the cot sequestered where the briar and woodbine wild embrace the mossy thatch scarce seen amid the forest gloom obscure or more substantial farm well fenced and warm where the full barn and cattle fodderd round speak rustic plenty nor the statelier dome by dark firs shaded or the aspiring pine close by the village church with care concealed by verdant foliage lest the poor mans grave should mar the smiling prospect of his lord where offices well ranged or dovecote stocked declare manorial residence not these or any of the buildings new and trim with windows circling toward the restless sea which ranged in rows now terminate my walk can shut out for an hour the spectre care that from the dawn of reason follows still unhappy mortals till the friendly grave our sole secure asylum ends the chase   behold in witness of this mournful truth a group approach me whose dejected looks sad heralds of distress proclaim them men banished for ever and for conscience sake from their distracted country whence the name of freedom misapplied and much abused by lawless anarchy has driven them far to wander with the prejudice they learned from bigotry the tutress of the blind through the wide world unshelterd their sole hope that german spoilers through that pleasant land may carry wide the desolating scourge of war and vengeance yet unhappy men whatever your errors i lament your fate and as disconsolate and sad ye hang upon the barrier of the rock and seem to murmur your despondence waiting long some fortunate reverse that never comes methinks in each expressive face i see discriminated anguish there droops one who in a moping cloister long consumed this life inactive to obtain a better and thought that meagre abstinence to wake from his hard pallet with the midnight bell to live on eleemosynary bread and to renounce gods works would please that god and now the poor pale wretch receives amazed the pity strangers give to his distress because these strangers are by his dark creed condemned as heretics  and with sick heart regrets   his pious prison and his beads  another of more haughty port declines the aid he needs not while in mute despair his high indignant thoughts go back to france dwelling on all he lost  the gothic dome that vied with splendid palaces   the beds of silk and down the silver chalices vestments with gold enwrought for blazing altars where amid clouds of incense he held forth to kneeling crowds the imaginary bones of saints supposed in pearl and gold enchasd and still with more than living monarchs pomp surrounded was believed by mumbling bigots to hold the keys of heaven and to admit whom he thought good to share it  now alas he to whose daring soul and high ambition the world seemed circumscribed who wont to dream of fleuri richelieu alberoni men who trod on empire and whose politics were not beyond the grasp of his vast mind is in a land once hostile still profaned by disbelief and rites unorthodox the object of compassion  at his side lighter of heart than these but heavier far than he was wont another victim comes an abbe  who with less contracted brow still smiles and flatters and still talks of hope which sanguine as he is he does not feel and so he cheats the sad and weighty pressure of evils present  still as men misled by early prejudice so hard to break i mourn your sorrows for i too have known involuntary exile and while yet england had charms for me have felt how sad it is to look across the dim cold sea that melancholy rolls its refluent tides between us and the dear regretted land we call our own  as now ye pensive wait on this bleak morning gazing on the waves that seem to leave your shore from whence the wind is loaded to your ears with the deep groans of martyred saints and suffering royalty while to your eyes the avenging power of heaven appears in aweful anger to prepare the storm of vengeance fraught with plagues and death even he of milder heart who was indeed the simple shepherd in a rustic scene and mid the vineclad hills of languedoc taught to the barefoot peasant whose hard hands produced   the nectar he could seldom taste submission to the lord for whom he toiled he or his brethren who to neustrias sons enforced religious patience when at times on their indignant hearts powers iron hand too strongly struck eliciting some sparks of the bold spirit of their native north even these parochial priests these humbled men whose lowly undistinguished cottages witnessed a life of purest piety while the meek tenants were perhaps unknown each to the haughty lord of his domain who marked them not the noble scorning still the poor and pious priest as with slow pace he glided through the dim arched avenue which to the castle led hoping to cheer the last sad hour of some laborious life that hastened to its close  even such a man becomes an exile staying not to try by temperate zeal to check his maddning flock who at the novel sound of liberty ah most intoxicating sound to slaves start into license  lo dejected now the wandering pastor mourns with bleeding heart his erring people weeps and prays for them and trembles for the account that he must give to heaven for souls entrusted to his care  where the cliff hollowed by the wintry storm affords a seat with matted seaweed strewn a softer form reclines around her run on the rough shingles or the chalky bourn her gay unconscious children soon amused who pick the fretted stone or glossy shell or crimson plant marine or they contrive the fairy vessel with its ribband sail and gilded paper pennant in the pool left by the salt wave on the yielding sands they launch the mimic navy  happy age unmindful of the miseries of man  alas too long a victim to distress their mother lost in melancholy thought lulled for a moment by the murmurs low of sullen billows wearied by the task of having here with swoln and aching eyes fixed on the gray horizon since the dawn solicitously watched the weekly sail from her dear native land now yields awhile to kind forgetfulness while fancy brings in waking dreams that native land again versailles appears  its painted galleries and rooms of regal splendor rich with gold where by long mirrors multiplied the crowd paid willing homage  and united there beauty gave charms to empire  ah too soon from the gay visionary pageant roused see the sad mourner start  and drooping look with tearful eyes and heaving bosom round on drear reality  where darkning waves urged by the rising wind unheeded foam near her cold rugged seat  to call her thence a fellowsufferer comes dejection deep checks but conceals not quite the martial air and that high consciousness of noble blood which he has learned from infancy to think exalts him over the race of common men nursed in the velvet lap of luxury and fed by adulation  could he learn that worth alone is true nobility and that the peasant who amid   the sons of reason valor liberty and virtue displays distinguished merit is a noble of natures own creation  if even here if in this land of highly vaunted freedom even britons controvert the unwelcome truth can it be relished by the sons of france men who derive their boasted ancestry from the fierce leaders of religious wars the first in chivalrys emblazond page who reckon gueslin bayard or de foix among their brave progenitors their eyes accustomed to regard the splendid trophies of heraldry that with fantastic hand mingles like images in feverish dreams gorgons and hydras and chimeras dire with painted puns and visionary shapes see not the simple dignity of virtue but hold all base whom honors such as these exalt not from the crowd    as one who long has dwelt amid the artificial scenes of populous city deems that splendid shows the theater and pageant pomp of courts are only worth regard forgets all taste for natures genuine beauty in the lapse of gushing waters hears no soothing sound nor listens with delight to sighing winds that on their fragrant pinions waft the notes of birds rejoicing in the trangled copse nor gazes pleased on oceans silver breast while lightly over it sails the summer clouds reflected in the wave that hardly heard flows on the yellow sands so to his mind that long has lived where despotism hides his features harsh beneath the diadem of worldly grandeur abject slavery seems if by that power imposed slavery no more for luxury wreathes with silk the iron bonds and hides the ugly rivets with her flowers till the degenerate triflers while they love the glitter of the chains forget their weight but more the men   whose ill acquired wealth was wrung from plundered myriads by the means too often legalizd by power abused feel all the horrors of the fatal change when their ephemeral greatness marred at once as a vain toy that fortunes childish hand equally joyd to fashion or to crush leaves them exposed to universal scorn for having nothing else not even the claim to honor which respect for heroes past allows to ancient titles men like these sink even beneath the level whence base arts alone had raised them  unlamented sink and know that they deserve the woes they feel poor wandering wretches whosoeer ye are that hopeless houseless friendless travel wide over these bleak russet downs where dimly seen the solitary shepherd shivering tends his dun discolored flock shepherd unlike him whom in song the poets fancy crowns with garlands and his crook with vilets binds poor vagrant wretches outcasts of the world whom no abode receives no parish owns roving like natures commoners the land that boasts such general plenty if the sight of wideextended misery softens yours a while suspend your murmurs  here behold the strange vicissitudes of fate  while thus the exiled nobles from their country driven whose richest luxuries were theirs must feel more poignant anguish than the lowest poor who born to indigence have learned to brave rigid adversitys depressing breath  ah rather fortunes worthless favorites who feed on englands vitals  pensioners of base corruption who in quick ascent to opulence unmerited become giddy with pride and as ye rise forgetting the dust ye lately left with scorn look down on those beneath ye though your equals once in fortune and in worth superior still they view the eminence on which ye stand with wonder not with envy for they know the means by which ye reached it have been such as in all honest eyes degrade ye far beneath the poor dependent whose fad heart reluctant pleads for what your pride denies ye venal worthless hirelings of a court ye pampered parasites whom britons pay for forging fetters for them rather here study a lesson that concerns ye much and trembling learn that if oppressed too long the raging multitude to madness stung will turn on their oppressors and no more by sounding titles and parading forms bound like tame victims will redress themselves then swept away by the resistlefs torrent not only all your pomp may disappear but in the tempest lost fair order sink her decent head and lawless anarchy oerturn celestial freedoms radiant throne  as now in gallia where confusion born of party rage and selfish love of rule sully the noblest cause that ever warmed the heart of patriot virtue    there arise the infernal passions vengeance seeking blood and avarice and envys harpy fangs pollute the immortal shrine of liberty dismay her votaries and disgrace her name respect is due to principle and they who suffer for their conscience have a claim whatever that principle may be to praise these illstarrd exiles then who bound by ties to them the bonds of honor who resigned their country to preserve them and now seek in england an asylum  well deserve to find that every prejudice forgot which pride and ignorance teaches we for them feel as our brethren and that english hearts of just compassion ever own the sway as truly as our element the deep obeys the mild dominion of the moon  this they have found and may they find it still thus may thou britain triumph  may thy foes by reasons generous potency subdued learn that the god thou worshippest delights in acts of pure humanity  may thine be still such bloodless laurels nobler far than those acquired at cressy or poictiers or of more recent growth those well bestowed on him who stood on calpes blazing height amid the thunder of a warring world illustrious rather from the crowds he saved from flood and fire than from the ranks who fell beneath his valor  actions such as these like incense rising to the throne of heaven far better justify the pride that swells in british bosoms than the deafening roar of victory from a thousand brazen throats that tell with what success widewasting war has by our brave compatriots thinned the world end of book i notes to the first book ends the chase  i have a confused notion that this expression with nearly the same application is to be found in young but i cannot refer to it  regrets his pious prison and his beads  lest the same attempts at misrepresentation should now be made as have been made on former occasions it is necessary to repeat that nothing is farther from my thoughts than to reflect invidiously on the emigrant clergy whose steadiness of principle excites veneration as much as their sufferings compassion adversity has now taught them the charity and humility they perhaps wanted when they made it a part of their faith that salvation could be obtained in no other religion than their own  the splendid palaces  let it not be considered as an insult to men in fallen fortune if these luxuries undoubtedly inconsistent with their profession be here enumerated  france is not the only country where the splendor and indulgences of the higher and the poverty and depression of the inferior clergy have alike proved injurious to the cause of religion  see the finely descriptive verses written at montauban in france in    0 by dr joseph warton printed in dodsleys miscellanies vol iv page  0   who amid the sons of reason valor liberty and virtue displays distinguished merit is a noble of natures own creation  these lines are thomsons and are among those sentiments which are now called when used by living writers not commonplace declamation but sentiments of dangerous tendency  exalt not from the crowd  it has been said and with great appearance of truth that the contempt in which the nobility of france held the common people was remembered and with all that vindictive asperity which long endurance of oppression naturally excites when by a wonderful concurrence of circumstances the people acquired the power of retaliation yet let me here add what seems to be in some degree inconsistent with the former charge that the french are good masters to their servants and that in their treatment of their negro slaves they are allowed to be more mild and merciful than other europeans  but more the men  the financiers and fermiers generaux are here intended in the present moment of clamor against all those who have spoken or written in favor of the first revolution of france the declaimers seem to have forgotten that under the reign of a mild and easy tempered monarch in the most voluptuous court in the world the abuses by which men of this description were enriched had arisen to such height that their prodigality exhausted the immense resources of france and unable to supply the exigencies of government the ministry were compelled to call le tiers etat a meeting that gave birth to the revolution which has since been so ruinously conducted  the breast of patriot virtue  this sentiment will probably renew against me the indignation of those who have an interest in asserting that no such virtue any where exists  the emigrants book the second quippe ubi fas

to the north of the weald of sussex time an afternoon in april      long wintry months are past the moon that now lights her pale crescent even at noon has made four times her revolution since with step mournful and slow along the waveworn cliff pensive i took my solitary way lost in despondence while contemplating not my own wayward destiny alone hard as it is and difficult to bear but in beholding the unhappy lot of the lorn exiles who amid the storms of wild disastrous anarchy are thrown like shipwrecked sufferers on englands coast to see perhaps no more their native land where desolation riots they like me from fairer hopes and happier prospects driven shrink from the future and regret the past but on this upland scene while april comes with fragrant airs to fan my throbbing breast fain would i snatch an interval from care that weighs my wearied spirit down to earth courting once more the influence of hope for hope still waits upon the flowery prime as here i mark springs humid hand unfold the early leaves that fear capricious winds while even on sheltered banks the timid flowers give half reluctantly their warmer hues to mingle with the primroses pale stars no shade the leafless copses yet afford nor hide the mossy labors of the thrush that startled darts across the narrow path but quickly reassurd resumes his task or adds his louder notes to those that rise from yonder tufted brake where the white buds of the first thorn are mingled with the leaves of that which blossoms on the brow of may ah twill not be  so many years have passed since on my native hills i learned to gaze on these delightful landscapes and those years have taught me so much sorrow that my soul feels not the joy reviving nature brings but in dark retrospect dejected dwells on human follies and on human woes  what is the promise of the infant year the lively verdure or the bursting blooms to those who shrink from horrors such as war spreads over the affrighted world with swimming eye back on the past they throw their mournful looks and see the temple which they fondly hoped reason would raise to liberty destroyed by ruffian hands while on the ruined mass flushed with hot blood the fiend of discord sits in savage triumph mocking every plea of policy and justice as she shows the headless corse of one whose only crime was being born a monarch  mercy turns from spectacle so dire her swoln eyes and liberty with calm unruffled brow magnanimous as conscious of her strength in reasons panoply scorns to distain her righteous cause with carnage and resigns to fraud and anarchy the infuriate crowd  what is the promise of the infant year to those who while the poor but peaceful hind pens unmolested the increasing flock of his rich master in this seafencd isle survey in neighboring countries scenes that make the sick heart shudder and the man who thinks blush for his species there the trumpets voice drowns the soft warbling of the woodland choir and violets lurking in their turfy beds beneath the flowring thorn are stained with blood there fall at once the spoiler and the spoiled while war wideravaging annihilates the hope of cultivation gives to

ere ye profane her everglorious name or catalogue the thousands that have bled resisting her or those who greatly died martyrs to liberty  revert awhile to the black scroll that tells of regal crimes

perverse and blind and base venality prevail to raise to public trust a wretch whose private vice makes even the wildest profligate recoil and who with hireling ruffians leagued has burst the laws of nature and humanity wading beneath the patriots specious mask and in equalitys illusive name to empire through a stream of kindred blood  innocent prisoner  most unhappy heir of fatal greatness who art suffering now for all the crimes and follies of thy race better for thee if over thy baby brow the regal mischief never had been held then in an humble sphere perhaps content thou had been free and joyous on the heights of pyrennean mountains shaggd with woods of chestnut pine and oak as on these hills is yonder little thoughtless shepherd lad who on the slope abrupt of downy turf reclined in playful indolence sends off the chalky ball quick bounding far below while half forgetful of his simple task hardly his lengthening shadow or the bells slow tinkling of his flock that supping tend to the brown fallows in the vale beneath where nightly it is folded from his sport recall the happy idler  while i gaze on his gay vacant countenance my thoughts compare with his obscure laborious lot

thee with stony eyes and cannot weep  ah much i mourn thy sorrows hapless queen and deem thy expiation made to heaven for every fault to which prosperity betrayed thee when it placed thee on a throne where boundless power was thine and thou were raised high as it seemed above the envious reach of destiny whatever thy errors were be they no more remembered though the rage of party swelled them to such crimes as bade compassion stifle every sigh that rose for thy disastrous lot  more than enough thou have endured and every english heart even those that highest beat in freedoms cause disclaim as base and of that cause unworthy the vengeance or the fear that makes thee still a miserable prisoner  ah who knows from sad experience more than i to feel for thy desponding spirit as it sinks beneath procrastinated fears for those more dear to thee than life but eminence of misery is thine as once of joy and as we view the strange vicissitude we ask anew where happiness is found  alas in rural life where youthful dreams see the arcadia that romance describes not even content resides  in yon low hut of clay and thatch where rises the gray smoke of smoldring turf cut from the adjoining moor the labourer its inhabitant who toils from the first dawn of twilight till the sun sinks in the rosy waters of the west finds that with poverty it cannot dwell for bread and scanty bread is all he earns for him and for his household  should disease born of chill wintry rains arrest his arm then through his patched and strawstuffd casement peeps the squalid figure of extremest want and from the parish the reluctant dole dealt by the unfeeling farmer hardly saves the lingering spark of life from cold extinction then the bright sun of spring that smiling bids all other animals rejoice beholds crept from his pallet the emaciate wretch attempt with feeble effort to resume some heavy task above his wasted strength turning his wistful looks how much in vain to the deserted mansion where no more the owner gone to gayer scenes resides who made even luxury virtue while he gave the scattered crumbs to honest poverty  but though the landscape be too often deformed by figures such as these yet peace is here and over our valleys clothed with springing corn no hostile hoof shall trample nor fierce flames wither the woods young verdure ere it form gradual the laughing mays luxuriant shade for by the rude sea guarded we are safe and feel not evils such as with deep sighs the emigrants deplore as they recall the summer past when nature seemed to lose her course in wild distemperature and aid with seasons all reversed destructive war shuddering i view the pictures they have drawn of desolated countries where the ground stripped of its unripe produce was thick strewn with various death  the warhorse falling there by famine and his rider by the sword the moping clouds sailed heavy charged with rain and bursting over the mountains misty brow deluged as with an inland sea the vales   where through the sullen evenings lurid gloom rising like columns of volcanic fire the flames of burning villages illumd the waste of water and the wind that howled along its troubled surface brought the groans of plundered peasants and the frantic shrieks of mothers for their children while the brave to pity still alive listened aghast to these dire echoes hopeless to prevent the evils they beheld or check the rage which ever as the people of one land meet in contention fires the human heart with savage thirst of kindred blood and makes man lose his nature rendering him more fierce than the gaunt monsters of the howling waste often have i heard the melancholy tale which all their native gaiety forgot these exiles tell  how hope impelled them on reckless of tempest hunger or the sword till ordered to retreat they knew not why from all their flattering prospects they became the prey of dark suspicion and regret   then in despondence sunk the unnervd arm of gallant loyalty  at every turn shame and disgrace appeared and seemed to mock their scattered squadrons which the warlike youth unable to endure   often implored as the last act of friendship from the hand of some brave comrade to receive the blow that freed the indignant spirit from its pain to a wild mountain whose bare summit hides its broken eminence in clouds whose steeps are dark with woods where the receding rocks are worn by torrents of dissolving snow a wretched woman pale and breathless flies and gazing round her listens to the sound of hostile footsteps  no it dies away nor noise remains but of the cataract or surly breeze of night that mutters low among the thickets where she trembling seeks a temporary shelter  clasping close to her hardheaving heart her sleeping child all she could rescue of the innocent groupe that yesterday surrounded her  escaped almost by miracle fear frantic fear winged her weak feet yet half repentant now her headlong haste she wishes she had staid to die with those affrighted fancy paints the lawless soldiers victims  hark again the driving tempest bears the cry of death and with deep sullen thunder the dread sound of cannon vibrates on the tremulous earth while bursting in the air the murderous bomb glares over her mansion where the splinters fall like scattered comets its destructive path is marked by wreaths of flame  then overwhelmed beneath accumulated horror sinks the desolate mourner yet in death itself true to maternal tenderness she tries to save the unconscious infant from the storm in which she perishes and to protect this last dear object of her ruined hopes from prowling monsters that from other hills more inaccessible and wilder wastes lured by the scent of slaughter follow fierce contending hosts and to polluted fields add dire increase of horrors  but alas the mother and the infant perish both  the feudal chief whose gothic battlements frown on the plain beneath returning home from distant lands alone and in disguise gains at the fall of night his castle walls but at the vacant gate no porter sits to wait his lords admittance  in the courts all is drear silence  guessing but too well the fatal truth he shudders as he goes through the mute hall where by the blunted light that the dim moon through painted casements lends he sees that devastation has been there then while each hideous image to his mind rises terrific over a bleeding corse stumbling he falls another interrupts his staggering feet  all all who used to rush with joy to meet him  all his family lie murdered in his way  and the day dawns on a wild raving maniac whom a fate so sudden and calamitous has robbed of reason and who round his vacant walls screams unregarded and reproaches heaven  such are thy dreadful trophies savage war and evils such as these or yet more dire which the pained mind recoils from all are thine  the purple pestilence that to the grave sends whom the sword has spared is thine and thine the widows anguish and the orphans tears  woes such as these does man inflict on man and by the closet murderers whom we style wise politicians are the schemes prepared which to keep europes wavering balance even depopulate her kingdoms and consign to tears and anguish half a bleeding world  oh could the time return when thoughts like these spoiled not that gay delight which vernal suns illuminating hills and woods and fields gave to my infant spirits  memory come and from distracting cares that now deprive such scenes of all their beauty kindly bear my fancy to those hours of simple joy when on the banks of arun which i see make its irriguous course through yonder meads i played unconscious then of future ill there where from hollows fringed with yellow broom the birch with silver rind and fairy leaf aslant the low stream trembles i have stood and meditated how to venture best into the shallow current to procure the willow herb of glowing purple spikes or flags whose swordlike leaves concealed the tide startling the timid reedbird from her nest as with aquatic flowers i wove the wreath such as collected by the shepherd girls deck in the villages the turfy shrine and mark the arrival of propitious may  how little dreamed i then the time would come when the bright sun of that delicious month should from disturbed and artificial sleep awaken me to neverending toil to terror and to tears  attempting still with feeble hands and cold desponding heart to save my children from the oerwhelming wrongs that have for ten long years been heaped on me  the fearful specter of chicane and fraud have proteus like still changed their hideous forms as the law lent its plausible disguise pursuing my faint steps and i have seen friendships sweet bonds which were so early formed and once i fondly thought of amaranth inwove with silver seven times tried give way and fail as these green fanlike leaves of fern will wither at the touch of autumns frost yet there are those whose patient pity still hears my long murmurs who unwearied try with lenient hands to bind up every wound my wearied spirit feels and bid me go right onward  a calm votary of the nymph who from her adamantine rock points out to conscious rectitude the rugged path that leads at length to peace  ah yes my friends peace will at last be mine for in the grave is peace  and pass a few short years perchance a few short months and all the various pain i now endure shall be forgotten there and no memorial shall remain of me save in your bosoms while even your regret shall lose its poignancy as ye reflect what complicated woes that grave conceals but if the little praise that may await the mothers efforts should provoke the spleen of priest or levite and they then arraign the dust that cannot hear them be it yours to vindicate my humble fame to say that not in selfish sufferings absorbed i gave to misery all i had my tears   and if where regulated sanctity pours her long orisons to heaven my voice was seldom heard that yet my prayer was made to him who hears even silence not in domes of human architecture filled with crowds but on these hills where boundless yet distinct even as a map beneath are spread the fields his bounty clothes divided here by woods and there by commons rude or winding brooks while i might breathe the air perfumed with flowers or the fresh odours of the mountain turf and gaze on clouds above me as they sailed majestic or remark the reddening north when bickering arrows of electric fire flash on the evening sky  i made my prayer in unison with murmuring waves that now swell with dark tempests now are mild and blue as the bright arch above for all to me declare omniscient goodness nor need i declamatory essays to incite my wonder or my praise when every leaf that spring unfolds and every simple bud more forcibly impresses on my heart his power and wisdom  ah while i adore that goodness which designed to all that lives some taste of happiness my soul is pained by the variety of woes that man for man creates  his blessings often turned to plagues and curses saintlike piety misled by superstition has destroyed more than ambition and the sacred flame of liberty becomes a raging fire when license and confusion bid it blaze from thy high throne above yon radiant stars o power omnipotent with mercy view this suffering globe and cause thy creatures cease with savage fangs to tear her bleeding breast restrain that rage for power that bids a man himself a worm desire unbounded rule over beings like himself teach the hard hearts of rulers that the poorest hind who dies for their unrighteous quarrels in thy sight is equal to the imperious lord that leads his disciplined destroyers to the field  may lovely freedom in her genuine charms aided by stern but equal justice drive from the ensanguind earth the hellborn fiends of pride oppression avarice and revenge that ruin what thy mercy made so fair then shall these illstarrd wanderers whose sad fate these desultory lines lament regain their native country private vengeance then to public virtue yield and the fierce feuds that long have torn their desolated land may even as storms that agitate the air drive noxious vapors from the blighted earth serve all tremendous as they are to fix the reign of reason liberty and peace notes to the second book hope waits upon the flowery prime  famine and

despotism would have lost its horrors yet he had considerable failings and his greatest virtues may be chiefly imputed to his education in the school of adversity  deluged as with an inland sea the vales  from the heavy and incessant rains during the last campaign the armies were often compelled to march for many miles through marshes overflowed suffering the extremities of cold and fatigue the peasants frequently misled them and after having passed these inundations at the hazard of their lives they were sometimes under the necessity of crossing them a second and a third time their evening quarters after such a day of exertion were often in a wood without shelter and their repast instead of bread unripe corn without any other preparation than being mashed into a sort of paste  the prey of dark suspicion and regret  it is remarkable that notwithstanding the excessive hardships to which the army of the emigrants was exposed very few in it suffered from disease till they began to retreat then it was that despondence consigned to the most miserable death many brave men who deserved a better fate and then despair impelled some to suicide while others fell by mutual wounds unable
