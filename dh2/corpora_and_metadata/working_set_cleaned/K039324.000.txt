sir begging your pardon   gay no why did her maid then make so strict an enquiry into my fortune and affairs   sharp for two very substantial reasons the first to satisfy a curiosity natural to her as a woman the second to have the pleasure of my conversation very natural to her as a woman of taste and understanding   gay prithee be more serious is not our all at stake   sharp yes sir and yet that

do with him   kitty with all my heart  i have given you my sentiments upon the occasion and shall leave you to your own inclinations   mel oh madam i am much obliged to you for your great condescension ha ha ha however i have so great a regard for your opinion that had i certain proofs of his villainy    kitty of his poverty you may have a hundred i am sure i have had none to the contrary   mel oh there the shoe pinches aside   kitty nay so far from giving me the usual perquisites of my place he has not so much as kept me in temper with little endearing civilities and one might reasonably expect when a man is deficient in one way that he should make it up in another knocking without   mel see who is at the door  exit kitty  i must be cautious how i hearken too much to this girl her bad opinion of mr gayless seems to arise from his disregard of her   enter sharp and kitty so sharp have you found your master will things be ready for the ball and entertainment   sharp

modest master know that my husband shall indite your house at the next parish meeting for a nuisance   mel a nuisance   sharp i said so  a nuisance i believe none in the neighborhood live with more decency and regularity than i and my master as is really the case  decency and regularity cries she with a sneer  why sirrah does not my window look into your masters bedchamber and did not he bring in a certain lady such a day describing you madam and did not i see    mel see oh scandalous what   sharp modesty requires my silence   mel did not you contradict her   sharp contradict her why i told her i was sure she lyd for zounds said i for i could not help swearing i am so well convinced of the ladys and my masters prudence that i am sure had they a mind to amuse themselves they would certainly have drawn the windowcurtains   mel what did you say nothing else did not you convince her of her error and impertinence   sharp she swore to such things that i could do nothing but swear and call names upon which outbolts her husband upon me with a fine taper crab in his hand and fell upon me with such violence that being half delirious i made a full confession   mel a full confession what did you confess   sharp that my master loved fornication that you had no aversion to it that mrs kitty was a bawd and your humble servant a pimp   kitty a bawd a bawd do i look like a bawd madam   sharp and so madam in the scuffle my coat was torn to pieces as well as your reputation   mel and so you joined to make me infamous   sharp for heavens sake madam what could i do his proofs fell so thick upon me as witness my head shewing his head plaisterd that i would have given up all the maidenheads in the kingdom rather than have my brains beat to a jelly   mel very well  but i will be revenged  and did not you tell your master of this   sharp tell him no madam had i told him his love is so violent for you that he would certainly have murdered half the attorneys in town by this time   mel very well  but i am resolved not to go to your masters to night   sharp heavens and my impudence be praised aside   kitty why not madam if you are not guilty face your accusers   sharp oh the devil ruined again aside to be sure face em by all means madam  they can but be abusive and break the windows a little  besides madam i have thought of a way to make this affair quite diverting to you  i have a fine blunderbuss charged with half a hundred slugs and my master has a delicate large swiss broad sword and between us madam we shall so pepper and slice em that you will die with laughing   mel what at murder   kitty dont fear madam there will be no murder if sharps concerned   sharp murder madam it is self defense besides in these sort of skirmishes there are never more than two or three killed for supposing they bring the whole body of militia upon us down but with a brace of them and away fly the rest of the covey   mel persuade me never so much i will not go that is my resolution   kitty why then i will tell you what madam since you are resolved not to go to the supper suppose the supper was to come to you it is great pity such great preparations as mr sharp has made should be thrown away   sharp so it is as you say mrs kitty but i can immediately run back and unbespeak what i have ordered it is soon done   mel but then what excuse can i send to your master he will be very uneasy at my not coming   sharp oh terribly so  but i have it  i will tell him you are very much out of order  that you were suddenly taken with the vapors or qualms or what you please madam   mel i will leave it to you sharp to make my apology and there is half a guinea for you to help your invention   sharp half a guinea  it is so long since i had any thing to do with money that i scarcely know the current coin of my own country oh sharp what talents have thou to secure thy master deceive his mistress outlie her chambermaid and yet be paid for thy honesty but my joy will discover me aside madam you have eternally fixed timothy sharp your most obedient humble servant  oh the delights of impudence and a good understanding  exit sharp   kitty ha ha ha was there ever such a lying varlet with his slugs and his broad swords his attorneys and broken heads and nonsense well madam are you satisfied now do you want more proofs   mel of your modesty i do but i find you are resolved to give me none   kitty madam   mel i see through your little mean artifice you are endeavoring to lessen mr gayless in my opinion because he has not paid you for services he had no occasion for   kitty pay me madam i am sure i have very little occasion to be angry with mr gayless for not paying me when i believe it is his general practice   mel it is false he is a gentleman and a man of honor and you are    kitty not in love i thank heaven  curtseying   mel you are a fool   kitty i have been in love but i am much wiser now   mel hold your tongue impertinence   kitty that is the severest thing she has said yet  aside   mel leave me   kitty oh this love this love is the devil  exit kitty   mel we discover our weaknesses to our servants make them our confidents put em upon an equality with us and so they become our advisers  sharps behavior though i seemed to disregard it makes me tremble with apprehensions and though i have pretended to be angry with kitty for her advice i think it of too much consequence to be neglected   enter kitty kitty may i speak madam   mel dont be a fool what do you want   kitty there is a servant just come out of the country says he belongs to sir william gayless and has got a letter for you from his master upon very urgent business   mel sir william gayless what can this mean where is the man   kitty in the little parlour madam   mel i will go to him  my heart flutters strangely  exit melissa   kitty oh woman woman foolish woman she will certainly have this gayless nay were she as well convinced of his poverty as i am she would have him  a strong dose of love is worse than one of ratifia when it once gets into our heads it trips up our heels and then good night to discretion here is she going to throw away fifteen thousand pounds upon what faith little better than nothing  he is a man and that is all  and heaven knows mere man is but small consolation  be this advice pursued by each fond maid never slight the substance for an empty shade rich weighty sparks alone should please and charm ye for should spouse cool his gold will always warm ye  end of the first act act ii enter gayless and sharp gay prithee be serious sharp

thou excused me from the ball and entertainment   sharp beyond expectation sir  but in that particular i was obliged to have recourse to truth and declare the real situation of your affairs i told her we had so long disused our selves to dressing either dinners or suppers that i was afraid we should be but awkward in our preparations in short sir  at that instant a cursed gnawing seized my stomach

fermentation that you should not have known in an hours time whether you was a fish or a man   gay why what is all this you have been telling me   sharp a downright lie from beginning to end   gay and have you really excused me to her   sharp no sir but i have got this half guinea to make her excuses to you and instead of a confederacy between you and me to deceive her she thinks she has brought me over to put the deceit upon you   gay thou excellent fellow   sharp dont lose time but slip out of the house immediately the backway i believe will be the safest for you and to her as fast as you can
