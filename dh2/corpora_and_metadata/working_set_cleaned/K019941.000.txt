an epistle to c churchill author of the rosciad  telumque imbelle sine ictu conjecit virg by r lloyd m a  london printed for william flexney near grays inn gate holborn mdcclxi  advertisement as in parts of the following poem there is an allusion to a late delicate production it may not be improper to let the reader into some secrets concerning its origin that he may know the progress of wit and how dangerous it is for young adventurers to attack veterans in the service and teach them to pay a due deference to all distinguished writers an author possessed of those happy qualities which appear so notoriously in that publication viz modesty decency and good nature has an indisputable right to be believed upon his own assertion and therefore it would be illiberal to doubt but that he is as he ought to be distinguished this ode then was performed by the maker as a coffin to hold the dead bodies of those unfortunate heroes slain by his redoubtable pen a gentleman it seems unhappily differed in opinion with our champion and expressed his sentiments in a paper called the craftsman outsallies the vindictive knight i should say squire to use his own language does him slaps him into the coffin where he laid quietly for some months till a second paroxysm of indignation produced a second murder and the former body was obliged to give place to the latter the coffin is nailed down the plate altered and the brazen inscription informs us c churchill died the   th of june       happy is the man that is always prepared for his enemy and has his naiads by him ready made it must be allowed that this gentleman has made huge strides toward parnassus and has strangely walked over all our heads i wish him joy of having exalted himself to the pinnacle of this aerie mountain but beg leave to remind him that people sometimes tolluntur in altum ut lapsu graviore cadant   an epistle to c churchill if at a tavern where you would wish to dine they cheat your palate with adulterate wine would you resolve me critics for you can send for the master up or chide the man the man no doubt a knavish business drives but tell me what is the master who connives hence you will infer and sure the doctrines true which says no quarter to a foul review it matters not who vends the nauseous slop master or prentice we detest the shop critics of old a manly liberal race approved or censured with an open face boldly persud the free decisive task nor stabbed concealed beneath a ruffians mask to works not men with honest warmth severe thimpartial judges laughed at hope or fear theirs was the noble skill with generous aim to fan true genius to an active flame to bring forth merit in its strongest light or damn the blockhead to his native night but as all states are subject to decay the state of letters too will melt away smit with the harlot charms of trilling sound softness now wantons even on roman ground where thebans spartans sought their honored graves behold a weak enervate race of slaves in classic lore deep science language dead though modern witlings are but scantly read professors the author takes this opportunity notwithstanding all insinuations to the contrary to declare that he has no particular aim at a gentleman whose abilities he sufficiently acknowledges fail not who will loudly bawl in praise of either with the want of all hailed mighty critics to this present hour  the tribunes name survived the tribunes power now quack and critic differ but in name empirics frontless both they mean the same this raw in physic that in letters fresh both spring like warts excrescence from the flesh half formed half bred in printers hireling schools for all professions have their rogues and fools though the pert witling or the coward knave casts no reflection on the wise or brave yet in these leaden times this idle age when blind with dullness or as blind with rage author against author rails with venom cursed and happy he who calls out blockhead first from the low earth aspiring genius springs and sails triumphant born on eagle wings no toothless spleen no venomed critics aim shall rob thee churchill of thy proper fame while hitchd for ever in thy nervous rhyme fool lives and shines out fool to latest time pity perhaps might with a harmless fool to escape the observance of the critic school but if low malice leagued with folly rise armed with invectives and hedged round with lies should wakeful dullness if she ever wake write sleepy nonsense but for writing sake and stung with rage and piously severe wish bitter comforts to your dying ear if some small wit some sixlind verseman rakes for quaint reflections in the putrid jakes talents usurped demand a censors rage a dunce is dunce proscribed in every age courtier physician lawyer parson cit all all are objects of theatric wit are ye then actors priviledgd alone to make that weapon ridicule your own professions bleed not from his just attack who laughs at pedant coxcomb knave or quack fools on and off the stage are fools the same and every dunce is satires lawful game freely you thought where thought has freest room why then apologize for what to whom though grays inn wits with author squires unite and selfmade giants club their labored mite though pointless satire make its weak escape in the dull babble of a mimic ape boldly pursue where genius points the way nor heed what monthly puny critics say firm in thyself with calm indifference smile when the wise vetran knows you by your style with critic scales weighs out the partial wit what i or you or he or no one writ denying thee thy just and proper worth but to give falshoods spurious issue birth and all selfwilled with lawless hand to raise malicious slander on the base of praise disgrace eternal wait the wretchs name who lives on credit of a borrowed fame who wears the trappings of anothers wit or fathers bantlings which he could not get but shrewd suspicion with her squinting eye to truth declared prefers a whispered lie with greedy mind the proffered tale believes relates her wishes and with joy deceives the world a pompous name by custom due to the small circle of a talking few with heartfelt glee thinjurious tale repeats and sends the whisper buzzing through the streets the prude demure with sober saintlike air pities her neighbor for she is wondrous fair and when temptations lie before our feet beauty is frail and females indiscreet she hopes the nymph will every danger shun yet prays devoutly  that the deed were done mean time sits watching for the daily lie as spiders lurk to catch a simple fly yet is not scandal to one sex confined though men would fix it on the weaker kind yes this great lord creations master man will vent his malice where the blockhead can imputing crimes of which even thought is free for instance now your rosciad all to me if partial friendship in thy sterling lays grows all too wanton in anothers praise critics who judge by ways themselves have known shall swear the praise the poem is my own for it is the method in these learned days for wits to scribble first and after praise critics and co thus vend their wretched stuff and help out nonsense by a monthly puff exalt to giants forms weak puny elves and descant sweetly on their own dear selves for works per month by learnings midwives paid demand a puffing in the way of trade reserved and cautious with no partial aim my muse ever sought to blast anothers fame with willing hand could twine a rivals bays from candor silent where she could not praise but if vile rancour from no matter who actor or mimic printer or review lies often overthrown with ceaseless venom spread still hiss out scandal from their hydra head if the dull malice boldly walk the town patience herself would wrinkle to a frown come then with justice draw the ready pen give me the works i would not know the men all in their turns might make reprisals too had all the patience but to read them through come to the utmost probe the desperate wound nor spare the knife wherever infections found but prudence churchill or her sister fear whispers forbearance to my frightned ear oh then with me forsake the thorny road lest we should flounder in some fleetditch ode and sunk for ever in the lazy flood weep with the naiads heavy drops of mud hail mighty ode which like a picture frame hold any portrait and with any name or like your nitches planted thick and thin will serve to cram the random hero in hail mighty bard too  whatsoever thy name  or durfy for it is all the same to brother bards shall equal praise belong for wit for genius comedy and song no costive muse is thine which freely rakes with ease familiar in the well known jakes happy in skill to souse through foul and fair and toss the dung out with a lordly air so have i seen amidst the grinning throng the sledge procession slowly dragged along where the mock female shrew and henpeckd male scoopd rich contents from either copious pail called bursts of laughter from the roaring rout and dashed and splashd the filthy grains about quit then my friend the muses loved abode alas they lead not to preferments road be solemn sad put on the priestly frown be dull it is sacred and becomes the gown leave wit to others do a christian deed your foes shall thank you for they know their need broad is the path by learnings sons possessed a thousand modern wits might walk abreast did not each poet mourn his luckless doom jostled by pedants out of elbow room i who nor court their love nor fear their hate must mourn in silence over the muses fate no right of common now on pindus hill while all our tenures are by critics will where watchful guardians of the lady muse dwell monstrous giants dreadful tall reviews who as we read in famed romance of yore sound but a horn press forward to the door but let some chief some bold adventurous knight provoke these champions to an equal fight strait into air to spaceless nothing fall the castle lions giants dwarf and all ill it befits with undiscerning rage to censure giants in this polished age no lack of genius stains these happy times no want of learning and no dearth of rimes the seesaw muse that flows by measured laws in tuneful numbers and affected pause with sound alone sounds happy virtue fraught which hates the trouble and expense of thought once every moon throughout the circling year with even cadence charms the critic ear while dire promoter of poetic sin a magazine must hand the lady in how moderns write how nervous strong and well the antirosciads decent muse does tell which while she strives to cleanse each actor hurt daubs with her praise and rubs him into dirt sure never yet was happy era known so gay so wise so tasteful as our own our curious histories rise at once complete yet still continued as they are paid per sheet see every science which the world would know your magazines shall every month bestow whose very titles fill the mind with awe imperial christian royal british law their rich contents will every reader fit statesman divine philosopher and wit compendious schemes which teach all things at once and make a pedant coxcomb of a dunce but let not anger to such frenzy grow drawcansir like to strike down friend and foe to real worth be homage duly paid but no allowance to the paltry trade my friends i name not though i boast a few to me an honor and to letters too fain would i praise but when such things oppose my praise of course must make them  s foes if manly johnson with satyric rage lash the dull follies of a trifling age if his strong muse with genuine strength aspire glows not the reader with the poets fire his the true fire where creep the witling fry to warm themselves and light their rushlights by what muse like grays shall pleasing pensive flow attemperd sweetly to the rustic woe or who like him shall sweep the theban lyre and as his master pour forth thoughts of fire even now to guard afflicted learnings cause to judge by reasons rules and natures laws boast we true critics in their proper right while lowth and learning hurd and taste unite hail sacred names  oh armed with honest rage save your loved mistress from a ruffians rage see how she gasps and struggles hard for life her wounds all bleeding from the butchers knife critics like surgeons blessed with curious art should mark each passage to the human heart but not unskilful yet with lordly air read surgeons lectures while they scalp and tear to names like these i pay the hearty vow proud of their worth and not ashamed to bow to these inscribe my rude but honest lays and feel the pleasures of my conscious praise not that i mean to court each lettered name and poorly glimmer from reflected fame but that the muse which owns no servile fear is proud to pay her willing tribute here finis
