introduction from many propositions dispersed through the writings of the ancient geometers and more especially from one whole treatise it appears that the process by which they investigated the solutions of their problems was for the most part the reverse of the method whereby they demonstrated those solutions but what they have delivered upon the tangents of curve lines and the mensuration of curvilinear spaces does not fall under this observation for the analysis they made use of in these cases is no where to be met with in their works in later times indeed a method for investigating such kind of problems has been introduced by considering all curves as composed of an infinite number of indivisible straight lines and curvilinear spaces as composed in the like manner of parallelograms but this being an obscure and indistinct conception it was obnoxious to error  sir isaac newton therefore to avoid the imperfection with which this method of indivisibles was justly charged instituted an analysis for these problems upon other principles considering magnitudes not under the notion of being increased by a repeated accession of parts but as generated by a continued motion or flux he discovered a method to compare together the velocities wherewith homogeneous magnitudes increase and thereby has taught an analysis free from all obscurity and indistinctness  moreover to facilitate the demonstrations for these kinds of problems he invented a synthetic form of reasoning from the prime and ultimate ratios of the contemporaneous augments or decrements of those magnitudes which is much more concise than the method of demonstrating used in these cases by the ancients yet is equally distinct and conclusive  of this analysis called by sir isaac newton his method of fluxions and of his doctrine of prime and ultimate ratios i intend to write in the ensuing discourse for though sir isaac newton has very distinctly explained both these subjects the first in his treatise on the quadrature of curves and the other in his mathematical principles of natural philosophy yet as the authors great brevity has made a more diffusive illustration not altogether unnecessary i have here endeavored to consider more at large each of these methods whereby i hope it will appear they have all the accuracy of the strictest mathematical demonstration  of fluxions in the method of fluxions geometrical magnitudes are not presented to the mind as completely formed at once but as rising gradually before the imagination by the motion of some of their extremes newt introd ad quad curv   thus the line ab may be conceived to be traced out gradually by a point moving on from a to b either with an equable motion or with a velocity in any manner varied and the velocity or degree of swiftness with which this point moves in any part of the line ab is called the fluxion of this line at that place  again suppose two lines ab and ac to form a space unbounded toward bc and upon ab a line de to be erected  now if this line de be put in motion suppose so as to keep always parallel to itself as soon as it  has passed the point a a space bounded on all sides will begin to appear between these three lines for instance when de is moved into the situation fg these three lines will include the space afh here it is evident that this space will increase faster or slower according to the degree of velocity wherewith the line de shall move it is also evident that though the line de should move with an even pace the space afh would not for that reason increase equably but where the line ac was farthest distant from ab the space afh would increase fastest now the velocity or celerity wherewith the space afh at all times increases is called the fluxion of that space  here it is obvious that the velocity wherewith the space augments is not to be understood literally the degree of swiftness with which either the line fg or any other line or point appertaining to the curve actually moves but as this space while the line fg moves on uniformity will increase more in the same portion of time at some places than at others the terms velocity and celerity are applied in a figurative sense to denote the degree wherewith this augmentation in every part proceeds  but we may divest the consideration of the fluxion of the space from this figurative phrase by causing a point so to pass over any straight line ik that the length il measured out while the line de is moving from a to f shall augment in the same proportion with the space afh for this line being thus described faster or slower in the same proportion as the space receives its augmentation the velocity or degree of swiftness wherewith the point describing this line actually mores will mark out the degree of celerity wherewith the space every where increases and here the line il will preserve always the same analogy to the space afh in so much that when the line de is advanced into any other situation mno if ip be to il in the proportion of the space amn to the space afh the fluxion of the space at mn will be to the fluxion thereof at fh as the velocity wherewith the point describing the line ik moves at  to the velocity of the same at l and if any other space qrst be described along with the former by the like motion and at the same time a line vw so that the portion vx shall always have to the length il the same proportion as the space qrst bears to the space afh the fluxion of this latter space at ts will be to the fluxion of the former at fh as the velocity wherewith the line vw is described at x to the velocity wherewith ik is described at l it will hereafter appear that in all the applications of fluxions to geometrical problems where spaces are concerned nothing more is necessary than to determine the velocity wherewith such lines as these are described page      in the same manner may a solid space be conceived to augment with a continual flux by the motion of some plane whereby it is bounded and the velocity of its augmentation which may be estimated in like manner will be the fluxion of that solid  fluxions then in general are the velocities with which magnitudes varying by a continued motion increase or diminish and the magnitudes themselves are reciprocally called the fluents of thse fluxions m vel incrementorum velocitates nominando fluxiones and quantitates genitas nominando fluentes newton introd ad quadr curv   and as different fluents may be understood to be described together in such manner as constantly to preserve some one known relation to each other the doctrine of fluxions teaches how to assign at all times the proportion between the velocities wherewith homogeneous magnitudes varying thus together augment or diminish  this doctrine also reaches on the other hand how from the relation known between the fluxions to discover what relation the fluents themselves bear to each other  it is by means of this proportion only that fluxions are applied to geometrical uses for this doctrine never requires any determinate degree of velocity to be assigned for the fluxion of any one fluent and that the proportion between the fluxions of magnitudes is assignable from the relation known between the magnitudes themselves i now proceed to show  in the first place let us suppose two lines ab and cd to be described together by two points one setting out from a and the other from c and to move in such manner that if ae and cf are lengths described in the same time cf shall be analogous to some power of ae that is if ae be denoted by the letter x then cf shall always be denoted by  where a represents some given line and n any number whatever here i say the proportion between the velocity of the point moving on ab to the velocity of that moving on cd is at all times assignable  for let any other situations that these moving points shall have at the same instant of time be taken either farther advanced from e and f as at g and h or short of the same as at i and k then if eg be denoted by e ch the length passed over by the point moving on the line cd while the point in the line ab has passed from a to g will be expressed by  and if ei be denoted by e ck the length passed over by the point moving on the line cd while the point moving in ab has got only to i will be denoted by  or reducing each of these terms into a series ch will be denoted by  and ck by  hence all the terms of the former series except the first term viz  will denote fh and all the latter series except the first term viz  will denote kf  when the number n is greater than unite while the line ab is described with a uniform motion the point wherewith cd is described moves with a velocity continually accelerated for if ie be equal to eg fh will be greater than kf  now here i say that neither the proportion of fh to eg nor the proportion of kf to ie is the proportion of the velocity which the point moving on cd has at f to the uniform velocity wherewith the point moves on the line ab for while that point is advanced from e to g the point moving on cd has passed from f to h and has moved through that space with a velocity continually accelerated therefore if it had moved during the same interval of time with the velocity it has at f uniformly continued it would not have passed over so long a line consequently fh bears a greater proportion to eg than what the velocity which the point moving on cd has at f bears to the velocity of the point moving uniformly on ab  in like manner kf bears to ie a less proportion than that which the velocity of the point in cd has at f to the velocity of that in ab for as the point in cd in moving from k to f proceeds with a velocity continually accelerated with the velocity it has acquired at f if uniformly continued it would describe in the same space of time a line longer than kf  in the last place i say that no line whatever that shall be greater or less than the line represented by the second term of the foregoing series  viz the term  will bear to the line denoted by e the same proportion as the velocity wherewith the point moves at f bears to the velocity of the point moving in the line ab but that the velocity at f is to that at e as  to e or as  to   if possible let the velocity at f bear to the velocity at e a greater ratio than this suppose the ratio of p to q  in the series whereby ch is denoted the line e can be taken so small that any term proposed in the series shall exceed all the following terms together so that the double of that term shall be greater than the whole collection of that term and all that follow again by diminishing e the ratio of the second term in this series to twice the third that is of  to  or the ratio of x to  shall be greater than any that shall be proposed consequently the line e may be taken so small that twice the third term that is  shall be greater than all the terms following the second and also that the ratio of  to e shall less exceed the ratio of  to e than any other ratio that can be proposed therefore let the ratio of  to e be less than the ratio of p to q then if  be also greater than the third and all the following terms of the series the ratio of the series  to e that is the ratio of fh to eg shall be less than the ratio of p to q or of the velocity at f to the velocity at e which is absurd for it has above been shown that the first of these ratios is greater than the last therefore the velocity at f cannot bear to the velocity at e any greater proportion than that of  to e  on the other hand if possible let the velocity at f bear to the velocity at e a less ratio than that of  to e let this lesser ratio be that of r to s  in the series whereby ck is denoted e may be taken so small that any one term proposed shall exceed the whole sum of all the following terms when added together therefore let e be taken so small that the third term  exceed all the following terms   etc added together but e may also be so small that the ratio of  to  the double of the third term shall be greater than any ratio that can be proposed and the ratio of  to e shall come less short of the ratio of  to e than any other ratio that can be named therefore let this ratio exceed the ratio of r to s then the term  exceeding the whole sum of all the following terms in the series denoting ck the whole series  or kf will in every case bear to e or ei a greater ratio than that of r to s or of the velocity at f to the velocity at e which is absurd for it has above been shown that the first of these ratios is less than the last  if n be less than unite the point in the line cd moves with a velocity continually decreasing and if  be a negative number this point moves backwards but in all these cases the demonstration proceeds in like manner  thus have we here made appear that from the relation between the lines ae and cf the proportion between the velocities wherewith they are described is discoverable for we have shown that the proportion of  to  is the true proportion of the velocity wherewith cf or  augments to the velocity wherewith ae or x is at the same time augmented  again in the three lines ab cd of where the points a c e are given let us suppose g h and i to be three contemporary positions of the points whereby the three lines ab cd of are respectively described and let the motion of the point describing the line of be so regulated with regard to the motion of the other two points that the rectangle under ei and some given line may be always equal to the rectangle under ag and chapter here from the velocities or degrees of swiftness wherewith the points describing ab and cd move the degree of swiftness wherewith the point describing of moves may be determined  the points moving on the lines ab cd may either move both the same way or one forwards and the other backwards  in the first place suppose them to move the same way advancing forward from a and c and since some given line forms with ei a rectangle equal to that under ag and ch suppose qt x ei  ag x ch then if k l m are contemporary positions of the points moving on the lines ab cd of when advanced forward beyond g h and i and n o p three other contemporary positions of the same points before they are arrived at g h and i qt x em will also be  ak x cl and qt x ep  an x co therefore the rectangle under im the difference of the lines ei and em and qt will be  ak x hl  ch x gk and ip x qt  an x ho  ch x gn  here the proportion of the velocity which the point moving on ab has at g to that which the point moving on cd has at h may either keep always the same or continually vary and one of these velocities suppose that of the point moving on the line cd have to the other a proportion gradually augmenting that is if ng and gk are equal hl shall either be equal to oh or greater here since im x qt is  ak x hl  ch x gk and ip x qt  an x ho  ch x gn where ch x gk is  ch x gn and ak x hl in both cases greater than an x ho im will be greater than ip in so much that in both these cases the velocity of the point wherewith the line of is described win have to velocity of the point moving on ab a proportion gradually augmenting here therefore the line im will bear to gk a greater proportion than the velocity of the point moving on the line of when at i bears to the velocity of the point moving on the line ab when at g and the line pi will have a less proportion to ng than the velocity which the point moving on the line of has at i to the velocity which the point moving on the line ab has at g  now let r be to s as the velocity which the point moving on ab has at g to the velocity which the point moving on cd has at h then i say that the velocity which the point moving on of has at i will be to the velocity which the point moving on ab has at g as ag x s  ch x r to qt x r  if possible let the velocity which the point moving on of has at i be to the velocity which the point moving on ab has at g as ag x s  ch x r to the rectangle under r and some line qv less than qt  take w to gk in the ratio of s to r then will ag x s  ch x r be to r x qv as ag x w  ch x gk to qv x gk here because the ratio of the velocity of the point moving on the line cd to the velocity of the point moving on ab either remains constantly the same or gradually augments w is either equal to hl or less but when it is less by diminishing hl the ratio of w to hl may become greater than any ratio that can be proposed short of the ratio of equality the like is true of die ratio of ag to ak by the diminution of gk therefore let gk and hl be so diminished that the ratio of ag x w to ak x hl shall be greater than the ratio of qv to qt then the ratio of ag x w  ch x gk to ak x hl  ch x gk that is to qt x im is greater than the ratio of qv to qt or of qv x im to qt x im therefore ag x w  ch x gk is greater than qv x im and the ratio of ag x w  ch x gk to qv x gk is greater than the ratio of qv x im to qv x gk or of im to gk but the ratio of im to gk is greater than that of the velocity which the point moving on of has at i to the velocity which the point moving on ab has at g therefore the ratio of ag x w  ch x gk to qv x gk or that of ag x s  ch x r to qv x r still more exceeds the ratio of the velocity at i to the velocity at g and consequently the ratio of the velocity at i to the velocity at g is not greater than that of ag x s  ch x r to qt x r  again if possible let the velocity which the point moving on of has at i be to the velocity which the point moving on ab has at g as ag x s  ch x r to the rectangle under r and some line qx greater than qt  here let y be to ng as s to r then will ag x s  ch x r be to r x qx as ag x y  ch x ng to qx x ng but y will be either greater than ho or equal to it and when greater by diminishing ho the ratio of y to ho may become less than any ratio that can be proposed greater than the ratio of equality the like is true of the ratio of ag to an by the diminution of ng therefore let ng and ho be so diminished that the ratio of ag x y to an x ho shall be less than the ratio of qx to qt then the ratio of ag x y  ch x ng to an x ho  ch x ng that is to qt x ip is less than the ratio of qx to qt or of qx x ip to qt x ip consequently ag x y  ch x ng is less than qx x ip and the ratio of ag x y  ch x ng to qx x ng is less than the ratio of qx x ip to qx x ng or of ip to ng but the ratio of ip to ng is less than that of the velocity which the point moving on of has at i to the velocity which the point moving on ab has at g therefore the ratio of ag x y  ch x ng to qx x ng or that of ag x s  ch x r to qx x r is also less than the ratio of the velocity at i to the velocity at g consequently the ratio of the velocity at i to the velocity at g is not less than that of ag x s  ch x r to qt x r  if the points describing ab and cd move backwards together the velocity at i will be the same and the demonstration will proceed in like manner  but if one of the points as that moving on cd recedes while the other on ab advances forward take in cd any fixed point at pleasure z then the point on cd in respect of z moves also forward again take in the line of eg to ag as cz to qt then ag x cz is  qt x eg and ag x ch being  qt x ei ag x hz will be  qt x gi and by the preceding case ag x s  zh x r will be to qt x r as the velocity wherewith the point moving on of separates from g when at i to the velocity which the point moving on ab has at g but as ag is continually increasing and eg keeps always in the same proportion to ag the point g will itself be in motion and the velocity of the point g will be to the velocity at g as the line eg to ag that is as cz to qt or as cz x r to qt x r therefore the velocity wherewith the point moving on of when at i separates from g being to the velocity of the point moving on ab when at g as ag x s  zh x r to qt x r the absolute velocity which the point moving on of has at i will be to the absolute velocity which the point moving on ab has at g as ag x s ch x r to qt x r moving backwards when it separates from g swifter than the point g itself moves that is when ag x s  zh x r is greater than cz x r or ag x s greater than ch x r and when the point moving on of at i separates from g with a slower motion than that wherewith g moves that is when cz x r is greater than ag x s  zh x r or ag x s less than ch x r the point moving on of at i advances forward  we have in our demonstrations only considered the fluxions of lines but by these the fluxions of all other quantities are determined for we have already observed that the fluxions of spaces whether superficial or solid are analogous to the velocities wherewith lines are described that augment in the same proportion with such spaces  thus we have attempted to prove the truth of the rules sir isaac newton has laid down for finding the fluxions of quantities by demonstrating the two cases on which all the rest depend after a method which from all antiquity has been allowed as genuine and universally acknowledged to be free from the least shadow of uncertainty  we shall hereafter endeavor to make manifest that sir isaac newtons own demonstrations are equally just with these we have here exhibited but first we shall prove that in all the applications of this doctrine to the solution of geometrical problems no other conception concerning fluxions is necessary than what we have here given and for this end it will be sufficient to show how fluxions are to be applied to the drawing of tangents to curve lines and to the mensuration of curvilinear spaces  if upon the line ab be erected in any angle another straight line ac and it be put in motion upon the line ab toward b keeping always parallel to itself and proceeding on with a uniform velocity if a point also moves on the line ac with a velocity in any manner regulated this point will describe within the angle under cab some third line de which will be a curve unless the point moves in the line ac likewise with a uniform motion  here i say the line ac being advanced to any situation fg by what has already been written on the nature of fluxions without any adventitious consideration whatever a tangent may be assigned to the curve at the point g  when the point moves on the line ac with an accelerating velocity the curve de will be unequal to the abscisse db now if two other situations hi and kl of the line ac be taken one on each side fg and mgn be drawn parallel to ab while the line ac is moving from the situation hi to fg the point in it will have moved through the length im and while the same line ac moves from fg to kl the point in it will have passed over the length nl and since the point moves with an accelerated velocity im will be less and nl greater than the space which would have been described in the same time by the velocity the point has at g  let fo be taken to fg in the proportion of the velocity wherewith the point f moves on the line ab to the velocity which the point moving on the line fp has at g and the straight line ogq be drawn cutting hi in r and kl in s then fh will be to mr and fk to ns in the same proportion therefore from what has been said above mr will be greater than mi and ns less than nl so that the line oq which unites with the curve at the point g lies on both sides the point g on the same side of the curve that is it does not cross or cut the curve as geometers speak but touches it only at the point g  when the point moves on the line ac with a velocity gradually decreasing the curve will be concave toward the abscisse but in this case the method of reasoning will be still the same  if the curve de be the conical parabola the latus rectum being t and t x fg  df q or fg   the fluxion of df will be to the fluxion of  that is the fluxion of fg as t to  df therefore of is to fg in the same proportion of t to  df or of df to  fg and of is half df  in like manner by the consideration of these velocities only may the mensuration of curvilinear spaces be effected  suppose the curvilinear space abc to be generated by the parallel motion of the line bc upon the line ad with a uniform velocity within the space comprehended between the straight line ad and the curve line az and let the parallelogram aefb be generated with it by the motion of bf accompanying bc suppose another parallelogram  ghik to be generated at the same time by the motion of the line gh equal to ae or bf insisting on the line gl in an angle equal to that under cbd and let the motion of gh be so regulated that the parallelogram ghik be always equal to the curvilinear space abc then it is evident by what has been said above in our explanation of the nature of fluxions that the velocity wherewith the parallelogram eabf increases is to the velocity wherewith the parallelogram ghik or wherewith the curvilinear space abc increases as the velocity wherewith the point b moves to the velocity wherewith the point k moves  now i say the velocity of the point b is to the velocity of the point k as bf to bc  suppose the curve line acz to recede farther and farther from ad then it is evident that while the parallelogram eabf augments uniformly the curvilinear space abc will increase faster and faster therefore in this case the point k moves with a velocity continually accelerated  here if possible suppose the velocity of the point b to bear a less proportion to the velocity of the point k than the ratio of bf to bc that is let the velocity of b be to the velocity of k as bf to some line m greater than bc then it is possible to draw within the curve acz toward d a line as on parallel to bc which though it exceed bc shall be less than m and will the ratio of the velocity of the point b to the velocity of the point k be less than the ratio of bf to no or than the ratio of the parallelogram bp to the parallelogram bo therefore still less than the ratio of the parallelogram bp to the space bcon farther let the parallelogram kirq be taken equal to the space bcon then will the point k have moved from k to q in the time that the point b has moved from b to n now the parallelogram bp is to the parallelogram kr as bn to kq that is as the velocity wherewith the point b passes over bn to the velocity wherewith kq would be described in the same time with a uniform motion but as the point k moves with a velocity continually accelerated its velocity at k is less than this uniform velocity now spoken of therefore the velocity of the point b bears a greater proportion to the velocity of the point k than the parallelogram bp bears to the parallelogram kr that is than the parallelogram bp bears to the space bcon but the first of these ratios was before found less than the last which involves an absurdity therefore the velocity of b bears not to the velocity of k a less proportion than that of bf to bc  again if possible let the velocity of b bear to the velocity of k a greater proportion than that of bf to bc that is the proportion of bf to some line s less than bc and let the line tv be drawn parallel to cb and greater than s and the parallelogram tb be completed here the ratio of the velocity of the point b to the velocity of the point k will be greater than the ratio of bf to tv or than the ratio of the parallelogram bw to the parallelogram bt therefore still greater than the ratio of the parallelogram bw to the curvilinear space vtcb now if the parallelogram xyik be taken equal to the space vtcb that the point describing the line gl may have moved from x to k while vt has moved to bc since the parallelogram bw is to the parallelogram xi as vb to xk that is as the velocity wherewith the point b has passed over vb to the velocity wherewith xk would be described in the same time with a uniform motion the velocity of the point b bears a less proportion to the velocity of the point k than the parallelogram bw bears to the parallelogram xi because xk is described with an accelerating velocity that is the velocity of the point b bears a less proportion to the velocity of the point k than the parallelogram bw bears to the space vtcb but the first of those ratios was before found greater than the last therefore the velocity of b does not bear to the velocity of k a greater proportion than that of bf to bc  if the curve line acz were of any other form the demonstration would still proceed in the same manner  hence it appears that nothing more is necessary toward the mensuration of the curvilinear space abc than to find a line gk so related to ab that while they are described together the velocity of the point wherewith ab is described shall bear the same proportion at any place b to the velocity wherewith the point describing the other line gk moves at the correspondent place k as some given line ae bears to the ordinate bc of the curve acz  the method of finding such lines is the subject of sir isaac newtons treatise upon the quadrature of curves  for example if acz be a conical parabola as before and g x bc  ab q taking gk   the parallelogram hk    ab x bc is equal to the space abc for gk being equal to  the fluxion of gk or the velocity wherewith it is described at k will be to the fluxion of ab or the velocity wherewith b moves as  or bc to gh or ae  having thus as we conceive sufficiently explained what relates to the proportions between the velocities wherewith magnitudes are generated nothing now remains before we proceed to the second part of our present design but to consider the variations to which these velocities are subject  when fluents are not augmented by a uniform velocity it is convenient in many problems to consider how these velocities vary this variation sir isaac newton calls the fluxion of the fluxion and also the second fluxion of the fluent distinguishing the fluxions we have hitherto treated of by the name of the first fluxions these second fluxions may also vary in different magnitudes of the fluent and the variation of these is called the third fluxion of the fluent fourth fluxions are the changes to which the third are subject and so on fluxionum scilicet primarum fluxiones seu mutationes magis aut minus celeres fluxiones secundas nominare licet etc newt quadr curv in princip   in the two fluents ae and cf whose fluxions we compared at page   etc where ae being denoted by x cf was equal to  and the fluxion of ae bore to the fluxion of cf the proportion of  to  here it is evident that the antecedent  of this proportion being a fixed quantity and the consequent  a variable one the fluxion of ae does not bear to the fluxion of cf always the same proportion if n be the number   the fluxion of ae is to the fluxion of cf as a to the variable quantity   x and if n be the number   the fluxion of ae to that of cf will be as a  to   x  therefore if ae be described with an uniform velocity when n is any number greater than unite cf is so described with a velocity continually accelerating that when n is    this velocity augments in the same proportion as cf itself increases and when n is    it augments in the duplicate of that proportion etc  here therefore we see that while one quantity flows uniformly the other is described with a varying motion and the variation in this motion is called the second fluxion of this quantity  it is evident farther that in this instance when n is    the variation of the velocity is uniform for the velocity keeping always in the same proportion to x while x increases uniformly the velocity must also increase after the same manner but when n is    since the velocity is every where as x  and x  does not increase uniformly neither will the velocity augment uniformly so that it appears by this example that the variation in the velocity wherewith magnitudes increase may also vary and this variation is called the third fluxion of the magnitude  in the same manner may the fluxions of the following orders be conceived each order being the variation found in the preceding one and the consideration of velocities thus perpetually varying and their variation itself changing is a useful speculation for most if not all the bodies we have any acquaintance with do actually move with velocities thus modified  a stone for instance in its direct fall toward the earth has its velocity perpetually augmented and in galileos theory of falling bodies when the whole descent is performed near the surface of the earth it is supposed to receive equal augmentations of velocity in equal times in this case therefore the velocity augments uniformly and the second fluxion of the line described by the falling body will in all parts of that line be the same so that third fluxions cannot take place in this instance since the variation of the velocity suffers no change but is every where uniform  but if the stone be supposed to have its gravity at the beginning of its fall less than at the surface of the earth the variation of its velocity at first will then be less than the variation at the end of its motion or in other words the second fluxions in the beginning and end of its fall would be unequal consequently third fluxions would here take place since the variation would be swifter as the body in its fall approached the earth  the stone in this last instance then not only moves with a velocity perpetually varying as in the preceding example but this variation continually changes in the true theory of falling bodies neither this last variation nor any subsequent one can ever be uniform so that fluxions of every order do here actually exist  the same is true of the motion of the planets in their elliptic orbs of the motion of light at the confines of different mediums and of the motion of all pendulous bodies  in short an uniform unchangeable velocity is not to be met with in any of those bodies that fall under our cognizance for in order to continue such a motion as this it is necessary that they should not be disturbed by any force whatever either of impulse or resistance but we know of no spaces in which at least one of these causes of variation does not operate  having thus explained the general conception of second third and following fluxions and having shown that they are applicable to the circumstances which do really occur in all motion we are acquainted with we will now endeavor to declare the manner of assigning them  and in the first place second fluxions may be compared together as follows suppose any line to be so described by motion that it always preserve the same analogy to the first fluxion of any magnitude then the velocity wherewith this line is described that is the fluxion of this line will be analogous to the second fluxion of the aforesaid magnitude for it is evident that this line will perpetually alter in magnitude in the same proportion as the fluxion to which it is analogous varies  suppose ab to be a fluent described with a varying motion the second fluxion at any one point c may be compared with the second fluxion at any other point d by causing the line of to be described by the motion of a point so as to keep always the same analogy to the first fluxion of the fluent ab suppose eg be to eh as the first fluxion at c to the first fluxion at d then the second fluxion at c will be to the second fluxion at d as the first fluxion of the line of at g to the first fluxion of the same at h  in like manner if another fluent ik be generated along with the former fluent ab and also described with a variable motion the second fluxion of this latter fluent ik at any place l may be compared with the second fluxion at any part of the former fluent ab by describing the line mn with such a motion as always to preserve the same analogy to the first fluxion of the fluent ik as the line of bore to the first fluxion of ab suppose mo to be to eg as the first fluxion of ik at l to the first fluxion of ab at c then the second fluxion at l will be to the second fluxion at c as the velocity wherewith the line mn is described at o to the velocity wherewith the line of is described at g  in the same manner if a line be described analogous to the second fluxion of any magnitude the fluxion of this line will express the third fluxion of that magnitude and so of all the other orders of fluxions  in the next place the relation in which the several orders of fluxions stand with regard to each other will appear by the following proposition  let the line ab be described by the motion of the point c moving with a varying velocity and let a series of lines be adapted to this line ab in such manner that the point d moving upon the first line of this series at the same time with the point c may ever terminate a line ed analogous to the velocity of the point c the point f at the same time terminating upon the second line of this series a line gf analogous to the velocity of the point d and hi upon the third line being by the motion of the point i made ever analogous to the velocity of the point f etc  if now another line kl be described by the motion of the point m and if a series of lines be adapted to this line kl in the like analogy by the motion of the points n o p so that qn be to ed as the velocity of the point m to the velocity of the point c to to gf as the velocity of the point n to that of the point d and sp to hi as the velocity of the point o to that of f i say that if the velocity of the point c has to the velocity of the point m always the same proportion at equal distances from a and k that then the velocity of d to that of n will be in the duplicate of that proportion the velocity of f to that of o in the triplicate of that proportion the velocity of i to that of p in the quadruplicate of that proportion and so on in the same order as far as these series of lines are extended  suppose the velocity of the point c be always to the velocity of the point m as the line t to the line v when these points are at equal distances from a and k then since the times in which equal lines are described are reciprocally as the velocities of the describing points the time in which ac receives any additional increment will be to the time in which km shall have received an equal increment as v to t  now ed is always to qn in the proportion of t to v therefore the variation by increase or diminution that ed shall receive to the like variation which qn shall receive while the lines ac km are augmented by equal increments will be also as t to v but the time wherein ed will receive that variation to the time wherein qn will receive its variation will be as v to t consequently since the velocities wherewith different lines are described are as the lines themselves directly and as the times of description reciprocally the velocity of the point d to that of the point n will be in the duplicate ratio of t to v  again the velocity of d being to the velocity of n when ac and km are equal always in the same duplicate ratio of t to v and gf being always to to as the velocity of the point d to the velocity of the point n the variation by increase or diminution of the line gf to the like variation of to while ac and km receive equal augmentation will also be as the velocity of d to the velocity of n that is in the duplicate ratio of t to v but the time in which the line gf receives its variation will be to the time in which to receives its variation as v to t hence the velocity of the point f will be to the velocity of the point o in the triplicate ratio of t to v  after the same manner the velocity of the point i will appear to have to the velocity of the point p the quadruplicate of the ratio of t to v  but from what we have said above it is evident that the velocity of the point d is to the velocity of the point n as the second fluxion of ac to the second fluxion of km the velocity of the point f to the velocity of the point o as the third fluxion of ac to the third fluxion of km and the velocity of the point i to the velocity of the point p as the fourth fluxion of ac to the fourth fluxion of km and hence appears the truth of sir isaac newtons observation at the end of the first proposition of his book of quadratures that a second fluxion and the second power of a first fluxion or the product under two first fluxions a third fluxion and the third power of a first or the product under a first and second and so on are homologous terms in any equation for as it appears by this proposition that if the velocity wherewith any fluent is augmented be in any proportion increased its second fluxion will increase in the duplicate of that proportion the third fluxion in the triplicate and the fourth fluxion in the quadruplicate of that same proportion it is manifest that the terms in any equation that shall involve a second fluxion will preserve always the same proportion to the terms involving the second power of a first fluxion or the product of two first fluxions the terms involving a third fluxion will preserve the same proportion to the terms involving the third power of a first or the product of a first and second or the product of three first fluxions and the terms containing a fourth fluxion will keep the same proportion to the terms containing the fourth power of a first the product of a second and the second power of a first the second power of a second or the product of a first and third etc however be increased or diminished the first fluxion or the velocity wherewith the fluents augment  in the problems concerning curve lines which relate to the degree of curvature in any point of those curves or to the variation of their curvature in different parts these superior orders of fluxions are useful for by the inflexion of the curve whilst its abscisse flows uniformly the fluxion of the ordinate must continually vary and thereby will be attended with these superior orders of fluxions  for example were it required to compare the different degrees of curvature either of different curves or of the same curve in different parts and in order thereto a circle should be sought whose degree of curvature might be the same with that of any curve proposed in any point that should be assigned such a circle may be found by the help of second fluxions when the abscisses of two curves flow with equal velocity where the ordinates have equal first fluxions the tangent make equal angles with their respective ordinates if now the second fluxions of these ordinates are also equal the curves in those points must be equally deflected from their tangents that is have equal degrees of curvature upon this principle such circles as have here been mentioned may be found by the following method  the curve abc being given let it be required to find a circle equally incurvated with this curve at the point b suppose efg to be this circle in which the tangent fh at the point f makes with the ordinate fi the same angle as the tangent bk drawn to the other curve abc at the point b makes with the ordinate bl of that curve now if the two abscisses al and ei are described with equal velocities the first fluxion of the ordinates lb and if will be equal and therefore if the two curves are equally incurvated at the points b and f the second fluxions of these ordinates will be also equal if m be the center of the circle efg and me be denoted by a and mi by x if will be   and by the rules for finding fluxions the first fluxion of if will be to the fluxion of mi or of x as x to   now suppose the line no to be so described that the fluxion of mi or of x shall be to the first fluxion of if as some given line e to np in the line no then will np be   suppose likewise the lines qr to be so described that the fluxion of al in the curve abc shall be to the first fluxion of lb as the same given line e to qs in the line qr here the first fluxions of if and lb being equal np and qs are equal and since the second fluxions of if and lb are equal the fluxions of np and qs are also equal but np was   and by the rules for finding fluxions the fluxion of np will be to the fluxion of mi as eaa to  that is as e x em q to if c therefore in the curve abc the fluxion of qs to the fluxion of al will be in the same proportion of e x em q to if c hence by finding first qs then its fluxion from the equation expressing the nature of the curve abc the proportion of e x em q to if c will be given consequently the proportion of e to if will be also given because the ratio of em q to if q is the same with the given ratio of hf q to hi q or of kb q to kl q and hereby the circle efg will be given whose curvature is equal to the curvature of the curve abc at the point b  suppose the curve abc to be the conical parabola where al q shall be equal to g x lb g being the latus rectum of the axis here e will be to qs as g to   al for that is the ratio of the fluxion of al to the fluxion of bl therefore qs is   al and consequently the fluxion of qs to the fluxion of al that is e x em q to if c as   e to g or as   e x em q to g x em q in so much that if c is  g x em q and the given ratio of if q to em q namely the ratio of kl q to kb q is the same with the ratio of g to if that is if is equal to half the latus rectum appertaining to the diameter of the parabola whose vertex is the point b  this is all we think necessary toward giving a just and clear idea of the nature of fluxions and for proving the certainty of the deductions made from them for it must now be manifest to every reader that mathematical quantities become the proper object of this doctrine of fluxions whenever they are supposed to increase by any continued motion of prolongation dilatation expansion or other kind of augmentation provided such augmentation be directed by some general rule whence the measure of the increase of these quantities may from time to time be estimated and when different homogeneous magnitudes increase after this manner together one may vary faster than another now the velocity of increase in each quantity is the fluxion of that quantity this is the true interpretation of sir isaac newtons appellation of fluxions incrementorum velocitates for this doctrine does not suppose the fluents themselves to have any motion fluxions are not the velocities with which the fluents or even the increments which those fluents receive are themselves moved but the degrees of velocity wherewith those increments are generated subjects incapable of local motion such as fluxions themselves may also have their fluxions in this we do not ascribe to these fluxions any actual motion for to ascribe motion or velocity to what is itself only a velocity would be wholly unintelligible the fluxion of another fluxion is only a variation in the velocity which is that fluxion in short light heat sound the motion of bodies the power of gravity and whatever else is capable of variation and of having that variation assigned for this reason comes under the present doctrine nothing more being understood by the fluxion of any subject than the degree of such its variation  to assign the velocities of variation or increase in different homogeneous quantities it is necessary to compare the degrees of augmentation which those quantities receive in equal portions of time and in this doctrine of fluxions no farther use is made of such increments for the application of this doctrine to geometrical problems depends upon the knowledge of these velocities only but the consideration of the increments themselves may be made subservient to the like uses upon other principles the explanation of which leads us to the second part of our design  of prime and ultimate ratios the primary method of comparing together the magnitudes of rectilinear spaces is by laying them one upon another thus all the right lined spaces which in the first book of euclide are proved to be equal are the sum or difference of such spaces as would cover one another this method cannot be applied in comparing curvilinear spaces with rectilinear ones because no part whatever of a curve line can be laid upon a straight line so as wholly to coincide with it for this purpose therefore the ancient geometers made use of a method of reasoning since commonly called the method of exhaustions which consists in describing upon the curvilinear space a rectilinear one which though not equal to the other yet might differ less from it than by any the most minute difference whatever that should be proposed and thereby proving the two spaces they would compare could be neither greater nor less than each other  for example in order to prove the equality between the space comprehended within the circumference of a circle and a triangle whose base should be equal to the circumference of that circle and its altitude to the semidiameter archimedes takes this method about the circle he describes a polygon as abc and makes it appear that by multiplying the sides of this polygon there may at length be described such an one as shall exceed the circle less than by any difference that shall be proposed how minute soever that difference be by this means it was easy to prove that the triangle def whose base of should be equal to the circumference of the circle and altitude ed equal to the semidiameter is not greater than the circle for were it greater how small soever be the excess it were possible to describe about the circle a polygon less than the triangle but the circumference of the polygon is greater than the circumference of the circle therefore the polygon can never be less but must be always greater than the triangle for the polygon is equal to a triangle whose altitude is the semidiameter of the circle and base equal to the circumference of the polygon it appears therefore impossible for the triangle def to be greater than the circle  thus far archimedes makes use of the polygon circumscribing the circle and no farther but inscribing another within the circle he proves by a similar process of reasoning that it is impossible for the triangle to be less than the circle whereby at length it becomes certain that the triangle def is neither greater nor less than the circle but equal to it  however the triangle may be proved not to be less than the circle by the circumscribed polygon also for were it less another triangle degrees whose base eg is greater than of might be taken which should not be greater than the circle but a polygon can be circumscribed about the circle the circumference of which shall exceed the circumference of the circle by less than any line that can be named consequently by less than fg that is the circumference of the polygon shall be less than eg and the polygon less than the triangle degrees therefore it is impossible that this triangle should not exceed the circle since it is greater than the polygon consequently the triangle def cannot be less than the circle  thus the circle and triangle may be proved to be equal by comparing them with one polygon only and sir isaac newton has instituted upon this principle a briefer method of conception and expression for demonstrating this sort of propositions than what was used by the ancients and his ideas are equally distinct and adequate to the subject with theirs though more complex it became the first writers to choose the most simple form of expression and the least compounded ideas possible but sir isaac newton thought he should oblige the mathematicians by using brevity provided he introduced no modes of conception difficult to be comprehended by those who are not unskilled in the ancient methods of writing  the concise form into which sir isaac newton has cast his demonstrations may very possibly create a difficulty of apprehension in the minds of some unexercised in these subjects but otherwise his method of demonstrating by the prime and ultimate ratios of varying magnitudes is not only just and free from any defect in itself but easily to be comprehended at least by those who have made these subjects familiar to them by reading the ancients  in this method any fixed quantity which some varying quantity by a continual augmentation or diminution shall prepetually approach but never pass is considered as the quantity to which the varying quantity will at last or ultimately become equal provided the varying quantity can be made in its approach to the other to differ from it by less than by any quantity how minute soever that can be assigned princ philos lib i lern     upon this principle the equality between the forementioned circle and triangle def is at once deducible for since the polygon circumscribing the circle approaches to each according to all the conditions above set down this polygon is to be considered as ultimately becoming equal to both and consequently they must be esteemed equal to each other  that this is a just conclusion is most evident for if either of these magnitudes be supposed less than the other this polygon could not approach to the least within some assignable distance  ratios also may so vary as to be confined after the same manner to some determined limit and such limit of any ratio is here considered as that with which the varying ratio will ultimately coincide ibid   from any ratios having such a limit it does not follow that the variable quantities exhibiting that ratio have any final magnitude or even limit which they cannot pass  for suppose two magnitudes b and b  a whose difference shall be a are each of them perpetually increasing by equal degrees it is evident that if a remains unchanged the proportion of b  a to b is a proportion that tends nearer and nearer to the proportion of equality as b becomes larger it is also evident that the proportion of b  a to b may by taking b of a sufficient magnitude be brought at last nearer to the proportion of equality than to any other assignable proportion and consequently the ratio of equality is to be considered as the ultimate ratio of b  a to b the ultimate proportion then of these quantities is here assigned though the quantities themselves have no final magnitude  the same holds true in decreasing quantities  the quadrilateral abcd bears to the quadrilateral ebcf the proportion of ab  dc to be  cf provided the two lines ae and df are parallel now if the line df be drawn nearer to ae this proportion of ab  dc to be  cf will not remain the same unless the lines da cb fe produced will meet in the same point and this proportion by diminishing the distance between df and ae may at last be brought nearer to the proportion of ab to be than to any other whatever therefore the proportion of ab to be is to be considered as the ultimate proportion of abdc to becf or as the ultimate proportion of the quadrilateral abcd to the quadrilateral ebcf  here these quadrilaterals can never bear one to the other the proportion between ab and be nor have either of them any final magnitude or even so much as a limit but by the diminution of the distance between df and ae they diminish continually without end and the proportion between ab and be is for this reason called the ultimate proportion of the two quadrilaterals because it is the proportion which those quadrilaterals can never actually have to each other but the limit of that proportion  the quadrilaterals may be continually diminished either by dividing bc in any known proportion in g drawing hgi parallel to ae by dividing again bg in the like manner and by continuing this division without end or else the line df may be supposed to advance toward ae with an uninterrupted motion till the quadrilaterals quite disappear or vanish and under this latter notion these quadrilaterals may very properly be called vanishing quantities since they are now considered as never having any stable magnitude but decreasing by a continued motion till they come to nothing and since the ratio of the quadrilateral abcd to the quadrilateral befc while the quadrilaterals diminish approaches to that of ab to be in such manner that this ratio of ab to be is the nearest limit that can be assigned to the other it is by no means a forced conception to consider the ratio of ab to be under the notion of the ratio wherewith the quadrilaterals vanish and this ratio may properly be called the ultimate ratio of two vanishing quantities  the reader will perceive i am endeavoring to explain sir isaac newtons expression ratio ultima quantitatum evanescentium and i have rendered the latin participle evanescens by the english one vanishing and not by the word evanescent which having the form of a noun adjective does not so certainly imply that motion which ought here to be kept carefully in mind the quadrilaterals abcd befc become vanishing quantities from the time we first ascribe to them this perpetual diminution that is from that time they are quantities going to vanish and as during their diminution they have continually different proportions to each other so the ratio between ab and be is not to be called merely ratio harum quantitatum evanescentium but ultima ratio vid princ philos page         should we suppose the line df first to coincide with the line ae and then recede from it by that means giving birth to the quadrilaterals under this conception the ratio of ab to be may very justly be considered as the ratio wherewith the quadrilaterals by this motion commence and this ratio may also properly be called the first or prime ratio of these quadrilaterals at their origin  here i have attempted to explain in like manner the phrase ratio prima quantitatum nascentium but no english participle occuring to me whereby to render the word nascens i have been obliged to use circumlocution under the present conception of the quadrilaterals they are to be called nascantes not only at the very instant of their first production but according to the sense in which such participles are used in common speech after the same manner as when we say of a body which has lain at rest that it is beginning to move though it may have been some little time in motion on this account we must not use the simple expression ratio quantitatum nascentium for by this we shall not specify any particular ratio but to denote the ratio between ab and be we must call it ratio prima quadrilaterum nascentium vid ibid   we see here the same ratio may be called sometimes the prime at other times the ultimate ratio of the same varying quantities as these quantities are considered either under the notion of vanishing or of being produced before the imagination by an uninterrupted motion the doctrine under examination receives its name from both these ways of epxpression  thus we have given a general idea of the manner of conception upon which this doctrine is built but as in the former part of this discourse we confirmed the doctrine of fluxions by demonstrations of the most circumstantial kind so here to remove all distrust concerning the conclusiveness of this method of reasoning we shall draw out its first principles into a more diffusive form  for this purpose we shall in the first place define an ultimate magnitude to be the limit to which a varying magnitude can approach within any degree of nearness whatever though it can never be made absolutely equal to it  thus the circle discoursed of above according to this definition is to be called the ultimate magnitude of the polygon circumscribing it because this polygon by increasing the number of its sides can be made to differ from the circle less than by any space that can be proposed how small soever and yet the polygon can never become either equal to the circle or less  in like manner the circle will be the ultimate magnitude of the polygon inscribed with this difference only that as in the first case the varying magnitude is always greater here it will be less than the ultimate magnitude which is its limit  again the triangle def is the ultimate magnitude of the triangle degrees because the base eg being always equal to the circumference of the polygon will constantly be greater than the base of equal to the circumference of the circle only and yet eg may be made to approach of nearer than by any difference that can be named  upon this definition we may ground the following proposition that when varying magnitudes keep constantly the same proportion to each other their ultimate magnitudes are in the same proportion  let a and b be two varying magnitudes which keep constantly in the same proportion to each other and let c be the ultimate magnitude of a and d the ultimate magnitude of b i say that c is to d in the same proportion  as a is a varying magnitude continually approaching to c but can never become equal to it a may be either always greater or always less than c in the first place suppose it greater when a is greater than c in approaching to c it is continually diminished therefore b keeping always in the same proportion to a b in approaching to its limit d is also continually diminished  now if possible let the ratio of c to d be greater than that of a to b that is suppose c to have to some magnitude e greater than d the same proportion as a has to b since c is the ultimate magnitude of a in the sense of the preceding definition a can be made to approach nearer to c than by any difference that can be proposed but can never become equal to it or less therefore since c is to e as a to b b will always exceed e consequently can never approach to d so near as by the excess of e above d which is absurd for since d is supposed the ultimate magnitude of b it can be approached by b nearer than by any assignable difference  after the same manner neither can the ratio of d to c be greater than that of b to a  if the varying magnitude a be less than c it follows in like manner that neither the ratio of c to d can be less than that of a to b nor the ratio of d to c less than that of b to a  it is an evident corollary from this proposition that the ultimate magnitudes of the same or equal varying magnitudes are equal  now from this proposition the forementioned equality between the circle and triangle def will again readily appear for the circle being the ultimate magnitude of the polygon and the triangle def the ultimate magnitude of the triangle degrees since the polygon and the triangle degrees are equal by this proposition the circle and triangle def will be also equal  if the preceding proposition be admitted as a genuine deduction from the definition upon which it is grounded this demonstration of the equality of the circle and triangle cannot be excepted to for no objection can lie against the definition itself as no inference is there deduced but only the sense explained of the term defined in it  the other part of this method which concerns varying ratios may be put into the same form by defining ultimate ratios as follows  if there be two quantities that are one or both continually varying either by being continually augmented or continually diminished and if the proportion they bear to each other does by this means perpetually vary but in such a manner that it constantly approaches nearer and nearer to some determined proportion and can also be brought at last in its approach nearer to this determined proportion than to any other that can be assigned but can never pass it this determined proportion is then called the ultimate proportion or the ultimate ratio of those varying quantities  to this definition of the sense in which the term ultimate ratio or ultimate proportion is to be understood we must subjoin the following proposition that all the ultimate ratios of the same varying ratio are the same with each other  suppose the ratio of a to b continually varies by the variation of one or both of the terms a and b if the ratio of c to d be the ultimate ratio of a to b and the ratio of e to f be likewise the ultimate ratio of the same i say the ratio of c to d is the same with the ratio of e to f  if possible let the ratio of e to f differ from that of c to d since the ratio of c to d is the ultimate ratio of a to b the ratio of a to b in its approach to that of c to d can be brought at last nearer to it than to any other whatever therefore if the ratio of e to f differ from that of c to d the ratio of a to b will either pass that of e to f or can never approach so near to it as to the ratio of c to d in so much that the ratio of e to f cannot be the ultimate ratio of a to b in the sense of this definition  the two definitions here set down together with the general propositions annexed to them comprehend the whole foundation of this method we are now explaining  we find in former writers some attempts toward so much of this method as depends upon the first definition lucas valerius in a most excellent treatise on the center of gravity of solid bodies has given a proposition nothing different but in the form of the expression from that we have subjoined to our first definition from which he demonstrates with brevity and elegance his propositions concerning the mensuration and center of gravity of the sphere spheroid parabolical and hyperbolical conoids this author writ before the doctrine of indivisibles was proposed to the world and since andrew tacquet in his treatise on the cylindrical and annular solids has made the same proposition though something differently expressed the basis of his demonstrations at the same time very judiciously exposing the inconclusiveness of the reasonings from indivisibles however the consideration of the limits of varying proportions when the quantities expressing those proportions have themselves no limits which renders this method of prime and ultimate ratios much more extensive we owe entirely to sir isaac newton that this method as thus completed is applicable not only to the subjects treated by the ancients in the method of exhaustions but to many others also of the greatest importance appears from our authors immortal treatise on the mathematical principles of natural philosophy  however we shall farther illustrate this doctrine in applying it to the same general problems as those whereby the use of fluxions was above exemplified  we have already given one instance of its use in determining the dimensions of curvilinear spaces we shall now set forth the same by a more general example  let abc be a curve line its abscisse ad and an ordinate db if the parallelogram efgh formed upon the given line of under the same angle as the ordinates of the curve make with its abscisse be in all parts so related to the curve that the ultimate ratio of any portion of the abscisse ad to the correspondent portion of the line eh shall be that of the given line of to the ordinate of the curve at the beginning of that portion of the abscisse then will the curvilinear space adb be equal to the parallelogram eg  in the curve let the abscisse ad be divided into any number of equal parts ai il ln nd and let the ordinates ik lm no be drawn and also in the parallelogram eg the correspondent lines pq rs and tv in the curve complete the parallelograms iw lx ny and in the parallelogram eg make the parallelogram pz equal to the parallelogram iw the parallelogram rg equal to lx and the parallelogram td equal to ny then the whole figure ikwmxoyd will be equal to the whole figure pzgdh but in the curve by increasing the number and diminishing the breadth of these parallelograms the figure ikwmxoyd will approach nearer and nearer in magnitude to the curvilinear space adb in so much that their difference may be reduced to less than any space that shall be assigned therefore the curvilinear space adb is the ultimate magnitude of the figure ikwmxoyd farther since the parallelogram eg is in all parts so related to the curve that the ultimate ratio of every portion as ln of the abscisse ad to rt the correspondent portion of eh is the same with the ratio of of or rs to lm the ultimate ratio of the parallelogram lx or its equal rg to the parallelogram rv is the ratio of equality this is also true of all the other correspondent parallelograms therefore the ultimate ratio of the figure pzgdh to the parallelogram pg is the ratio of equality that is the figure pzgdh by increasing the number of its parallelograms can be brought nearer to the parallelogram pg than by any difference whatever that may be proposed moreover by increasing of the number of ordinates in the curve the residuary portion ai of the abscisse can be reduced to less than any magnitude that shall be proposed whereby the parallelogram eq corresponding to this portion of the abscisse may be also reduced to less than any magnitude that can be proposed and the parallelogram pg be brought to differ less from eg than by any assignable magnitude since therefore the figure pzgdh can be brought nearer to the parallelogram pg than by any difference that can be assigned the figure pzgdh can be brought also nearer to the parallelogram eg than by any difference that can be assigned consequently the parallelogram eg is the ultimate magnitude of the figure pzgdh therefore the figures pzgdh and ik wmxoyd being equal varying magnitudes and the ultimate magnitudes of equal varying magnitudes being equal the curvilinear space adb is equal to the parallelogram eg  suppose the curve abc were a cubical parabola unequal to the abscisse that is suppose th a given line and th q x lm  al c if eh be   x of then the parallelogram eg will be equal to the space adb  as eh is   er will be   and et   consequently rt   therefore the parallelogram eg is here so related in all parts to the curve that ln is to rt as th q x of to al c  al q x ln  al x ln q  ln c now it is evident that the ratio of ln to rt can never be so great as the ratio of th q x of to al c but yet by diminishing ln the ratio of ln to rt may at last be brought nearer to this ratio than to any other whatever that should be proposed consequently by the preceding definition of what is to be understood by an ultimate ratio the ratio of th q x of to al c is the ultimate ratio of ln to rt but al c being  th q x lm th q x of is to al c as of to lm therefore the ratio of of to lm is the ultimate ratio of ln to rt consequently by the preceding general proposition the parallelogram eg is equal to the curvilinear space adb and this parallelogram is equal to ad x db  again this method is equally useful in determining the situation of the tangents to curve lines  in the curve abc whose abscisse is ad let eb be a tangent at the point b let bf be the ordinate at the same point b and gh another ordinate parallel to it which shall meet the tangent in i and the line bk parallel to the abscisse ad in k here the ratio of hk the difference of the ordinates to bk can never be the same with the ratio of bf to fe unless by the figure of the curve the tangent chance to cut it in some point remote from b this ratio of bf to fe being the same with that of ik to kb but it is farther evident that the nearer gh is to fb the ratio of kh to kb will approach so much the nearer to the ratio of ik to kb and the angle which the curve bc makes with the tangent by being less than any rightlined angle it is manifest that gh may be made to approach toward fb till the ratio of hk to kb shall at last approach nearer to the ratio of ik to kb or of bf to fe than to any other ratio whatever that shall be proposed that is the ratio of bf to fe is the ultimate ratio of hk to kb therefore if from the properties of the curve abc the ratio of hk to kb be determined and from thence their ultimate ratio assigned this ratio thus assigned will be the ratio of bf to fe because all the ultimate ratios of the same variable ratio are the same with each other  suppose the curve abc again to be a cubical parabola where bf is   and gh   here hk will be   therefore hk is to fg or bk as   af x ag  fg q to z q consequently the ratio of hk to bk can never be so small as the ratio of  af q to z q but by diminishing bk it may be brought nearer to that ratio than to any other whatever that is the ratio of  af q to z q is the ultimate ratio of hk to kb therefore if bf bear to fe the ratio of  af q to z q the line be will touch the curve in b and of will be equal to af  after the situation of the tangent has been thus determined the magnitude of hi the part of the ordinate intercepted between the tangent and the curve will be known for example in this instance since bf is to fe that is ik to fg as  af q to z q ik will be   and hk being   hi will be   now by this line hi may the curvature of curve lines be compared  let the straight line ab touch the curve cbd in the point b ce being the abscisse of the curve and bf the ordinate at b take any other point g in the curve and through the points g b describe the circle bgh that shall touch the line ab in b lastly draw ikgl parallel to fb here are two angles formed at the point b with the circle one by the line bk the other by the curve and the proportion of the first of these angles to the second will be different in different distances of the point g from the point b and by the approach of g to b the angle between the circle and curve will be diminished even so much as at length to bear a less proportion to the angle between the circle and tangent than any that can be proposed that is by the approach of the point g to b the angle between the tangent and circle may be brought nearer to the angle between the tangent and the curve than by any difference how minute soever homogeneous to those angles therefore the magnitude of the circle being continually varied by the gradual approach of g to b and the angle between the tangent and circle thereby also varied the angle between the tangent and curve is the ultimate magnitude of these angles that is the ultimate of these circles determines the degree of curvature of the curve cbd at the point b but in the circle the rectangle under lkg is equal to the square of bk and whereas the magnitude of kl will perpetually vary by the approach of the point g toward b if bm taken in fb produced be the ultimate magnitude of kl the circle described through m and b to touch the tangent ak in b will be the circle by which the curvature of the curve cbd in b is to be estimated  suppose the curve cbd to be the cubical parabola as before where z q x fb is  cf c then kg will be   hence lk   is   but it is evident that in a given situation of the tangent ab the ratio of bk q to fi q is given therefore lk will be reciprocally as  cf  fi and will continually increase as the point g approaches to the point b but can never be so great as to equal  yet by the near approach of g to b lk may be brought nearer to this quantity than by any difference that can be proposed therefore by our former definition of ultimate magnitudes  is the ultimate magnitude of lk consequently if bm be taken equal to this  the circle described through m is that required  we have now gone through all we think needful for illustrating the doctrine of prime and ultimate ratios and by the definitions we have given of ultimate magnitudes and proportions compared with the instances we have subjoined of the application of this doctrine to geometrical problems we hope our readers cannot fail of forming so distinct a conception of this method of reasoning that it shall appear to them equally geometrical and scientific with the most unexceptionable demonstration  therefore we shall in the next place proceed to consider the demonstrations which sir isaac newton has himself given upon the principles of this method of his precepts for assigning the fluxions of flowing quantities  of sir isaac newtons method of demonstrating his rules for finding fluxions sir isaac newton has comprehended his directions for computing the fluxions of quanties in two propositions one in his introduction to his treatise on the quadrature of curves the other is the first proposition of the book itself in the first he assigns the fluxion of a simple power the latter is universal for all quantities whatever  for determining the fluxion of a simple power suppose the line ab to be denoted by x and another line cd to be denoted by  or by considering a as unite cd will be denoted by xn  suppose the points b and d to move in equal spaces of time into two other positions e and f then df will be to be in the ratio of the velocity wherewith df would be described with an uniform motion to the velocity wherewith be will be described in the same time with an uniform motion but if the point describing the line ab moves uniformly the velocity wherewith the line cd is described will not be uniform therefore the space df is not described with a uniform velocity in so much that the velocity wherewith df would be uniformly described is never the same with the velocity at the point d but by diminishing the magnitude of df the uniform velocity wherewith df would be described may be made to approach at pleasure to the velocity at the point d therefore the velocity at the point d is the ultimate magnitude of the velocity wherewith df would be uniformly described consequently the ratio of the velocity at d to the velocity at b is the ultimate ratio of the velocity wherewith df would be uniformly described to the velocity wherewith be is uniformly described but df being to be as the velocity wherewith df would be uniformly described to that wherewith be is uniformly described the ultimate ratio of df to be is also the ultimate ratio of the first of these velocities to the last because all the ultimate ratios of the same varying ratio are the same with each other therefore the ratio of the velocity at d to the velocity at b that is of the fluxion of cd to the fluxion of ab is the same with the ultimate ratio of df to be  if now the augment be be denoted by o the augment df will be denoted by  and here it is obvious that all the terms after the first taken together may be made less than any assignable part of the first consequently the proportion of the first term  to the whole augment may be made to approach within any degree whatever of the proportion of equality and therefore the ultimate proportion of  to o or of df to be is that of  only to o or the proportion of  to    and we have already proved that the proportion of the velocity at d to the velocity at b is the same with the ultimate proportion of df to be therefore the velocity at d is to the velocity at b or the fluxion of xn to the fluxion of x as  to    in the first proposition of the treatise of quadratures the author proposes the relation betwixt three varying quantities x y and z to be expressed by this equation  suppose these qnantities to be augmented by any contemporaneous increments great or small let us also suppose some quantity o to be described at the same time by some known velocity and let that velocity be denoted by m the velocity wherewith the augment of x would be uniformly described in that time be denoted by x the velocity wherewith the augment of y would be uniformly described in the same time by y and lastly the velocity wherewith the augment of z would be uniformly described in the same time by z then   and  will express the contemporaneous increments of x y and z respectively now when x is become  y is become  and z become  the former equation will become  here as the first of these equations exhibits the relation between the three quanties x y z as far as the same can be expressed by a single equation so this second equation with the assistance of the first will express the relation between the augments of these quantities but the first of these equations may be taken out of the latter whence will arise this third equation   which also expresses the relation between the several increments and likewise if o be a given quantity this equation will equally express the relation between the velocities wherewith these several increments are generated respectively by a uniform motion and this equation being divided by o will be reduced to more simple terms and yet will equally express the relation of these velocities and then the equation will become  now let us form an equation out of the terms of this from which the quantity o is absent this equation will be  and this equation multiplied by m becomes  it is evident that this equation does not express the relation of the forementioned velocities yet by the diminution of o this equation may come within any degree of expressing that relation therefore by what has been so often inculcated this equation will express the ultimate relation of these velocities but the fluxions of the quantities x y z are the ultimate magnitudes of these velocities so that the ultimate relation of these velocities is the relation of the fluxions of these quantities consequently this last equation represents the relation of the fluxions of the quantities x y z  it is now presumed we have removed all difficulty from the demonstrations which sir isaac newton has himself given of his rules for finding fluxions  in the beginning of this discourse we have endeavored at such a description of fluxions as might not fail of giving a distinct and clear conception of them we then confirmed the fundamental rules for comparing fluxions together by demonstrations of the most formal and unexceptionable kind and now having justified sir isaac newtons own demonstrations we have not only shown that his doctrine of fluxions is an unerring guide in the solution of geometrical problems but also that he himself had fully proved the certainty of this method for accomplishing this last part of our undertaking it was necessary to explain at large another method of reasoning established by him no less worthy consideration since as the first enabled him to investigate the geometrical problems whereby he was conducted in those remote searches into nature which have been the subject of universal admiration so to the latter method is owing the surprising brevity wherewith he has demonstrated those discoveries  conclusion thus we have at length finished the whole of our design and shall therefore put a period to this discourse with the explanation of the term momentum frequently used by sir isaac newton though we have yet had no occasion to mention it  and in this i shall be the more particular because sir isaac newtons definition of momenta that they are the momentaneous increments or decrements of varying quantities may possibly be thought obscure therefore i shall give a fuller delineation of them and such a one as shall agree to the general sense of his description and never fail to make the use of this term in every proposition where it occurs clearly to be understood  in determining the ultimate ratios between the contemporaneous differences of quantities it is often previously required to consider each of these differences apart in order to discover how much of those differences is necessary for expressing that ultimate ratio in this case sir isaac newton distinguishes by the name of momentum so much of any difference as constitutes the term used in expressing this ultimate ratio  thus in page    where be is  o and df equal to  the ultimate ratio of df to be being the ratio of  to o such a part only of df as is denoted by  without the addition of any of the following terms of the series constitutes the whole of the momentum of the line cd but the momentum of ab is the same as the whole difference be or o  in like manner if a and b denote varying quantities and their contemporaneous increments be represented by a and b the rectangle under any given line m and a is the contemporaneous increment of the rectangle under m and a and a x b  b x a  a x b is the like increment of the rectangle under a b and here the whole increment m x a represents the momentum of the rectangle under m a but a x b  b x a only and not the whole increment a x b  b x a  a x b is called the momentum of the rectangle under a b because so much only of this latter increment is required for determining the ultimate ratio of the increment of m x a to the increment of a x b this ratio being the same with the ultimate ratio of m x a to a x b  b x a for the ultimate ratio of a x b  b x a to a x b  b x a  a x b is the ratio of equality consequently the ultimate ratio of m x a to a x b  b x a differs not from the ultimate ratio of m x a to a x b  b x a  a x b  these momenta equally relate to the decrements of quantities as to their increments and the ultimate ratio of increments and of decrements at the same place is the same therefore the momentum of any quantity may be determined either by considering the increment or the decrement of that quantity or even by considering both together and in determining the momentum of the rectangle under a and b sir isaac newton has taken the last of these methods because by this means the superfluous rectangle is sooner disengaged from the demonstration  here it must always be remembered that the only use which ought ever to be made of these momenta is to compare them one with another and for no other purpose than to determine the ultimate or prime proportion between the several increments or decrements from whence they are deduced neque spect magnitudo momentorum sed prima nascentium proportio newt princ phil lib ii lem    herein the method of prime and ultimate ratios essentially differs from that of indivisibles for in that method these momenta are considered absolutely as parts whereof their respective quantities are actually composed but though these momenta have no final magnitude which would be necessary to make them parts capable of compounding a whole by accumulation yet their ultimate ratios are as truly assignable as the ratios between any quantities whatever therefore none of the objections made against the doctrine of indivisibles are of the least weight against this method but while we attend carefully to the observation here laid down we shall be as secure against error and the mind will receive as full satisfaction as in any the most unexceptionable demonstration of euclide  we shall make no apology for the length of this discourse for as we can scarce suspect after what has been above written that our readers will be at any loss to remove of themselves whatever little difficulties may have arisen in this subject from the brevity of sir isaac newtons expressions so our time cannot be thought misemployed if we shall at all have contributed by a more diffusive phrase to the easier understanding these extensive and celebrated inventions  finis errata page   l pen read  p  0 l    r  p    l
