the history of jack connor  volume i  the second edition corrected  whoever thinks a faultless piece to see thinks what never was nor is nor ever shall be in every work regard the writers end since none can compass more than they intend and if the means be just the conduct true applause in spite of trivial faults is due pope london printed for w johnston at the golden ball in st pauls churchyard mdccliii  to the right honorable henry fox esquire his majestys secretary at war sir the generality of dedications are drawn like bills of exchange for full value supposed to be given in compliment and encomium but this address expects no pecuniary indulgence neither does it beg a protection which no man can give from public censure neither does it seek your favor to the author since he is already honored therewith the performance which it introduces is founded on the principles of integrity and honor and naturally inclines to him who excells in those virtues and did i know a person who enjoys a larger portion you might probably have seen another name at the head of these pages if they afford matter of amusement to you and matter of improvement to those who want it they will answer every end that the author proposes while by the concealment of his name as well from you as from the public he can without suspicion of partiality to your person or virtues have the secret pleasure of declaring himself with the justest esteem and regard  sir your most obliged and most obedient humble servant w c ashburton   july      to the reader the historian is an absolute stranger to most of the people of the present age therefore can never pretend to the honor of satyrizing any man or any body of men  he has had a bundle of papers left him by a deceased friend who was infinitely more capable of putting them in form than he can pretend to though the recluseness of his life afforded him abundant leisure these papers contained a variety of observations which he thought might be useful to mankind he has extended these observations he has in some measure commented on them he has dressed them in the garb of the times he has given them the air of romance and he gives to the reader the absolute power of determining whether he has done right or wrong  the historian has this advantage over most others and this only that the trifle he now presents to the public has a fair chance of being impartially dealt with for as he is unknown and will remain so the critical eye cannot condemn his person whatever it may his work his scribbling may be abused but he has taken care to secure his person from such treatment though he is not conscious that he has ever merited it  irony well managed has ever been a successful way to fix the attention and novel and romance may be conducted to very laudable purposes and answer the end of more learned writings the moral of the following history may correspond with an old physical aphorism which i apprehend may be found in the schola salerni wrote in the days of william the conqueror  qui medicas arts exercet noscere parts debet ad aegrotum dandi mistum been potum nam varium est herbis genus haec impletur acerbis illa

conjecture that the learned doctor mead is obliged to them at least for the title of his new book monita et praecepta medica be this at it will i shall only beg leave to give to the english reader their meaning in his own language a skilful physician will consult the constitution of his patient and not madly pour down even the most salutary medicines some herbs are filled with sour and some with bitter juices too disagreeable to be given singly physic like good counsel must be administered with caution or the stomach will revolt the patient must be decoyed into a cure and the unpalatable drug must be conveyed in the most innocent vehicle his judgment can furnish he who acts otherwise merits not the title of a physician but of a quack  the history of jack connor chap i the rise the progress of the human heart the real honor the disguise of art the wise the good the vicious  all i sing oh thou from whom our every actions spring not the poor author but the world inspire if not the style the moral to admire learn from the child he places in your sight to act with justice and to judge aright anonimous the actions of monarchs the intrigues of ministers the history of battles and slaughter and the revolutions of kingdoms are subjects that rather surprise and astonish the generality of readers than improve or amend the heart a great wicked or virtuous man plunged into the utmost distress must raise our pity and compassion a glorious and a wise prince triumphing over foreign or domestic enemies and fixing his crown in the affections of his people must warm the rational mind and give delight and pleasure but what have the bulk of mankind to do with their greatness their misfortunes or successes may make us cry out it is strange  it is wondrous strange but how can we make the application to ourselves the wide difference in our situations almost renders it impossible and if by chance something like a parallel should arise it must be stripped of all pompous terms  the rubbish of state and parade must be removed and the whole levelled to the sphere we act in  perhaps reflections of this nature gave rise to biography the story of the calamities or good fortune of private persons must sensibly affect every private reader and as the incidents are natural and what every man is subject to he with ease applies the inferences and in some measure may be said to read himself  the papers and memorandums committed to my care gave rise to the following account of john connor  i will not affirm that i have acted impartially because i will not presume doing what i am afraid no historian ever did if i assure my readers i am quite unbiasd yet i hope to be indulged like the rest of my brethren when i sometimes act otherwise i cannot avoid saying i have consulted the ease of my reader as much as possible by not swelling this work into twenty volumes as a proof of my indulgence i have shortened my prefatory discourse and this introduction above one hundred pages and shall proceed directly to the history  jeremiah connor the father of john whose story i now write had been a well made athletic man and a soldier in king williams army in the war in ireland when that matter was settled he quitted that sort of life and passing through sundry services at last settled with sir roger thornton a gentleman of great honor and fortune in the county of limerick in ireland here he lived and his warlike scars of credit made him assume some authority and furnished a large fund for conversation he found the happiness of being virtuous in the cause of liberty and commonsense though he was one of the famous enniskilliners that joined king william yet his reward like other great men was confined to the secret pleasure of having done his duty  in this family lived dolly bright who performed the function of landrymaid she was young and handsome and jerry observing she had a docile and tractable turn he encouraged her in it being himself a man of learning he took some pains to inculcate all his knowledge and taught her to read and write the fame of her erudition a little hightened her vanity especially when sir roger examined her himself and declaring her a very surprising genius gave her a kiss and two guineas to buy a gown and linen  this unfortunate present and a few more of the same nature at last alarmed lady thornton and brought on some alteration in which the lady seemed in the right all sir rogers affirmations were of no effect my lady most violently protested the impudent slut should quit the house or she would  sir roger knew the world and what is more he knew himself and his wife which determined him to make all this easy he told jerry connor that if he would marry dolly bright he would give him a cabin and five acres of ground at a small rent and complete his happiness who had been so careful of her education  lady thornton objected to this but finding sir roger grow warm and somewhat peremptory she acquiesced  though jerry connor was thirty years older than dolly they willingly consented to the match and peace was restored to the family  thus jacks parents were fixed in a farm about twenty miles from thornton castle jerry was fiftyfive and dolly twentyfour years of age to complete their joy the hero of this history stepped forth and was ushered into the world the   th day of december    0 just seven months after their nuptials a fine healthy boy and the very picture of jerry connor  whether it was from the frequent visits sir roger paid them or from some other motive my lady thornton never rested till she had persuaded him to remove his family to england this was a mighty loss and poor connor felt it more and more every day they were much in arrear and as the steward could no longer indulge them they were put to vast difficulties this shagrind mrs connor and her husband was sometimes peevish every misfortune was imputed to one or the other consequently many bitter invectives passed between them and sometimes blows mrs connor generally conquered for an old wound broke out in his knee and lamed him the good woman had always great spirits which raised itself on certain occasions to that noble ardour which the vulgar call termagant in which her neighbors and husband gave her opportunities to improve  at last another wound appeared in his head and obliged him to have recourse to the surgeon of the next town though ill able to bear the expense of at least a shilling a day however the surgeon was a skillful man and so managed his patient that in a month he brought a humor into his eyes and in six weeks he was quite blind the surgeon declared his sorrow for the accident but believed that had it not providentially happened it must have cost him his life the wound at last healed but connor thought and his wife saw they were ruined which the seizing their two remaining cows and a barrel of potatoes completely finished and next night the good woman threw jack on her back took her blind husband by the hand and marched off with about six shillings to seek better fortune  chap ii he tells us when one sense is suppressed it but retires into the rest so poverty against the will gives cunning to assuage the ill anonimous sullen and silent were their travels all that night but when day appeared they determined to repose themselves at the first inn that seemed proper to entertain such guests mutually agreeing to postpone all talk of affairs till their bodies were a little refreshed at length a cabin appeared to which they bended their steps and by the information of a linen rag over the door and a pipe stuck in the thatch they boldly entered and called for milk and bread before this could be had the woman of the house demanded three halfpence and mrs connor pulling out a piece of an old glove which contained all her treasure paid for the approaching breakfast  at this repast the good creature seemed very tender of mrs connor whose eyes were swelled with crying she asked many questions as where they came from and whither going to which she received a melancholy account of the past but not of what they intended to do being ignorant of it themselves the poor woman sympathizd with her guest who by a change of fortune grew strangely humble and was now all humility and meekness  god almighty help you said the landlady i am sure you have troubles enough  i pray the sweet jesus to comfort you and send you safe in your journey  but my dear soul added she rocking herself you must not set grief too much about your heart for my poor dear man in his grave god be with his soul left me the mother of three children and one in my belly and the devil a farthing to bless myself but three shillings and fivepence in silver and brass to be sure it was the holy virgin put it into my head to speak to the quality that traveled the road and by my own soul i got pence enough and bred my poor little creturs to get their bread as well as myself for thady is a fine boy and a poor scolard and speaks his latin and brings home many a happeny sweet jesus bless him and send me once to hear him say mass for my dear child will be nothing but a priest and father osloughnesey will send him to france on his own means gods blessing on the sweet man  then my dear little terence drives the cows out and home for mr flaherty and brings me broken meat and a bottle of good ale when he finds it after the servants for the rogue is as cunning as a fox  pray jesus i could see him a priest too  and my daughter noragh poor soul is always busy enough and minds the hens and the turf and digs the potatoes and serves the carryers very well ever since father osloughnesey got me this good house  she was going on but finding mr connor was more inclined to sleep than hear she called to her daughter noragh to settle the straw in the other room and advised the travelers to rest for a few hours assuring them that the cow and the pigs at one end of it kept it pure and warm mrs connor conducted her husband to the apartment where in spite of every calamity sleep attended and diverted every anxious thought  twas about twelve oclock at noon when they joined the landlady mrs connor was putting her hand in her pocket to pay for her bed but the kind woman held it fast and prevented her swearing she would not take a farthing and ordered noragh to give them a large bowl of milk then putting some boiled potatoes into her apron she fixed the child on her back and with a sweet jesus be with you let them depart  jerry greatly praised the tenderness of the poor woman and a conversation ensued on their present circumstances to be sure said his wife since god almighty has made you stone blind and given me this helpless infant you cannot work nor can i go into service god help me so to be sure myself cannot find out a better way than to speak to the quality on the road as the landlady did though to be sure none of my kiff or kin ever did so before but you know jerry gods will must be done  and then she cried heartily  dont cry said connor for what good will that do us  though we never begged yet it is a trade soon learned and god knows our poverty ought to make us set up very soon  i formerly mimickd an old blind man for sport and now i must do it in reality for profit  take care of the child dolly and dont leave your poor jerry and i warrant we shall eat and drink well enough  and what more can any body do  the transition from an irish cottager to a beggar is very natural and common in the country the many examples of that sort enabled the poor couple to bear and in some measure lightened their afflictions  they now seriously determined to begin this new occupation on the first proper object resolving with themselves not to touch the capital stock but at the last extremity  they had marched about seven miles without meeting any passengers but what seemed as poor as themselves at last she cried out that a gentleman in scarlet appeared with two servants well mounted this put them into some confusion but jerry boldly raising his spirits assisted his voice and in the most pathetick manner begged a little charity to a poor blind old soldier who once served most faithfully his king and country  his helpmate was not eloquent on this occasion but the abundance of her tears supplied her want of speech and perhaps inclined the gentleman to throw them a few halfpence which he did in a hasty manner and riding smartly on was followed by a million of blessings but how great was her surprise and joy when she picked up three halfpence and a shilling  she kissed the silver a thousand times and in her transport as often kissed the child and jerry who were now squatted in the ditch she talked of providence and the blessed virgin and in rapture concluded that please god they would cheer their hearts by a pot of ale at the first house  the poor man objected to this and begged of her only to spend the brass but to put the shilling in the glove with the rest  after much dispute and sundry dissertations on extravagance and stinginess she consented  but who can paint the wildness of her looks and the frantic motion of her limbs nor describe her dreadful shrieks and exclamations when she neither found glove nor pocket  they were fairly cut off  heaven and hell and purgatory and all mankind were in an instant engaged in her quarrel till fatigued and tired with the violence of her passion she threw herself on the ground and in a torrent of tears assuaged the storm in her swelling breast  connor bore this misortune with great patience and comforted his wife out of the proverbs he gave her many on this occasion and concluded that solomon who was a wise man told us that riches made themselves wings and flew away  dont tell me jerry said she of such stuff i say again and again our poor matter of money would have been safe enough in my pocket if we had not slept at that cursed inn and as for your wings i am sure they must have been in the old b  s fingers  or said jerry in her daughters  but hang it it is gone  what cannot be cured must be endured  a pound of sorrow never paid an ounce of debt  i have heard a wise man say that when the worst has happened we ought to be content because we know the worst  many a cloudy morning turns out a fine day  we are now beggars dolly and twould be a sin to be rich for sufficient to the day is the evil thereof  and st paul says  hold your foolish tongue cried dolly  this is fine prating indeed  will your solomon provide a bed for us to night or will st paul pay for our supper  not they by my soul  they will talk and make a fine story but the devil a bit will they give to fill a hungry belly  come come said he we have a shilling still left let us keep that and our wits and my life for it we shall pick up a pretty living  so saying jack took his post on his mothers back and got safe to the next village they finished the remainder of their potatoes had their pint of ale and went to rest pretty much as in the former manner  chap iii begging is not so vile a trade as some imagine  some have made vary the style or change the dress you will find it is what we all profess the difference lies twixt rich and poor some beg for little  others more hudibrastick the good people continued their daily travels and wandered through many counties and greatly improved in the art and mystery that was to furnish them with bread and indeed every day produced its supply three months past in this manner till the old man complained of the fatigue and most ardently wished for a settled habitation they were now in the great road and within a few miles of clonmel on a pretty eminence that commanded a good prospect twas agreed to fix here and lodge about a quarter of a mile from the road where was an old hut which a few boughs covered well enough for the present  the venerableness of jerrys beard which no razor was suffered to visit had a very good effect and the tattered condition of dollys clothes her hair hanging about her eyes a dirty clout on her head and face and hands almost of the same color made her look near as old as her husband and procured the charity of well disposed christians so amply that they had no reason to repent of their situation  in a short time the hut was better covered and they provided themselves with two cadows a small pot two wooden platters two trenchers one knife and two horn spoons however this abode being so distant from what they might call their shop made it very inconvenient and lost them many customers this determined them to double diligence and to save as much as would build a cabin by the road side on the common a few shillings completed this structure and their effects were soon removed  thus were they fixed in a more comfortable manner than could be imagined from the appearance of the hovel business went on in a very prosperous way and as money came in they increased their conveniences and utensils but every thing was added externally that gave an idea of misery and wretchedness  they often drank ale eat bread and sometimes meat which most cottagers in the kingdom are utter strangers to in short they lived as happily as the impetuosity of dollys temper would admit which at some seasons vented itself on jerry in old rogue and old scoundrel and such affectionate epithets which he bore with the calmness of a philosopher seldom answering but in proverbs  scarcely had they been settled three months before some of their neighbors smoked a pipe with blind connor and poor doll their great knowledge surpised them particularly when they found she could both read and write the priest of the parish who was a young man being at last made acquainted with this prodigy determined to pay her a visit one morning when she was cleaner dressed than usual she was sweetly singing on the ditch side and his reverence surpised her in the act of giving suck as she knew him she blushed and was going to cover her neck which the holy man prevented with his hand saying god speed your work my dear child  dont be ashamed at what god has given you  i am well enough used to such sights  perhaps he was but mrs connor had a skin of such an wholesome sanguineness and breasts so prominent and firm as puzzled his reverence and made his blood rise in his face and his speech to faulter  as mrs connor durst not disoblige the priest she made all the fine speeches in her power and told him almost as much as if she had been at confession his reverence spoke very compassionately on her unhappy circumstances and in a tender manner insinuated the hard fortune that so young and wellspoken a woman should be reduced to ask a favor of any man when if she had her due they ought to ask favors of her  not my dear child said he that i would be after finding fault with your industry or putting bad thoughts in your head no no god forbid but as you are a sensible woman i may tell you we ought to know good as well as bad that we may avoid the one and follow the other but when we make a slip as we are all frail mortals it must be great comfort to a good catholic to have a holy priest to pray for and absolve us  at this he put on a countenance of primitive piety or at least so much of it as his eyes would permit which still sparkled and being fixed on the beautiful part beforementioned spoke a language truly catholic  jacks mother was quite confounded at all these fine words and not perfectly understanding logical distinctions was afraid the holy father was endeavoring to make her proof against good or bad fortune not against good or bad morals father kelly soon solved her doubts for as the child still continued at the breast he praised its beauty patted its cheeks and uttered every infantine expression which mothers are so naturally fond to hear  the sweet little fellow said he it looks like an angel i must kiss it were it but for the sake of the nurse  he kept his word but guiding his head a little more on one side he feasted his lips as if by accident on those charms his eyes had been witness of for half an hour  his reverence recovered himself at last and  i ask your pardon good mrs connor said he for by my own conscience i had no harm in my thoughts but god forgive me in troth i was going to the other side for fear it would be jealous though if i had you know there would be no sin in it neither for what is a breast but flesh and so is your hand and what sin my dear in touching a hand  this reasoning was so strong that conviction sat on mrs connors countenance which the good man perceiving he very fervently transported his kisses from one side to the other  some travelers appearing and jerry being summoned to his post the charitable priest slipped sixpence into her hand and gave the old man a yard of good tobacco so wishing them good luck added his benediction and promised to call in his walks  it would be endless to point out the virtues of this good man he visited frequently and always left something behind him he mentioned to dolly the most charitable families in the country and taught jerry how to tell the weary traveller the hour of the day he repaired the first hut where she always cooked the victuals when he honored them with his company he put a door to it and sent in good store of whiskey and straw with two cadows this served his reverence for a country retreat and answered every end of a confessional his conversation was truly pious and his pains were great to convert jerry to the bosom of that church out of which there is no salvation sometimes indeed his zeal was rather too great for when mr connor made strong objections he most charitably and with a truly christian spirit hurried poor jerrys soul to the devil and all his angels in which journey his wife always added an hearty amen  about the age of five years jack remembers his daily sitting on a ditch with his father and mother industriously employed in that most ancient and most noble profession of begging the situation was well contrived and three roads terminated just at their mansion and as it were emptied themselves into the great one besides the beauty of the prospect i apprehend his parents had some regard and love to society for no traveller could pass but were attacked with all the oratory in their power without vanity i may say few people of their distinction enjoyed that talent to greater perfection especially mrs connor when she was determined to extract a penny from a good christian she mounted the ditch and with eyes raised to heaven and uplifted hands she bespoke his favor she saluted him with every tender moving expression the tear was ready and sometimes she pleaded a numerous family of orphans and sometimes an ancient helpless husband  did his hard heart pass by untouched she followed him with her raised voice invoking every saint to prosper his journey and to commiserate her wretched condition  many a time and often has she compelled the most obdurate lawyer or parson to reinback and fumble for farthings  jerry had his excellence he was really advanced in years was infirm and blind the loss of sight so dreadful to many was to them of infinite use from this he drew the pity of the goodnatured and the compassion of most travelers but his being an old soldier who had served by sea and land afforded an addition to his revenue to which a red coat contributed not a little  young as our hero was his employment had its use for whilst his dear parents were solacing themselves in their castle and enjoying the comforts of ale tobacco and the conversation of friends he was on the watch for the approach of passengers when his father or mother and sometimes both sallied out and he always attended to join in the cry and pick up the copper that humanity threw them  jack now grew a sturdy fellow of six years old as his mother had been so good to teach him to read he was a great comfort to his father and entertained him out of the whole duty of man which he took particular care of ever since mrs connor had sold his bible the child read so frequently that at last he was very expert and began to relish the subject one day he asked his father if there was any more books in the world for he would read them all god bless you poor child said jerry and give you grace to learn and practice all good things  then folding him in his arms with many tears and uplifted hands beseechd the almighty to succor his helpless age and guide his steps that he might live by honesty and labor  though jack knew not what he meant yet his words made so great an impression that he cried most heartily  in this situation the mother found them which soon changed the scene she stormed like a fury and swore he was sending the boy to the devil as well as himself but continued she with all my heart an obstinate bastard as he is but i will take care i warrant of your damned book  she then cursed herself most bitterly for teaching jack to read and muttered something of sending him far enough out of his reach  no dolly said her husband you need not do that for father kelly and you will soon send me to my long home  it is too good news to be true  said she  well well replied jerry i shall not trouble you long  you may let me have a little peace whilst i live  some passengers interrupted this conversation and the common occurrences of the day gave jerry some respite till dinner  he said grace as usual but could not eat at supper twas the same way and in the night a fever came on which opened his wounds and for want of proper care a mortification ensued and the fourth day he slept with his fathers  the pious priest was determined to have the better of the argument at last and make him a good catholic by performing the final rites of the church before the body was quite cold  on this melancholy occasion it must be confessed the poor widow behaved as the most fashionable of her sex  she shrieked and wrung her hands and called on death to ease her misery  she fainted and fell into fits and the neighbors with great difficulty brought her to herself  when recovered she bore her fate with great resignation and gave directions about the funeral with much composure of mind except when more friends dropped in which renewed her sorrows and then the whole company sympathizd in the most doleful cadences  the deceased being stripped and washed was laid out on some straw covered with a sheet that was formerly white on his breast was a large dish filled with salt which undoubtedly had its use the good people three miles round flocked to blind connors wake with loads of whiskey and tobacco pipers were in abundance and sundry gentlemen amused the company with the sweet harmony of their trumps or jewsharps  when father kelly had declared that jerry connor died a true son of the church being by him converted almost by a miracle a buzz of content ran through the whole assembly and he finished a few prayers for the repose of his soul  the common irish are cheerful at a wedding but at a wake their joy and mirth is seemingly extravagant ill nature and the want of compassion and tenderness are not placed amongst their natural vices if the moral of this ancient custom be examined and found to proceed from their pleasure in believing that their friend or companion has quitted all human infirmities and now enjoys a fullness of bliss we cannot think the practice irrational or absurd  mirth in every shape abounded but jack seemed to drop all the romping sporters he listened with great attention to a knot of old ladies who entertained each other with true stories of giants and witches and spirits and kings of ireland  from these he went to another cluster who spoke of the deceased like the egyptian priests they magnified his supposed virtues and gave him vices to which he was a stranger  scandal and malice and envy were present some hinted that dolly was not his wife some called her his niece and some his daughter but all agreed in wondering what he devil father kelly could see to make him so civil to her  i much fear many grand societies are but humble imitators of this equally polite assembly  at last the funeral set out directing their course to a ruined monastery about six miles distant the march was solemn and ever and anon a sacred dirge was raised that shook the hills and echoed through the vales the company still increased from the neighboring cabins whose inhabitants having walked two or three miles and raised their notes of condolence with the rest perhaps would at last find time to ask who is dead  the necessary rites being finished mr kelly with some of the company returned to the hut where jack soon found he wanted a father and had not a mother  chap iv what by this name then shall be understood what but the glorious lust of doing good the heart that finds it happiness to please can feel anothers pain and taste his ease the cheek that with anothers joy can glow turn pale and sicken with anothers woe free from contempt and envy he who deems justly of lifes two opposite extremes who to make all and each man truly blessed does all he can and wishes all the rest fielding on good nature i may with truth affirm that jacks parents though beggars gave better education to their son than most of their neighbors witness his reading at so tender an age when not one in a thousand know a single letter his dress was pretty much the same with young gentlemen of his years or rather with almost all in the parish he had something on that resembled breeches and a remnant of a rug very artfully hung over his shoulders and fastened round his waist by pieces of wood nicely carved of the size of a packers needle  a shirt was an idle and uncomfortable ornament and shoes and stockings made youth too tender and delicate this noble and manly dress is most carefully preserved and scarcely has novelty and fashion found an opportunity of making any variations  though the romans never visited ireland yet their dress certainly did were our virtuosi seriously to consider this they might save the vast expense they are at in purchasing a piece of leaden or marble or copper roman figure and drapery when by stepping to ireland they may see thousands even at this day in the original habit and whole groups in the ancient manner eating on the ground  perhaps i may be thought too free with so great a name as lock when i say i imagine he borrows part of his treatise on education from this people to whom i have been told he was no stranger all the world knew that the common romans wore no shoes but mr lock could not infer from thence with all his more than human understanding that going without them or having the feet constantly wet was conducive to health or vigor till he saw such numberless examples  but to return to the family  father kellys visits to the widow were more frequent than usual as she stood in need of more frequent consolation from his pious intentions the evilminded of the parish drew conclusions noway favorable to either especially as mrs connor dropped her former occupation and retired to the first hut where she suffered herself to be visited but by a few select friends and was never publicly seen but at mass  how different how changed in her appearance her face was washed  her fine black hair was combed and nicely plaited  her kercher was clean which passing under her chin was neatly tied at the back of her neck  her brown jacket with red cuffs  her red petticoat and above all her yellow stockings and new brogues drew the eyes of the whole congregation some to admire her real comeliness but more to whisper they wished she came honestly by them  whatever were their private opinions father kelly received many public marks of their disesteem the old ladies and the young extremely resented this open and particular attachment so injurious to their own beauties and superior merit they wrought on their husbands their brothers and sweethearts and the good and charitable priest was condemned a sacrifice to malice and envy  whether the people had just cause to complain to the titular archbishop of cashel or whether father kelly and mrs connor were conscious of guilt or whether they found the current of slander too strong to stem i know not neither can i tell the resolution they took on this occasion but certain it is they came to one very speedily  mrs connor had converted the old red coat into a sort of waistcoat for jack who having a pocket never failed carrying his book in it one morning she called him up earlier than usual and with more than common good humor washed his face and combed his head and having put on something like a shirt she kissed him saying he was a charming pretty boy in reality he was so  come jack says she now well walk to town and see your aunt  poor jack was vastly pleased at going to town though he knew not where and followed his mother with great cheerfulness they had not walked above a mile or two when a man overtook them whom mrs connor knew some questions being asked i am going said she to leave jack at my sisters for a day or two and must be back to squire disneys to night  that is too far said the man to walk in one day go you to the squires and i shall take care of jack  the child cried but his mother coaxd and prevailed on him to go without murmuring she kissed and promising to see him tomorrow turned about and jack and the stranger marched on  nothing remarkable happened in this journey but jack complained that the town was a great ways off  that he wished he was there  that he was hungry or dry or sleepy and some childish talk of that sort to which the man gave answers and relieved all his wants  many days passed in small journeys till the fellow found he was in the county of mead he fed the child as well as he could and having got a woman to wash his rags and clean him marched on till he came to a large fine house  now jack said he we shall soon see your aunt stay here my good child a little and i will be with you by and by but be sure dont go beyond that great gate pointing to the gate of the house the man walked off and jack never saw him after  the poor child waited a long time for him with great patience till hunger and night coming on he cried till his little heart was almost broke  at last he ventured to walk to the gate and found it open he went into a large courtyard and finding a house which was a deserted dogkennel he boldly entered and what with his fatigues and little sorrows he lay down and slept soundly till next morning  one of the grooms going by heard the cries of the boy and relieved him from his prison  he was asked many questions to which he could give no answers except that a man was going with him to his aunts and that his name was jack connor  the groom asked him if he was hungry yes said jack and very dry too and my feet are very sore  the servant was good natured and taking him into one of the stables gave him a piece of bread and some small beer he washed his little feet with warm brand and water which was ready to be given to a sick horse and laid him on some clean straw the poor child went to sleep but wakened so refreshed and so happy that on seeing the groom he smiled and uttered every expression that showed the gratitude of his heart  thus was he fed for a fortnight and all enquiry was made by the servants about him but in vain  jack grew quite well and mightily pleased with his situation for providence had directed him to the house of lord truegood a nobleman less remarkable for his large fortune than his humanity and extensive charity to all mankind  mr kindly his lordships domestic steward had heard something of this story and determined to see the child  he watched when the servants were out and stole privately into the stable  jack was mounted in one of the windows with his book in his hand but when he saw the gentleman he stuffed it into his pocket and got on his feet in an instant mr kindly with a smile of good nature cried out  who have we got here  where did you come from child  indeed sir replied jack almost in tears i dont know  dont cry my dear said the good steward i shall do you no harm  have you a mother and where is she gone to  i dont know indeed sir replied jack but she gave me to a man to see my aunt and he bid me stay at the gate and so i did and so he did not come for me  thats my good boy said kindly come now tell me all the rest  the poor child was not at a loss but told as much of his affairs as he possibly could know and in so innocent a manner that greatly pleased the good man  that is my good dear said he but what book was it you put in your pocket let me see it my man  jack delivered it telling him his father said it was a good book and would make every body good  mr kindly looked at the title and was greatly surpised  your father said he was a good man and you will be a very good boy when you can read it  oh dear said jack indeed sir i can read it very well  can you so replied the steward let me see  he opened the book where least marked and jack began and pretty distinctly read  so also for the calamities and miseries that befall a man be it want or sickness or whatever else these also come by the providence of god who raises up and puts down as seems good to him and it belongs not to us to judge what are the motives to him to do so as many do who upon any affliction that befalls another are presently concluding that sure it was some extraordinary guilt which puts this upon him though they have no particular to lay to his charge  as the boy read the tenderness of the good man mounted to his eyes  that is enough my child said he  god bless you  so quitting him in an instant got into the yard and gave vent to a few tears  good god cried he how infinitely is thy loving kindness who out of the mouths of babes and sucklings teaches us our duty  mr kindly walked to the house and having called mrs mathews an elderly servant begged her to get him a leg or a wing of a fowl with a piece of bread and some small beer lord dear sir said mrs mathews may hap your mornings walk has gotten you a stomach pray let me broil you a pigeon and give you a glass of white wine  thank you heartily good mrs mathews replied the steward you know i seldom eat in a morning but i never drink what i want is for a poor stranger  lord bless you dear sir said mrs mathews you are so good all the servants are bound to pray for you  she did not wait for a reply but ran to the pantry and soon returned properly loaded  thank you my dear friend said mr kindly now i have a great favor to beg of you which is to carry these to the farthest stable where you will find a poor little boy see him eat his dinner and take him to john longs wife  yes that i will said she  the lord preserve your good heart  i am sure youre always the poor mans friend  the lord keep you your health for youre too good for this world  we must assist one another said kindly but pray go and help the child and i will walk on to john longs  mrs mathews thought there was some mystery in this affair but resolved to hear and see but say nothing she determined to be as secret as could be expected from her sex and station so wisely took jenny the house maid to the stable to whom she communicated the matter with many notable remarks  you know jenny said she mr kindly is a man as well as another and though he is ancient or so yet let me tell you it is an old rat that will not eat cheese  he is a hearty man jenny and a good natured man and they say lives a widower for the sake of his children now putting things and things together who knows what may have happened  but please god it shall go no farther for me  nor for me neither said jenny for i would not hurt a hair of his head poor dear man  they got to the stable and found jack with the groom  so so said mrs mathews have i found you young spark  come sit down my little fellow and try how a bit will agree with you  what jenny said the groom are you come too i will say that for you you have as good a nose at finding out a pretty boy as any wench in the parish i suppose he is some relation of yours eh jenny  the fellows a fool said mrs mathews though may hap he may have as good relations as any here  come my brave man eat heartily and much good may do you  so  you say your name is jack  yes madam said the child my name is jack connor  very well said the good woman very well now come my dear and take a walk with me well not go far only to john longs  then turning to the groom said with a wink mr kindly bid me fill his little belly and carry him to johns wife  the groom was pleased and the ladies marched on  jenny said mrs mathews look at the little fellow how sturdily he walks and for all the world like good mr kindly faith and troth said jenny and so he does and his name is jack too faith said mrs mathews i forgot that and then the little rogue has the very smile of him  now i think on it jenny i will be hanged but i knew the mother of him do you remember bryan connor the miller that lived at the ford two miles off  yes that i do replied jenny and by the same token he had four daughters and three sons  very true said mrs methews and all the neighbors believed mr kindly was a great help to the family for he went very often there the old people died and the children went up and down i dont know what became of them all but molly connor was a pretty hussy enough but was no better than she should be and about seven or eight years agon she contrived to get her belly up and then went to dublin  goodness sirs said jenny how strangely things comes about so to be sure this is her child ay ay said mathews as sure as i am in this spot alive murder will out you know but that is none of our business  we are only servants and must hold our tongues so besure jenny said she dont open your lips about it for it shall not be computed to me for i hate fending and proving and woudnt be brought into a primeiniron for all i am worth in the world  the steward and mrs long were waiting at the door till jack arrived  there madam long said mr kindly there is a boy for you dont you think him very like me heaven knows replied mrs long for the poor little face of him is so dirty it is impossible to tell who he is like but please god i will know more of him by tomorrow do so said kindly and in a little time i hope to see him look as well as my own son  then turning to mrs mathews thanked her for her civilities and promised her a present of some good bohea tea  the ladies made great haste home and by mr kindlys words they were more confirmed in their first conjectures and in the necessity of being very secret  no doubt they were mighty cautious but on mr kindlys return to bountyhall he found a strange alteration in the countenances of the servants  when he spoke he was answered with a smile or a grin  a general titter and whisper ran through the family and on his enquiry into the cause of so much mirth they vanished with a loud laugh  though a little surpised at their behavior he knew there was no mischief done so was perfectly easy he always permitted them to be as cheerful as they pleased for he thought an openness and freedom of manners was an indication of an honest heart but he ever suspected a servant of a gloomy or sullen countenance  chap v there is a lust in man no charm can tame of loudly publishing his neighbors shame on eagles wings immortal scandals fly while virtuous actions are but born and die harveys juvenal a secret like many other disorders is epidemical and contagious but in the whole history of physic none is more instant or whose quality is more diffusive  every part of human matter is immediately affected and the first symptom most commonly appears on the tongue to curious persons this malady would afford an infinity of observations  where a secret takes its rise from charity goodnature friendship benevolence or other remarkable virtues be assured the disorder is not of long continuance it attacks us and we must be a little sensible of its power but it soon flies off by the operation of the lips  some have been cured by saying i never thought him that sort of man  he is a great cheat if what you say be true  that may be but to be sure he had his ends in it  i find miracles are not ceased  i have a little of the thomas in me  and so on  against this sort of pestilence the bishop need never order public prayers for when it happens it seldom goes beyond the neighborhood but never marches to the next parish  on the other hand when the plague of secrecy has its source from scandal malice envy and sometimes mere ignorance the effects are astonishing every breast is enflamed and the fire communicates itself like electricity the heart swells and the tongue with loud clamor utters millions of falsehoods  the farther the contagion spreads the disorder increases its force nor does it stop till it encounters some new frenzy or secret  though the learned dr mead has been silent on this article yet it certainly is of as subtle and poisonous a nature as any mentioned in his history  indeed it seldom carries its baneful influence to the life of the person pointed at but it violently attacks and often destroys the reputation the bread the peace and happiness of whole families the doctor may cure the enraged mastiffs bite but who can heal the wounds that slanderers tongues have made  dr monroe is a stranger to this species of madness nor did i ever hear that mr ward has attempted to palliate it if it is not in physic to relieve this dreadful malady what prayers should we not offer up to avert the evil  do thou therefore kind reader give up thy neighbor or thy friend who labors under this madness  avoid him  his breath is infectious and the saliva of his tongue will destroy thy peace  listen not to his words neither repeat them  be firm in truth and the pest may escape thee and perhaps in time the name of the malady may be lost  but to return  the mighty secret was now in the possession of every servant mounting by degrees till it arrived to mrs betty tittle lady truegoods woman who like a good christian suffered not the sun to go down till she imparted the valuable discovery to her ladyship  tittle said her ladyship i cannot imagine what ails the servants surely something must have vastly pleased them they seem so merry  tittle put her handkerchief to her face to hide her blushes  pray said my lady what is the matter  i suppose some maid has got a sweetheart or stolen a wedding or some such thing  no indeed mem said tittle i assure your laship there is nothing like a wedding in the case  i hope replied my lady there is nothing worse though you are all too apt to laugh at mischief but whatever it is i insist mrs tittle you will instantly tell me  lord mem said tittle i dont know how to speak of naughty things especially to your laship but all the servants knows as well as i for mrs mathews and jenny told me of it and they went to see the child  child cried my lady greatly alarmed what child  i once more desire and i lay my commands on you to tell me the whole story this moment  i hope said tittle your laship will not be angry with me but it is only please your laship that molly connor the millers daughter made mr kindly a present of a fine boy this morning the nurse brought it home because mr kindly would not pay for its keeping this four or five years so the poor man was forced to take the child and send it to john longs and indeed please your laship that is all only they say that the boy is seven or eight years old and as like mr kindly as two peace but they say mem  hold your impertinent tongue said my lady is this the occasion of so much giggle  you are an ungrateful pack i am sure it is false therefore i charge you all not to appear before me with such saucy airs  indeed mem said tittle if i have said any thing to offend your laship  yes madam said my lady you have very greatly offended me and so you have all but hold your scandalous tongue and leave me this minute  poor mrs tittle was not only vastly disappointed but greatly frightened as she had never heard her ladyship speak in such a manner or seem in such a passion  she informed the rest of the reception she met with and the faces of the servants seemed more composed at supper they were quite surpised at the oddity of her ladyships temper and quoted many examples diametrically opposite  i am sure said mrs tittle had i told as much to squire smarts lady we should have laughed together about it the whole live long night  ay ay said mrs mathews god bless the good lady malign when i waited on her in yorkshire many a gown and petticoat and smock have i gotten for telling her half as much but to be sure some people think themselves wiser than all the world  hold hold said tom blunt the butler now do you see if so be that as how my lady is wrong she will do you right and if my lady is right how like fools and ninnihammers will you all look so do you see take a fools advice and go and sleep upon it  tom went to bed and as he left them no more to say we may suppose they followed his example  my lord and lady were now retired when she revealed to him with an air of concern and emotion what mrs tittle had told her every now and then asking his advice and opinion  my dear betty replied my lord dont be uneasy i have heard of this affair pretty much in the same manner i have privately examined into it and have great reason to applaud mr kindlys conduct as you always judge right i am not surpised at your checking the tattling of servants which if once encouraged as ignorant people too frequently do it is impossible to say where it may end however continued his lordship as trifling as this affair is i hope to make it useful when i bring it on the carpet i must beg your asistance  my dear harry said my lady i shall not fail but come to bed and if you think proper tell me then all the rest  the curtains were drawn but as nothing of the conversation transpird i cannot draw this chapter to a greater length  chap vi hail wedded love mysterious law true source of human offspring sole propriety in paradise of all things common else by thee adultrous lust was driven from man among the bestial herds to range by thee founded in reason loyal just and pure relations dear and all the charities of father son and brother first were known milton as the reader must reside with lord and lady truegood for some time perhaps they will be pleased at being properly acquainted with them to those who know not their persons i can only introduce them to their personal conduct and family behavior this may be as useful and entertaining and rather less tedious than a description of their features their stature or other visible marks of elegance beauty or deformity  his lordship had about five thousand a year in ireland and about two thousand in england all in his own power her ladyship was the daughter of sir william templeton of lancashire she was heiress to two thousand pounds a year in that county and his lordships estate lay contiguous to it miss templeton was endowed with all those charms that men of sense admire because they know they are lasting her wit and knowledge had that sort of sprightly and solid turn that enlivened at the same time it pleased and improved her hearers her many virtues were more admired than imitated and her person though not a beauty was so genteel and elegantly neat that she raised desire in every breast and commanded more than common respect they had been well acquainted when children and from the intimacy of each family a friendship if not something stronger insensibly grew up with them his collegiate studies being over and his father dead he was sent to finish the accomplishments of a gentleman by travel in this time he constantly corresponded with miss betty templeton and the most agreeable and entertaining letters passed greatly to their satisfaction and mutual improvement mr johnston a clergyman and his lordships tutor and companion vastly encouraged these good dispositions in his pupil foreseeing the happy consequences that might arise from it  at twentyfour years of age his lordship returned from his travels a truly polite and wellbred man  he found miss templeton now about nineteen years of age with every qualification he could wish in a wife  he spoke to her at some distance on that head and found her answers sensible and just and noways against his views  his lordship then applied to mrs jordon a widow lady and aunt to miss who had bred her from a child and supplied the loss of a mother the good lady was overjoyed to put her dear niece into the hands of a nobleman of such fortune and whose great goodnature and many virtues promised a life of real happiness and content  his lordship now paid his addresses publicly every one agreeing they were born for each other  a jointure was soon fixed on but the settling his estate was a matter of some difficulty as his notions on that head were uncommon  he always thought that the undutifulness of children to their parents especially of the eldest son proceeded often from a knowledge of the fortune they were entitled to at their fathers decease  his lordship convinced the young lady of the absurdity of placing children out of the power of parents either to reward some for their goodness or chastise others for their misdeeds at last he persuaded her guardians and four thousand pounds a year was settled on the issue of the marriage in such proportion as my lord thought proper to make by will or any future deed or gift except an estate of five hundred pounds a year which should follow the title two thousand pounds a year and ten thousand pounds in money was settled on miss templeton and my lord reserved the remainder as a settlement on any future wife or to be disposed of as he thought proper  the young lady was so weak that she absolutely insisted that pin or alimony should not be mentioned in any of the writings  all these matters being regularly adjusted the day was fixed and mr johnston joined their hands and completed the happiness of this truly affectionate pair  my lord and lady stayed above two years in england but finding his presence quite necessary in ireland to settle his fortune which had somewhat suffered by the death of his father and his own long absence he hastened over and determined chiefly to reside there  he took with him his two sons henry and william with my ladys aunt mrs jordon and a numerous retinue of servants  mr johnston had been already there twelve months and settled in a good living which my lord had procured him  bountyhall the seat of lord truegood was a regular well built house though not altogether in the modern taste  the company to congratulate my lord and lady on their safe arrival was very numerous and very gay they seemed free and of cheerful dispositions inviting my lord and family to their houses in such an hearty sincere manner as quite pleased and surpised my lady and mrs jordon who were not a little prejudiced against the irish  mrs jordon could not avoid telling my lord she liked them extremely but wished they would speak with another tone of voice  my lord laughed and said i assure you one of the ladies asked me if all the english spoke in so strange a manner as mrs jordon but she added she believed you were a very good lady for all that  my lady and her aunt smiled and took this tender rebuke in the proper manner acknowledging that infant prejudices were difficult to remove but hoped time would get the better of some of them  mrs jordon took great pains to reform the pronunciation of the people she made such progress in transplanting the lancashire dialect that on her return to that county she was heartily laughed at and by her friends was constantly called an irish bogtrotter  a brogueaneer  a teague and sundry other endearing names  but i must follow my lord  his first care was to get out of the hands of the lawyers for he had three chancery suits two of them he soon finished in an amicable manner but the third was so glaring an affront on his understanding and his right that he would hear of no composition lest he might be taxed with weakness and draw on himself others  this determined him to prosecute the suit with the utmost vigor and the expedition of the law was such that the cause was ripe for an hearing just as my lord  became a grandfather  whilst his law affairs were put in a channel he at the same time settled with his different receivers two of whom he discharged as likewise his auditor taking that branch into his own management he obliged his receivers to return him monthly abstracts of their receipts and payments by which he was enabled to settle each tenants account and at one view knew their arrear and gave orders for severity or indulgence as the circumstances required  as my lords chief residence was in the country he saw with real uneasiness the wretched condition of the poor inhabitants their idleness and sloth with the swarms of ignorant priests and the treatment of some landlords kept them in a constant miserable situation and even deprived them of sufficient spirits to wish a change of condition my lord clearly saw that such dispositions could never improve the face of the country he considered that the people however poor and miserable were by nature strong and when set on by example and encouragement were not the least docile of all nations these sort of reflections as a faithful and good subject engrossed his whole thoughts he knew that the strength of the crown was in the number of faithful inhabitants and to reclaim those who were otherwise was a duty worthy the attention of every man who loved the king or his own happiness  at a meeting of the justices of the peace for the county his lordship very pathetically laid before them what popery was productive of in a protestant government or as it is elegantly expressed by the brightest genius of the age the earl of chesterfields speech to the parliament of ireland that the speculative errors of popery would only deserve pity if their pernicious influence upon civil society did not both require and authorize restraint that the laws against papists though severe in the letter and though mostly taken from the edicts of france against hugonots but greatly softened were connived at and in a great measure made useless  that the condition of the poorer sort in ireland was a scandal to a nation who piqued themselves at being polite and humane and almost compelled the few strangers who visited the country to imagine they were rather with the natives of the cape of good hope than in a civilized kingdom  that as natural justice and tenderness obliged us to indulge them with a priest in each parish yet justice and tenderness to ourselves ought to oblige us to prosecute every interloper who attempted to officiate  he added that he was so convinced of the necessity of it he was determined to begin in his own district and wished every one present would concur with him  many debates arose but the chief opposition was from tender minds who feared such a conduct would be called a persecution one of the gentlemen answered he did not doubt but popery would blacken it with every odious name  that whatever was the practice of other nations he was far from oppressing or forcing the wills or consciences of men in religious matters  that the present debate was not so much levelled at their religion as the preventing the ignorant being deceived and impoverished by those who pretended to the name of it  as in the case of gypsies and fortune tellers who rob the weak where a justice of the peace may and ought to send them to the house of correction if not to the plantations  that the maxim was perfectly true in regard to ireland that ignorance was the mother of devotion and that were it possible to give the poor natives a little learning they would be honester more industrious and in time find out how grossly they were deceived  much more was said on the occasion and all agreed to do their utmost for the relief of the poor in respect to supernumerary priests and in every other way for the general good  a few examples being made obliged those holy nusances to shift their abode and fly to a county in the west where one or two hundred extraordinary were little regarded and where fryaries are common and nunneries more open than at hammersmith near london  that the poorer sort might not want examples of industry to spur them on my lord annually settled two or three poor lancashire families on the home estate he built them decent dwellings and let them proper farms the more children they had his private encouragement was the greater  his happy imagination suggested to him a scheme productive of more good than was at first thought on  he gave out that in compassion to the poor of the parish he would take and maintain ten boys not older than twelve or younger than seven years of age and have them taught some trade or business that they might earn their bread in an honest way the poor people pressed their children on him with such eagerness that he might have had an hundred his number was fixed for boys but he permitted my lady to add ten girls to his plan for these he built a convenient house maintained and uniformly clothed and fixed a protestant family from the north to teach them two hours a day to read and the remainder in such branches of the linen manufacture as their age would admit of  my lord made regulations as he saw convenient the progress they made gave him vast pleasure and her ladyship a rational amusement as she frequently visited the children and heard them say their prayers and catechism and encouraged them in their work in a little time they were able to join in the psalms on sundays and their voices were a great addition to the service in a country church some few attempts were made to pervert the children and make them return to their parents and consequently to sloth ignorance and filth but the actors were soon obliged to quit the country and they were found to be popish schoolmasters who generally speaking are priests in disguise  from this hint so self evidently advantageous to the kingdom and from the bounty and infinite labors of a truly right reverend prelate sprung those schools of industry now known by the name of the incoporated society for promoting english protestant schools in ireland the application of the first subscription had so good an effect that his majesty supported the scheme by a royal charter and encouraged the spreading these schools over ireland by a grant of one thousand pounds a year this with the annual bounties and casual legacies from both kingdoms have enabled the trustees to extend their views and make the charity more general a charity where not a single instance of misapplication can be given a charity unparalleled and for which the next generation must bless the promoters as they must feel the happy consequences  for fuller particulars of this noble charity i must refer my kind readers to the annual accounts published in ireland and by their correspondent society in london when they examine and seriously consider it if they have hearts they must rejoice  but to return to my lord  though part of his time was given to the public his private affairs were not neglected he employed the poor which is the best sort of charity in draining and making good land of some bogs he planted trees of all sorts he mended and shortened the roads and in a word he contrived and spared no expense in executing what he judged of public utility  chap vii children like tender oziers take the bow and as they first are fashioned always grow for what we learn in youth to that alone in age we are by second nature prone dryden though his lordship had began and forwarded these great works he attended the british parliament three winters as a member of the house of commons he thought himself ill used at a new election and declined engaging too far lest it might frustrate his future views in some disgust at the treatment he had met with he returned to ireland  his son henry was now about five william four and his daughter harriot three years of age these began to demand his particular attention her ladyship was an uncommon mother for she had not only taught them what their age was capable of but had most prudently prevented their being taught sundry bad habits which might never be thoroughly erased scarcely were any of her children able to walk when she took opportunities of sending them into the next room at night without a candle and as they grew up she found reasons to oblige them to go over the whole house in the same manner neither did she ever permit a servant to stay with them or a candle to burn in the room when they were put to bed no nurse or domestic durst venture to mention a single word or idle story that could inspire fear into the minds of the children except they chose their immediate discharge which happened twice or thrice  by this method they had no notion of imaginary dangers which saved them many uneasy hours in their lives which others feel for want of such a management  their little learning was not inculcated by the common means of obligation and duty if my lord gave them halfpence and they listened to the story of a poor person and relieved him he was in great delight  when he had mentioned all the blessings attending a charitable and compassionate temper he would turn to my lady and say my dear the children have been very good and i desire you will love and encourage them and give them leave to learn as much as they please  to this my lady answered because they have so much sense as to oblige you i will take that trouble on myself  on the contrary was any one of them guilty of a fault the highest correction was being deprived of their book refused being taught their lesson and not regarded in the usual manner on these occasions the poor delinquent was obliged to make his peace and enter into grace by prayer repentance and double diligence yet still this matter was so contrived that no jealousy could arise amongst them the good were suffered to pity the faulty and intercede for them and after the necessary difficulties always succeeded often have they requested and even supplicated her ladyship to teach them and she often refused as what gave her too much pain or having other matters to mind of more consequence however she commonly suffered herself to be prevailed on at last  whatever some may imagine there is certainly an activity or impulse in the soul that gives it a desire and longing for those things that are attainable but by difficulty and labor and a disregard and sometimes a loathing even of our real happiness or pleasure when in a manner they are forced on us or too cheaply purchased whether this arises from the obstinacy or perverseness of our nature or is given to convince us that the love of freedom is strongly implanted in our breasts or whether for the wise end of employing the mind in searching after and surmounting difficulties and to raise in us the spirit of emulation and proper ambition so absolutely necessary to mankind i shall not determine as it is out of my province but i can safely say that whether this principle springs from a defect or perfection in our nature these parents changed the strong bias if the first and cultivated and greatly improved it if the latter  if a defect their manner is still more praiseworthy as they made it answer all the ends of a perfection  the same scheme varied in proportion as age opened their minds was constantly pursued in their education and the lessons and customs that were sown and had taken root in their childhood grew up insensibly into habits with their years and became constitutional  pride another attendant on our frame was to be encountered and conquered by my lord  as the little ones were what is commonly called fine children care was taken to prevent their having too good an opinion of their persons  the servants had particular instructions on that head nor could they without greatly disobliging my lord praise a child for its beautiful face skin or the like even the visitors were privately requested to avoid any applause of that sort but when some began to extol my lord or lady always drew back the flattery by assuring the person that all the merit harry had was his being a good boy did what he was bid said his prayers and thanked god that he had given him all his limbs and not made him crooked or deformed like many poor children  if my lady caught miss looking too frequently in the glass and seemingly admiring her features she ordered a beautiful china figure to be brought and desiring her to observe its complexion its eyes its teeth etc would add  perhaps this fine lady is as fond of her dear person as other folks and indeed i think with as good reason for do you know my dear harriot what this pretty thing is made of  i assure you it is of dirty earth just like you or me so you may well imagine this lump of clay has great reason to value itself when in an instant if i think proper i can brake it into a thousand pieces and make it dirt again  here said she to a servant take this thing away it seems too much pleased with itself to please me or any body else  there needed no more to persuade miss harriot to retire from the mirror ashamed of herself and of the comparison  when the business of their book which was always a voluntary duty or rather a pleasure was over they were indulged in every amusement and not kept up in warm rooms to weaken their sinews and enfeeble their constitutions the boys were permitted to ramble in the fields with a careful servant or two and use as much exercise as they pleased and their being dirty or wet on those occasions was never counted a fault  sometimes my lord and lady were vastly amused in entering into the spirit of their plays and my lord tumbled about the room and joined in their mirth and pastime by this means the children were never happier than when with them they seemed like companions and friends to each other and as they had no secrets to hide their behavior was cheerful and without restraint if sometimes they were timorous it was the consequence of love and affection and fear of disobliging  at their meals my lord and lady instructed them without their perceiving their main design for they never directly applied to any one or gave them directions or advice to do this or avoid that  their counsel was always given obliquely by praising such a gentlemans son who was so extremely good that though no more than five years old he read exceedingly well had all the psalms by heart and wanted much to learn to write then my lord would add i have entreated his father to indulge the child and have prevailed  i told you replied my lady that that boy would do well for i have always found him fond of his book  sometimes my lord much pitied a gentleman who had spent a great deal of money on his sons education the boy said he was such a fool he would learn nothing but was always with the servants so that now the poor man is obliged to bind him apprentice to a captain of a dirty ship  i am heartily sorry replied my lady for the good man and for his silly son but since the boy would not be a gentleman i think his father was in the right to oblige him to live in dirt and nastiness especially since he loved it  not a word of these sort of insinuations was lost to the children their little thoughts were set to work and they never failed making the application they were very fond of gays fables and always applied to my lord and lady for the just meaning when in doubt and received answers not only satisfactory but pleasant and entertaining on these and every other occasion they were spoken to by their parents and tutor in proper and elegant english and were set right if their answers were not in the best terms  a severe reprimand was scarcely ever used but when they were guilty of some act that had the least tendency to cruelty or ill nature  the torturing a fly or a sparrow  a pert answer to a poor person or a servant were crimes that brought a rebuke and a lesson that ended in tears and an acknowledgment of the fault but if they told an untruth or prevaricated on any examination no interest nor all the promises they could make were capable to prevent a chastisement that made the guilty and innocent tremble the maxim of my lord was never to punish in a passion and as seldom as possible but when really necessary to do it effectually and not make it a mere ceremony  with regard to their servants they were looked on almost in the light of children and had a natural right to protection and advice as servants they were obliged to a strictness in their duty but as men they were treated with that humanity and tenderness every creature is entitled to they obeyed their orders with alacrity and cheerfulness because they were never given with haughtiness or in an angry manner  for a nobleman he had many uncommon and singular notions he had prayers every morning and night and all the family assisted with great decency his lordship thought that the duties of religion were of the utmost consequence to society and the only security for the faith and confidence of man to man  he was surprised how people could with justice complain of the theft drunkenness and other immoralities of their servants when they not only took no care to persuade them of the odiousness of such practices by ordering them to attend the service of the church but too frequently gave examples of these vices themselves  though i have mentioned theft amongst the vices of gentlemen surely those who run in debt to tradesmen and suffer them to waste their time in vain enquiries after there property commit a robbery of the blackest kind and deserve equal punishment with those wretches who have openly ventured their lives to maintain their extravagancies and sometimes to satisfy their real wants  this sort of conduct was unknown in the family where on the delivery of any commodity the value was instantly paid by this means he was better served less imposed on and bought cheaper than most of his neighbors few things surpised him more than how a man can live and pretend to any degree of comfort or content when indebted to numbers and for large sums  he imagined that the many examples of the fatal consequence of such absurd management ought to persuade them into an opposite behavior but the want of thought or proper reflection plunged them into extravagance then into mortgages lawsuits and discredit  if possible they avail themselves of an infamous and scandalous practice and fly from bailiffs into parliament still the evils accumulate and often end in a gaol in the ruin of their families and the families of many of their creditors  my lord was not only punctual and exact in his dealings but every one under him was almost compelled to the like conduct for they knew his being a nobleman gave them no authority to commit nor would protect them from the punishment due to an illegal or unjust action  method makes seeming difficulties quite easy and a prudent conduct brings that peace and satisfaction of mind which we term happiness his lordships felicity was not merely confined to the prospect of his own regular family for he had the pleasure to observe that many of his neighbors adopted some of his rules and that the poorer sort began to practice a few  if my lord and his whole family were constant at church the gentry round ceased to think it ungenteel and were as constant as they  if my lord made responses of the service or sung psalms with an audible voice and was really intent on the duties of the place the rest of the congregation were brought to believe that their assembling was for other purposes than showing their finery gigling laughing bowing and the like the prevalency of example ought to oblige us to a rectitude of conduct for a bad one makes us in some measure guilty of the faults of others as a good one adds to their virtues and our own merit  as my lord and lady were blessed with great goodnature and understanding so were they happy in a sincere and mutual affection the world was not convinced of this from a foolish idle fondness when in company but by their cheerfulness good humor and complacency to each other and all present  my lord knew of what human nature is compounded and that to keep up this harmony so essential to their happiness a little management was sometimes necessary he knew that the most precious cordials become insipid if too frequently used and that nothing contributed more to preserve the true relish of conjugal felicity than a decency even to delicacy  they rose early in the morning and instantly retired to their own apartments and never appeared to each other but if not as fine at least as clean as when going to court they were so exact in this point that they had two beds in their chamber and frequently slept asunder this gave a relish and a poignancy to their most refined joys and brought with it that sort of pleasure that attends on novelty without the assistance of variety  were i to be minute on the whole economy of the family this would rather be the memoirs of lord truegood than the history of jack connor  the many methods he practiced to avoid drinking to excess himself and preventing it in others  his sundry contrivances to convince the poor of the necessity of labor and industry his successful arts to abolish profane swearing in his family and neighborhood and the many schemes made use of to persuade the natives into justice and honesty would fill a volume  what has already been said are merely sketches and the outlines of the picture the nice finishing of the features with the coloring and drapery i must leave to the management of the skilful reader whilst i pursue the account of my little friend  chap viii from thomas thumb to thomas jones you will find some diamonds and some stones read where you will and all remark much will be light but more be dark if judgment guides not your intention the poet loses his invention anonimous next morning mr kindly found the servants in the same merry mood and very cheerfully agreed with them but could by no means guess the real cause he forgot not however to send mrs mathews to john longs to enquire after little jack she returned in raptures  lord mr kindly said she i never saw so fine a child in all my born days to be sure his father was a healthy man and a good natured man for the little fellow is as strong as herclus and his complexion is as fine white and red as any kings son in the land and he laughs and smiles and is as happy as any thing god bless it  though i am a virgin as i may say yet i thinks i should not blush if he was my own son and i am sure you need not be ashamed of him for it is no harm for a man  how how said kindly so mrs mathews you would infer that the child is mine  eh lord sir said she he is so like  she would have said more but the muscles of her face took an involuntary motion and obliged her to run off in a loud laugh  i believe said he i have at last found out the reason of so much diversion in the family how apt are people to think amiss and invent scandal they are happy when they can indulge the thought that their superiors do wrong because in some sort it brings them down to their own level and when we walk in the same line no wonder if our authority is diminished  i am pleased however they think no worse of me for in this they will soon find their error  he was going on with many moral reflections and considering how to proceed when the bell summoned him to dinner  at table my ladys woman was a little merry and gave such hints about old men and young girls that my lords gentleman could not forbear joining in the satyr he declared that if venerable nestors practiced such gambols in the parish he and all the young fellows would be obliged to run away for shame  no no mr sympson cried mrs tittle you ought rather to stay when you are sure of finding an old fellow to father your handiwork  very true indeed madam said sympson but you know they say an old cock treads sure  at this witty stroke mrs tittle laughed immoderately and fixed her eyes on mr kindly but the butler looked grave and having emptied his glass said why lookee madam do you see when i am in company i love to understand what the company say so do you see because as how i dont know what you and that gentleman laugh at mayhap it is at me if so out with it a gods name for if it be true i will own it but if it be a lie as i suspect it is keep it to yourselves for i cannot scold with a gilflirt and i have something else to do than knock down a butterfly  then clapping his hand on madam the governants shouder who had not spoke a word cried  what say you madam to all this you that know the very marrow and quintessence of good manners for my part do you see i am for letting every tub stand on its own bottom  that is my way mamzell  mon dieu monsieur de butler said mademoiselle le meagre i protes i am quite confus mademoiselle tittel she talk of de men and of de girl and laff so mouch dat i assure you is ver mouch contre de bien seance monsieur kindly say noting but monsieur de sympson he laff at one monsieur nestor and monsieur oldcock but say noting non plus and monsieur butler he look serieux and make a beau discourse on de gilfleur de papillon and a tub  bon dieu i understand not one syllabe  i protest mademoiselle said mr kindly you are just on a par with the rest of the good company but people of wit and fine teeth are apt to show their excellencies  in all probability mrs tittle was going to make some very smart answer when a servant entered and told mr kindly that my lord desired the favor of his company which broke up the party for this time  mr cassock a young clergyman who was tutor to the children constantly dined with my lord where mr kindly was often sent for as his lordship particularly esteemed him for he was most careful and diligent in his duty of just principles and strong and nervous understanding mr kindly found only my lord my lady and the chaplain at table when two or three glasses and some common chat had gone round my lady asked him when he heard from his sons  very lately madam said mr kindly thank god and this good family the boys are in a way of advancing themselves for they know that their virtue and industry only can recommend them to his lordships favor and protection  they shall not want that replied my lord my last letters mention your son jack as the most diligent reader in the temple i was so pleased with the character they gave him that i have wrote to my friend and relation the lord chancellor in his favor so that who knows but councellor kindly may be imported into this kingdom with the next chancellor  the good old man could not refrain from tears of joy  you have not mentioned said my lady how my favorite billy is he was always fond of going to church and reading prayers so of course he must be a parson  yes madam said kindly he was so inclined  thank god he is in good health and minds his duty in the college but i fear he reads too much for i am informed he intends to sit for the next fellowship unknown to his friends  mr kindly said my lady you are very happy in your sons and i assure you your daughter betty has her share of merit she is a very good girl and minds her work with mrs le meagre extremely well in a year or two she will be able to manage a house so mr kindly you must open your bags and i shall try and get her a good husband  i humbly thank your ladyship said kindly but a child of sixteen bred up so much under your ladyships good instructions i hope cannot entertain thoughts of that sort  who replied my lord can tell the thoughts of girls we must leave them to time but mr kindly since your three children are in some measure provided for i should be glad to know if you have any more that i could assist you in  more my lord said kindly i protest i dont rightly comprehend your lordship  why mr kindly said the chaplain you blush and that is a sure sign of your comprehending but since your memory is so bad permit me to rub it up by asking you a single question  sir replied kindly you may ask as many as you please but as i am ignorant of any particular obligation i shall certainly only give you such answers as i think proper  guilty guilty my lord cried the parson it is plain by his evasions  come come old gentleman to the point answer fairly have you not been flesh and blood  did not temptation appear in the shape of molly connor the millers daughter  and was not the fruit of your labor a  a bastard said kindly is it not so you mean sir  just so indeed sir replied the chaplain a fine chopping boy  since said mr kindly my lord and lady are present at the heavy charge laid on me by this very young gentleman i think myself bound in duty to answer  your lordship knows me incapable of falsehood therefore i aver in the most solemn manner there is not the least foundation for so malicious and scandalous a report i am not ignorant of the cause and shall fully satisfy my lord and lady but not before this worthy gentleman to whom i hope to be permitted to ask a question or two in my turn  undoubtedly said my lady it is but fair and just  stand fast mr cassock said my lord or old kindly will be too many for you  oh my lord answered cassock i fear no one but an old woman if he will prove himself such i shall run for it immediately  very well sir said kindly very well will your reverence permit me to ask how would you have behaved to me if i vented on you the same wit and slander you were just now so good to bestow so liberally upon me  i hope sir replied cassock the dignity of my function makes a wide difference between me and people in your sphere  you mean sir said kindly that it ought to make a wide difference but as you seem to want that knowledge i shall with my lords permission tell you wherein the dignity consists  when we the poor laity who work for and pay you are proud tyrannical envious and the like your function obliges you to meekness modesty love and universal charity and good will to all mankind that we may see and admire the charms of such a conduct and be almost compelled to imitate it it is then and then only that a real dignity is added to your function but when a parson busies himself only about his tithes is immoral too lowminded or too full of grandeur to help or administer comfort to his poor parishioners  when he notoriously follows god for the loaves and the fishes  when he performs the offices of the church with his eyes wandering to every object and his hand adjusting a newacquird tippet or displaying a brilliant ring  when he forgets the fervor of his duty and seems to read with a slighting indifference  when he takes no pains to reconcile the divisions of his neighbors but foments little animosities and adds slander to slander it is then though his function remains his dignity is lowered even below the sextons  now mr cassock if you know any of your brethren who act in this manner though they preach like angels you may assure them the ignorant laity will hold them and their dignity in very great contempt  at least i promise you john kindly will  well said old gentleman cried my lord upon my word a notable discourse  discouse said my lady i really think it a most admirable lesson  why mr cassock continued she mr kindly has furnished you with texts enough for twenty sermons  ay ay said my lord but i hope mr cassocks good sense will rather incline him to apply the moral which will certainly add to my good opinion of him  mr cassock blushed but answered i am not so vain as to believe myself faultless but perhaps i may be guilty of some that i have not properly attended to to show your lordship my willingness to amend i am extremely pleased at mr kindlys plain dealing and shall endeavor to take the hint  and i am said my lord as much pleased you take his honest freedom in the true light for believe me it is less criminal to commit a fault than impatiently to bear a gentle admonition  sir said kindly to the chaplain since you are so good to forgive me i most heartily ask your pardon if i have made use of any unguarded expressions  why said my lady this matter is settled just as it ought to be  but about this boy for a boy there certainly is  madam said kindly if you will permit me i shall mention all i know of this affair  we can spare you that trouble said my lord for my lady and i know it already but let us send for the young stranger for i long to see him  i was said my lady as impatient as you and have sent for him already  she rung the bell and having inquired of the servant was told john longs wife had been in the kitchen this half hour  then said my lady pray desire her and her little charge to come in  all the servants had been admiring poor jack and mounted with him and mrs long almost into the parlour mrs long made her profound honors and my lady spoke very tenderly to her and of her family  mr kindly then presented jack connor saying my lord this is my little boy who is much improved since yesterday  mrs long had taken great care to wash him well and clean and comb his head his fine lightbrown hair hung in natural curls and his complexion was remarkably good he had clean linen and his own red waistcoat and old breeches but the good woman had not yet given him a coat nor shoes nor stockings  my lord and lady seemed charmed with his countenance though the poor child was in the utmost confusion and astonishment  my lords two sons now came in and my lady called them to her  my dear harry said she here is a poor little boy that has lost his father and mother and was stripped of all his clothes i believe he is a very good child so you know twould be a sin to let him go quite naked and starve  o dear said harry indeed i will give him my brown coat and breeches  and indeed madam said billy i will give him a shirt and a pair of stockings  and i am sure said harry my shoes will be large enough  they saw my ladys consenting looks and instantly ran to perform their promise all were pleased at the tenderness and goodnature of the children and whilst they were absent mr kindly asked jack where was his book the boy could just say here sir and gave it him  this book my lord said kindly has greatly prejudiced me in favor of this poor child i caught him reading in it and i made him turn to another part which he distinctly read and by accident it was this paragraph  mr kindly gave the book to mr cassock who read it which affected my lord but brought tears into my lady eyes  there seems to me said my lord somewhat remarkable in the story of this child i will try him a little then turning to mrs long told her to leave the boy with him when mrs long had retired he took jack between his knees and with great fondness and good humor asked him many questions and received short but very proper answers he then showed him a guinea and a shilling but the child knew not what they were at last he produced an halfpenny and jack readily told the name  well my dear said my lord what will you do with that halfpenny  i must replied jack give it to my mother for i always give it to her  and which way said my lord do you get an halfpenny  i run said the child after every body in the road and they give me an hapeny for the love of god thats my good child said my lord and turning to mr kindly added i can easily discover the profession of his parents or those he was with but his reading and his accent i own surprise me however since providence has directed him to take sanctuary in my house i am determined to take care of him  i think continued he the saving an innocent from perdition and breeding him up in virtuous principles is in fact giving him a new birth and increasing our own happiness in the same degree we give it to others  the power said my lady of doing good is certainly the highest gratification a rational mind is capable of receiving  true indeed madam said kindly your power to do good is great but heaven has added another blessing to you both in giving you hearts and minds ready and willing to exercise that power on every proper object  in the name of this poor tender creature i humbly thank your lordship and my good lady and i pray god he may live to show his gratitude to such bountiful benefactors  the two boys by this time had got the clothes and running with them into the parlour were going immediately to strip poor jack but my lord stopped them and kissing harry told him he was so good and charitable he would give him the prettiest little horse he could get and a bridle and saddle  and because said my lady my dear billy followed his brothers good example i shall do as much for him  the children were quite happy and harry ran as my lord bid him for mrs long  here mrs long said my lord take back your little fellow for this night dress him in these clothes and be so good to come with him tomorrow for we all intend to take some care of jack  his lordship then put the boy and half a guinea into her hand and she blessed their honors and retired  before mrs long quitted the house mr kindly desired her to pack up all the old rags belonging to jack and bring them to him  chap ix what can our judgment or our prudence do if chains of accidents concur not too one happy accident one lucky hit outballances our wisdom and our wit anonimous mrs long found the coat and other things fitted jack very well and had dressed him with great neatness on his arrival at my lords the whole family admired his strength and his exact make but he seemed more awkward than before and was very uneasy with his shoes mr kindly provided him with some necessaries and employed him in attending my lords sons in their amusements and in cleaning their shoes and brushing their coats at leisure times he heard him read in the bible or his own book and my lord and lady often did the same  in six months the boy was quite changed the cheerful and happy disposition indulged him by nature showed itself on a thousand occasions insomuch that he became a general favorite and was sensible of his happiness mr kindly from time to time gave him such lessons of duty and gratitude as suited his age and mr cassock taught him his prayers catechism and other matters equal with my lords children  one day as mr kindly was writing in his office jack approached him and blushing but with a modest smile looked up and seemed as if he had a favor to ask  well jack said the good man do you want another book  no indeed sir replied the child i dont want a book  why you rogue said kindly i hope you are not tired of reading yes indeed sir said jack o ho said the old man very well since you will not read and be a good boy i shall get you a leather coat and cap and you shall be a postillion and lie with the horses jacks countenance changed his eyes swelled and he burst into a violent fit of crying  mr kindly was a long time before he could dry his tears or get him to speak and explain what he wanted  sir said jack at last indeed and indeed i am not tired of reading for if you please i would be very good and write as you do if you would give me pens and paper  the tenderness of the old gentleman was touched at the childs request  yes said he my dear jack you shall have pens and paper and i will get you a little desk in the office and teach you to write myself  jack was quite delighted and the novelty of the employment diverted and pleased mr kindly particularly as his pupil was so apt a scholar that in eighteen months he wrote a very good hand and perfectly understood the four first rules of arithmetic  he was now about ten years of age and seemed to have a faculty in learning whatever he undertook in the plays of children he was dexterous and in the little occupations of the family he was handdy and neat he had a certain manner of doing things that nature alone can give and what some can only imitate even by labor and pains another natural gift began at this time to be remarkable for he had a fine voice and greatly diverted the maids with irish songs some were of humor and required a proper management of voice and words to keep up the drollery this he was a perfect master of  the boys were one morning at play in the fields and mr cassock who commonly attended them was by accident at a good distance master harry and jack had some words and harry gave him a blow on the face jack greatly resented this and told him if he was not my lords son he would beat him heartily harry fired at the rebuke and menace pulled off his coat and flew at him like a little tiger jack defended himself without returning a stroke though his hair was almost torn off his head at last he received a violent cut which stunned him and made his nose bleed he then cried out most bitterly and run directly home the tutor heard his cries and saw him running and joining the boys master billy told him the real truth as jack was entering the house my lord saw him from a window in his study and ordered a servant to bring him up with some difficulty he got the story out of him and mr cassock and the two boys entering with my lady my lord was confirmed in the truth of what he said and looking very serious and in great concern sat down and took up his book  i am said my lady quite surpised and astonished that harry could behave in so brutal a manner to a poor boy that loves him  come hither jack said she  do you think you could beat harry if you were to box and fight fairly yes indeed please your ladyship said jack for master harry knows i am stronger than him  very well replied my lady i believe what you say and now remember you have my lords leave and mine to beat him soundly whenever he strikes you again  then turning to a servant ordered jack to be taken down and cleaned  poor harry was in great tribulation but when my lady very gravely directed him to go to the kitchen and dine with the servants he cried most dreadfully  why sir said my lady you are fit for no other company for when a young gentlemen will fight with his servant does he not make him his equal but i suppose you think you may do what you please with jack but to convince you sir you are no better than him except you behave better you shall wear his clothes and he yours and then i believe every stranger will take him for master harry and you for jack connor  harry begged and entreated and gave many promises of never doing the like again  you see said my lady when one does a naughty thing nobody speaks in our favor i cannot forgive you except my lord does  then turning about will your lordship said she pardon harry this one fault he promises and is penitent  my dear said my lord what can i do in the affair if master harry was a gentleman and had beaten a servant of mine i should certainly resent the affront except he begged and obtained my servants pardon  that is true indeed said my lady so my dear billy call up jack and i am sure harry will beg his pardon very sincerely  mr cassock who knew his time began now to intercede for master harry and assured my lord he never knew him do a thing of that sort or put himself into so violent a passion before that as it was the first fault he begged my lord to forgive him and could almost promise it would be the last  my lord shakd his head and the two boys entering my lady spoke to harry who immediately went and kissed jack and very heartily asked his pardon jack blushed but with a smile bowed and kissed him again  harry then went to my lord and on his knees begged his forgiveness my lord raised him saying i forgive you my dear this fault since you are sorry for committing it but depend on your honor that you will keep your word and never vex your papa again now go and beg my ladys pardon for you have greatly offended and fretted her  my lady took him in her arms and the affair ended much to the satisfaction of all parties  two days after the three boys the chaplain and a servant with a gun went in the morning to walk as usual a small rivulet run by one of the fields which they generally crossed by the help of large stones but an abundance of rain having fallen it was raised above four feet and very rapid this stopped their progress but as they mounted the brook to find another passage harry saw a jackdaw in a tree on the opposite side and the boys begged the servant to fire at it and they mounted the ditch to see it fall jack went a little lower to get a convenient stand but scarcely had he been there a moment when the earth breaking under harrys feet he fell into the river  his brother shrieked but jack instantly took hold of a bough of a tree that fell near the water and stretching out as far as he was able caught harry by the hair just as he rose having been carried by the stream about ten yards and held him fast  billy roared and stamped and the poor parson and servant were frightened almost into stupidity till jack called out here  here  they got to him just in time for his whole weight resting on his left arm his little force was almost exhausted  cassock and the servant jumped in directly and rescued harry but not immediately attending to the care of jack the poor boy could not retire but fell in between them however they divided their labor and brought the children safely out  jack had only got a ducking but harry was some time before he could speak but being laid on the grass he soon recovered the tenderness of the boys is not to be expressed they kissed him a thousand times and even cried with joy mr cassock fearing they might catch cold walked pretty smartly toward the house near which they met my lord looking over some improvements he was greatly surpised at the condition they were all in but much more so when the chaplain told him of the accident and particularly of jacks ready thought my lord was much moved and most affectionately embracing the children carried them to my lady who waited their coming in to breakfast  as my lord told her the story love tenderness surprise and fear were visible in her countenance her heart seemed ready to leap from its habitation and the whole mother rushing violently on her spirits she seized harry in her arms and would have fallen with him had not my lord and mr cassock supported her to her chair where she did not recover till her tears were suffered to come to her assistance  the boys were put in warm beds and the chaplain was advised to change his clothes my lord and the women stayed with my lady and indeed she had great occasion for them  mr kindly had been absent on business but when he returned and heard of the affair he trembled excessively but joy succeeding he ran to my lord and lady then to the two boys whom he almost smothered with caresses then to the chaplain and then to my lord again in a word the poor man could think and speak of nothing else and even of that not very distinctly  the hurry of the family ceased by degrees and all matters were set right by dinner time and jack took his place behind the boys whom he always waited on a neighboring gentleman hearing of the accident came to felicitate my lord on master harrys providential escape  at dinner it was the particular conversation and mr cassock was compelled to repeat the morning adventure with all its circumstances which often obliged jack to blush and hold down his head  my lord bid him never to be ashamed at doing good and the gentleman was very lavish of his praises  my lady looked at master harry and hinting at the quarrel said  we may plainly see how much it is our interest to be good and friendly to and avoid giving offense to the poorest creature since every man however low or mean may if he pleases be of great use or do an irreparable injury to the greatest let what will be our situations we are born to help and assist each other according to our power and abilities and he who does it not destroys the end of his creation  this said she is a plain truth and i hope you and your brother will remember and practice it as long as you live  thus out of every accident or the most common occurences did these wise parents inculcate virtue and humanity in the minds of their children and gave them a moral certainty of their being hereafter happy in themselves and of making others happy  in the evening the gentleman took his leave and calling jack kissed him and put a crown in his hand which he immediately deposited with mr kindly my lord gave the servant which had been with the children a farm worth ten pounds a year many poor neighboring families felt on this occasion his goodness and liberality and he added ten children more to the charity scheme beforementioned the chaplain was not forgot in my lords thoughts and my lady ordered jack new clothes from head to foot  as the family was extremely beloved no wonder if all the gentlemen round continued for some time to visit and congratulate them on their good fortune scarcely one quitted bountyhall without a mark of regard for jack these he always consigned to mr kindly so that his riches at last amounted to the mighty sum of ten pounds  chap x the reason why so few marriages are happy is because young ladies spend their time in making nets and not in making cages  swifts maxims perhaps my merry readers are extremely angry at being so long detained in company with boys whilst others of a more serious turn are pleased with the opening of the heart and the gradual increase of knowledge in the minds of children others again reading only as a mere amusement and to kill time are in an actual state of indifference and provided the great end is answered are equally charmed with clarissa as tom jones that these classes may be gratified i shall beg leave to introduce a young lady by way of episode and because she is the daughter of my good friend mr kindly  miss betty kindly now turned of twenty was a most agreeable girl with good sense and good humor mr cassock had a small paternal fortune a good allowance from my lord and forty pounds a year for officiating for the minister of the parish who was about fourscore years of age this young gentleman was not insensible of the charms of miss betty and of her more essential qualifications and knowing my lords sons would soon be removed from his care determined to take the advantage of the general joy and solicit my ladys interest he suffered not the time to elapse but took the first opportunity when my lady was alone  she rallied him a little at first on his being in love but assuring him of all her good offices added  i believe a little of my interest will go a great way for i much doubt if you have not a powerful friend already in the garrison  mr cassock blushed and aukwardly thanking her ladyship retired  it seems mademoiselle le meagre had informed her of what passed in miss bettys heart which she was convinced of by some observations on her late conduct  my lord was extremely pleased at this discovery and declared it was what he had always wished after dinner he sent for mr kindly and the chat at last fell on jack connor  i wish my lord said mr kindly you would permit my instructing that poor boy in the duty of my station he is surprisingly diligent notable and honest and so expert at his pen that young as he is he has often assisted me  i think i have been a faithful servant to your lordship and your truly noble father who bred me from a child and it would give me the greatest joy to have almost a certainty of leaving as just a one to succeed me  age my lord steals on and should heaven indulge me with a few more years of strength and abilities i must then submit to our common destiny  my lord winked at her ladyship and she at mr cassock who instantly withdrew and my lady soon followed  jack said my lord has saved my son if i had no other motive than that you may be assured he is greatly in my thoughts but i love the boy for many reasons having noticd particularly his behavior but as i am determined to send him with my sons to mr johnstons where he may learn a little more we must postpone your scheme till his return  since you think continued my lord so much of my jack give me leave to think a little of your betty  the girl is of age and you know young wenches are flesh and blood  in two words poor cassock loves her and if my intelligence be right betty is far from disliking him therefore if you approve of the match the parson must have some money to buy a new gown and a fresh cargoe of sermons  does your lordship approve of it said kindly i do said my lord  then replied the old man i have no will but your lordships and tomorrow sir i shall put into your hands the value of three hundred pounds and submit my dear child to your lordships judgment thinking myself the happiest of men by the favor and indulgence of the best of masters  i thank you said my lord for your compliment and to show you how much i approve of this union and that your daughter may be under your own eye i intend to present mr cassock to this parish on the death of the present incumbent you know it is worth two hundred pounds a year and that dr canter is superannuated and cannot last long  kindly with uplifted hands was attempting to utter his gratitude but my lord stopped him saying  no more of that mr kindly i am now going to advance this matter and retiring left the happy old man but the power of thanking providence and admiring the goodness of my lord  in a few days mr cassock was presented in form to miss kindly all the conversation of the family was on the approaching wedding which was fixed at no longer a distance than a week and some neighboring families were invited  were i a french memoir writer i should naturally embrace this opportunity to extol the virgin charms of the bride and describe the beauty and propriety of every part of her dress without a slavish regard to truth i should then have said  scarcely were the curtains drawn which permitted the suns appearance when miss opened those eyes that alone could eclipse his brightness she sighed and sometimes wished and sometimes trembled at the approach of the time when she was to be  she knew not what  she knew not where hope and fear engrossed her whole imagination till the hour arrived when she bid an eternal adieu to that bed destined never more to embrace her virgin innocence mademoiselle le meagre and mrs tittle assisted in adjusting her dress and her ladyship deigned to give her advice and help her tresses were of the finest brown which hanging behind in small natural ringlets were nicely ordered to crown her forehead and touch her ears which were ornamented with brilliants and though of the first water her charms added a particular luster and refulgency to diamonds likewise sparkled round her lovely neck and a little above the heavenly orbs hung the glittering cross which jews might kiss and infidels adore her stays discovered a shape the most exact and delicate and the robe that closed on it was of the finest white silk of padua a bunch of jasmin hyacinths and roses took their place near her neck and seemed to envy the vicinity of a superior fragrancy she descended to the apartment where the company and her desiring lover impatiently attended and where a most magnificent and elegant dinner was provided the first course consisted of  i hope the courteous reader will excuse my not proceeding farther in mere sound and permit me to say in plain english that the wedding day at last came and that miss betty behaved as girls naturally do on the occasion my lady had made her a present of genteel plain clothes and her good complexion shape and size made her a very desirable object mr cassock looked and seemed to think her a subject worth handling  when the ceremony and the usual compliments were over my lord declared his intention of giving the parish to mr cassock on the death of doctor canter  this was a comment on the text that mr cassock had not known before and as it perfectly agreed with his way of thinking he looked on the author as a very learned and wise man  the truth is he was so struck with my lords bounty that neither he nor his bride could return their thank but by their humble obeisances  my lord had still in reserve what was to complete the reward of mr kindlys fidelity  he first bestowed many compliments on him before all the company and then added  when my boys are settled at mr johnstons school my lady and i purpose staying for some time in england you will then mr kindly be so good to audit the accounts of my receivers and take the charge and management of my charity children you and the young couple must keep this house warm in my absence and that the roof may be always in good order and to defray the expenses attending your increase of business i desire you will charge me with one hundred pounds a year extraordinary and now mr kindly give me leave to regard you as my companion and my friend  a profound silence ensued till the old man finding his tongue he poured out whatever his grateful heart suggested and ending in most fervent prayers retired in haste to give his tears of joy full scope  at dinner he was pretty cheerful and mirth good humor and happiness admired bountyhall and resided there  as i am called another way it cannot be expected i should wait on this company the whole evening much less pretend to conduct mr cassock and his bride to that theater where we are suffered to see the actors but by the reflection of fancy  let it suffice to say that the young lady was next morning mrs cassock  so much has been said of this noble family that i fear some will be apt to suspect my veracity  envy will positively assert that the characters are absurd unnatural and without a precedent  illnaure will discover the sarcasm in placing in full view what the nobility ought truly to be in opposition to what some really are  the thought of such scandalous insinuations determines me to quit bountyhall and shift the scene  it is necessary to inform my readers that mr johnston who i am now going to visit is the clergyman that was a companion to my lord in his travels  during their stay at paris mr johnston became acquainted with madam bonfoy the widow of a captain who had been killed in the service she had solicited for a pension but being known to be a hugonot could never obtain it as she had two thousand livres a year on the townhouse of paris and the interest of some money she kept genteel apartments and lived in a very decent manner with her niece who was about four years old  the temper of madam bonfoy was so like mr johnstons an inclination for each other ensued which ended or rather increased in matrimony  my lord got him a good living in the north of ireland but afterward advised him to exchange for one of less value near portarlington in the kings county inhabited mostly by french protestants and where little of any other language was spoken my lord gave him the plan of a school which by mr and mrs johnstons good management could not fail of being extremely advantageous to them mr johnston had now been in that situation near four years and met with great approbation as he had talents peculiar to that profession  master harry was now twelve years of age and all things were preparing for the journey of the three boys every one in the family began to dread the loss of such children who by a thousand little pranks were extremely dear to them miss harriot began to pine and cry that she was to lose her brothers and her favorite little jack in short it is impossible to express the silent grief that reigned in the house  mr kindly took up whole days in preaching to jack and giving him good advice  perhaps my dear child said he i may never see you again if so mind my words and i shall be always present with you and shield you from those evils the world is full of if you despise and neglect them depend upon it calamity and misfortunes will attend you that my counsel may not be forgotten i have wrote it down and put it in your trunk that you may read and get it by heart they are the same instructions i gave to my own sons when they went from me and in general will answer your purposes i have likewise continued he put up a good store of paper and pens and i insist on your writing frequently to me with a particular account how the young gentlemen behave and how you employ your time  jack cried most heartily and faithfully promised to obey all his commands and be a good boy  the children took leave of the neighbors but jack in a very tender and particular manner took his of mrs long and the goodnatured groom  the coach and servants were prepared and the young travelers were to set out next morning with my lord and mr cassock her ladyship being with child prevented her being of the party  the morning came and the horses were ordered to be put too  mr kindly took jack in his hand to the office and showing him his little effects in a small trunk he had provided put therein a purse saying  jack here is all your money with some interest amounting to fifteen guineas i know you will take great care and keep it till you really want it you are no fool my dear and he must be the greatest fool that spends his money idly  jack gave him his word he should find it all when he came back  yesterday said mr kindly i told you i might never see you more i have this small box to give you as my last legacy it contains a book that in time you may read but as i know you love truth i must have your promise never to open it but at the time i direct  jack fell on his knees and assured him he would never open it if he ordered  then said the old man mind what i say i lay my commands on you never to open this box except you be reduced to the greatest necessity and almost want bread  so saying he locked it in the trunk and gave jack the key  now said mr kindly i have but one word more to say  if god should prosper you in the world and your heart should swell with pride and arrogance remember that drawer and correct those vices  pray sir said jack what is in that drawer  you shall see said kindly and producing his old red waistcoat tattered shirt and breeches said  this jack is your original so judge if pride and haughtiness will agree with such a dress  the boy blushed and embracing mr kindlys waist assured him he would always remember the drawer and the dogkennel  they now joined the children whom they found in tears having just quitted her ladyship jack was sent in by my lord and on his knees most humbly thanked her ladyship for all her goodness to him  the parting with her sons made her scarcely able to speak but she bid him mind his business and serve god  she could utter no more but with a tender embrace let him depart  the servants had their turn and the boys were almost hugged to death  with great difficulty they quitted this moving scene and the coach driving off were followed by the prayers and blessings of a thousand of the poor inhabitants  chap xi seek you to train your favorite boy each caution every care employ and ever you venture to confide let his preceptors heart be tried weigh well his manners life and scope on these depends thy future hope gay the occurrences on the road are not worth mentioning but my lord and mr cassock gave the lads a good impression of their new master and explained the rules and customs of the school mr johnston was prepared for their reception and thanked my lord for the honor he did him after supper my lord and mr cassock went to private lodgings the two brothers had a chamber to themselves and jack had a small one near the backstairs at the end of the gallery  before eight next morning my lord and mr cassock went to mr johnstons all the scholars had not yet made their appearance but the bell ringing the rest soon were in the school where mr johnston and the family attended my lord when all were seated one of the lads mounted a desk and with great reverence began the morning service of the church another read the lessons of the day mr lilly the usher raised the psalm and the first boy finished the prayers except the blessing which mr johnston always pronounced  this over an hour was employed in examining their exercises and giving others for the following day and then they retired to breakfast  my lord was again conducted to school when one of the most ingenious of the gentlemen ascended the pulpit and made a latin oration on the rise of nobility he very artfully insinuated how happy some families were in always leaving heirs to their virtues as well as their titles and that he could point out even in these degenerate days a living example of that blessing were he at liberty to speak without being suspected of flattery and concluded that though many patricians were a scandal to their own and every other order yet some were always found who added a luster to the dignity as their lives were an ornament to human nature and their actions the glory of their fellowcitizens  when this gentleman had finished another mounted and made a short speech in english on the happiness of a good education which he compared to a tender plant under the management of a skilful gardener who not only made it bear exquisite fruit but gave the branches such an elegant turn as added a beauty to the place and a delight to the eye  his lordship was extremely pleased with this entertainment but particularly with the distinct emphatical and graceful manner in which they pronounced their words he was not wanting in returning his thanks to the young gentlemen and giving the usher ten guineas begged he would be so good to buy a dozen bows and arrows and erect two butts in the next field which would not only agreeably entertain them but be a most healthful exercise  his lordship then gave some private directions to mr johnston and recommending the boys to the care of his wife took a most tender leave and returned to bountyhall  i must continue at portarlingtonschool above three years if my reader pleases i shall indulge his residing with me and making all the remarks and applications his understanding may suggest imagination must furnish him with the many pranks and tricks schoolboys are wont to play as i am not at leisure at present to entertain him in that manner i shall confine myself to the narrow compass of hinting at the conduct of this school as there is somewhat peculiar in it and what i could wish every other had a part of if not the whole  mr johnston was a gentleman of very extensive knowledge great application and temper cheerful and easy in conversation and above all knew mankind and the world perfectly well as he had talents peculiar for instruction and delighted in it so his virtue and understanding convinced him that rearing up good and useful members of society was the most honorable employment of man  his house could hold but twentyfive youths and each paid thirty pounds a year when his conduct was known it is not to be imagined what interest was made by gentlemen to have their sons admitted on a vacancy  his first care was the inculcating into his pupils the principles of true religion as the surest foundation on which to build the moral virtues his next was the inspiring into them a certain proportion of ambition and temporal happiness and demonstrating that learning honor and integrity were the most probable if not the only way to attain them for these purposes they constantly attended divine service at church and at home he made them read the prayers alternately and as occasions required gave historical accounts to explain or illustrate some passages in the old or new testament  he always treated them not as children but as gentlemen which made them endeavor to act as such if some were negligent of their duty he seemed concerned at it and pitied the unhappy youth that forgot himself so much as to undo by a voluntary neglect all that his ancestors had acquired by knowledge and industry  he took great pains to give them an early habit of civility and good manners and by his own practice convinced them how agreeable such a conduct was to every man he always spoke with a bow and marks of respect and encouraged them to act in the like manner to each other he showed them by sundry serious and comic examples the use and beauty of politeness and the absurdity and bad consequences of a clownish and brutish behavior  the mornings were given to school learning in which by his skilfulness and assiduity they made great progress as to fixed holidays they were strangers but when all the lads were perfect in their different lessons mr johnston always returned them thanks and then added  this is very clever  i find gentlemen you have taken more than ordinary pains but i am so far from desiring too much study that please god if to morrow be a fine day we will take the diversion of hunting or fishing  just gentlemen as you please  thus they could always command a day of amusement but that lad passed his time very disagreeably who by his idleness had stopped the pleasure of the rest  the evenings in some degree were their own either to study in their chambers or divert themselves in the large yard or field if the weather did not permit the latter mr johnston used to say  well gentlemen how shall we pass our time i have a great notion mr moore can pronounce one of ciceros orations as well as mr stevenson  sometimes he pitched on one of atterburys or tillotsons sermons sometimes on speeches in tacitus or livy sometimes on parliamentary debates and sometimes on milton or on occasional pieces of poetry of beauty and elegance  the reader always mounted the pulpit but if he erred from the right pronounciation and true meaning of the author or lessened the sense by false action or too languid a delivery mr johnston begged his pardon and desired to be permitted to show wherein he thought it might be uttered more to the satisfaction of the audience  he then took his place and displayed the orator  his determined and resolute voice stirred their young blood but when he softened into pity at some distress it caught the lads and their countenances showed it  he thought it absolutely necessary that a young man should be acquainted with the history of his own country at least as soon as that of egypt greece or rome this was a fixed entertainment twice a week and his comments observations and reflections on the different parts were adapted to those he made them to and had always somewhat that showed the value of liberty and the danger in not putting proper bounds to it  the effects of tyranny and oppression  the nature of laws and government  the obligation of a king to his subjects and his subjects to him  the happiness of a good monarch with the infamy and punishment due to those who wantonly attempt to disturb the peace of the crown and the peace of the people  of a cheerful evening mr johnston has proposed the repetition of a good comedy but as he did not conceive that acting a play was of use to youth he placed them in their seats and assigned them their different parts which they read from different copies the comedies he generally chose were steeles farquhars and some of cibbers as they not only had wit and humor but a certain moral in them not to be found in congreve wycherly dryden or vanbrugh but by wading through obscenity  if the gentlemen chose a tragedy he made them carefully observe the difference between a passionate utterance and ranting and between the soft and tender manner of expression and the whining and gave them examples himself  but the most favorite manner he had of entertaining them because he had a scheme in it was giving short and pleasing accounts of the lives of great men of all nations  the conqueror and captive  the tyrant and the father of his people  the law giver and the incendiary  the patriot and the pretenders to patriotism  the orator and the declaimer  the divine  the lawyer  the moral and experimental philosopher  the botanist  physician and the merchant  the many professions that spring from these fountains were at different times set in proper and clear lights  their virtues and uses to society or the abuses of power and knowledge were touched so as not to descend too deeply into the sciences but to fix the attention of the lads and give him an opportunity of discovering the bent of their inclinations and geniuses  such a conduct he thought as necessary a part of the duty of a master as teaching them latin or greek and he never failed communicating his discoveries to their parents  happy had it been for many gentlemen if their genius had been properly attended to in their youth  the many absurdities in the world would be avoided and each have the rank the law of nature had assigned them  the martial spirit would not be compelled to expose himself in a pulpit  the tender and meek mind would not be drove to the field of bustle and slaughter  the physician would not prescribe at the bar nor the lawyer administer physic by act of parliament  each would be in their just point of view and each have a fair opportunity of excelling  as nature gives not equal talents to all this good master made proper allowances he was never displeased at one gentlemans being less apt to learn than another provided he found him equally diligent on the contrary he encouraged and indulged him and frequently stole into his room at night and gave him half an hours private instruction for the business of next day but insisted on its being kept secret from the rest  seldom was their book an occasion of chastisement but they never were excused for any vicious act when he found a lad of an obstinate sullen temper who despised learning good advice or correction he sent him home to his friends  on such occasions he always made a pathetic speech to the school and placed the unhappy boy separate from the rest  when he was to depart mr johnston walked with him to the gate and all the gentlemen followed with profound silence here he embraced him and took his leave praying god that this gentle admonition might make him reflect in time and change his conduct so as to be an honor and not a discredit to society  then in a ceremonious manner all the rest took a melancholy farewell  amongst the many advantages of this seminary mrs johnston and her niece nannett contributed in improving the boys in french and as all the inhabitants commonly spoke it they acquired that language with great facility  some evenings when mr johnston could not attend his wife has extremely diverted and amused them by moliers comedies gilblas scaron and other books of that tendency  thus did this good family look on themselves as parents to the children and the children regarded them as such  instruction and profitable entertainment were so agreeably and nicely blended that the one was never suffered to become tedious and irksome nor the other to cloy or fill the mind too much  chap xii persuasive folly has strong charms tallure the feeble to her arms weakness and vice go hand in hand and seem united by one band let reason but assume her seat folly and vice will soon retreat anonimous as jack connor was not intended for a perfect scholar mr johnstons care on that account was not so exact as to other lads but what regarded the moral and social duties he received in common with them in the three years at this school he had acquired a good share of latin and some greek but his chief pleasure was in reading and making extracts of useful and entertaining passages from history voyages poetry and the like of which mr johnston had a good collection always open to the gentlemen this improved him in writing made strong impressions on his mind and gave him a falicity and a genteel and easy turn of language that much better scholars are strangers to he spoke french with great fluency for mademoiselle nannett took some pains to perfect him in it and as he had a charming voice she taught him many agreeable french songs  he was now in the spring of life tall and well made health beauty and sprightliness were always present with him and mirth and joy danced in his eyes these and his little accomplishments made him caressed by all and were so remarkable that even madam johnston has been frequently heard to say ma foy cest un beau garcon  voila de quoi fair un joli homme  if nannett was silent she looked and perhaps thought the more  the dial spoke not but it made shrewd signs  the juice of the grape is insipid nor can yield a spirit till fermented in this state the vessel must be pierced and a vent given to the jarring particles or it will burst its tenement  the hand of experience knows when to stop this chasm  to fine it down and give it the proper time to acquire a mellowness and flavor that gladdens the heart of man and adds cheerfulness and good humor to every rational company  if ignorance interferes in the management the wine will become sour and of little or no value  is there not somewhat of a fermenting quality in human nature or rather is it not certain that there is  without this fermentation which the passions only can give man would be but a moving statue it is the passions that open his understanding  they lay the plan of all his operations  they conduct him first to objects of pleasure and then branch out his imagination to glory  honor  riches they polish him and raise a desire of loving and of being loved  in a word they alone when justly guided can make him a rational creature  if unheeded and suffered to take an unnatural bent neither fame nor honor can result from them and the man becomes the pest of society instead of the pleasure  our little hero was not formed without these passions if from inexperience they sometimes hurried him into imprudent acts and brought him into dangerous situations he was the first to censure his own conduct and recur instantly to the principles imbibed in his youth  of what use these passions and these principles were to him is too much a part of this history to be omitted in their proper place  since therefore it is impossible for me to act the impartial historian and omit the consequences of these passions i hope the candid reader will excuse the seeming levity of this chapter  my hero is not a perfect hero  he is young and without experience he has the seeds of man in him and consequently is faulty besides as his whole life turns on this incident i am compelled to insert it but hope the moral will excuse the tale  the time was now come when jack was to be tempted and unwarily to yield when he became criminal he became unhappy  of late he took a particular pleasure in nannetts company and she in return treated him with great freedom and with somewhat more than mere complaisance his years prevented his seeing the secret motives of her kindness he was happy because she was fond of him but her fondness arose from a different principle  she loved  how far this passion will extend itself few are unacquainted and poor nannett practiced every female wile to gain a heart invincible to her charms only from ignorance often has she told him he ought at his age to avoid blushing when he spoke to her and be more a man than to tremble at touching her hand  these and many other forcible expressions she has reiterated and sometimes even kissed him but they only served to give him a secret uneasy pleasure and a constant desire of her presence without a knowledge of the meaning  she remarked his confused behavior and found she must either renounce all shame by speaking in direct terms or absolutely avoid him  the delicacy of her sex as much forbid the one as her violent love did the other  her invention was on the rack but at ast she remembered a certain french book where a lady is placed exactly in her situation to this dear volume she turned and determined to try the experiment she found opportunities to oblige jack to read most part of it to her but deferred the lecture of the interesting scene till the first day mr johnston and the lads went a hunting that time soon came and the evening before she whispered him to avoid being of the party and they would finish that charming story he with eagerness consenting she told him how inconvenient it would be to read in his little room but said she as soon as they are all gone if you will promise to be very secret and make no noise you may come to my chamber and we can read at our ease  he promised and this conversation ended  it was now june and being fine weather all were ready for the sport of the field at four in the morning jack excused himself to master harry on account of a book he was to finish and a letter to write to mr kindly and slily slipping up into his room remained there till he saw them all at some distance with cautious steps he quietly mounted the backstairs and found nannetts chamber door on a jarr ready to admit him his treading was not so light but her attentive ear heard him and putting the curtain back in a low voice she cried  lord bless me jack who would have expected you so early  i thought to have been up and dressed and now you surprise abody in bed indeed i am quite ashamed of myself  but  shut the door and sit down softly  she then opened the curtain a little more and jack sat at some distance a silence ensued for some minutes till at last he ventured to say something of the book  well said nannett look for it under my pillow and i will read  jack searched for some time but in vain and she calling him an awkward fellow rose carelessly and soon found it  undoubtedly she had no intention of exposing to his view her lovely neck for no sooner had she caught his eyes fixed on that part and saw the tumult it occasioned in him than with great precipitation she covered it  her head was once more laid on her pillow and the book in her hand  if said she you keep so far off you cannot hear me and you had better come and sit on the bedside  the poor boy willing to oblige carefully moved but found her right arm negligently thrown out this impediment he gently removed but not before he had frequently kissed it she called him a fool but her good nature did not forbid this sort of folly  jacks spirits were up in arms so we must presume he was going to sit down improperly otherwise she certainly would not have said  bless me  why sure you ant so mad as to lie on the bed  but  if you are afraid your shoes will make a noise and will absolutely do it cannot you pull them off  his shoes vanished in an instant and he placed himself where before he had no intention   come come said nannett let me make an end of my story but if you attempt to serve me as amyntor does his phillis positively i shall not endure you  but  here is one kiss more to keep you quiet  she then fixed on the page and began  thus situated were this happy pair silence and secrecy reigned and no eyes to witness their joys but those of laughing cupids who hovered round the enchanting bower amyntor was all desire and love but his invincible modesty obliged the equally enamored phillis to supply by management what her tongue could not utter she insensibly conducted him to the beginning of charms to which the youth was an absolute stranger  nannett continued to read and with great judgment laid the proper emphasis on every word but at every tender or delicate period as many such there were jack became an exact imitator and frequently interrupted the narration she often wondered at his assurance and declared her anger but her countenance did not seem to imply that passion and at last she was permitted to continue  too pressing amyntor too yielding phillis  the time the place and every opportunity conspired with their mutual inclinations  a thousand dalliances intervened till prudence  virtue  and phillis were lost  nannett would have proceeded but jack still faithful to his copy prevented it by acting amyntor  i hope the reader will not insist on too nice a description of this scene for i am permitted but to add that at last as reading was become useless she closed the book and  i must close this chapter  chap xiii ah thoughtless mortals ever blind to fate too soon dejected and too soon elate sudden these honors shall be snatched away and cursed for ever this victorious day drydens virgil the clock struck seven which roused them from their dream of happiness to think on their safety nannett was unwilling to part but jack now more prudent took an hasty kiss or two and got to his room unperceived he now began to reflect on his conduct and he judged himself greatly criminal he now remembered mr kindlys precepts which had for some time been neglected and called to mind his last words of calamity and misfortunes if he departed from virtue these thoughts gave him extreme uneasiness but he found himself greatly relieved by resolving to be guilty no more and to shun the object an unusual gravity attended him the whole day which greatly disturbed nannett as he gave her no opportunity of inquiring into the reason  he was extremely pleased with this conquest over himself but alas he little knew his own heart and as he was a stranger to the ways of men how could he possibly know that of women  nannett impatient to learn what passed in his soul waited in her chamber till two in the morning not doubting but jack would find his way there the disappointment extremely mortified her pride however she determined at all events to have her doubts satisfied and resolutely ventured down and got to his bedside she prevented a noise on his awaking by telling her name and as she was undressed without more ceremony slipped in and took him in her arms  where now were all his mighty resolutions  where were all mr kindlys moral lessons  vanished  lost in the obscurity of the night and in the arms of youth and beauty  she made him many tender reproaches but her love forgave all  his reflections that day were quite of another complexion to the former and he even thought himself a fool for being more timorous than a girl besides he argued the impossibility of danger or being discovered and that if it was a crime he at most was answerable but for half but the strongest reason for continuing this affair was that he believed every man would do the same had he the same opportunity  thus his understanding was quite defeated by what he thought good reason  how many are there who by such fallacious arguments persuade or endeavor to persuade themselves into evil even contrary to their real opinion and how many are there who are but too successful in their attempts to deceive themselves  his amor went charmingly on for about six weeks nor could there be in his imagination an happier mortal  he insensibly dropped all boyish amusements and was much less punctual and exact at school than formerly his visage began to change and the roses in his cheeks to fade insomuch that madam johnston really thought him out of order and very innocently directed nannett to take some care of the poor boy and give him something warm when he was in bed nannett most punctually obeyed her commands but jack grew paler notwithstanding  mr johnston at last observed an alteration in jack and for some time was of his wifes opinion but as nothing could escape his penetration he perceived that the boys eyes sparkld and his face had an uncommon glow whenever nannett entered the room he likewise remarked a peculiar pleasure in their countenances when they spoke to each other and even when their eyes chanced to meet which they frequently did  it is a question would puzzle monsieur de moivre whether most intrigues were began or were discovered by the eyes certain it is they are as apt to betray as seduce if these faithless companions have a language to persuade us into secret deeds they have another to divulge it  what pity it is they are placed in so conspicuous a spot  mr johnston in his youth was a master of this language and read in their hearts what gave him extreme pain he was tortured with suspecting the worst and reasoned himself into the conduct he was to observe should his suspicions be well grounded  he knew should his resentment vent itself in words the reputation of his niece was lost and the character of his school would suffer a severe wound  to chastise the boy would answer but the same end  to join them in marriage was ridiculous and to suffer them to live peaceably in iniquity was impossible  for two days was he thus agitated before he could fix on a scheme to save all appearances but particularly those that could affect his own family  when he had revolved his plan and taken a resolution his next step was to satisfy his eager doubts  the third morning about three oclock he quietly stepped into jacks room he examined the bed which he founded unruffled and cold and immediately concluded jack was in a warmer place he paused for a few minutes to stifle his indignation and let the hurry of his spirits subside and then quietly mounted to his nieces apartment he gently opened the curtain and found the happy criminal pair locked in each others arms bidding defiance to all worldly cares for they were fast asleep  for some time he gazed with astonishment and scarcely credited the evidence of his eyes  at last he stirred nannett who wakened with a tender expression to jack but when she perceived her uncle she was just going to scream out when he put his his hand on her mouth and conjured her to make no noise but lie still  jack now opened his eyes but the moment he beheld the old gentleman he hid himself under the clothes  poor nannett put on a most supplicating countenance which her ready tears greatly assisted mr johnston with as much coolness as he could collect first desired her to pin her tucker and now said he child though you have been very foolish yet i promise you if you will keep your own counsel i shall do the same and it shall for ever be a secret even from your aunt  so much goodness gave her new life and she promised never more to transgress and be all obedience  dry your eyes my dear said he you see i am not angry with you or jack so bid him get up and meet me in the garden immediately where we will consult how to manage this silly affair  when he was gone jack ventured to peep out and was quite overjoyed to find mr johnston in such good humor and much wondered at it they were both extremely pleased and imagined they even had his consent to continue their agreeable amusement  jack soon dressed himself and taking a tender leave of his dear nannett promised to meet earlier the following night but alas that meeting never happened  jack got to the garden as directed but trembled at mr johnstons approach who assuming a smile gave the boy not a little courage  well sir said his master it seems you have lately passed your time very cheerfully and turned over other leaves besides latin and greek however i am not now here to upbraid you with ingratitude or with the breach of all laws human and divine neither shall i now correct you or send you to prison and have you hanged as the laws direct but as i shall always have it in my power so i shall certainly put it in practice except you will give me your most sacred promise to do whatever i shall order  sir said jack with great confusion i really dont know how to appear before god or you after my transgressions but i hope my sincere repentance with my most solemn vow to obey all your directions will atone for my crimes  i know replied mr johnston you abhor a lie therefore i will trust you the last letters i received from my lord particularly mention you about a project i had of sending you to london of which he has approved now jack if you will set out this day in the manner i shall direct i will pardon all and put you in a way of making your fortune  sir replied jack who was fired at going to london i have already given you my oath to obey and to convince you of my readiness i am willing to set out this minute  in the first place said mr johnston i must insist on your not speaking a syllable to nannett on any account whatever nor to any person in the family about what has happened in the next place i desire you will press me this morning for leave to visit mr wilsons family who have so often invited you  go that road about a mile and then turn back through the fields which you know will in about an hour lead you into the great road to dublin on this side the windmill you will find my man john with a carr who will have particular orders to take care of you and you will follow his directions as i know you will believe me i give you my word and honor that i intend only your own good but it is absolutely necessary for your peace and mine that you promise punctually to obey my orders and that on no account you will ever write yourself or cause any other person to write to my lord mr kindly or me these are the conditions on which my pardon is founded if you transgress be assured my utmost rensentment will follow  jack threw himself on his knees and most solemnly vowed in the presence of god religiously to observe all his directions and rising asked his master what he intended to do with his shirts books and his other little effects but being assured he should find them all safe in dublin was quite easy on that account  now said mr johnston i am satisfied and i hope you will have reason to be content lest you may want money on the road here is a guinea and more will be given you in town  as they walked toward the house mr johnston gave him many good lessons for his future conduct  he very earnestly recommended a modest sober and religious life as what only could give him true joy and real happiness  he told him that god sometimes permitted good to come out of evil and prayed it might be so in the present case but that no man ought to depend that such a grace would at all times be bestowed on us  that as the mercy of god was great so was his jealousy equally capable of forgiving young rash sinners as of punishing obstinate and unrepenting offenders  much more was said on this subject and in so tender a manner as greatly to affect the boy and make a strong impression on his mind mr johnston concluded with saying you have not much of the common irish manner of speaking but let me advise you to forget the little you have and endeavor to speak like the people you live with which will prevent your being often laughed at and ridiculed by the ignorant and vulgar and none other can do it  your name is quite irish but i shall call you john conyers in my letters and henceforward let that be your name and now mr conyers i think we have fully settled this matter therefore go in and behave as usual but remember your promise  they got to the house before any of the servants were up so their meeting was a secret  when jack was alone he began very seriously to reflect on his situation he was conscious of deserving very severe punishment and thanked god mr johnston had treated him so well  on the other hand he regretted parting with his dear nannett especially in the manner he had promised and had a violent inclination to take one tender farewell but his vow prevented him the injunctions laid on him he thought very extraordinary but the dread of punishment and shame and the anger of my lord and mr kindly made him acquiesce with patience to these hard terms besides as he really had an entire confidence in and a love for mr johnston he doubted not but he had good reasons for what he ordered  though his effects were to meet him in dublin he had the wise precaution of putting on two shirts and taking his purse which now contained but eleven guineas he likewise put in his coat pocket the little box and instructions given him by mr kindly and all the little manuscripts he had thus dressed and fixed in his resolutions he waited on mr johnston and begged his leave to visit mr wilson who lived about four miles to the west  mr johnston hesitated for some time but his wife interceding she obtained permission provided he promised to go half a mile round and not cross the ford which was sometimes dangerous  it seems mr johnston had given orders to john to go that morning with a carr to dublin for an hogshead of wine and as he was an old faithful servant was the only person he trusted with the secret he gave him his instructions and a letter to his brother who was a merchant of that city  john had set out about eight oclock and jack took a different road about nine  he went off with tolerable spirits but when he came to the appointed turn his heart swelled and the thoughts of parting with nannett master harry billy and all his dear friends for ever almost made him distracted and obliged him to sit down and give way to a torrent of tears  at last the thoughts of seeing dublin and london and the hopes of making his fortune throwing his situation into a more favorable light he found strength to proceed and joined old john about eleven oclock  the man was prepared for him and under the pretense of keeping him from the sun seated him on a bundle of straw on the carr and covered him with a sort of awning so close that no passengers could see him and then marched on to dublin where he was well received by the merchant  perhaps the goodnatured reader may be desirous of knowing what passed at portarlington when jack was missed and how nannett and the family behaved on this melancholy occasion and sorry i am that it is not in my power to gratify so reasonable a curiosity he may if he pleases suppose with me that they sent next day to mr wilsons and that their surprise was great when informed they had not seen or heard of him no doubt many were their conjectures some i imagine thought he had run away but i apprehend the most probable and general surmise was that in crossing the ford he was drowned  be this as it will i must though with some regret leave this good family and follow my friend jack conyers through scenes of a much different nature  the calm tranquil life he has hitherto led must give place to the hurry and bustle of the world  deceit craft flattery and vice must succeed to lessons of honor probity and virtue  chap xiv take sound advice proceeding from the heart sincerely yours and free from fraudful art drydens virgil happy that being who sometimes permits himself to think seriously who suffers his imagination deliberately to reflect on external objects and internally apply those lessons of morality and instruction that may be drawn from every action of man  vice trails with it those marks that show us its odiousness as some poisonous animals carry their antidote  affluence and plenty are not generally productive of such thoughts for in that situation we are apt to look no farther than ourselves nor conceive the possibility of being wretched and unhappy till we have experienced some of its bitters  there is a pleasing and a useful sensation in the soul at viewing and commiserating the distresses of the unfortunate the more we have pitied and raised our tenderness and charity to others the happier we find ourselves should distress and penury visit us in its rounds  independent of the christian duty of compassion this consideration alone makes it good to have been in trouble  jack though tenderly treated by the merchant and now in a large city where variety of unaccustomed objects presented themselves to his view yet melancholy ideas filled his mind to abandon and be abandoned by those friends he had so sincerely loved  to live amongst strangers in a distant country and to begin to labor and work for the bread he was to eat were to him most dreadful vicissitudes of fortune and what he imagined were peculiar to himself in these gloomy reflections he acknowledged his manifold offenses and in his fervent prayers which had lately been neglected most heartily begged forgiveness he read mr kindlys instructions to his son over and over and made the properest observations on them in his power  as i have now some spare time it cannot be better employed than laying before my reader the instructions so often mentioned  should he be wise enough not to stand in need of these precepts i beg he will pass them over and skip on to the mere narration  to my son john kindly bounty hall my dear child when you reflect on the relation i bare to you and on my tenderness and affection you must be convinced that all my care and pains is to endeavor to make and perhaps see you an happy and a worthy man  you are now to begin a new scene of life where instead of the guardianship of a fond father you must be guided and directed by so dangerous a tutor as yourself  though you must be far removed from my presence yet i conjure you by every sacred tie to think on your father and the advice he now gives you  be careful in observing every duty of religion you will find it the surest and perhaps the only way to keep peace and content in your heart and a serenity and cheerfulness in your countenance  by being a man be not ashamed of being a christian  candor integrity and gratitude are some of the strongest links that bind men to each other when these are absent suspicion fraud and deceit will fill each breast and make us rather companions for the wild inhabitants of the forest than associates to animals who boast superior reason  you are to live in the world  you are to study the large volume of mankind  whilst thus employed forget not that mankind are studying you  nature has given you an easy flexible temper therefore guard against the charms of flattery  i know you will avoid the profligate and profane shun likewise the demure the precise and the very godly  experience demonstrates that hypocrisy cunning and deceit generally lurk under it and that the righteous overmuch have other schemes to work out besides their salvation  with virtue truth and justice which i trust you will preserve there are duties of society that give beauty and harmony and therefore must not be neglected  a tenderness for our fellow creatures a compassionate turn for their misfortunes and pity for their weaknesses are what we owe ourselves and them  by not paying this debt we renounce our claim to humanity  polite behavior and complacency of manners places every action in the most advantageous light and adds irresistible grace to every word and every motion  be sincere in such a conduct and suffer not your lips to give the lie to your heart  there is a medium to be followed even to persons we have an ill opinion of  as a general good behavior is necessary to and required by all you cannot fail of being remarkably so to some particulars but avoid making friendships till by time you are convinced they deserve yours  when you have found a friend detest the old and false maxim of living with him as though he may become an enemy  go not into the way of temptation for believe me it will but too often fall in yours resolution is strong but the strongest is lodged in a frail body therefore depend not too much upon it but rather owe your safety to a timely flight  in your dress avoid as much as possible the gaudy and fluttering but in the neat and clean endeavor to be remarkable a carefulness in properly setting off the person is commendable and useful it argues a desire of pleasing and gratifies the eye of every beholder a propriety in dress and a certain sobriety of deportment free from affectation and formality will always add weight to your conversation and make it sought after  company and cheerfulness are necessary and of infinite use but a constant jollity and mirth betrays such a levity in the mind that your presence will never be desired but merely to divert others whose regard ceases the instant the laughter is over  should your wit offend be assured of an enemy for ever  as your inclinations lead you to the study of the laws you will soon perceive the strength of the foundation on which the british constitution is built  you will soon observe the happiness of that kingdom where the different ranks of men have their different operations all coinciding and centering in the preservation of the whole  let your heart and your hand be always ready to support this structure  it has often been in danger and suffered mightyrevolutions but as it is now fully repaired by a protestant architect be it your care as much as in you lies to defend it from every foreign political and from every domestic wicked attempt  ambition and pride are crimes of the most dangerous tendency yet like opiates a small quantity is sometimes necessary as a large one gives the patient up to frenzy and madness and in the end destroys him  to have these in a just degree will raise a desire of excelling and prevent a meanness of conduct  a poet says  there is a pleasure in being mad which none but mad men know  be it so but desire not to experience it rather try what pleasure common sense will afford  she will instruct you in economy and in that proper management of your fortune that will bid defiance to a goal and make your sleep truly a blessing  she will teach you the right use of learning and show the folly of being impertinent with it  she will hold a mirror to your person and point out the absurdity of being vain of it  she will advise direct and show you the world in its true and genuine colors and give you that taste which ignorance pride and folly will ever be strangers to  learn if possible to be content with the station heaven has allotted you and endeavor to attain that sort of philosophy which gives patience and resignation in all sorts of calamities  the happiest of beings not only are subject to them but almost daily feel them in different shapes  to be a master of this truly noble science believe me the heart must be unconscious of guilt and a rectitude of thought must dwell in it  in a word let your intentions and your schemes of life be always founded in virtue and honor but whilst human and prudential means are pursued submit the issue with all humility unto that being who is incapable of error or falsehood and into whose hands i cheerfully submit you  john kindly   as often as jack read over these lessons he found his cares to lighten and received such strength to support himself as made him determine to pursue them as exactly as he could  he had now been in dublin about a month and had received all the effects he left in portarlington the merchant having prepared all things for his expedition and equipped him tolerably well in clothes gave him five guineas and a letter to his correspondent mr joshua strong of throgmortonstreet and embarked him on board the hibernia bound for london  i hope it will not be expected i should furnish my readers with the adventures of this voyage of ten days as there happened but the common occurrences on such occasions but i am strongly inclined to present them according to the practice of other wise authors with a most extraordinary and surprising dream jack had the first night  he dreamed  but i beg pardon for i find myself at this instant so drowsy that i must request my kind reader will follow my example and by taking a nap dream the remainder of this chapter  chap xv when pleasure stumbles in our way our best resolves too often decay frail nature prompts and giddy youth falls into crimes in spite of truth anonimous mr strong had by post received a full account of jack and what he was destined for so that when he appeared with his letter he was received with a sort of civility that gave him some uneasiness mr strong was at dinner and having asked him a few trifling questions desired him to go to the kitchen and get some victuals he bore this indignity tolerably well for his appetite did not permit his quarrelling with punctilios in the evening some more questions were put to him and was told he should be taken next morning where he was to live it seems mr strong had had time to prepare matters  this was not the pleasantest night jack passed in his life but the morning at last came that was to solve some doubts mr strong took his hat and cane and desired jack to follow him as they walked he told him they were going to mr champignons the weaver in spittle fields with whom he had agreed to bind him apprentice you may said mr strong stay seven or eight months on trial but i dare say you will like your situation so well that you will have reason to thank your friends  jack though not quite pleased was glad to find matters no worse and with more cheerfulness continued his march to the weavers  mr strong entering cried well monsieur here is the boy i spoke to you about take him and be sure dont keep him idle  ha hah said champignon parbleau he be a ver pretty garcon and i sure you must work ver well for be gar si he no travail he fall ave de ver good soupemaigre  thats right said mr strong no work no meat but i hope he will prove a good boy so monsieur your servant  i will call on you as i go by  serviteur serviteur monsieur de strange cried champignon as you plese call en pessant  jack eyed his new master and could scarcely forbear laughing at the oddity of his figure he was about sixtyfive or seventy years of age tall and very thin his swarthy skin did not seem to belong to what it covered and his cheekbones in particular discovered a violent inclination to escape through he had on an old greasy stuff gown and a double milled cap that perhaps was formerly scarlet in short jack thought he was bound apprentice to a skeleton but a certain good natured smile and an agreeable vivacity in the old man gave him some prospect of being better than he imagined  monsieur champignon was one of the million whom the religious wisdom of lewis the fourteenth compelled to visit england and other protestant countries and who brought with them many useful arts and manufactures he was a man of great application and industry which with great saving for a course of years made him worth about twenty thousand pounds he had a gaiety in his temper and such a fund of natural good understanding that his company was extremely agreeable to many eminent merchants his wife was a good sort of old woman but his only child mademoiselle tonton was a most lively and pretty girl of twentyfour years of age her complexion was not of the brightest but her sparkling eyes and her good shape made her a very desirable object her father from the stinginess of his temper had disappointed her of two very good matches and the scandalous chronicle of the neighborhood said she had taken a proper revenge  champignon was so whimsical that he scarcely ever spoke french and his english was such a medley as to occasion frequent laughter when he was asked why he spoke not better english he always answered  de par tout les diables  how you ave me speak so better englis sacre chien i ave live dans londres no more as forty year but avec de time me sal ave de conversation piff  paff  so well as monsieur me lor mere  jack was employed in the usual business of a junior apprentice and in weaving ribbons which he did tolerably well but found he had not a natural call to be tied to a loom  it would be impertinent to attempt to entertain the reader with the many arch tricks jack played his new master or with the mirth monsieur champignons english afforded he was extremely passionate and often called jack a jean foure an irland sonmabiche and many other whimsical names that always excited llaughter  he had now lived with mr champignon above twelve months and was pretty well reconciled to the family whose love he had got by songs and a thousand irish stories miss in particular was greatly diverted with his agreeable chat and he overheard her one morning tell her maid that considering conyers was irish he was the prettiest young fellow she ever saw in her life  though his manner of speaking was greatly improved yet there remained enough of his country to be severely banterd by miss tonton she often insisted on his making bulls and blunders she laughed at the words unwell  big coat  ere yesterday and the like  jack who was now become pretty free asked her if she understood him when he spoke  yes said she i comprehend your meaning well enough but you have such unaccountable phrases one had need of an irish expositor  im glad madam said jack you are pleased to allow i speak so as to be comprehended but a gentleman the other day in our warehouse cried out did no body see any body take up never a hat  i beg madam you will be so good to explain this english phrase for upon my sowl i cannot  upon my sowl said she and laughed violently at his tone without answering his question  such sort of conversation happened frequently and was equally amusing but as he artfully suffered her to have the superiority in every argument and even asked her advice and instruction she conceived a vast opinion of his uncultivated genius and his natural good parts  these sort of beginnings generally lead to and are but the forerunners of thoughts not so proper to be plainly set down  these impertinent thoughts but too often occurred  jack had them not  guess who then  miss tonton was one morning at her toilet very judiciously adjusting her headdress before she fixed her stays young conyers passing her chamber was perceived by the reflection of her glass and calling him in a great hurry begged he would look down her back for a flea that teased her immoderately jack very innocently examined the part and declared he saw nothing  lord said tonton youre such an unhandy booby you will let the creature escape but look sharp jack i beg of you  jack looked but his imagination being warmed by the touch his understanding became the clearer  now cried he i see it  there it hops faith it is a swinger  he then vigourously pursued the flying animal which traversing the whole plain of her back took its course to the eminencies in front where it afforded a most delightful chase it skipd from hill to hill practiced all the craft of the hare but jack was so keen a sportsman that he rested not till he had fairly caught it  associates in amusements become intimates and frequently form friendships twas so in the present case tonton began to be extremely fond of jacks company and found so many opportunities to hunt that one would imagine she had collected all the fleas in the parish to afford him diversion her maid bersheba who was old and ugly prevented many an evenings sport so she was obliged to make use of her as a whipperin or as a groom to hold the horses by this notable contrivance jack was frequently introduced when the family were in bed and stayed till they were near rising when he quietly retired through the old maids room whose heyday of the blood was not over but sometimes mutinyd in the matrons bones  it seems poor bersheba was likewise subject to fleas and the hunting them became not a little troublesome to jack it chagreend him much and made tonton very uneasy  at last he obtained a long respite but not in the manner he chose for he was taken extremely ill and a violent fever ensued no doubt he wanted not proper care and in six weeks he began to return to his senses and a little to recover  the first use he made of his reason was to confess the justice of the punishment for his repeated crimes  bountyhall portarlington his friends and all their good advice now came rushing into his thoughts with such force that he relapsed and had like never to have given me the opportunity of writing his history his youth and good constitution at length prevailed and all danger was over except what might proceed from his extreme weakness or falling into a consumption he recovered so slowly that the doctor like his brethren when they know not what else to do advised a change of air for a month or two champignon was one of the few frenchmen of substance who had not a country house and to take lodgings and maintain jack would be attended with an expense he by no means could bring himself to think of  mr villeneuf a very eminent merchant in blackfryars was an intimate friend and had frequently diverted himself with jack whose pertinent answers and good understanding made him a sort of favorite  champignon said he one day why dont you send poor conyers to the country  the lad will die here and his funeral will cost you more than a months lodging  ha ha said champignon i do no such ating  parbleu i send jean to de diable  to monsieur de strange  dat gentilman he never come say champignon how jean conyer do  monsieur de strange say noting do noting  poor champignon must do tout  ventrebleu je crois dat de monde tink me diablement rich  i tell you monsieur villeneuf poor champignon sall dye alors you will see you will regard all my pauvre richesse  a dautres said villeneuf i know you better besides if mr strong be a brute i hope my friend champignon is not  but i shall make this matter easy and honest conyers shall not be lost  send him tomorrow to my house at greenwich where he may be a companion for my sober melancholy son and perhaps do each other good  champignon was not averse to this proposal and jack with his trunk were put into a coach and sent off next day  mr villeneuf the son was a gentleman of twentyfour years of age he passionately loved reading and retirement was extremely good natured and charitable but had a gloominess in his temper that made him averse to much company and mirth his father who had no other child was obliged to indulge him in his humor and supply him liberally with money to gratify his generous spirit his large fortune could very well afford this expense  jack was as happy as his disturbed thoughts would permit which were ever reflecting on his past conduct and upbraiding him with actions of which he dreaded the consequence  repentance he thought might avert a further punishment and set himself seriously to think of it  he knew that truly to repent he must lead a new life and avoid his former and all other crimes  but how difficult what struggles had he to forget nannett and tonton he could not avoid remembering the very thing he wanted to be blotted from his memory then how could he say he would forget them  no but as he could not prevent the intrusion of thought he was determined to refrain from actual evil as this was the utmost he could bring himself to he rested satisfied that this resolution would hold firm  the first week at greenwich was not extremely pleasant as young mr villeneuf seldom spoke to or seemed to regard him but as the apprentice of a weaver for whom his father had some value jack perceived the reason of this coolness and by degrees stole in a latin sentence and some judicious observations but in such language and accent for he had quite lost the irish tone that surpised the young gentleman and made him desirous of a more intimate acquaintance this he easily accomplished and as jacks health and spirits increased he made great progress in the affections of mr villeneuf  the old gentleman had determined to send his son to paris for a year or two that by travel and a different climate and company he might be brought insensibly to act like other men he found his son was much pleased with jack and proposed his going with him as a kind of servant of whom he might at times make a companion the young gentleman expressed his satisfaction and conyers was vastly delighted at seeing a little more of the world and not be obliged to return to the perpetual motion of the shuttle  i must leave the management of monsieur champignon to the old gentleman and bid adieu to spittlefields tonton and bersheba for in three months mr villeneuf and conyers found themselves in the capital of france  chap xvi the learned full of inward pride the fops of outward show deride the fop with learning at defiance scoffs at the pedant and the science the don a formal solemn strutter despises monsieurs airs and flutter while monsieur mocks the formal fool who looks and speaks and walks by rule britain a medley of the twain as pert as france as grave as spain in fancy wiser than the rest laughs at them both  gay jack was now in his ninteenth year of a good stature good complexion and when dressed was a very genteel and handsome fellow his eyes were black and sprightly he had a most agreeable smile and something so easy in his manner that he prepossessed every one in his favor almost at first sight when he spoke it was with great modesty but his learning and good sense made him heard with pleasure he had found out the grand secret of conversation which was to speak seldom but to the purpose and he had likewise learned to get the better in an argument by sometimes giving it up  his fixed allowance from mr villeneuf was but small but he equipped him with decent clothes ruffled shirts and from time to time with money sufficient to dine at a good ordinary and be always clean and neat mr villeneuf generally went out about ten in the morning and returned to his lodgings about five in the evening except he went to the comedy but never expected conyers till about eight or nine oclock jack always attended when he was dressing but was of little use as a french footman performed all that operation  mr villeneuf had a fencing and a dancing master rather because it was the fashion and that his father insisted on it than for any use they might be of to him the gentlemen constantly attended but conyers principally received the benefit of their instructions he likewise was very diligent at a neighboring academy for riding this was of infinite advantage as it strengthened his limbs and gave him a carriage that still added to the gracefulness of his person when his curiosity was pretty much gratified he applied closely to the best french authors making their history and language familiar to him he examined and enquired as far as he was able into their laws their customs and manners and made such observations that more learned travelers need not have been ashamed of he had a genius for figures and made himself a tolerable master of some branches in mathematics in a word he took care to be fully employed  his young master or rather his friend had books enough and in conversation gave him many hints which he improved one night at supper villeneuf told him he wondered at his staying so much in the house and that he ought to go more into the world you are always said he poring over books and advising me against what you practice yourself  i confess sir said conyers it is but too true i am necessitated to act like the gascoin for not having it in my power to read the great i must content myself with the small world as i find it in books  pray said mr villeneuf how did the gascoin manage  why sir replied conyers the gascoin was just as poor a fellow as i am but he took it into his head to be industrious and amuse himself with selling water in paris an old friend met him and his pitchers and was vastly surpised that a gentleman of his noble blood could so demean himself as to follow so low an occupation lord replied the gascoin you quite mistake the matter for i am a man of great importance and such a favorite at court that the king has granted me the waters of the sein but as i have not found a chap to buy the whole at once you see i am obliged to retail it  so said villeneuf the moral of the story is that your poverty prevents your following my advice but henceforward that shall be no obstacle my appointment is more than i possibly know how to spend and must desire your assistance in the management of part of it to begin take these fifty pieces and command more when they are gone  sir said conyers i own i meant to beg a little money but could never imagine your generosity and goodness extensive and great as they are could lead you into such an act that my poor services can never repay  conyers like numps in the comedy was quite another creature with money in his pocket and so elate that he could not avoid imparting his good fortune to madam commode the milliner where they lodged she rejoiced exceedingly and extolled mr villeneufs generosity to the skies but still insinuated that the bounty was vastly lessened when the worth and value of the receiver was considered  many were the compliments and encomiums bestowed on him by the good woman and her fair daughter mademoiselle madelain this young lady was blessed with peculiar eloquence and such a fluency of speech that conyers pressed her acceptance of a couple of lewis dors which by some accidental words he found she stood in need of with great difficulty she consented but assured him it was owing to his irresistible politeness  he imagined sometimes she was troubled with fleas but he found those of paris more nimble than those he had before hunted for though he often attempted yet he never could catch one of madelains  he dined most commonly at a neighboring hotel frequented by very good company where he had the honor of hearing the english pretty severely handled particularly by monsieur maquereau and the chevalier fanfaron  i cannot conceive said maquereau how london maintains itself for most of the inhabitants transport themselves to paris  true cried fanfaron those english of some understanding know they can never improve but by our company  i cannot blame them replied the other for it shows some glimmering of a good taste the english continued he have that plodding turn and that sort of blunt stupidity that enables them to make money and as foolishly to throw it away were it not for their guineas their company would be insupportable  it must be confessed said the chevalier that their purse is the best furnished part about them they are awkward and clumsey and have not the least spark of french politeness  im sure said maquereau raising his shoulders we take great pains to make them reasonable animals by sending such a constant provision of cooks milliners tailors footmen silks embroideries and a million of other useful ingredients in the composition of a fine gentleman or lady and so ungrateful are the creatures that they send us nothing in return  fo  re cried the chevalier what the devil have they to send us so monsieur balance comes in person to return their thanks  many more vain and impertinent remarks passed between them and the chevalier concluded by saying it must be allowed france is the nation in the world where people see good manners and true politeness  conyers was very uneasy at this conversation but monsieur de pense an elderly gentleman took a glass of wine and said to him mr englishman i have the honor to drink your health it is the english fashion and i love it the better i have great obligations to the english and regard them as a brave and generous people as for their politeness i swear they have more than what you have seen this day at table  sir said conyers i am very glad to find so much in one gentleman and am disappointed at not discovering the same in all  how sir cried the chevalier in an half angry tone  sir replied jack very briskly you will be so good to indulge me two words before your warmth increases gentlemen continued he i am in paris by command therefore am not one of those who come merely to learn fashions all nations have fools in abundance  english fools go abroad because they have money and perhaps the fools of this country stay at home because they have none i frequently meet them and sometimes dine with them and if you will take their words they are men of taste and politeness and to convince you of it they will tell you the english are stupid and barbarous they will say the rudest expressions with the most respectful bow and call it good manners i own gentlemen my ignorance cannot comprehend the vast politeness of such a conduct but my little experience has taught me not to judge of a whole nation by a few recent bad samples  fanfaron and maquereau swelled with choler but pense in a sort of peremptory manner desired them to be easy and added  i am ashamed of all this every one here knew this young gentleman was english and every one of us ought to strive who could most oblige him if gentlemen will strike the ball they must expect it will rebound and i doubt not but the young englishman is as capable of handling a racket as either of you but by g  he that offends him by design offends me  i offend the gentleman cried the chevalier i hope i have more good manners  i am truly sorry said maquereau any pleasantry of mine should offend a stranger much more one of so respectable a nation as england and i hope the gentleman will be so good to grant me his pardon  sir said the chevalier to jack i ask the same with the utmost sincerity and flatter myself the good nature so peculiar to the english nation will demonstrate itself on this unhappy occasion for be assured sir we had not the least intention of affronting you or our dear friend monsieur de pense  mutual compliments having passed the affair was finally adjusted but mr pense begged a further acquaintance with conyers for he was vastly satisfied with his conduct  at supper jack acquainted mr villeneuf with his adventure who seemed extremely pleased he had come off so well  that idle partiality to our country and the despising all others said mr villeneuf gives rise to a thousand quarrels do not our vulgar countrymen most heartily abuse the french and all other nations and i believe many of our greatones do the same  in this sir said jack you may very justly say the great vulgar and the small differ in little  if at all the highest and lowest class only vary in their vices by the manner of committing them they have their amors and are equally gratified  one may drink champaign or burgundy to excess and the other be as happily drunk with beer or gin  one may game for a thousand pounds and the others be as eager and cheat as much in play for twopence  but said mr villeneuf in swearing and cursing as their capacities are equal they are equal in every part  in abusing the french said conyers they may have a shadow of reason because they are always public or private enemies but what can be said sir when they abuse and insult a whole kingdom governed by the same monarch the same laws and inhabited by the same people as themselves  i suppose said villeneuf you mean the people of ireland for i know you have a warm side to it  sir said conyers i shall not deny it neither do i think it a criminal warmth for he who wishes well to a part of his majestys faithful subjects ought to do so to the remainder  not only so replied villeneuf but is bound in duty to wish well that is to endeavor to convert the bad ones your observation on the insults offered the irish is i think rather too general and holds true but with regard to what you term the great and small vulgar gentlemen of a certain education think differently and are not slaves to old popular errors and prejudices however i believe you will confess that the infamous practices of some of the irish dont much contribute to remove the partiality  tis too true sir said conyers and many pay for their pranks with their lives and die suddenly in tyburn road if a poor wretch has or takes on himself a name something like the common irish every newspaper charges him to the account of ireland when perhaps some other part was entitled to the honor this has often made me wish that the hibernians had a gallows erected for their own proper use as they have here for the normans and who knows but a certain shame might operate more forcibly than the severity of laws  well well cried villeneuf i am for the ford let it fit whom it will as for the abuse and banter bestowed in general on the irish tone or manner of speaking i think it falls only on those who give it but as you seem to interest yourself about them and i believe know little of the conduct of england with regard to that kingdom i shall give you some time or another a short tract on that subject which i have chiefly collected from the observations of my father  conyers returned him many thanks and mr villeneuf desiring him to keep up his acquaintance with monsieur pense retired to his chamber  chap xvii of all the follies we can boast none sure can be so strong as pay a fool to rule the roast and guide our children wrong what man who plows the fertile soil and hopes reward for cares will call the crows to reap his toil and be content with tares anonimous next morning conyers paid a visit to monsieur pense and was genteely received the usual compliments being over i doubt not sir said he but you were greatly shocked yesterday at the impertinencies of the two scoundrels but as you very justly said that you would not brand a whole nation for the faults of a few i believe i can strengthen your good sense by informing you who those men are  i am sure sir said conyers they are persons of low minds which made my resentment fall the lighter but i must own my obligations to you for extricating me from an affair that might have been as troublesome as necessary  i promise you said pense you owe me nothing and you will be convinced of it when i have the pleasure of being better known to you at present permit me to give you a short account of those gentlemen who gave themselves so many airs  fanfaron was very early dubbed a knight of the famous and ancient order of industry it is impossible to inform you of his many exploits in france italy and in england where i had the honor of meeting him and maquereau at a gamingtable and detected them of using loaded dice fanfaron fell to my share and maquereau to a friend the discipline of the cane and kicking lasted a full half hour and was so entertaining that they have ever since done me the honor of being extremely complaisant  the chevalier got acquainted in london with mrs smith the wife of an italian merchant she was a most charming woman and her husband was extremely fond his business calling him to leghorn he prudently settled his affairs and made his dear wife sole executrix and divided his fortune between her and a child poor mr smith went off and his tender consort would have been inconsolable had not the goodnatured fanfaron comforted her in her afflictions  at last the chevalier persuaded her into a scheme to make their joys more complete and not so liable to be interrupted by the curiosity of a husband he very dexterously forged a letter from the correspondent at leghorn to mrs smith full of kind expressions and friendship and the great difficulty he was under by being obliged to mention the loss of so worthy and good a man as mr smith who took a fever and in spite of all assistance and the skill of physicians died in his arms the ninth day confirming a testament made in england  mrs smith was now a widow and acted that part to such perfection that her relations thought she could not long survive  good heaven cried conyers i shudder at the consequences  well sir said pense notwithstanding her mighty grief her weeds and administering to the will were not forgotten in fine she called in the debts sold off the stock in trade the house and every thing belonging to it and finding herself in possession of six thousand pounds in cash very fairly bid adieu to her husband her child her father and all her relations and flew with her beloved fanfaron to this famous city  poor mr smith returned soon after to england if his pleasure was great at the thoughts of meeting his dearest wife what were the torments he endured when he found he had not only lost her but was reduced to beggary words cannot express his melancholy situation and the manner of it afflicted him more than had he been deprived of all by any other accident his friends did all in their power to assuage his woes and as he had an extreme good character and was really an honest man the merchants of london acting like themselves supported his credit abroad advanced him money and set him so fairly in the world that i left him greatly recovered in his spirits and fortune  dear sir said conyers you give me great joy but i am curious to know if possible what became of mrs smith  her fate replied pense was dreadful enough fanfaron for some time lived a gay and splendid life constancy and humanity were not amongst his virues or vices so that in about twelve months madam was sent to graze on the common till at last having run through every scene of misery attended by a guilty conscience she finished her days in the hospital of la charity  tears stood in conyerss eyes but when he a little recovered poor wretch said he as the hand of providence is so visible i shall not pretend to arraign its justice or mercy  i presume continued he monsieur fanfaron enjoys the remainder of her fortune with vast comfort and satisfaction and doubt not but he will some day or other have the honor of entertaining a crowd at the greve  and very likely added pense attended by his friend maquereau  this other fine gentleman continued he was a footman in paris and went to london with an english lord had he had common honesty he might have made a fortune for he dont want sense he passed through many services and was remarkably dextrous in the nice conduct of an affair which in italy is managed by a secretario de amore and what in england is termed pimping the money he got by this branch of business was all laid out at the gamingtable however i found him in paris a few years ago with an equipage but by some circumstances that then happened i have reason to believe his last master was not the richer for him  but let us drop these fellows for they are not worth our thoughts though we are compelled sometimes to dine with and be civil to them  i observed said conyers an englishman at table yesterday with a young lad and what surpised me was they never opened their mouths but to eat and drink  o replied pense with a laugh the gentleman you mention is a bearleader  a bearleader cried conyers in the name of wonder what profession is that why sir answered pense a bearleader is a man who understands latin and greek and is well paid by a rich father to take his child and expose him through every great town in europe  i suppose said conyers you mean a governor to a young gentleman in his travels  you may give it replied the other what name you please in england but i am sure they here give it the proper appellation for the boys that generally follow these leaders may very justly be called cubs  conyers smiled and the conversation continued on various subjects till they withdrew to dinner  in the evening jack gave mr villeneuf some account of his visit and did not forget the description of a bearleader  certain it is said villeneuf nothing improves the mind of a young man like prudent travel we are sensible of this in england but few know how to conduct it  we generally take a lad from the university where though he has acquired some learning yet he is as ignorant of the world as his bedmaker and at once case him up in fine clothes and let him run a winter or two in london he is then taken up and saddled with a governor who races him round europe and in two or three years he returns to his dear parents loaded with the bawbles and vices of each country  and is this sir said conyers the mighty uses of traveling  tis but too frequently so replied villeneuf but when a youth of education improved by good company travels with a gentleman of sense for his companion his friends may expect the harvest of a thorough accomplishment this youth will remark on the strength and weakness of different countries on the usefulness of different manufactures and endeavor to transplant those sciences that may advantage his country and improve it this i call traveling and not riding post but to send a boy of sixteen or seventeen years of age who knows nothing of his own country with a pedant as ignorant as himself is truly what your friend calls exposing both to the ridicule and imposition of foreigners and brings a contempt on our country  one will improve by the good customs and manners and the other as certainly catch the follies and impertinences of every nation they travel through and every nation have some of one and too much of the other  sir said conyers though i do not pretend to be a traveller yet i cannot help observing that the courtesy of this country is not of the right breed their civilities or as they call it their politeness seems to me rather an habit and jingle of words than to carry a meaning significant of what they express  sometimes said villeneuf it is so yet when i find myself deceived their manner of doing it prevents my finding fault and even pleases it is this sort of manner that makes a stranger pass his time more agreeably in france than in most other countries and what i wish our people had a little more of  i believe sir answered conyers if our english want that manner they make it fully up by their sincerity  so we say replied villeneuf but suppose it fact what have i to do with the sincerity of a people with whom i mean to pass but a short time to contract no particular friendships and to keep myself in that neutral civil style which every man has a title to believe me conyers men of fortune will be naturally drawn to that place where they can purchase most pleasure and receive most honor you may if you please call it flattery but since we choose to swallow they are in the right to administer the dose  i wonder said conyers that so much of it dont turn the stomach  just the contrary replied villeneuf for the stomach is so accustomed to it that it becomes a real nutriment and a nutriment that many courts in europe are so fond of that they will purchase it though their liberties may be the price  i have often heard said conyers that the french have always aimed at universal monarchy but i should imagine that the fate of the romans who fell by their own weight would deter them from such a project but ambition and glory have no bounds  if said villeneuf they have such notions they may manage in another manner by the conversation i have frequently had with some gentlemen of understanding i have laid down a plan of french politics by way of hypothesis and not as truth which is very difficult to come at if my conjectures are right their system is short and far from impracticable  but it is now late so take it and examine it at your leisure  when both were retired conyers read and copied as he always did the observations of mr villeneuf he now began from the study of books to examine the truth from the study of man and compare them together  the reflections of mr villeneuf and the additions made by conyers according to the time he had occasion to mention them must be left to that time to discover for he is now going to bed and so am i  chap xviii it is an old maxim in the schools that flattery is the food of fools yet now and then your men of wit will condescend to take a bit swift conyers constantly visited monsieur pense and was much improved by his company mr villeneuf was so extremely pleased that he supplied him very liberally with money but whatever good sense jack possessed he by no means understood the uses of that commodity his landlady and the fair madelain were determined to enjoy an equal share of it at the small expense of a little flattery and the nice tickling the string of vanity and selfopinion so common in youth and what age and experience are not always proof against  these ladies had engaged the esteem of conyers by a thousand winning ways but now his person and his vast accomplishments were the theme of every hour when they spoke of him to strangers it was with rapture but they took care that he was within hearing this sort of conduct not only produced frequent plays operas and parties of pleasure but often extracted half a dozen pieces for some pretended emergency which were repaid by madelain in caresses and by every freedom except the last  they often wished that conyers had a fortune agreeable to his merit and insinuated that perhaps they might be of service to him  it is not said madame commode a new or uncommon thing for ladies of fortune to make themselves happy with a young gentleman of your figure and understanding  and i know said madelain a most beautiful lady with half a million of livres that i believe sees monsieur conyer oftener then he imagines  in a word cried madame since my girl has blabbed out so much i must tell you a little more the daughter of a rich banker of paris has seen you and is actually in love her companion sups with me this evening and you must be of the party  lord madame cried madelain what a charming couple they will be how delightfully will they live  what a superbe equipage and magnificent hotel good god what cannot youth beauty and riches do together  hold hold said her mother not so fast if you please fair and softly  this must be a work of some time and managed with great address or we shall stumble on many difficulties  conyers blushed and gave many thanks for the good opinion she was pleased to entertain of him  that he would study to deserve her favor and would be entirely guided by her  leave it to me replied madame and i will engage to make something of it  i need not desire you to be cheerful and free with the lady to night but dont think of making her any presents till you become a little more intimate which i hope will be about the third visit  presents must be made but let them be genteel and frequent  they pave the way and oil the hinges  you understand me  extremely well replied conyers and as i know they are absolutely necessary they shall not be wanting  conyers provided some excellent burgundy and champaign and in the evening was presented with great form and encomiums to the amiable companion of the fair unknown at supper he was extremely gay and polite and at her request sung several new songs in an elegant taste  mademoiselle farde was highly delighted with his agreeable company and gave many proofs of it  madame commode and madelain were very lavish in their praises and the night concluded with mutual marks of esteem and respect  a second and a third evening past pretty much like the first except that mademoiselle farde and conyers were very intimate and free madame commode by accident showing some fine new fashioned caps and ruffles conyers embraced the luckly opportunity of presenting mademoiselle farde with what she seemed to like most the gift was a trifle of about twelve lewis dors and with great entreaty was accepted that night the good lady of the house brought on the proper subject and with some hesitation mademoiselle farde acknowledged that monsieur conyer was not indifferent to the lady she had the honor to live with  conyers bowed and assured her he was in love with the description of that beautiful angel and with many apologies begged she would convey a small billet to her fair hands mademoiselle farde objected to such a proceedure and would have absolutely refused it had not madame commode and madelain most artfully pleaded his cause  he had a letter prepared which he most respectively gave her  she was equally ready and with a wink slipped a note into his hand  when all were retired he read his billet which contained these words i have my reasons let me see you tomorrow evening at six oclock in the tuilleries keep this a profound secret adieu  conyers was punctual and farde was exact  she told him twas impossible to meet so often at madame commodes without being observed and to take him to the ladys house was impossible that to be of service to both she had taken a private lodging where they could settle matters and where the lady would certainly meet him were it in her power she then added we may be observed even here let us retire  conyers attended and was conducted to a little lane and a very indifferent chamber of which she had the key  here she informed him of many particulars with regard to the young lady and gave him hopes of bringing matters to bear and promised her utmost assistance  so much goodness naturally claimed a grateful return and at last she was prevailed on to accept ten pieces his generosity charmed her nor could she forbear answering his tender embraces which by degrees became more fervent so that  you will permit a continuance of this history  he had now completely fixed mademoiselle farde on his side yet they met at his lodgings as usual but more frequently in this  the young lady answered his billets in a proper and polite manner and permitted him to hope he replied as politely and the correspondence went on in the most agreeable manner though he sometimes thought that the postage was rather too expensive however as he was sure of the ladys affections he judged it well bestowed and waited for the issue with great patience for above four months  one morning as he was going out he found a letter to madame commode which had been dropped by accident and he read  dear commode you have afforded me infinite pleasure by the company of the english man were he richer our profit would be greater however i shall do my part to ease the poor devil of what he dont know the value of i send you back the embroidered petticoat which the fool gave me last night so give the bearer six lewis dors i shall call on you tomorrow and think i have a scheme to keep the silly fellows hopes alive at least three months longer adieu  farde   no london citizen looked so much aghast at the dread shock of first or second earthquake nor broughton famous bruiser felt such pangs when slack the pupil of his iron hands raised his tough fists and with a mighty stroke buried those eyes that saw to aim so well as looked and felt the poor the bubbld conyers he stared and read but at last cried out i am an english man  i am a poor devil a fool and silly fellow but  art to art  and then he left the letter just where he found it  he recovered his usual sprightliness and went to find mr pense to whom he communicated the beginning of this affair in a very serious manner but pense had no sooner heard madame commode named than he bid him have a care  i am surprised said he that a young fellow of your understanding has not found out that that lady is but of the middling order of bawds  you are her dupe her cully and give me but permission and i shall demonstrate it to you  permit me said conyers to thank and save you the trouble for i know it perfectly well but my knowledge is not three hours old  he then told him the remainder of the story and begged his advice which pense gave with an addition of good instructions  conyers found means to persuade villeneuf to change lodgings and on various pretenses to borrow a few louis from madame commode and even from mademoiselle farde  at last he contrived a letter as from london to a merchant in paris wherein among many particulars he expressed his surprise that mr conyers would choose to live in the manner he did with mr villeneuf when a large estate waited his orders by the death of his father a gentleman delivered to mrs commode this letter open with directions where he lived but that he would have the honor of waiting on mr conyers in a few days  it is not easy to conceive the impression this letter made on the mother and daughter they gave it to conyers with prodigious respect and formed projects infinitely more extensive than the first  he told them he knew of this before therefore was not elate on any advancement of fortune but he likewise found a time to persuade madelain to accompany him to england and share it with him  as she consented to his generous proposal it is not surprising that they sealed the agreement in the most solemn manner  he was now out of the house of madame commode and constantly visited mademoiselle farde this good creature was much more liberal of her favors than he expected but jack being of a free communicative temper miss madelain shared in her bounty he soon was sensible of his situation and applied to his friend pense who with a smile said this affair has ended with strict poetical justice and let it there remain drop these fine ladies and make your court to a surgeon  poor conyers was greatly mortified  the reflections of his mind were not lightened by the pains of his body he found he had not only acted imprudently but wickedly and once more began to repent that is to dread a sharper punishment for he had that sort of uneasy foreboding in the soul that many feel but what none can describe or account for  his intimacy with pense for almost two years had grown into a strict friendship  to this sensible man he discovered his present situation and almost his whole life and received such consolation and comfort that greatly alleviated his sorrow  they were now in the tuilleries and the surprise of conyers was extreme when mr pense began to speak in very good english  it is but just my dear conyers said he to repay your confidence in me by giving you some account of myself which i shall fairly do and in few words  i was born continued he in london of french protestant parents and my real name is villars my father was a mercer and bred me to the business but it seems my idle inclinations led me more to plays gaminghouses and horse races  my father thought that a prudent wife would take off my wildness and provided me with as good a one as ever man was blessed with  we commenced in trade and had tolerable business but diversion or what they call innocent recreation was strong in my weak head i was often at the play houses and a constant member of two or three notable clubs  i sometimes tried my fortune at a masquerade where my disguise saved my reputation but not my purse  i kept a brace of good geldings and frequently ventured fifty or an hundred pieces at epsom tunbridge and other races  my poor dear girl with gentle words and tears in her eyes has remonstrated the injury i did my credit  that i lost not only my money to sharpers but my youth and time which never could be recalled  i laughed at her sober follies but she never replied but  well well i hope my dear tom will think before it is too late  notwithstanding my idle extravagancies my dear wife managed the shop so well that my circumstances rather increased than diminished  the folly of appearing rich in the eyes of the world is a sure way of being poor in reality  this folly i had and without considering my force i took a house and garden at dulwich kept my chair and more servants and according to custom went there on saturdays and returned on mondays but to my shame i speak it i did worse much worse for i kept a whore  oh mr conyers could my example could the compunction of mind i now feel be a warning to mankind i should have some pleasure in being a sacrifice for their use  well sir these matters took their natural course i began to think people asked for their money more frequently than they were wont  i was pestered with duns  i practiced all the low arts and contrivances to silence their importunities  my plate and silks often visited the pawnbrokers and sometimes i was privately arrested  my mind was on the rack i suffered the torments of the damned and all this for follies and imprudencies that in the highest enjoyment afforded but an insipid pleasure  good god what exquisite misery though my temper was soured my dearest girl bore my peevishness with a peculiar sweetness of manners  so far from reproaching my conduct she had laid down a rational plan for retrieving all  no doubt her trouble was great but it was internal and her delicate tender nature sunk under the weight and she  died in my arms  oh conyers  poor pense could utter no more for his heart swelled and the round drops chased one another down his manly cheeks  conyers was much in the same situation but at last he said from shakespeare thy heart is big get thee apart and weep passion i see is catching for my eyes seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine begin to water   they took two or three silent turns in the walks and in about a quarter of an hour pense had so much recovered as to be able to proceed  to the loss of my wife was added the infidelity of my servants which my carelessness made an easy matter  finding the impossibility of reestablishing my credit i secreted to the value of five hundred pounds and leaving my shop and effects to the mercy of my creditors took shelter in paris  i had but one comfort in all my misfortunes for i had no child to share the afflictions of a guilty father  in this city i have chiefly resided for fifteen years and get a seeming livelihood by lending money on pledges but the british minister is my principal support he has employed me on many occasions and to give him intelligence of every occurrence these ten years past four years ago i went to london on his affairs where i met those two worthy gentlemen fanfaron and maquereau  the french look on me as one of themselves  i live quietly and as a gentleman and believe i am not suspected  conyers returned him many thanks for his candid relation and assured him of his inviolable  secrecy  they were now talking of indifferent matters when pense turned suddenly and said pray what is the motto to the order of the bath  conyers though surpised at the question answered tria juncta in uno  then replied pense observe those three gentlemen by yonder tree in such earnest conversation and then you will see the motto in reality  one continued he is an english nonjuring parson the other is a irish man of the society of jesus and the third is a scotch man of the episcopal church  those three and many others of the same stamp have pensions here and at different times reside in london and divert themselves and frighten the credulous people by numberless pamphlets and paragraphs in newspapers full of the decay of trade  the weakness and wickedness of the ministry be they whom it will  the danger of our liberties by pribery and corruption  the dreadful consequences of a standing army and many other popular subjects  the scotch man is a master of his trade and keeps up the credit of his books by very ingeniously answering them himself which furnishes him an opportunity of replying to himself  they really are men of learning and strong parts and meet with great encouragement from the enemies of england  i shall not said conyers interrupt their pious meditations for i am called to mr villeneuf who i fear waits for my appetite informs me it is near dinnertime  few ceremonies suffice amongst friends and they parted but promised to meet soon again  chap xix if dame partialty but holds the glass full sure in every virtue we surpass change but the mirror and let prudence speak well blush at error and our fond mistake anonimous for some time past mr villeneuf had frequently made conyers of his party and was not disgraced by his behavior this day a select company dined at an eminent citizens  cheerfulness and good humor added the true relish to the entertainment but when the servants were withdrawn the conversation fell on particular subjects  as no man said monsieur st martin can judge so impartially of his own country as a stranger of understanding i should be glad mr villeneuf would give us his opinion of france with freedom and his accustomed sincerity  many apologies were made and compliments returned till at last mr villeneuf consented provided that the question was fairly stated  i cannot suppose said he you mean to have my opinion on what regards state affairs  no no replied the other we only beg your thoughts of the people their politeness their manners their dress and their happiness or otherwise  tis a difficult task you have assigned me said villeneuf and will require your patience but as great and little  long and short  strong and weak are made such only by comparison i hope you will permit an alternate account of england under the several articles  the company approved of his method and he began  few people on earth are blessed with such a fund of spirits and natural gaiety of temper as the french and yet few nations are more crampt in the natural exercise of it they laugh they sing they dance and seem content the public are constantly supplied with amusements and policy has so contrived as to make glory and war be thought a rational recreation all are disregarded but those who serve the king in his troops his majestys name is never mentioned but with the profoundest respect we never see his portrait hung out as a sign in paris because it would be treating the monarch with too much freedom but the sign of the holy ghost and all the saints are dispersed through every street a king is always the head of the most childish games and at cards the best is honored with that title  such principles are propagated with great art and the religion of the country admitting auricular confession and absolution an absolute monarch can with ease direct the current of opinion  men of learning and judgment must go with the stream for it falls from too high a fountain to be resisted whatever their private sentiments may be besides two or three hundred thousand orators well armed will always carry demonstration and conviction in england where the constitution admits the full enjoyment of property and where property is proportionably divided amongst all the inhabitants one would imagine they should be more cheerful than the french but the fact is otherwise for this very property and the liberty of employing it has the contrary effect they have the blessing but a jealousy and the perpetual dread of losing it throws thorns on their pillows and like the miser they starve in the midst of plenty they employ watchmen for their security yet are in constant fear of being plundered by them  this is the rise of all the clamor against an handful of troops  the religion of england teaches duty and submission to the king and those in authority under him but some imagine that the liberty of england gives the people a right to abuse all not considering that by lessening and ridiculing the just power and authority of their governors they lessen their own weight and consequence in the world  france has propagated the notion of military honor to such a degree that they are become a nation of janisaries and perhaps must be treated as such  that is they must right or wrong be frequently employed commerce and traffic flourish in peace  riches and plenty learning and knowledge are the consequences as well as pride and luxury men naturally become fond of these sweets and will not quietly forego them they will find out their own strength and power they will expect a freedom of action as well as thought and absolute monarchy will fall before them  richelieu knew this  he broke and divided the power of the nobility not like henry the seventh of england amongst the people but added all to the dignity and power of the crown  mazarin did the same and louvois fouquet and colbert completed the project and the long reign and ambition of lewis confirmed it the king of great britain is the fountain of honor but the monarch of this kingdom is not only the fountain of real but the creator of imaginary honors a trivial cross dangling at a buttonhole gives a french gentleman such a spirit of honor as to entreat a general to permit him to mount a breach in england it must be a valuable consideration that can persuade most men even to do their duty  the fashions of the two nations are on different footings here in whatever manner the king or those about him are pleased to wear their swords or dress their hair it instantly becomes the practice of all paris every man from the duke to the porter has his hat cocked and his coat cut nearly in the same manner london affords more variety  there every man dresses according to his fancy some have coats below the knees and breeches down to the middle of the leg others mount their breeches to the thighs and raise their skirts to their waists some shopkeepers dress like privy counselors and some of high rank may be mistaken for coachmen  i am ignorant who had the honor of inventing weepers when in mourning but i think i may venture to affirm our manner of wearing them answers the end of ornament and keeps the shirt from being blackened by the coat to wear them on the top of the sleeve can answer no end  the english ladies rely on their native charms nor want the assistance of paint to heighten their complexions whether the french ladies really stand in need of art i know not but their conduct seems to imply it  whatever good sense the french are masters of this is certainly not the most glaring instance  in france politeness is not always good manners neither is the bluntness of an englishman always a mark of sincerity the lie is more frequently given in france than is generally imagined but the pardon that is begged and the excuse that is demanded je demand excuse pardonne moi softens the negative which with the addition of sundry significant gestures custom has made that genteel which frequently is the reverse  in england these customs are accounted superfluous and they deny or contradict in plain terms even without the assistance of the rude monosyllable  i have been often told i must own il faut avouer i confess i do not understand the phrase  if i must believe i am deprived of the liberty of thinking for myself and my arguments must cease when i am pinned down to the reasons of my antagonist in england the freedom of judging is held more sacred  the theaters of the two nations were different the tragedies and plays of the english shakespeare gave rise to those of france his imagination was not confined by the rules of aristotle as perhaps he thought he had as good a right to alter as the other had to make if the english by following new models are more regular in unity time and place i am sorry to say their fire is not so bright nor will their heat last so long  monsieur de voltaire and labbe le blanc take great pains to show the absurdity of some of our authors in transporting the audience to different kingdoms and continuing the scenes of one play for many years but they do not tell us that in tragedy or comedy where we are to suppose an easy natural conversation it is unnatural to make the parties speak in rhyme they insist that the action should be confined to twentyfour hours if so i apprehend it is unnatural to have it represented in three if twentyfour hours business can be shown in so short a time we may as well have twentyfour years  the abbe complains of our murdering on the stage and says that a man not understanding our language must take us for a barbarous people delighting in blood should a man not understanding french see the stage in tears and in the utmost agony of grief must he not wonder what has occasioned it the truth is neither of the stages are made for those who do not understand the language but i really think every stranger or frenchman of sense must be shocked at the unnatural absurd entertainment of a speaking harlequin with a patched coat and a black face  the english are full loose in their morals but i really think libertinism reigns here in a much higher degree the french have a way of varnishing their vices and making them more dangerous and catching than our awkward manner can arrive at  when an englishman swears by his maker it is shocking but when the french with eyes and hands lifted up cry out sacred god sacre dieu it is little regarded as it is the common expression of every ten minutes the french have another phrase which is but too commonly used even before ladies and what some ladies are as familiar with this phrase serves to show pleasure or anger according to the tone or manner of speaking  how often are the words foure fouu boure bousse pronounced in the politest assemblies and passed over as if no idea was annexed to them  i am ignorant of any rules that establish such indecencies except the strong law of a bad custom i am much pleased that voltaire and le blanc could not mark these amongst our other follies but they totally forget them when they mention their own the abbe very justly censures the looseness and ribaldry of some of our comedies but he omits to inform us that no nation excels france in the multitude of abomiable and filthy books  informers against the breach of the laws are absolutely necessary in every civilized government the informer when his motive springs from conscience and the good of his country is a most valuable subject and merits the regard of mankind but to be informed against and hurried to the bastile or banished in an instant by a letter de cachet without knowing the accuser or the crime may for aught i know be very good policy but i am sure it is not justice  in england let the motives of information be what they will the informer is not only not skreend and sheltered from his enemies but is given up to the reproach and invectives of an engragd populace laws are made and punishments assigned for transgressors but our vox populi decrees a severer treatment to the discoverer and saps the very foundation of laws  with regard to the happiness of the french or english no mortal can judge it must be left to their own decision that is each will give the preference to themselves for each have that natural prejudice and partiality to their own country that persuades them into an opinion of their peculiar felicity  did not mankind deceive themselves by imagining an ideal happiness they would be miserable in reality  deformed persons have generally a large share of vanity and selfopinion they are infinitely happy when their mirror discovers beauty and charms which the world do not find out such a conduct is justified by the wise scheme of providence as it gives ease and comfort to their lives which otherwise would be almost insupportable  perhaps the same argument may be applied to kingdoms  thus gentlemen i have given short hints of my private opinion taking things in a general light but i know there are many exceptions  the wise the good the honest of both nations have equal sentiments and speak one common language  both nations have their peculiar virtues as well as vices  in a word if the people of one were less a dupe to glory and arbitrary power and the other less a prey to extravagant liberty i apprehend both would have more content  but to be perfectly happy is not given to human nature  the company expressed much satisfaction at mr villeneufs discourse particularly at the manner he conducted it  at last one of the gentlemen said i know england and some of their laws i know the nature of their parliament and the power of the crown i know the vast benefit of their juries and the good effects of their habeas corpus act my knowledge but increases my astonishment that a people enjoying a liberty and freedom unknown to all other nations on earth should repine at their situation and take pains to imbitter the blessed waters of peace and plenty since all things as you say rise or fall by comparison what happiness would the english enjoy did they but turn their eyes on the miseries of other kingdoms as frenchmen replied another we ought not to be angry at their conduct for were they truly sensible of their happiness and all united to their real interest what power could stand before them no doubt our ministry know this too well to neglect any opportunity of dividing them nor is it a difficult task for the liberty of the country and the unbounded license of the press easily furnishes tools to work with  i am afraid sir said villeneuf your conjecture is but too well founded yet i must hope time will open our eyes not by supressing the press but by despising the invectives the slander and the vile insinuations it too frequently throws out  the conversation insensibly became more general and their different opinions were given with freedom and good humor conyers had his share and made himself very agreeable by sprightly and cheerful turns  come come said monsieur st martin talk as you will i think it is given up that we live with gaiety mirth and cheerfulness and that is living the want of this i believe is the reason that suicide and madness are much more common in england than in france  pray sir said conyers let me be permitted to take off a little of the imputation and account for the seeming difference from other reasons than what monsieur le blanc and other french authors have given  mankind continued conyers are pretty much the same in every clime our frantic disorders are conspicuous to the world  if france be equally liable to them the nature of their government casts a veil over the misfortune  with us if a poor wretch hangs or drowns himself the newswriters immediately give the circumstances and his name to the whole kingdom  such an affair in paris is seldom known beyond the district he lived in  as to madness we cannot insist on a parity in numbers  we have public and private madhouses in abundance and many unhappy creatures are exposed to public view  perhaps france has less need of these edifices when it is considered they have at least an hundred thousand of both sexes in monasteries and convents  as these seminaries take in the several degrees from the most austere to a life of easy inaction may we not naturally suppose that numbers of the inhabitants take shelter into those orders that have the nearest affinity to the degree of enthusiasm and madness with which they are possessed  of this the many thousand volumes of lives of saints many of whom never existed but in the brains of monks is a convincing proof  if we meet numbers in different habits walking the streets and seemingly exercising the function of right reason and understanding who can count those confined to their cells or to the limits of their garden i am not singular in my conjecture for the famous monsieur d aubigny about the year   00 writes this epigram  huguenots fascheux and austeres qui blamez tant les monasteres a la pareille dites nous ou len pourroit loger les fous illnatured calvinists who scold at monasteries and what they hold without their aid pray tell us plain where could we all the mad maintain the epigram furnished the company with a good deal of laughing chat though they did not deny but there was some truth in the question  time puts an end to all things as it did to this conversation  the usual compliments and bows being made on all sides each separated to their places of repose which affords me and my reader an opportunity of doing the like  chap xx what god alas will caution be for living mans security or will insure his vessel in this faithless sea where fortunes favors and her spite roll with alternate waves like day and night cowley next morning mr villeneuf found himself much out of order yet he could not avoid mentioning what with design he had omitted in the conversation of yesterday  god forbid said he that persecuting spirit should ever prevail in england yet i should imagine selfpreservation ought at least to keep us upon our guard against the encroachments of popery for though we are not their enemies because they are papists yet they are certainly ours because we are protestants  we suffer them in england to purchase estates and the influence property carries with it is sometimes too visible  they are likewise permitted to sell their estates but the hugonots in france may purchase but cannot sell  we allow our subjects to attend the romish chapels of foreign ministers but what frenchman dare visit our ambassadors chapel at paris  without forcing the consciences of men i think we might and ought to take some example from our neighbors  sending protestant youths of both sexes to be educated in the colleges of jesuits or in the convents of nuns is such a monstrous such an absurd practice that as no name can be given so no punishment can be equal to the crime  this sir replied conyers has often surprised me but there is another matter equally astonishing  i know what was formerly understood by a nonjuror i know that a scrupulous conscience might refuse the oaths to king william when he had before taken them to king james but i cannot conceive what a nonjuror is in these days  and you will said villeneuf be more amazed when i tell you he is one of those rank weeds that the best land is most subject to a nonjuror is a person that avails himself of that liberty and constitution of england which his principles and the study of his whole life labors to destroy  he denies the validity of the foundation of our laws  he calls himself a protestant and yet acts on popish tenets  how it is possible such a being can be suffered in our state is past my comprehension  if he refuses the oath of allegiance which i wish was more frequently tendered what security has the government for his conduct and ought he not to be expelled a society to which he avows himself an enemy  if he must be resident why is he not served like the jews in germany and obliged to wear a badge of distinction  on this subject mr villeneuf gave many hints but conyers prevented his enlarging too much and as he saw his countenance frequently change he persuaded him to lie down  all the morning he complained of a violent headache and pain in the back  all precautions were taken and the best physicians employed but all proved ineffectual for this good this valuable young gentleman died the fourteenth day  poor conyers was in the utmost affliction for he lost his brother his friend his master and his whole support  for some time he was not able to attend his own interest but the good nature of mr pense shared his sorrows and directed his conduct  by the will of mr villeneuf he found himself possessed of sixty pounds with all the books and wearing apparel he had in france pense advised the selling the books and all the clothes except the shirts which done he had about one hundred and fifty pounds to begin a new life  pense knew perfectly his situation and many projects were thought on to put this sum to a proper use but as neither of them could contrive how he might live on it they passed them over without fixing but pense promised to think for him  whilst their imaginations were busily employed in forming plans for his future conduct an accident happened which i am almost ashamed to mention i once intended to have suppressed this accident but my strict adherence to truth obliges me though with reluctance to make it a part of this history besides as all the memoirs and papers that served in compiling this great work are now deposited in the cotton library for the perusal of the curious and to vouch the authenticity and impartiality of this performance with what face could i omit or gloss over a material circumstance and make my veracity doubtful to the public if some have taken a contrary method i am determined to keep mine integrity  conyers did not always dine at the same hotel for different companies afforded him different remarks at one of these ordinaries he had made a sort of acquaintance with a genteel young man of about his own age without inquiring into his character the conversation happened to turn on the folly and absurdity of gaming and this gentleman laid open the subject and the schemes of sharpers in so clear and convincing a manner that charmed conyers  after dinner they took a walk together and renewed the subject  few men said the stranger understand play better than i formerly i was a bubble to it but when i became a master and might have won back the money i had lost though i dont much want it my friends and relations got round me and obliged me to renounce gaming for myself i now assist some friends and but last night i won two hundred pieces for the gentleman in blue with gold brandenburghs that dined with us this i frequently do and am of use to some honest fellows  i should imagine said conyers that a man who constantly plays must sometimes be liable to quarrels disputes and many other difficulties  i grant you replied the gentleman such affairs happen in poor low company but the assemblies i frequent are composed but of people of rank and fortune most of them incog so no one takes notice or seems to know another but all are on the same footing  our hero listened with great attention and by his many questions seemed desirous to venture a small matter which perchance might double his fund the two hundred pieces won last night ran strangely in his head and his imagination put him already in possession of such a sum like a fish he went round and round and often nibled at the bait till at length his eager desires surmounted his fears and he swallowed the hook  when conyers proposed visiting the temple of fortune the other made some few difficulties but was at last prevailed on to lend him his skill in pursuance to the plan of operation conyers gave him forty louis and put twenty more into his own pocket it was too soon to begin the project and to divert the time and raise their spirits the gentleman proposed a bottle of champaign they finished two and conyers found himself extremely elate and prognosticated vast good fortune he was like alnaschar the famous glass man for he had raised his thoughts and built the edifice of grandeur but others had the honor of kicking it all down  they arrived at the temple where the priests were assembled and very earnest at their devotions  conyers was fixed at a table with good company where he won and lost but much wondered his friend did not appear and assist him he grew a little uneasy but when he inquired the gentleman was not to be found neither did any one know his name conyers was unwilling to suspect him and pursued his fortune singly  as no man knows his own courage till he is tried so conyers knew not his passion for play until he was at a gaming table  his twenty pieces being near expired he ventured to ask if any gentleman would give him credit till next morning in case he lost with great politeness they all agreed there was no difficulty in confiding in a gentleman of his appearance  the play continued and the dice flew about with the usual vehemence  the fickle goddess held the changing balance and joyd to see such true such fervent zeal in all her votaries  the rites and ceremonies being finished conyers began to examine the mythology he now discovered that the doctrine was extremely erroneous for he had not only lost all his ready money but was indebted above fifty louis dors  the small remains of the night was not employed in the most agreeable reflections neither was the morning ushered in with happier thoughts for the crime of last night stard him full in the face in the shape of three gentlemen with demands of money whilst employed in discharging these debts of honor mr pense entered which put him in the utmost confusion pense began to imagine that his friend had taken up the business of lending money on pledges but a little of their conversation soon convinced him of his error  when the three gentlemen had retired our friends stood silent and gazed on each other for some time  well sir said pense i find the prudent the wise the sagacious mr conyers is beholden to sharpers for making his fortune and giving him experience  conyers blushed and with some hesitation told his melancholy tale but concluded with heartily cursing the falsehood of the french  very fine cried pense very fine indeed you have been bubbled by pickpockets and you damn a whole nation but the truth is you ought to quarrel with your own folly and imprudence and i hope you will so effectually do it as for ever to banish them your company  gaming continued pense is the most ruinous of all vices it is   as an historian i must be extremely angry with one henry fielding who has wrote the memoirs of a profligate fellow whom he calls tom jones  this man has done me great injury and i am apt to believe has seen the materials of this history for in one of his volumes he has not only copied the very long discourse mr pense made on gaming but has raked together all that the wisest have said or could say on that subject so that he has very unfairly deprived me of the benefit of a dozen or twenty pages which i must strike out or be thought a plagiary  this is not the only place where the said fielding has curtailed my reputation and crampt my genius  without saying more on this barbarous and ungentlemanlike usage i must insist that the good natured public will believe i should have had more reflections and have been as fertile in wit and humor as the said fielding had he not cruelly and enviously forestalled my invention  conyers was all attention to mr penses harangue and most faithfully promised to shun temptation and avaricious thoughts  the mischief is done said pense so i shall upbraid no more i had a scheme for your service but doubt your consenting to it i shall not flatter you for why should the poor be flattered but what i have to say is my sincere opinion  you are continued he a very handsome genteel young fellow you have learning and understanding you have cultivated your talents by the additions of polite accomplishments and the excellency of your voice and your good nature make you beloved by all my dear conyers it is no crime to be conscious of our perfections the folly lies in being vain of or overrating them  with your endowments and a prudent management you may make your fortune and be happy  a man must stoop before we can justly say he rises in a word i wish you would act the part of a servant  you will be maintained and clothed by your address i know you will acquire esteem and as there are secrets in all families no doubt but some may pass through your hands out of these and sundry accidents that unavoidably happen you may scheme some civil employ and establish yourself in the world as many worthy men have done not blessed with half your capacity  jack listened but made no reply  there is said pense another argument in favor of my project and a strong one for i do not see what else you can do  this last reason got the better of pride and conyers consented  now said his friend to convince you i have had you in my thoughts i can promise you a service with an english lord now returning to london he is rich extremely good humored but not the brightest genius in the world  he keeps an english wench  i need not desire you to endeavor to have her favor  at dinner they met again when pense informed him that my lord weakhead with pleasure consented as he wanted one to take care of his wardrobe and write his letters  i would not continued he have you always fixed to a particular service or family for except your judgment shows you a probability of succeeding in your chief design shift about and try another soil but be sure to take care of the little money you have left lest you should be too long unemployd  next morning they waited on lord weakhead who would not agree until his dulcinea had approved in some time the lady made her appearance and was so good to say she believed the fellow would do well enough his lordship told conyers the duty he expected from him and the lady added some for herself  he was to have thirty pounds a year and some perquisites to enable him to be decent  in three days they set out for england  the friends parted with great regret and took a most tender adieu pense gave a hint that in all likelihood a war would soon break out and begged of conyers never to write to him  chap xxi  fie fie upon her there is language in her eye her cheek her lip nay her foot speaks her wanton spirits look out at every joint and motion of her body oh these encounterers so glib of tongue they give a coasting welcome ere it comes and wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts to every ticklish redder set them down for sluttish spoils of opportunity and daughters of the game shakespeares troilus and cressida jack was soon settled in a familyway in london but found a mighty difference between his last and present master my lord had a fine house and a number of servants were maintained at a vast expense yet the whole was conducted in so slovenly a manner that nothing was in order and something was always wanting to complete the intended elegance  madam haughty ruled all and governed with a power as uncontrolled as it was extensive she frequently schooled his lordship in such terms that made conyers conceive an utter aversion for her some times she had violent fits of jealousy and on those occasions my lord was never permitted to approach neither could any rhetoric except that of a purse persuade her into any tolerable temper  her male acquaintances were singers fiddlers young fops and a couple of wornout sharpers her female friends were milliners mantuamakers of small repute and some nymphs of her own order for these a plentiful table was kept and the incense of praise was constantly perfuming on the altars of the goddess haughty though the house was perpetually crowded yet properly speaking lord weakhead saw no company  madam haughty had a strong levee almost every morning and because she had been in france and heard something of the conduct of their ladies of quality she frequently received their visits in bed conyers always made the tea and with a footman attended the duty of the table one morning when the company were pretty numerous jack was busy employed in this office but happening to go into the ladys dressing room he found a bottle with a label on which was wrote mouth water and as his gums were swelled with a cold he innocently used this water as a gargle whilst he was filling out the tea his lips shrunk up and his mouth almost closed the company could not forbear smiling at the oddity of his face which was quite distorted madam at last perceived the queerness of his phiz and with a laugh asked him what was the matter when he attempted to answer his whole face was in convulsions but as he could not articulate a word he ran to the dressing room and produced the bottle haughty burst into a violent laugh and whispered a lady near her who communicated the secret to a third and in a moment all present were in the utmost mirth and a thousand witticisms were thrown out till conyers was obliged to quit his station and seek refuge in his chamber where with patience and warm water he brought his features to their accustomed regularity but it was not till some years after he found out what had occasioned his disorder and the immoderate banter he suffered  mrs haughty carried her ridicule so far that it raised his resentment and determined him to watch her motions more narrowly in the mean time he could not avoid making some serious reflections on the conduct and situation of lord weakhead he thought that the life of a man of quality was to be employed in showing good examples to the world and with some sighs compared the behavior of his present master to that of lord true good  he was surpised how a peer could run from the dignity his ancestors had purchased and act below the character of the meanest mechanic he was astonished that a nobleman who might almost command the best society and a lady of the first family where good sense and honor would grace his table should renounce these rational comforts and amuse himself with the dregs of mankind and a woman of a most abandoned life he was at last convinced that his poor lord had all the plagues the worst wife could give without any one of those pleasures she might sometimes bestow  this lady has discovered that delicacy and tenderness were not the charms most admired by my lord in a mistress but that his constitution was to be governed only by absolute power the more she seemed to hate and despise him the fonder he grew her insolent security was such that she scarcely made a secret of her infidelity so that conyers caught her one morning beating time to the music of a dirty fiddler she colored a little at being so fairly discovered but with a matchless assurance proposed his taking a part in the concert conyers with a smile of disdain answered he had too good a taste to be charmed with a common vulgar ballad her rage is not to be expressed she swore like an old dragoon and in this temper he quitted her in contempt  amongst the many who paid court to my lord and madam haughty mr sangfroid a young surgeon of french extraction was pretty constant he had a particular regard for conyers and was the only person who found out his value and merit sangfroid was a man of sense and whose conversation was seriously diverting and his speaking french extremely well made conyers fond of being often with him to this gentleman he told his story and begged his advice i see said sangfroid you are not perfectly acquainted with this part of the world i have sometimes interfered between a gentleman and his wife and have made up mighty quarrels occasioned by lapdogs parrots and the like but i never meddle between a gentleman and his mistress it is of too sacred and delicate a nature neither can my probe search to the bottom of the wound and as i perceive that a mortification must of necessity ensue why should i give my patient unnecessary pain however continued he dont repine at being dismissed this service but live with me until i can provide you another conyers returned him many thanks and that evening accepted his kind invitation for my lord very gravely paid him three months wages and gave him a discharge  mr sangfroid received him with great kindness and apologizd for not having it in his power to be more constantly with him but he never failed at dinner and seldom in the evenings in these conversations conyers took care to ingratiate himself with his new friend and displayed his learning and accomplishments in so agreeable a manner as not a little surprised the surgeon who confessed he merited an happier fate but continued he it shall not be my fault if something dont turn out to your advantage  conyers passed his time in a very satisfactory manner for sangfroid entertained him with histories of sundry families but with such humor as created abundance of mirth and most useful observations which last jack constantly added to his collection  chap xxii hail thou who never as yet was sung by any bard or old or young enchanting riot god of drink whatever ancient poets think thou to the world chief foe or friend making some mount and some descend inspire my verse anonimous one evening our friends had agreed to go to a favorite play where mr sangfroid met several of his acquaintance i see said he to conyers a knot of choice spirits in the third row should they ask me to a tavern i must desire your company for though it will be time thrown away it will not be lost i cannot replied conyers rightly understand your distinction but command me that young gentleman continued the surgeon in a white fustian frock and checkered flannel waistcoat with the hat of a stage coachman is sir nicholas royster of yorkshire who inherits good four thousand pounds a year he is not yet of age but borrows money enough by insuring his life that elderly youth just by him with a red face is squire morise formerly of high hall in gloucestershire that fine seat and fifteen hundred a year round it has been long purchased by mr punctual a banker in the strand on which the squire has two hundred a year liferent that genteel young man on the other side is one mr fitzsimons of ireland where i imagine he has a good fortune for he is extremely generous he has chambers in the middle temple and for these three years has studied very closely a little beyond him you see a portly fierce gentleman in scarlet with a point d espagne hat so cocked that it frights the orange wenches he is called major noisy and i have been told was formerly a lieutenant in the army but was obliged to sell out and retire on ensigns halfpay but the knight is his friend  i think said conyers you apply the word fierce to the major now as i apprehend it is derived from the french word fire which means proud and saucy i beg you will give him some other epithet for i observe he is extremely familiar with the orange ladies who seem to attack him with equal freedom  your observation said sangfroid i believe is right but really the major is far from being proud but how fire may answer to saucy i hope to convince you however they are all my friends and customers and the plague of my profession is i must not only keep them company but agree to every thing they say when in company  the play was scarcely finished when the major gave a loud hem and having fixed sangfroids eyes called out  the kings arms and received a nod of consent  sir nicholas and his company got first to the tavern having picked up two special city sparks when mr sangfroid and conyers arrived they found the major and the rest very loud at the larder with great difficulty supper was ordered and the master mr ryan conducted them into the rose  as an historian i am compelled to attend but courteous reader if you are not charmed with discord of harsh sounds  if a tavern scene delights not thy heart or if thou find thyself not disposed for a conversation with such company go not thou in with me but pass on to some other part of this delectable history  the instant the major entered the rose he cried out z  ns what a room has the rascal put us into  here  you son of a w  re show us into the rummer this smokes like hell  ryan was all obedience and as he conducted them back the knight could not avoid saying ay ay let the old soldier alone d  me he will keep em all in order  the usual salutations began and mr sangfroid introduced conyers to each by their titles  sir said the major give me your hand d  n all these compliments you seem sir to be a gentleman and a man of honor and d  me but we are all obliged to young bolus for your company  conyers just began to return the compliment but the major interrupted him saying  sir you are a very pretty sensible gentleman and ringing the bell as loud as he could well take a hearty bottle together and know me for your friend  here  you ostler  d  me where is the wine  please your honor said the waiter the wine your honor always chooses is on the table  dye prate puppy said he to kennel down this instant  avaunt  the waiter retired with a smile and then he began come boys  come lads sit down and be d  d and take your wine in peace and quietness  the company were moving to their places when mr morise opened with an hoarse voice  d  n that old firelock what a clatter he makes curse him he will never be a conjurer for he want born dumb  this witty stroke occasioned a prodigious laugh which lasted with many additions till all had taken their seats  i hope it will not be expected i should set down minutely and in order every single word and repartee during the first half hours conversation the task would be too arduous even for the renowned author of pamela and clarissa whose patience nothing could equal except that of his readers old bunyan would have been at a loss and the celebrated mr cleveland would have found it impossible how therefore can i a weak ignorant modern pretend to attempt what such vast geniuses must have omitted all i am able to do is to beg the learned reader to supply my defects by imagining or if he can writing about thirty pages of the most fashionable oaths and refined bawdy jokes his wit can put together should his thoughts not be sufficiently elevated for so sublime a subject let him take the memoirs of a lady of pleasure whose author as he undoubtedly merits certainly ought to be preferred to the highest post on hounslow or some other convenient heath  whilst the supper was laying mr sangfroid whispered his friend that sir nicholas had pawned his honor they would have no whores in company that night for i hope added the surgeon to amuse you in a better manner  supper over they had just set down to fresh bottles when mr ryan entered please your honors said he here is the gazette and great news in it will your honor giving it to the major be pleased to read it for it is bespoke in the next room  i read it cried the major no not i by g  read it yourself and be d  d  ryan began and read of a powerful squadron fitted out at breast and that forty thousand french had orders to march to germany and the like number to the frontiers of flanders that the queen of hungary was levying a large army in bohemia which would be ready to take the field early in the spring  he was proceeding when the major jumped up drew his sword and slapping it on the table now cried he we shall have a war d  n my blood but we shall now the scoundrels will court me to show them the way to flanders and the prig officers who will hardly give me a bow shall come cap in hand for they cannot make me less than a lieutenant colonel z  ds how i long to be at it and then sir nicholas d  me sir nicholas but you shall go with me and be my ensign and fight by my side d  me if you shall not  not so fast said the knight for d  me if i do no no i know a trick worth two of that for as the gentleman said to night in the play i have four thousand a year of as good fighting land as any in europe so i suppose if we have a war i shall pay my club and you and your honor and glory may go fight and be d  d for sir nicholas then cried the hero stay at home and be d  d and mind your hounds and your horses z  ds when i was of your age  why said sangfroid when you were of sir nicholass age what mighty matters did your honor do come tell us my dear man of war  i was said the major the eighth son of fourteen for we were always a fine bucking family my father justice noisy it is well known had two thousand a year in cornwall and gave his children as much learning as they would take your latin and greek was not my turn and the fool my master floggd me damnably before he found it out which happened by an odd accident for when i was about fifteen the son of a b  h was at his old tricks with his birch but d  me if i didnt take him such a knock over the noddle with the poker that down dropped old ars in present and the best of the joke was that the scoundrel was a parson the old justice laughed heartily and praised my spirit so i thought i had him on i wanted d  ly to get to london but my chap was as close fisted as the devil and not a stiver would he part with to buy me a commission which was all my pride the old fool at last married a young b  h for love and used me like a dog d  me thought i but i will be revenged and you will split your sides with laughing when i tell you how i contrived it  d  n my blood if i didnt make love to my mother and fairly cuckold old squaretoes bravo bravo cried sir nicholas and bravo cried all the rest well said sangfroid so when you had cuckold your father you  z  ns mr purge cried the major sure i can tell my own story  why when i had done him that jobb d  me thought i but i will do you another so one morning i made free with a purse of fifty guineas and as the devil would have it the same day he found madam and i fairly planting his horns  z  ns how he stared and swore and raged like any freeman in bedlam i walked off my dears and left him that bone to pick the best way he could  well as i was saying i walked off and took the road to london as i had money in my purse i thought i had all the world in a string in a week i got acquainted with some fine ladies and very fond of me they were for d  me but i was as fine a lad as ever trod the ground and five foot seven in my stocking feet the dear b  hes soon made me known to some gentlemen of quality so that in about a month i knew drury lane and london as well as if i had been bred and born in it but d  me if i know to this day how it was but in six weeks i would but a single guinea left  now some lads would have sniveld and cried and begged pardon and so forth not me by g  d i kept up my heart like a man and as i could not purchase a red rag i bravely resolved to earn one with my sword so i went to the parade and took on in the first regiment of guards  the company greatly applauded his courage and resolution and he proceeded  a trifle a trifle gentlemen boys of spirit will always sooner or later strike out their own fortunes  well this was in the year      which all the world knows was about the middle of that red hot war  to cut short my story we landed near lisle which my glorious master the duke of marlborough was besieging and the same day i begged to mount the trenches  hot work hot work my boys for there was we exposed on the top of a ditch to the fire of the enemy for four hours endways  come gentlemen drink about sorrow is dry and d  me but i am choking with thirst  they drank but whilst the knight and mr morise were asking some particulars of the siege conyers found time to say to his friend  this fellow was never an officer and i verily believe was never in any army except as a sutlers servant  just then the majors voice was distinct  lord lord said he why there it is people that stay at home and see nothing must have strange notions to be sure it is terrible enough at first d  me if it is not but when a man is used to it for four or five campaigns as i was it is a mere fleabite  well as i was saying having cut a passage through the covered way and with fixed bayonets mastered the half moon of the first and second parapets and a breach being made in the glacis by our engineers i boldly mounted and the whole army following the poor devils of french surrendered the town  the gazette did me justice and the noble general made me an ensign at blenheim the next campaign i did my duty got a few wounds and a company and the same year a majority  you know the rest my old dad kicked up and like an unnatural son of a whore as he was left me a shilling a d  d peace being made and a boy put over my head i quitted the service and have been on halfpay ever since but now  d  n my blood they shall beg and pray before they catch me in flanders  so drink about my boys i am alive d  me  the bottle and wit went briskly round till sangfroid clapping sir nicholas on the shoulder there said he there is a fellow of mettle i think i see him routing a whole french army i wish he would write his memoirs they would sell d  d well what would you give sir knight to be able to say as much as the major  give replied sir nicholas d  me i would not give sixpence to be sure the fellow may have seen more for he is old enough to be my grandfather but d  n my blood i have done as much for my time as any he in christendom  impossible impossible said sangfroid  judgment judgment cried the knight and in a quarter of an hour silence was proclaimed and he began  why lookee gentlemen i was but nineteen as i may say last grass my good father sir joseph and my lady mother were very tender of my youth and gave me all the education a gentleman of my fortune required at ten years old i could read  no body better  and the same year i rode one of my fathers horses poor merry pintle and won the sweep stakes at wakefield races d  me if i didnt  z  ns i thought the old gentleman would have leapt out ofs skin for joy  next day my bucks i ran old sly boots against squire masons bay mare miss slammekin a bye match for fifty guineas weight for inches honest slyboots had well nigh distancd the mare when he lost all four and canted me twenty yards over his head there i lay and was taken up for dead though i only broke my left arm and two of my ribs  no more by g  when i recovered of my wounds all my friends said that young nick was fairly entered  come bucks drink about  well next year d  me if i didnt outride our huntsman in a fox chase and made him hellishly jealous but in leaping a double ditch i got a tumble and my head fell foul of a d  d stump of a tree and laid it open see gentlemen see pulling off a little black wig here it is you may put your fingers in it but d  me i soon horsed for all that and called out jowler  ringwood  ho  then he displayed all the eloquence of field language and the company joining in the cry the guardian of the night forgot the hour and imagined himself in epping forest  at length sir nicholas found time to proceed  all the tenants was cock sure i would be a clever fellow but when i began to kill their dogs and break their nets the scoundrels complained to sir joseph and my good lady mother gave me a swinging lecture about good nature and humanity and such stuff but when i was sixteen i showed them other game for d  me if i didnt get their daughters with child by dozens and at last i tipped the same favor to her ladyships maid sir joseph cursed and swore and my lady cried and prayed like hell and the devil but what did i care  i knew they could not swear or pray me out of the estate do their worst so because they would not let me take my swing at home i touched the steward for a brace of hundreds and wished em all a good night  my dear father at last relented his hard usage of me and about four months ago he took a leap in the dark to kingdom come and so i am in mourning for him as you see  a loud laugh ensued and the bottle took its course and then he continued  my guardians for i have enough of em will not allow me to live like a gentleman but d  me they are bit i will not starve in a cooks shop not i for my bucks here i am safe and by the help of my friend yonder pretty sound now gentlemen i think i have been in more dangers than if i had fought twenty battles in flanders and d  me i will lay fifty guineas i have more wounds than his honor the major  every body agreed and poor noisy stood a whole volly of wit  truce boys truce cried the major why what the devil all upon roger  fitzsimons do dear rogue tell us some of your foolish exploits and keep sir nicholas in countenance  id do as much for you said fitzsimons with all my heart but it seems you have no occasion for the devil himself cannot put you out of countenance  this increased the laugh till sangfroid cried out well gentlemen i must own the major has said a good thing once in his life and i second the motion to order gentlemen to order mr fitzsimons is up  hear him hear him  all the cry now was hear him so fitzsimons was obliged to comply and he began  my history gentlemen is very short  my family is pretty considerable in ireland where my father kept a good house and lived in the true old hospitable manner but still gave his five sons such accomplishments as the country afforded we knew latin and greek but dancing and fencing much better at last the good man died and i as his eldest son took possession of the estate charged with my mothers jointure and portions for younger children to do the best i could for a large family i entered the temple and stinted myself to one hundred pounds a year i have many relations in london and some of fashion who introduced me into the politest company of both sexes where i soon found i had a genius for play and improved my talent  but gentlemen the ladies the ladies are kind for i court them in such a manner that few can withstand my rhetoric  z  ns cried the knight i would give a thousand pounds for that secret  you may have it much cheaper replied fitzsimons for when i am with a lady i like or whose eyes speak a certain language i watch the first opportunity and usher the new acquaintance etc d  me cried the major if i know what you mean i know well enough a man may be ushered to the kings bench or the poultry or the round house and the like where a man may make new acquaintances enough but d  me if ever i heard of ushering a new acquaintance to a lady but by a pimp  why you old b  h cried sir nicholas dont you know that new acquaintances are new guineas and that little fitz slily tipped the lady half a score  d  me after all it is the only best argument in the world  right right sir nicholas said the surgeon before gad you have hit it  the knight is so sharp said fitzsimons there is no hiding things from him  if the lady accepts my little rouleau i am sure of her immediately if she refuses and afterward permits my visits i try her again and seldom have occasion to repeat the dose from this i have the advantage of being of her family as often as i please and if it increases not my revenue it at least prevents a decrease by another channel  this gentlemen is my amusement but my grand resources are the chocolate houses  when salkeild and cook and ventris and littleton begin to grow dry and stupid i turn about and converse with my good friend monsieur de moivre on the doctrines of chances  perhaps said mr morise that same mr de  what do you call him may be a pretty fellow i dont know him but for salkeild and the rest i have seen em drunk and sober enough and by the l  d they are stupid mortals  that may be said the major for d  me if i know any of em but dear morise not to interrupt you i have often heard some of your tiptop people say that your littleton is a d  d clever fellow  but i beg pardon and my dear fitz dont let us talk of religion d  n your doctrine and finish your story  with all my heart said fitzsimons for two words will do it  in short gentlemen i am master at piquet and could teach whist to mr hoyle i care not how the world goes for one lord pays for my chariot another keeps my servants and horses and many of different titles contribute to my familyexpences  thus gentlemen i live and live well though the good old gentlewoman keeps her jointure  z  ns cried sir nicholas youre a happy fellow but i am the most unlucky dog in the world  there is my mother now  d  me she has no more nature in her than a stone for if she loved her only child or my poor defunct father to be sure she would have contrived some way or other to have paid him a visit by this time  but no matter for whether her jointure falls in or not by g  i am determined next bout to be knight of the shire if it costs me twenty thousand pounds  the highest encomiums were ready to fall on sir nicholas when mr morise rose in an extacy crying out d  me i must kiss the dear boy  do dear sir nick stand for the county and here i am that will support you with all my interest and be your manager for by the l  d no man in europe understands that matter better  i thought said mr sangfroid your estate lay in another county  you thought replied morise psha d  it why man all the world knows i have stood for twenty boroughs and counties and was a member too in the queens time but that d  d new ministry threw me out and i have been fighting them ever since but next p  t i think i have a borough pretty sure  ay ay master morise said the major let it alone till then and then you may think on it for that will be your share  why you dirty scoundrel cried morise do you upbraid me in my misfortunes that has kept you from starving  patience good mr morise said the major starving ay ay d  me if you kept me like yourself i should starve indeed  morise lost all temper and whilst he discharged a thousand hard names and not a few glasses on the major the warrior practiced his own lesson of patience and received them with great meekness still crying out  mr morise mr morise  dont rouse the angry lion  morise drew his sword but some held him and some the major whose sword by this time was unsheathed  the storm was violent the majors voice was thunder and morises the echo to it  mr ryan and the waiters entered which added not a little to the harmony  now might be heard oaths imprecations prayers and entreaties rushing instantly out but no mortal could distinguish or assign a reason  at last the noise of war seemed to subside and gentle peace began to spread her pinions the mangled limbs of slaughtered bottles and glasses were decently interred and the purple stream that covered half the plain was now swallowed up by the neighboring sands all preliminaries being adjusted tranquillity was proclaimed and three bottles called for to sacrifice to love and friendship  bumpers went briskly round and their zeal was so fervent to establish a right understanding that some of the company began to lose their own  z  ns cried the knight what fools were we to quarrel amongst ourselves when the common enemy is at hand  d  me my bucks let us sally forth and beat the watch  glorious thought said the major and let us beat up the bawdyhouses  im with you cried morise by the l  d it is the most finest fun in the universe  to pay  a bill this instant and let us to business  all seemed to join and whilst the bill was preparing sir nicholas settled the operations  the reckoning was three pounds eighteen shillings and each man put his hand to his pocket  the major laughed and swearing he had changed his breeches that morning and forgot to shift his money added it is no great matter for my servant is an honest fellow however sir nick tip me a guinea till i see you next  the knight readily complied and mr conyers saying it is just our half guineas apiece threw one on the table  morise whispered somewhat to sir nicholas who immediately cried out z  ns that is true d  my b  d if the gentleman pays a farthing in my company  conyers begged to be excused but the other insisting on paying the whole threw four guineas to the waiter mr morise took the half guinea entreating mr conyers to put it up which he peremptorily refusing well said morise it is only so much the more for the waiter however in a mistake he slipped it into his own pocket  twas past three oclock and the quiet of the neighborhood was to be invaded the company in the street each encouraging the other in the expedition  but my duty calls me another way for mr conyers took the first chair and got safe to his lodgings without sharing in the honors or danegrs of this glorious action and his friend very soon followed his example  chap xxiii o that i had my innocence again my untouched honor but i wish in vain the fleece that has been by the dyer stained never again its native whiteness gained waller sangfroid was roused about six that morning by a thundering rap at the door at ten he returned and gave conyers the sequel to the evenings entertainment  there has been fine work said he and our heroes have furnished me employment it seems they began their attack on the watchmen a little too precipitately so were instantly outnumberd the battle lasted but a short time and in the hurry the major and mr morise got off to a bagnio but most miserably cut in the head and face  the valor of the young knight not permitting him the proper use of his legs he was taken prisoner and conducted to the citadel of the parish vulgarly termed the roundhouse he is tolerably bruised and has another honorable mark planted just over his eye some of the watch are slightly injured but as they will make the most of it this affair perhaps may be made up at the trivial expense of an hundred guineas  but said conyers what became of the other gentleman for methinks mr fitzsimons is a man of more understanding than to embarque in such an exploit  he answered the surgeon slipped off with me and whispered he had no idea of fighting where nothing but the reverse of honor or credit could possibly be obtained  as for the city blades all i hear of them is that they played their parts very well for some time but had so much prudence as not to be taken  i am heartily glad said conyers that some have been properly punished for their conduct is so absurd that nothing can extenuate it but imagining them lunatic  in truth said sangfroid the watchmen treated them as such and blooded them severely  but what think you of their humor  humour replied conyers faith i find none but for ribaldry folly and nonsense i thank my stars i never heard nor saw more in my whole life i was quite silent and bore all their extravagancies with some patience except their horrid swearings which really made me shudder  and yet said his friend such is the general run of tavernconversation  i am sorry for it answered conyers but wonder what joy what pleasure men can take especially old ones in riot and excess company and too much wine may sometimes lead men into a thousand odd frolicks but a cool deliberate system of ignorance debauchery and impiety is what i can by no means account for dean swift indeed was not so much astonished at seeing men wicked as at their not being ashamed of it  that said sangfroid is really the most surprising circumstance but of our companions i can only say as killigrew did of lord wharton they would not swear at that abominable rate if they thought they were doing god honor many observations passed till the surgeon told him they would dine tomorrow with a lady on the surry side where possibly he might be more happily and more agreeably entertained  next day they took boat the lady said sangfroid we are going to visit was formerly called polly gun but lately polly cannon and has been what the world calls one of us she has had her share of variety but managed so cleverly as to have an income of about two hundred pounds a year she is now about fortyfive years of age preserves a portion of beauty and has for these four last years retired from the town and lives a most regular and modest life she has been often in keeping but had always a settlement by way of lifeannuity i transact all her affairs and am on such a footing that i hope to persuade her to give you her history you will be pleased with her conversation for she is extremely wellbred and of a lively and cheerful turn  they rowed up the river about six miles conyers still enquiring into more particulars which furnished sangfroid with an opportunity of describing her person her economy her happiness and other articles till they landed a quarter of an hour brought them to her house it was small but most neatly furnished with a garden in nice order the first salutations over mrs cannon fell into the easy and familiar style she very agreeably rallied the magnificence of her palace the elegance of the apartments and the spaciousness of the saloon as she went through the few rooms she made very merry remarks  now gentlemen said she this is my bedchamber and contains somewhat scarcely to be found in any other  i must own madam said conyers i never saw so truly a clean neat and charming an apartment in my life but the bed strikes my imagination the most  what joy what content must repose and slumber find in it  oh very fine said she but though your guess is very true permit me to set you right in the main  this bed continued she i made myself and have for these four years constantly slept in it as happily as i wish or desire but few beds can boast like this of being never employed but merely to sleep in  sangfroid laughed and conyers smiled  you may laugh gentlemen said she yet faith it is fact  but now let us go to the library she then conducted them into a pretty contrived closet and showed about three hundred volumes of history poetry and books of divinity  i doubt not said she but some great personages may have a larger collection but perhaps they cannot say with me that they have read all theirs more than once over  yonder are the classicks in good english  you may examine them if you please for i assure you they are not in wood and designed for ornament only  conyers and the surgeon found something to say on every volume nor did she fail in very pertinent replies  she then led them to her garden  here said she is the fair flower in its luster what pity to crop its growing sweetness then cast it like a loathsome weed away  pity indeed madam said conyers but to transplant to cherish it in your fair garden where the sun always shines has been your careful employment but however to let it wither and perish on the stem without smelling its fragrancy is perhaps a crime almost as bad for my part i should enjoy its perfume and endeavor to keep it in constant blow  yes yes said she i never knew a young fellow that did not imagine he would make an excellent gardener  but here comes my maid and i prophecy dinner is ready  as they walked to the house the surgeon gave her a whisper  the repast was plain but so neat and enlivened by such good humor and cheerfulness that conyers declared he never had so high an entertainment  sangfroid put her in mind of the promise she made him  since said she your friend mr conyers is so curious i shall give him a history of which i make no great secret  the story of polly gun otherwise polly cannon who or what were my parents is of no consequence only i must say they were people of substance and reputation and most tenderly bred and educated me i grew up like other wenches and at fourteen the flattering world had talked me into beauty perhaps i really was so but am sure i thought it about this time one mr tarrier and his lady took a furnished house in our neighborhood the good gentlewoman was mighty religious and never failed at the parish church she took a great liking to my fathers pew and by many little civilities was much regarded by our family she invited us to supper and was invited in return in a word her conversation was so pious and godly and she inveighed so much against the wickedness and vices of the present age that my poor parents became so fond of and intimate with her that they entreated she would be so good to instruct their dear polly i own i was not much pleased with my tutoress for she constantly traild me to church twice a day my good mother thanked god she had found so good a friend but i soon discovered that madam tarrier was not so outrageously rigid as i expected for she sometimes persuaded them to permit me to a play the pious lady always chose a comedy and in some parts where i was ignorant of the joke she very kindly explained perhaps more than the author meant  in this manner we lived for about half a year and the good woman had got such an ascendancy over my mother that i believe she would have trusted me with her even to america she frequently took me to visit her uncle near grosvenorsquare he was a very polite rich old gentleman and so kind to me that i was always sure of some pretty present or a guinea or two to buy ribbands at one and the last of these visits madam tarrier took the opportunity of leaving me with her uncle that she might attend her devotions at a neighboring church i thought she staid a little too long and began to be impatient the old gentleman endeavored to pass away the time with a chat fitting my years but at last i could not refrain crying most bitterly  what need i amuse you with unnecessary particulars  the she devil had left me with an he one and i was undone  the first month of my confinement for i was constantly watched was dreadful to my imagination i most affectionately loved my father and mother and felt their sufferings at the loss of an only child i wept almost day and night but must say the old gentleman was extremely tender and fond and did all in his power to make my life easy he bought me books we read by turns and he gave me that sort of taste and relish for them which i now find of infinite use i played on the harpsichord and sung well but he had a master to perfect me and amuse my leisure hours i insensibly began to be better pleased with my station and in twelve months was quite reconciled to it  what an animal is man  as i grew happy and fond of the wretch his affections cooled and he entirely changed his conduct at last he upbraided me with infidelity which was impossible and proved his assertions by my injuring his health he stormed and flew into a violent passion and calling his man jenkins here said he take this fair lady get her a lodging and a surgeon which i shall pay but since she has found out a trade all she can expect of me is to set her up  without giving me time to reply he stepped into his chariot and vanished  i was struck dumb and though my heart was ready to burst no friendly tear assisted me poor jenkins was in great perplexity but one of the maids having packed up all my linen and clothes of which i had abundance and very fine he was obliged to execute the orders of his master and conducted me to the door where an hackney coach stood ready to receive me  as i was passing the hall i dont know what persuaded me to open the parlour door but what was my astonishment when i saw mrs tarrier and a charming young creature in close conversation  i stood motionless but in agony and with uplifted eyes i just uttered  infamous woman and fell in a swoon  the servants too charitably brought me to myself and jenkins rather carried than led me to the coach  when we got to the lodging he had provided for me i flew to the bed and abandoned myself to tears sighs and the most melancholy reflections  good god said i is there no law no justice for the injuries done me must i suffer in silence and must triumphant villainy go unpunished  is the nature of woman so hardened and the conscience of man so steeled as not to feel the utmost remorse for this worse than rape  bitter very bitter were my words and jenkins tried all means to assuage the violence of my passion at length i became more calm and he promised to wait on me in the morning the woman of the house obliged me to eat a little and was very civil and tender  next day jenkins came and brought a surgeon when alone he began to question and examine me in the delicate manner and then declared i was injured in a high degree  twould be tedious to mention all this affair let it suffice that i was perfectly recovered in two months  as i could not accuse myself of a real crime i resolved if possible to return to my parents not doubting but they would receive me and revenge my wrongs with proper caution i persuaded my landlady to make some enquiry after them but good heavens what were my sufferings whilst she gave me the following account  i have done madam said she what you have desired and find that the family i inquired after had a beautiful daughter who was stolen from them about a year ago by a bawd who as a neighbor got into their favor but decamped the moment she finished her horrid work the poor mother was so grieved at the loss of her child that she fell into a decay and died in half a year the father with difficulty got the better of his afflictions but sold all his effects and went abroad but where i could not learn i assure you madam that family are greatly pitied by all the neighbors  my situation is not to be described  now said i the worst has happened  my dear mother is dead  my father gone  and i must be abandoned to the fate of a prostitute  but what signifies what becomes of me  jenkins just then entered and after some chat told me my lodgings and surgeon were paid and now polly said he your old friend sends you these fifty guineas and advises you to take care of yourself  i took the money but vented on the old villain every name and every imprecation my rage could suggest  come come said jenkins of what use is all this you must now think of providing a maintenance and if you will be advised by me perhaps things may go better than you imagine you are certainly a fine girl and some gentlemen would think themselves happy in your acquaintance if you will give me leave i will engage you shall not want two or three very liberal friends  you understand me  i was really in such a temper of mind and thought my situation so desperate that i did not reflect on the misery i was going to plunge my self into but consented to be guided by him and fell into his project with a sort of stupidity that i never could account for  jenkins got me noble lodgings properly situated and gave me his instructions but like other dealers i gave him a sample of the goods he had the benefit of a subscriber for six copies by having the seventh gratis he was a notable broker and sent many good customers to my warehouse  in six months polly gun began to be famous and my lodgings were sometimes the scene of quarrels and noise especially at night in short disgraces had knocked too frequently at my door and the neighborhood obliged me to shift my quarters  in three years i believe i had thirty different apartments good and bad just as the balance of trade was for or against me it is an odd sort of fund for when stock was low i mounted to a second or third story when high i descended to the first floor i had not seen jenkins for some time so presume he was instructing other wenches whom his master had made as wretched as myself  by this time some of my clothes were worn out and many had visited the pawnbrokers  i was frequented but by lovers of the trifling order  i had not saved a shilling and wanted many necessaries in my profession besides being indebted a months lodging in this distress my maid persuaded me to be acquainted with the porters of two or three noted taverns  to these places i was frequently sent for and now took the name of polly cannon the novelty of my face my conversation which was always decent my voice and my youth and compexion furnished out a good or rather a bad livelihood the porters were fond to promote my interest as i greatly promoted theirs  these gentlemen always charged a shilling for my chair hire to the tavern and another if i returned alone to my lodgings though i was obliged to walk if i got a guinea their fee was a crown besides some other dues which i shall not mention in short these fellows make a vast income out of the industry of poor young ladies  even this sort of life at last failed me for my face grew too familiar which is an unpardonable crime amongst gentlemen and my biting the porters out of their just poundage and refusing some certain compliances which they regard as their prerogative they left me to pick my teeth in my chamber and never invited poor polly cannon to a good supper  i could not starve  with some interest i was inlisted under the banners of a famous lady near covent garden not to be too minute in my relation i shall only say i did tolerably well there for some time but a quarrel between one of the nymphs and i obliged me to shift the scene and make a piece of the furniture of a coffeehouse  as abandoned as i was i could never swear or drink the want of this last qualification made me soon discharged the mansions of drunkenness and threw me for subsistence into the arms of the public  why should i pretend to describe what no mortal can exactly do what joy can you receive in my speaking variety of wretchedness or in a tale whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul  cold famine and pestilence were my constant companions  i breathed but devoutly wished every moment might be my last row justly paints my misery  to know no thought of rest to have the mind still ministering fresh plagues as in a circle where one dishonor treads upon another what know the fiends beyond it heaven help the unhappy creatures groaning under this fatal necessity and forgive those who drove them to it  one night as i took my rounds i touched a young gentleman and in the usual phrase asked for a pint of wine he turned and by the assistance of a lamp examined me a little and consented  perhaps child said he you are more hungry than dry  on my telling him he guessed right he ordered a supper  our conversation became very diverting and he was so good to say i was much above the common he desired my story and i gave it him very naturally but concluded that as all poor girls were fertile in invention i much doubted if he credited my tale  he looked serious but from pitying he became amorous and pressed my going to a bagnio  wretched as i am sir said i i cannot do a wilful injury you are happy and in health but i am miserable every way  when he was convinced of the truth of what i said he took me in his arms and vowed he would never forget my generosity  take said he these five guineas and meet me tomorrow morning in somersetgardens  you may be sure i was punctual and indeed he was exact in fine he carried me to the house of a surgeon where i remained until his duty was over my friend whose name was loveit conducted me to a private family where in a short time with good living and tolerable content of mind i recovered my former spirits my complexion and every sign of youth for i was not yet quite oneandtwenty  if ever i loved a man it was this dear friend and he merited all my regard  with this gentleman i lived near three years and as happily as my situation could admit of i recovered my music and my taste in books and greatly improved in both  one morning at breakfast he walked about the room and seemed very pensive on my enquiring the cause he sat down by me and began thus  i hope my dear polly believes i love her as i ought but all things must have an end  dont be too much alarmed said he on seeing my my tears  i shall act with honor and to your satisfaction  in two words polly my friends and my real interest compel me to marry  be happy sir said i in the choice of a wife and may every blessing attend you  what remains for me but despair anxiety and madness  not so my dear polly cried he for i hope a better fate attends you here are one hundred guineas and this paper intitles you to an annuity of forty pounds a year be careful of these and be happy  his generosity charmed me and by degrees he calmed my troubled spirits and brought me to talk of parting with more coolness of temper than i possibly could have imagined  since we must separate said he take a little of my advice my cousin captain mizen of the superb man of war has seen and likes you as he knows all my affairs he begs to be admitted to your good graces the captain is an old bluff tar and though not very polite and tender yet he is an hearty honest fellow if you consent i will engage a settlement of thirty pounds besides your living as you have hitherto done  some conversation ensued and at last i accepted the proposal  the evening was ushered in by a visit from captain mizen who was introduced by mr loveit i received them with great respect and made many compliments for the praises bestowed on me by my friend  sblood said the captain what is all this jawing for i have done as coz desired and ohas the papers ins pocket now do you see an it be too little there is twenty pieces more to turn the scale  now mistress how say you shall we make the bargain and seal lips  loveit smiled but i was mute  well well said he silence gives consent so mistress by your leave  he kissed most furiously and then turning to loveit said  sblood coz she is a well built sloop and will carry a huge deal of cavas i am afraid i shall never be able to run her fairly down  we had much of this sort of conversation but mr loveit came to the point and his giving me another annuity of thirty pounds i own it prejudiced me greatly in favor of captain mizen a few more words finished this affair and i became the property of this man of war and parted with my friend with love and regret  captain mizen visited constantly but seldom before one or two in the morning and frequently half seas over as he called it twas difficult to manage him in this trim but when quite drunk was very tame and obedient so i took care to ply him with port or punch and then he turned in with ease in the morning he always begged pardon not in words but in a pecuniary manner that carried irresistible persuasion i certainly hated him and the resistance i always made to his caresses served but to plague me the more with his fondness the creature loved and no caliban could show it more i was his pinnace his frigate and a thousand tender names but on struggling he has cried out  that is right  yardarm and yardarm  sblood poll an you blow me up by the world i will clap the broad r on you  at last my true love went to sea and gave me a reprieve for six months the experience i had made me find out the real use of money and resolve to save as much as i could the captain returned with a fresh cargo of that commodity which his love made less valuable he was so generous that i suffered his embraces with great freedom but discovered the lucky secret that this was the only chance i had of losing his valiant heart it seems he loved a smart engagement and a ship that would take a good deal of drubbing before she struck an easy conquest was to him of no value with this knowledge i pretended extreme fondness i hung on his neck i kissed his carbuncled cheeks and almost cried when he left me he seemed pleased enough with my behavior but his visits were less frequent and in six months he forfeited his articles gave me the goodbye and left me like a turtle all alone to weep and mourn the absence of her mate  my landlady mrs wheedle was a woman who understood the world in her younger days she had been of personal use to a nobleman who married her to his footman and procured him a very pretty employ in the revenue latterly i believe she served his lordship in another capacity with these people i lived and all things considered was perfectly happy in the friendship of mrs wheedle we went to church to play houses and were inseparable in one of our walks i took it in my head to enquire for my old friend near grosvenor square of whom i had not heard for above six years mrs wheedle went to the house but found it inhabited by another family with some difficulty i was informed that the old gentlemans whole fortune was swallowed up in the south sea that his distress was so great that it turned his head and had been supported by charity in a madhouse near chelsea where he died about a year ago  i had no great reason to love his memory yet could i not help a few tears but guarded against calling his fate a just judgment  lord said mrs wheedle what signifies it if the gentleman was a friend in a corner thank god there be others in the world as good as he charity begins at home my dear but nothing is to be got by idleness i love to see a young woman industrious and careful it is the most recommendablest thing in life  i am no enemy said i to industry but sure you would not have me hawk about my goods or stand at the door and cry  walk in gentlemen and behold the wonderful works of nature alive  alive  ho  certainly polly said she youre distracted  did ever any body hear such nonsense  if you will be industrious i know a friend will give you employment  ay marry said i now you say something but will he come down handsomely for you know i hate a game that cannot afford paying the cards  lord lord polly said she youre strangely covetous but i dont blame you neither  there is squire careless now the most charmingest and most agreeablest man in life mayhap he may answer your purpose  what say to that polly  with all my heart said i the squire shall be welcome but you know the conditions  in a few days mr careless paid me a visit and with great ease and familiarity fell into a chat of a settlement  i am so unlucky my dear said he to have my estate so fixed by law that i cannot touch it my income i spend like a gentleman pleasure is my religion and the ladies are the idols i adore the incense i burn is money and my sacrifice is love accept one and the other and the priestess below stairs shall have reason to be content  i laughed at the oddity of his expressions but as his incense had a sweet smelling flavor i was persuaded of the sincerity of his devotions and i became his titular saint  his visits were very irregular but though always cheerful always goodhumored and generous they seemed rather paid to dispose of and kill time than to see the object of his love  mrs wheedle took notice of this and insinuated that vacant hours might be employed to advantage  there is perquisites said she belonging to all employments in life and since you keep an office i see no reason why you shoudnt have em as well as others  if i keep an office said i it is an office of assurance or rather that of an underwriter but where are the perquisites you talk of for i always admired your douceurs or as some call them your dowcers  youre a madcap said she but let me alone to work for you  the good woman was very skilful and at different times brought me acquainted with two or three elderly gentlemen who made ample amends for the roughness of their beards and their stinking breath this revenue was partly appropriated to my friends private recreation and mine and the remainder to the sinking fund  careless sometimes met one of these gentlemen in my chamber but seemed quite indifferent about it the indolence of his temper was such that no jealous thoughts had power to give him uneasiness i once made an apology for having a stranger in my apartment and told him a wellcontrivd lie  bless me child said he why so many words about a trifle  i know you are a woman and cannot help acting as such  i know you have been playing the truant but why should i be angry at the constant practice of your sex no no my dear i am so happy that no woman can disappoint me  you have all the same turn and a little cheating even at cards affords you infinite delight  the pleasure of deceiving has something exquisite in it but i am so illnatured as to disappoint you and freely indulge a passion so natural to the ladies  i own he flung me more by his indifference than had he stormed and swore i said what was necessary on the occasion but he took the standish and wrote  here my dear polly said he are my sentiments let us say no more on the head but love one another as well as we can  he then began a very merry conversation and embracing me very tenderly took his leave  i longed to read his paper and found these words  the easy lover why should i pretend to have dear pollys heart entire what in her power to me she gave and fanned the amorous fire then tell me not illnatured soul to others she is as kind why should i her bliss control since others hit my mind no let us ramble not repine let both contented be her souls her own her charms are mine and that is enough for me at first i thought i had lost him for ever but a day or two convinced me to the contrary we kept up a tender correspondence for about a twelvemonth more and my perquisites regularly came in at last his extravagancies and the want of common attention to his affairs drove him into such difficulties that he was compelled to give up many amusements and me amongst the rest  mrs wheedles good management prevented my too much regretting the loss of careless she soon furnished me with another and another and the last fool still welcome as the first  i must reserve for another opportunity my travels to ireland with a lord of that country and to france with a scotch nobleman  my living with a jew a methodist preacher and sundry others and the many tricks i played in a progress of fifteen years would make a large folio and perhaps be as useful as moll flanders  in a word i found myself possessed of about two hundred pounds a year well paid besides some ready money and jewels  time began to gather my roses and ruffle my smooth brow the few charms that remained i resolved to use myself i had seen the world and found it a vain empty nothing  i began to call to my memory the days of innocence and happiness  i reflected on the charms of religion and virtue for their beauties had not quite forsaken me  i tried their power and they have conducted me to this mansion of peace and tranquillity  why are miserable creatures called women of pleasure  poor wretches they know of none  in their happiest days and in the highest keeping whom do they converse with  in the midst of gaiety they are in darkness and obscurity  they walk with selfcondemned and suspicious looks and just live like a rat in the wainscot  when stripped of their finery when discarded the fertile paddock and sent to graze on the common what horrors  what vileness  i do not pretend to be a judge of the charms of matrimony neither can i have a just idea of the pleasure parents take in their children as i never was in either situation but this i can positively affirm from my own experience that in the midst of every joy i was capable of receiving as i certainly was of some i had reflections which i could not account for but which gave me infinite anxiety  to be necessitated to be fond where i was quite indifferent  to caress him whom i despised  to seem to love and be all tenderness where i hated and even loathed  in short to live if i may so call it a martyr to my reason and understanding is a situation the most deplorable human nature can be reduced to  as light follow shade so trouble and remorse pursue the vicious  who can fathom the deep or measure infinite space but oh who can describe the joy when the father of infinite mercy speaks peace and comfort to the contrite heart  she ceased  sangfroid praised the steadiness of her resolution but conyers was lost in thought  if madam said he at last
