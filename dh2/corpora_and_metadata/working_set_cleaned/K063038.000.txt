greek models the rules of french critics or the examples of modern writers a justification of the following piece would be attempted in vain they would call it a motley performance deficient in almost every article which constitutes a true and proper tragedy if the author was to allege that he never meant to compose a tragedy according to their acceptance of the word but that his intention was to fill up a picture of real life in a certain given time the outlines of which were taken from historical facts his reason would be deemed unsatisfactory  regardless of the end proposed they would continue to exclaim that the unities were neglected that the grave was intermingled with the ludicrous that the business of the drama frequently stood still that the dialogue was too familiar and the meter little better than measured prose  how far some of these objections may be valid and how many more might perhaps with reason be urged against particular passages the author would not determine the force of others of them he would endeavor to diminish by answering that they militate equally against human life itself and that while he should be sorry to have this denominated an artificial poem he would flatter himself it cannot be justly thought an unnatural one  dr johnson indeed in the preface to his edition of shakespeare seems to have sufficiently vindicated this particular species of writing to which those who please may instead of tragedy give the more simple name of history neither are there wanting many good judges of composition who wish that the less studied diction and more plain and level meter of the school of that immortal poet which seems to have ended with southern had been continued to the present time even this performance with all its imputed irregularities and deficiencies will perhaps be preferred by them to those translated tragedies or imitations which of late years have through novelty lived their nine nights on the stage and been damned for ever after in the closet though they had been corrected and metamorphosed by managers calculated to afford to favorite actors or actresses opportunities of shining and curtailed by lord chamberlains  a diversification of characters has been attempted in this piece and to give to every character the mode of sentiment and expression peculiarly suited to it it is not at all difficult for a man of a very middling genius to contrive a regular plot to pen down a certain number of sounding lines and though his dramatis personae are distinguished by particular names to put his own sentiments in their mouths throughout five acts had the author been solicitous of adapting his plan to the stage or wished to conciliate the favor of the indiscriminating multitude he might probably have followed the same method  however it may appear to us when we are reading no small attention is requisite in written dialogue of any kind for an author entirely to cast off self this was the characteristic of shakespeare and perhaps after all the author of this play has deceived himself and it may with reason be applied to him   sudet multum frustraque laboret ausus idem  dramatis personae men tarquin titus aruns sextus l j brutus collatinus lucretius valerius horatius herminius claudius messengers guards etc women lucretia lucretias maids lavinia clelia camilla and others  lucius junius brutus act   scene   rome valerius lucretius valerius yes we may weep the ruin of our country and so must all good men but there is no remedy the evil is too rank to admit a cure oppression wide has spread her bane and tainted the universal air scarce are our souls our own much less our words the secret curse is frequent offered up to all the gods the midnight silent deprecation calls for vengeance on the proud the imperious tarquin but in the day each wears the face of loyalty nor dares so jealous are these grovelling times even in his brothers bosom pour the secret which ulcerating preys upon his heart how we two thus have dared communicate our thoughts either to other is to me most strange and passing marvel  lucretius had i not known thee long thou noblest roman amid these worst of times immovable in honors steady course invariably upright and just in thy domestic life untainted too i would not thus have opened my inmost breast or given the passing wind an opportunity to bear my words on its licentious wing to the tyrants ear  valerius a mutual confidence henceforth be ours scarcely can i express with what abhorrence i look upon this monster of a man scan the whole catalogue of horrid crimes and if you find one he has not committed i will retract my words and call him virtuous his brother first he poisoned to possess his wife to gain the crown assassinated most ruffian like the good old king by marriage his father i beheld the elder thrown down from the senate house his aged limbs bruised by the flinty pavement his white locks which from the lawless robber would have gained respect and veneration wildly scattered over his sace defiled with clotted gore raised from the ground with utmost difficulty and tottering tward his home he met his death still did insatiate cruelty pursue his breathless corse denied the common rites of burial all men struck with horror shunned the accursed spot yet then his savage wife drunk with hot draughts of empire or possessed by the infernal furies every tie of human nature cast aside drove on high in her stately chariot and impelled the affrighted horses over him where he lay over the dead body of her murdered father  lucretius had i been told the fact as perpetrated in any foreign country my belief would have rebelled i wonder that the sun turned not his course as at the inhuman feast of grecian atreus ever to reflection as the deed rises in its native hue my blood runs cold no wonder if his throne founded by means like these should be supported by the same means hence in what copious streams has flowed the blood of princely senators their crimes were worth or riches has he spared one but whom absolute necessity compelled or mean opinion of his faculties suffered to live  valerius to this his cruel policy he adds superior talents with a soul that penetrates mankind he bears conjoined the fiery spirit of the warrior god talents by virtue guided which might place him among the first of kings but now serve only to make him bold and resolute in vice and what is worse create an awe a dread on which as on a base not to be shaken stands fixed hightowering tyranny  lucretius yet we need not complain us he has spared and me while against the ardeates he wages war in trust exalted to be governor of this fair city  valerius indeed were life alone to be esteemed we should not murmur but to breathe the air to walk about at large eat when we please sleep at our will this is not life  the beast upon the mountain leads a life like this when i am so selfish as to center all my sense of pleasure here when i cast off tender humanity which feels as relative to all the members of society joy or affliction may i then be cursed with such a life as this  lucretius did thou remember among the senators by tarquin slain the name of marcius junius  valerius well i knew him but what of him  lucretius oh he was placed above the strain of men his many virtues made him respected as a god by the sons of rome his ancestors came hither with aeneas from flaming troy the valor of his race the heroic ardor which inflames the breast of conscious greatness and uplifts mankind to something of divinity dwelt in him he was a man that had he escaped the wreck of those tempestuous days would never have suffered gigantic tyranny to take such strides at least some check he would have been some curb upon the mouth of headstrong appetite and wild ambition this our tarquin knew and at the same time looking with an eye of greediness upon his large possessions sent and slew him and his elder son a youth of gracious hopes the younger being absent escaped the ruin  valerius and now dwells with tarquin lucius the fool the laughing stock of the court whom the young princes always carry with them to aid their sport and jocund merriment the but at which they shoot their shafts of wit whose paucity of sense and mode uncouth awkward and blundering has deservedly got him the name of brutus  but why waste our talk on this same idiot  lucretius solve the question i did but hint him speaking of his father  valerius indeed why talk at all when all must end as bootless as began  there is a bound which checks they say all evils in their course and good ensues  our evils know no change nor have they this extremest limit proved  though that they should be in progression still is past belief  yet there is no chance in nature no possibility of alteration no man alive to aim at alteration and his three sons titus and aruns sextus all equal to their father in ability beyond if possible in the black deeds of villainy of lust and treachery are three firm pillars added to the pile which threats to stand for ages oh these thoughts are capable to banish moderation from the prepared breast and make the wise turn fools and madmen  lucretius let us drop the subject who knows the secrets of avenging jove perhaps though we shortsighted as we are think liberty bound in eternal thraldom his counsels otherwise decree even now happily the dread events are bursting forth like lightning from the gloomy firmament to sweep this race of hell hounds from the earth  valerius what may be i will not say but hope long since has ceased with me to wear her sanguine hue why should free agents even on jove depend to sway the will he gave  man rules himself  his own fates arbiter  though over these times broods desperation shall we not beneath her wings immewd this galling tempting theme again revive  words cannot pluck the thorn but soothe the smart  farewell  i will to my house  whither if in the evening you will come still on a genuine roman citizen my lares smile  lucretius i would attend unbidden but thy inviting voice should charm me thither spite of disease or pain at evening close i come then farewell exeunt scene ii the camp before ardea titus aruns titus why aruns in what corner sits the wind what not a word to say quite down in the mouth  aruns i am and stranger cannot guess the cause unless it is living in inaction thus i would i was in rome or rome was here or that these coopdup ardeats would but sight i wonder that our father sits contented lounging ins camp plague on their petty sallies why does he not attack the nest at once with fire and sword and rouse up all the swarm it was not thus he triumphed over the sabines or wrested from the warlike volscis hands suessa pometia with whose glorious spoils turning religious all at once he built the temple in the capitol to jupiter though had he asked of me i could have told him a better way of laying out his money  titus i do believe thee aruns well i know to what divinity thou would have reared thy golden altars  aruns aye and wisely too pleasures my deity my jupiter my juno and minerva titus too if i mistake not is no atheist there but worships with as warm enthusiasm as any votary of them all it is true he wears a graver brow and commits sin with a more serious philosophic face there is all the difference between me and thee a touch of feature only in our hearts we are most cordially alike  titus alike why now indeed thy airy spirits dance sparkling in either eye but when i met thee what were thou then inwrappd in discontent what will thou be anon chiding at straws for lying in thy path then quick by thsparks of angry passion kindled into flame still varying like the wind  thy heart like mine when did thou find my skittish temper start and fly like thine from one to tother side  aruns well be it so heaven speed us both but sextus i envy that same sextus for his genius soars over us both and robs us of our birthright not that i think we halt behind him much in our designed intentions but success befriends him farther one would swear he kept fortune in pay and that the blindeyed goddess accepted bribes from him there is not a woman he looks on with desire but he possesses he says but to an enemy fall down and down he falls hah say thou is he not a son of tarquin and a glorious villain  titus glorious i grant but not a villain aruns pshaw that is a name may suit a vulgar mouth a tradesman talking of his brother knave but rank and station sanctify mens deeds a king successful cannot be a tyrant nor a kings son deserve a title less than that of prince  aruns thou reasonst well by mars when i want oracles to be delivered i need not go to delphos  out alas my bloods again obstructed and i feel a pain here in my head or in my heart a sort of creeping kind of lethargy  are you ever seized thus hah here comes my antidote  titus brutus true he is a doctor for the spleen you mentioned delphos when we two went thither through the unknown seas of greece sent by our father tenquire the meaning of the prodigy the snake portentous which with dreadful crest appearing in his palace hissed aloud a direful omen brutus then went with us oh i remember well the precious scenes of folly which he acted when we gave rich presents to the god he offered him a walking stick as if the god would walk and take the air but that the god was lame coming from out the temple gazing back as loath to leave a place so fine he fell over the threshold and ploughd up the ground fixing his face in the earth  aruns you may remember the oracle too said that he should bear chief sway in rome who first should kiss his mother when we came home both at one time we kissed her in that i think we are at least before our brother sextus jointly we reign after our father  enter brutus titus brutus where so fast why thou art running like a loaded horse  aruns or like a slave with fetters on his legs what have the rutili attacked the camp that thou art posting in this plaguey hurry  brutus pray my lords stop me not i am sent to you on special ordnance from the king farewell i must return again  aruns but were thou sent only to see us tell the king our father we are in good health we thank him for the message which thou have well remembered to deliver  brutus oh my good lord i had forgot indeed but in the multitude of public cares and daily business  if my memory fails a little  it is no wonder  and you know memory is such a thing as   titus as a cartwheel  brutus indeed my lord you have hit it mine turns round and round  sometimes i think my head is turned  aruns i too have thought it often  brutus have you my lord i am always glad when you and i agree you have just such a wit as i should choose  would i could purchase such an one and put it into my brain yet so i fear twould split my head as air shut up does water bubbles  titus thou have spoke wittier brute than you are aware  aruns but what wilt give me now for a recipe to make a wit i had it from the sibyl her thou saw the other day who sold to the king her books at such a rate  brutus pray let me see it what will i give  ten acres of my land  aruns thy land where lies it  brutus ask the king my cousin he knows full well i thank him he is my steward and takes the trouble off my hands  titus who told thee so  brutus the king himself  now twenty years are past and more when he sent for me from the farm where i had lived some time studying philosophy and such like serious matters  titus noble sophist i bend with the profoundest admiration of thy rare hidden knowledge  brutus yes yes all men must grant that i have no small smattering but where was i oh  kinsman says the king says he and smiled most graciously upon me for deeds of blackest and most treasonous nature thy father and thy brother were accused of they have paid the forfeit with their lives for thee who knewst not of their crimes as i love mercy nor take delight in wanton deeds of cruelty live and be happy the ingenuous heart and simple manners speaking in thy face   aruns aye it is a simple mannersspeaking face  brutus nay is it right to interrupt me thus  aruns pardon most noble brutus  brutus these thy qualities promise says he thou never wilt form a plot of damned conspiracy against thy sovereign   titus indeed for that i will be thy bondsman brutus  brutus live in my house companion of my children as for thy land to ease thee of all care i will take it for thy use all that i ask of thee is gratitude  titus and art thou not grateful for goodness so unmerited  brutus am i not never by the holy gods will i forget it it is my constant prayer to heaven that i may one day have the power to pay the debt i owe him  but the charm for wit you told me of  aruns oh  take it gratis  first then attend with caution  but the message you brought from tarquin   brutus father romulus that i should loiter thus why would you keep me engaged in talk the king your father calls a council to consider of the siege of ardea and the future operations against the stubborn rutili your presence is asked immediately shall i before and say youre coming  aruns if thou will good brutus or else behind or otherwise in the middle come well all go together or stay there and follow at thy leisure  exeunt aruns and titus brutus alone yet it is not this which ruffles me  the gibes and scornful mockeries of illgovernd youth  or flouts of painted sycophants and jesters reptiles who lay their bellies on the dust before the frown of majesty all this i but expect nor grudge to bear the face i carry too demands it  but what then is my mind fashioned to the livery of dull stupidity which i have worn these many a day is it bent aside and warped from its true native dignity else why how is it that vengeance now has slept so long o prudence ill delayer of great deeds and noble enterprises  yet  not so chance may and accidental circumstance crown bold and lucky rashness with success  but oftener not there is perhaps a time a certain point which waited for with patience seized on and urged with vigor will go near to banish chance and introduce assurance and fixedness in human actions  to avenge my fathers and my brothers murder and sweet i must confess would be the draught had this been all often has the murderers life been in my hands a thousand opportunities i have had to strike the blow  and my own life i had not valued as a rush  but still  there is something farther to be done  my soul enjoy the strong conception oh it is glorious to free a groaning country from oppression to vindicate mans commons rites and crush the neck of arrogance  to see revenge spring like a lion from his den and tear these hunters of mankind  give but the time give but the moment gods if i am wanting may i drag out this ideotfeigned life to late old age and may posterity never know me by another name but that of brutus and the tarquins household fool exit scene iii horatius herminius horatius whither away herminius to the council  herminius i go to the assembly called by the king i know not if you justly can term that a council where there is no consultation  horatius we need not now be nice in the definition of words horatius which become a soldier but ill at any time at no time more perhaps than now if we are not consulted we shall be told what tarquin and his sons have predetermined no small share of confidence as in the city they are the only source of government and law so in the camp they form each enterprise direct each motion and by the gods were government and law tempered with equity or war with justice i would not wish for abler lawgivers or leaders  herminius hold  no more horatius  what know you not that tents have often ears hearing distinctly if the times are bad heaven in its mercy mend them pray however but softly lest the statues of the gods should turn informers too who passes there across our path beyond that farther tent  horatius is it not collatine who lately married lucretiuss daughter  herminius trust me she is reported the fairest and the worthiest of her sex  horatius fairer than ever was a form created by youthful fancy when the blood strays wild and neverresting thought is all on fire the worthiest of the worthy not the nymph who met old numa in his hallowed walks and whispered in his ear her strains divine can i conceive beyond her the young choir of vestal virgins bend to her it is wonderful amid the darnel hemlock and base weeds which now spring rise from the luxurious compost spread over the realm how this sweet lily rose how from the shade of these illneighbouring plants her father sheltered her that not a leaf is blighted but arrayed in purest grace she blooms unsullied verdure such her beauties as might call back the torpid breast of age to longforgotten rapture such her mind as might abash the boldest libertine and turn desire to reverential love and holiest affection  herminius from a praise so warm a stranger might form some conclusions  horatius i speak as an acquaintance as a friend but yet impartially not swayed by passion but as i really think had lifes gay prime presented such an object to my view you would have thought me mad in my applause i should have flown above the shining spheres of the azure vault for new comparisons yet then not thought them hyperbolical i loved my wife i praised her but the height i raised her to reached not to this lucretia though since i have thought it much surpassed the truth here transport would have urged me far beyond all sober bounds and yet close by my side reason would have stood smiling to see herself so justly superseded  herminius such a prodigy should have a husband of no vulgar mould but collatine i see him every where the princes intimate at their carousals the first in noise and mirth and jollity of the unruly crew  horatius you are deceived he is young perhaps unsteady flexible and yielding to example though indeed as a relation and being near to the king i dont see how if twas his inclination he could do otherwise but he possesses many good qualities is gentle kind and generous wants not courage and i know doats with the most impassioned tenderness upon lucretia happily it is in hopes to ease his mind from the sharp grief of absence that thus he mingles with the festive train and joins the roar of idle rioting and dissipation though i never observed he joined it heartily i have seen him often lost in reflection there and often alone musing in melancholy as just now thou saw him when he passed us meditating with his eyes cast on the ground but let us haste to the kings tent  herminius before  i will follow you exeunt scene iv collatia lucretia lavinia lucretia how long is it lavinia since my lord has changed his peaceful mansion for the camp and restless scenes of war  lavinia why in my simple estimation madam it is some ten days or thereabout for time runs as it should with me in yours it may be perhaps ten years  lucretia and what should make thee think so  lavinia nay i know not but i have heard folks say  i think my grandam  yes my grandam twas  that she when she was young in days of yore and parted from her newlymarried husband found the whole method of times progress changed instead of wings to his back posting in haste and flitting by so quick you could not seize him by his lank lock a gouty hobbling wretch that noting of the pain he took in walking gave sympathetic pangs  she was a shrewd one and had if i would believe her in her spring felt all the power of love oh she could talk even then of purling streams and cooing doves and of the arms clasped thus and brow bent thus of aching hearts and such a deal of stuff that had i not even from my tender years been guarded well by the superior powers i should have sought me out a swain and married and now perhaps been moaning for the absence of my true trutle  lucretia so thy heart never knew what twas to love  lavinia no i thank holy vesta never i have cast indeed sometimes the eyes of approbation on a proper man but never sent deep glances off they darted from him upon another o my heart what twas to love why men are all alike all mothers sons  lucretia thou have a gadding tongue but still thy mind is right thou have no meaning affixed to what thou utterst  lavinia none to speak of  all that i mean is that if i were married and that my husband were called forth to the wars i should not stray through the grove next my house invoke the pensive solitude and woo the dull and silent melancholy brood over my own thoughts alone or keep myself within my house mewed up a prisoner i should do like the rest of my sex repair to company and noise it is for philosophers to love retirement women were not made to stand up like to statues in a niche or feed on their own secret contemplations  lucretia go to thou know not what thou say lavinia it is for the light of heart to range abroad to brave the general and licentious eye to mingle with the fickle trifling crew of merriment who laugh aloud if folly shake but the cap upon her head or lift her finger up before their face the praise of woman is to play the housewife well ambitious in her husbands sight to appear grateful and amiable not indeed careless of others but preferring him to all and his society not cloying neither but manifested in a way known only to nice affection and distinguished by it it is hers with care to oversee his family and govern with sure reins of government no easy task  lavinia jove bless us what is this if a superior place in life give not the power of tasting greater liberty of dancing to the honeyd notes of gladness and walking hand in hand with dainty pleasure if that the dame of rank must act the housecat sit at the hole and watch and cry bopeep or sing herself asleep the peasants wife or dull mechanicks is as happy nay and happier as by necessity tied ever down she knows she must comply and feels she cannot attain what most she wishes  lucretia and why should i believe she wishes more than she possesses why not think there is a jewel called content why circumscribe the habitation of true happiness within the narrow gaudy idle circle of swelling wealth and airblown empty pomp why think she cannot dwell with humble duty beneath the hut of uncemented stones covered with flags well pleased to tend her children healthy and smiling babes and when her husband comes from the field and pacing by his side her elder sturdy boy spring tward the door and give them that sincerity of welcome which greatness never saw with busy care and sedulous prepare their evening viands list to the scant adventures of the day what passing stranger rowsed their faithful dog what tree secured them from the scattered shower what distant undistinguished noise they heard and having drawn in their brief chronicle and thereto added her own little journal with mutual interchanged looks of love retire to rest unbroken no lavinia the true delight i am well convinced dwells there with nature and her offspring and if those to whom it is given beneath the cedar roof high overarchd to sit would relish life they must as far as possible pursue her paths unhackneyd and must imitate her unaffected simpleness  lavinia ah me i much suspect there are two natures then for ever since i was a tiny thing not higher than this i warrant i have thought of nothing all the livelong day but show and glitter and rich toys and ornaments and i have gone to bed and in my sleep have dreamed i had them then with the greatest pleasure have waked and wept full bitterly to find that i was disappointed i must own i have no notion of that other nature give me things quite the ontrary give me to enjoy life like i know who some ladies and those of the best quality in rome possess a pretty comfortable share of that same nature i esteem the best  lucretia let others act as they think fit nor let it be called in them a fault to please themselves in me a virtue  but i thank the gods who made me what i am who gave to me a father whose indulgent tenderness more than supplied a mothers loss who died ever memory set her stamp on my hearts tablet who taught me wealth was dross and that the mind possessed of conscious virtue is more rich than all the sunless hoards which plutus boasts often would he say o my beloved daughter i have tried nor yet in vain to set thee right to ope thine eyes against the siren charms of vanity deluding womankind act to approve thyself to thine own heart despise the idiot custom which breaks down the fence which ever should remain strong built between the sexes womans chiefest glory is in retirement and her highest pleasure results from homeborn and domestic joys hear me lucretia so shall thou obtain the crown of woman a deserving husband who not a prisoner to the eye alone a fair complexion or melodious voice shall read thee deeper nor shall time which palls the rage of passion shake his firmer love increasing by possession  this again i thank the gracious gods this husband too is mine  lavinia i should be glad to see this husband now these eyes are not the sharpest in the world is not that he gay as the morning lark and laughing with the sons of tarquin there his heart is bent on mirth he thinks not he like other absent men of his lucretia he did not hear a syllable of the praise her tongue just now bestowed  lucretia no more no more lest i be angry with thee for a fault thou can not help thy tongue runs idly  yet say even what thou will i am not offended  lavinia then i will say i dont believe that lady has truer lord more fixed in loyalty and how can he be otherwise were i in his condition fickle as i am and wavering in affection a true woman unschoold untaught by father or by mother i should cast anchor and forbid my bark ever to leave the port  what shall i say unless i say that now i speak the truth even from my heart  lucretia i know full well thy honesty come let us in and we will talk together of the stern dangers which attend on war and rouse the passion fear i know not how but there is something grateful to the soul even in terror though we dread the event it is pleasing while it is but imagined that my fears ever may be realizd in thee o collatine ye gods forbid exeunt act ii scene i the kings tent tarquin titus aruns sextus tarquin my glory and my pride my three bold sons whom i rejoice in more than in the increase of empire and dominion where is the king can say with me his children are his senators his judges and his generals while you the first supply i find they were as i esteemed them justly mere superfluous branches to the commonweal which i with prudent hand have lopped for government cannot be too simple torn by variety of ranks and orders action is lost in fruitless canvassing empty harrangues and vain deliberation while vigorous enterprise amid the jar of bickering parties dares not show his face no secrecy observed the enemy knows well the bent of every expedition as soon as planned and as the events foreseen prepares against it warily and strongly is this to be a king oh only name of royalty in fact a vassal slave tied down and manacled condemned to act not from himself but as by others tutored while some bold party swallowing up the rest seizes the reins of empire and bestows all the offices of trust he flimsy shadow titular monarch cannot help himself but like a wretched fisher in a boat from which the sails are rent by the rude winds the rudder clove asunder and oars lost still rides indeed upon the billows backs born by the flux and reflux of the tides at random till despair and famine end his miserable life or the crazed hulk admit the briny wave then both together sink in the deep and never are heard of more whod be a king like this  sextus who would my father rather would i betake me to the plough and till with utmost toil a land ungrateful a barren desert where but here and there a blade of corn would rise and my whole harvest scarce serve to keep body and soul together till the next years return such servitude were not to be sustained twere worse than death  tarquin still keep these sentiments my son they show the man not the poorspirited mean creature that generally is called so but the man born to command to lord it over these earthworms to sit in the exalted seat of empire and wield the scepter to be placed a god above the rest as the gods are bove him had i been guided by the moderate maxims of doting politicians had i not acted on principles which my soul started and hands dared execute i should have lived cooped up within the walls of rome and called only that petty city those few acres my sum of territory have pursued the canting superstitions of old numa or thought with ancus that to build a bridge or thought with ancus that to build a bridge over the tiber was a wondrous work or like old purblind servius have recorded offices ages deaths births marriages and kept the public register of the state but i resolved to rise above controulment to seize the glorious substance of true majesty to be a king indeed and men are not the restive beings some have but supposed they on timidity encroach but dare not look settled resolution in the face habit makes even slavery easy hence i turned my conquering arms against all the states around and made hetruria pale with fear now may the proudest nation yield to rome and own her its superior hence i am honored dreaded abroad and courted hence at home absolute lord and hence shall leave my children a stable throne which shall continue firm to latest ages if not wantonly or foolishly they deviate from my steps  titus may titus perish if he deviate wantonly  aruns and aruns if he deviate foolishly  sextus and sextus if he deviate either way  tarquin i know you better each than to suspect you nor think that my example or my precepts have been so little viewed or weighed so lightly keep but you three together in the band of mutual fixdness and you may defy time and the adversity of accident or force of malice  but my sons the reason of this our meeting this strong city ardea like to a mighty mound dams up the current of our progression were but this our own the whole rutilian state of course would follow the question is how to attain this end assault we have tried and wept our hardy veterans slain in the unequal task their walls are high and in few places only they are assailable the inhabitants are numerous and resolved to sell their freedom dear plenty as yet makes them highmettled and they laugh to scorn us and our strength speak each what you advise whether again to advance our scalingladders and strive with fire and sword to gain admission or whether change our siege into blockade and starve them to surrender titus speak  titus i see no reason here for much debate or many words to fix determination our soldiers with their late successless toil dispirited and faint theirs with the contrary valiant and bold again the uncertainty of being more successful than before the probability that we shall not the ill consequences if we make the assault in vain all tempt me to dissuade from action to gird the city well harrass the country debar them from supplies sap their high walls wait till we gain a lucky time for onset or deeplaid stratagem this gives a conquest certain though slow and this do i advise  aruns think not i speak through contradiction titus but i can bring as many arguments as cogent too and couch them full as briefly why we should not delay in every sally made since that trial they have been beat to the gates this has restored the courage of our soldiers and shame now adds a double sting to bravery delay breeds relaxation in our duty the rutili and their allies may join hem us between them and the walls of ardea or march to rome itself delay breeds danger i do not like delay it is a word i hate it is ominous as the ravens croak it bears with it a cold and deathlike sound might i but lead the army once again to the attack i would be myself the first to mount the wall and answer for the event if not let the events speak for themselves or speak you for them who determine otherwise  sextus could i by sly imposture hope to win this ardea as i did the town of gabii i would again submit my back to the scourge and from my fathers cruelty a suppliant entreat the gulled inhabitants nor wait his hint by cutting down the tallest poppies in the presence of the messenger i sent him to slay their leaders if this could be done or any thing like this i would not advise speedy assault or to protract the siege in both of which i can espy no small degree of danger titus well advises and so does aruns a small grain would turn the scale in eithers favor if our father determine for the assault about it speedily i will climb to the top of the wall as soon as aruns if titus shall be thought to have better counseled i will watch the turn of every circumstance and hard it shall be if some dexterous craft suit not with the opportunity which must in the course of things present itself  tarquin i wish that circumstance may offer if it does i doubt not of thy ready apprehension aruns must be oerruled he knows my temper as little brooks delay as his but ardour must yield to the necessity of the times  aruns aruns is pleased if every one is pleased he yields contentedly is quite resigned  enter brutus tarquin say what would thou  brutus horatius and herminius and others the centurions of the army came with me to the door of the tent they ask if it is your pleasure they should be admitted  tarquin horatius and herminius may come in let the rest to their tents these two shall bear our orders enter horatius and herminius say horatius and herminius whether you either of you know a reason of any force why we should not block up this town of ardea and by protracting the time render ourselves more sure of conquest with freedom speak  herminius i have but only one kept from their homes so long the populace already thither cast a longing eye they had been taught texpect an easy prey with speed to be obtained i fear their murmurs   tarquin say thou the murmurs of the populace shall i be moved by the manyheaded beast no if thou do not know these truths already learn them of me the grosser herd of men nature has marked for servitude to bear the yoke with passive neck and walk in trammels woe to the king who gives a tittle up to the unsould brutal rabble he shall find when it is too late and sorely rue his folly stop a wild horse when he has slipped his bit stick close your knees and make him slack his pace at your command guide him with gentle words and tell him that he should not throw his rider who talks of liberty he means licentiousness let the fat soil put forth that dangerous weed but one poor inch and you shall see it rise with growth gigantic till it reach to heaven and blast the golden firmament he knows but little of mankind who thinks by mild and gentle usage to exact obedience what follows mean opinion of his talents contempt then discontent is quickly seen to open her muttering mouth close on whose heels treads bold conspiracy and rank rebellion i know them well fond of variety and novel change bold where they see no sign of opposition like the highswoln tide through every open gap they rush amain i know them well the slavish animals let them but see the sternlyfrowning face of awful majesty let but authority lift high her iron whip and they will cringe and creep before your face like spaniel dogs nor dare to wag a tongue or move a limb or even draw their breath or let the strokes of their quickpalpitating hearts be heard i know them well they cannot bear indulgence it breeds corrupted humors in their minds and subtle venom which would blast the world like the winged plague  the murmurs of the populace why let the populace still murmur on like the vague murmurs of the empty gale they blow at random and soon pass away you cannot trace the wrinkles which they made on the smooth oceans face it is the fierce voice of the ruinating whirlwind which must rouse the godhead from his deep abode and cause him display his angry trident  titus might i speak i would presume to say herminius meant not aught derogating from your power of majesty but from his real fears and his good will   tarquin i do not think he did but let him learn henceforth if he will needs produce his reasons to produce better nor dare tell a lion that he must not chase down his prey because a swarm of gnats buz in the path he takes  aruns there is one ere tarquin tells his resolution whose sage opinion has not yet been asked  tarquin i beg his pardon and will ask it strait well kinsman lucius what is thy advice shall we with speedy onset or delay subdue these ardeates  brutus humph humph  no no  that scheme will not do  i have it here but cannot express myself in presence quite so full as i could wish but ever long time is passed i hope tacquaint you with a plan of mine by which the greatest enemies of rome shall sink before her but as yet excuse if i conceal the principles i go on  tarquin we do and render thanks for thy good will and lucius when thy plot is ripe acquaint us full many a year have we experience had of thy sagacity in admonition and quick dispach in business  it is determined to slack the arm of war and give it rest the sword be still but let pale meagre hunger scowl in their streets and let the torrid thirst parch them without remorse extremity must conquer and to that these haughty ardeates must yield perforce be it yours horatius and yours herminius to acquaint the people with our resolves tell them that though it is slow yet the possession of the town is sure enlarge upon the riches of the place which must be theirs if patience be but theirs quiet their murmurs if they will be quieted if not our will is fixed and dread example shall punish the seditious  horatius we shall do as we are commanded  exit tarquin sextus has any one seen collatine this evening  horatius we saw him as we came toward this tent he crossed our way to the right and we soon missed him  sextus he should be with us at our feast tonight  aruns i know his haunts the gentleman of late since he was married is grown melancholy  no wonder that you will say i will undertake to find him out however and produce him at the appointed time  exit aruns sextus you will sup with us  horatius herminius we shall my lord  sextus and thou without all doubt  brutus i pray excuse me may i be excused this once  sextus by no means why i tell thee what thou art the life the soul of company such wit such humor and facetiousness as thou possessest more especially when the brisk flagon has been circling round and the young god with laughter in his eye expands the liberal soul why i would rather not feast for half an age than want thy company without thy flighty bursts of merriment wine would be quite insipid and the hours drag sluggishly their heavy heels along  brutus say you so there is my hand if i dont meet you and be as merry as the best of you and rally with as good an air and smart and cut my joke and laugh at it myself as loud as you and show the wit in my teeth call me an ass the stupid animal i most abhor  titus strange that he should abhor his nearest of kin  sextus come let us hence this night our brows shall shine with the gay glories of the god of wine well seize the leisure which this calm shall yield and for the foaming bowl lay by the spear and shield if never relaxed wars sinews would be faint the bow is useless which is always bent exeunt omnes scene ii another part of the camp aruns claudius aruns where was he when thou saw him claudius  claudius my lord between the camp and where our troops possess the neighboring heights where thrown across the hasty brook a rafter bridge is seen oerlain with sod which totters as you pass there where beyond a path winds up the bank trod only by the cottager who lived hard by at morn and eve while fortune smiled now exiled by our arms beneath an oak whose bare top of its leaves bereaved and trunk dented with thunder like a veteran looks who many a hard campaign has weathered out covered with scars yet though with sinews shrunk and pithless limbs now bending over his staff still claiming veneration there lay collatine in musing wise a knotted root of the tree upheld him halfreclined his eyes were fixed nor did he see me as i quick brushed by when i had passed the bridge i turned me round and saw him suddenly spring from the earth and dart into the grove where mid the boughs and thickening underwood i lost him soon  aruns and where have thou been schooled where have thou got this tedious dull prolixity this quaint descriptive fribbling coxcomblike minuteness this web spun from the vacant brain o jove lash me and lash me well these trite describers these murderers of clear language and intelligence i asked thee where thou mettst with collatine had thou but told me in the neighboring wood south of the camp say should i not have found him as easily as now besides the trouble of seeing in my mind a clumsy painting drawn by a bungling artist prythee learn at least when i ask a plain question of thee to give as plain an answer gracious powers and is the gift of speech of so small value that we must lavish it away thus prodigally as twere a trifling knickknack oh reform reform  no words reform and hold thy tongue  claudius my lord to pleasure you in every thing shall still be my endeavor  aruns no it will not i bade thee but this moment lock thy lips why but because i liked thy silence best but hence thou know the horse we saw today do thou not recollect it find me out its owner understandst thou it is the horse which i so much admired do thou remember the chestnut with the hyacinthin mane enquire me out its owner let him know i would possess that horse  claudius my lord i will exeunt scene iii a grove near the camp collatinus alone whence are thy charms ambition i have looked with piercing eyes but none can i perceive why art thou so pursued by human kind is it that thou liftst thy aspiring front despising earth and all her grovelling sons and bidding bold defiance to the gods is it that cruelty thy fostermother thou laughst at pity dropping the humane and tender briny drop over sacred misery is it that like a whore thou leavest thy lovers and to the first newcomer brought by fortune thy ancient bawd give all thy joys the joys which unessential power presented to thee begot on lawless thirst of fancied greatness  for what is power if taught not its due aim by widedispensing goodness what is greatness if singular it stands selfvivified selftaught selfloving selfpossessing all centered in self detached from what gives to it its substance its inestimable worth and true original intrinsic value the willing tributary love of those who feel its warm irradiance and rejoice i see no graces in thy towering look in thy unfeeling mind in thy deceit and treacherous air thy scepter swayed in vain and grandeur dazzling fools  thou cursed sorceress whose birth the furies smiled when they beheld and shook their snaky locks thou bane of peace of every pure and every holy tie connecting man with man  could prayers avail oh hear me heaven drive to her native hell this harpy pest and chain her firmly there that she may never embroil the world again but harmony may reign and peace and love and friendships bright unsullied maiden fire and every grace and virtue  enter aruns whom have we here say man of melancholy mood what do thou moping alone beneath the umbrageous boughs of this deep wood what secret wizard spells exertst thou to enslave the struggling moon to make the wolves howl and the shepherddogs start from their unsound sleep to make the trees set free their earthclenchd roots the rivers turn back to their source and the old bedridden earth tremble for fear nay do not think i view thee with dreadful apprehension did thy eyes glance fire as sure i think the rays are dim thy mouth spit flames as sure it never will did thou lead growling in thy right hand chained the infernal tripleheaded dog as now i think i only spy a pinebranch there i would tell thee with unterrified aspect thou art my prisoner come along with me do thou draw back what reason can thou urge sextus expects thee at his feast tonight i am for thy appearance bound to answer i heard that thou were here and come to bear thee willing or not come leave tonight thy love of solitude even in this place and meet her tomorrow morning if thou will and welcome  collatinus my lord i am not well i am very sick  aruns sick and by what physicians wise advice walkst thou exposed to the damp evening air hangs not the dew upon the dropping leaves and does not philomela at the pause of every pensive strain turn back her head and wipe the trickling moisture from her wing go to thou art not sick  collatinus indeed i am  aruns indeed thou art thy hand ah ah i know a lovers pulse rather a wenchers ah were i to beat the bushes well around it is ten to one but up the hare would start there are three kinds of men whom i have found most notable that way  first your shy fellows who hang the head and if you speak to them are blushing ripe immediately next those who shun society and swear that man is a cursed creature whom they cannot live with thirdly and lastly all religious of all denominations these three kinds of men have all hot amorous blood which tingles through every vein and will not give them rest among the second thou come in point blank a mixture have thou of the first and third though were the gods to shake thee thy religion might fall from thee for aught i know as fast as leaves blown from a sapless tree in autumn  collatinus do thou then think it hangs so loosely round me were it indeed bound with firm bands of brass and knit with pins of hardest adamant whatever of religion i might have were aruns but permitted soon he would strip me and leave me naked as himself  aruns i own i have no notion of these tricks these ceremonial farces sacrifices prophetic entrails truthforeseeing birds chicken who teach by hieroglyphic pease and all the holy jugglings which our priests would fain persuade us owe their origin to the essences divine  will thou deny that numas nymph egeria was a strumpet who met him often in a wood like this  collatinus what profits my denying or affirming but say is aruns likewise ignorant of that pure incense which the breast unspotted offers to heaven that fine ethereal fire which by the gods created first and placed in the human bosom sed by the fair deeds of moral goodness rectitude and truth flies upward to its native origin has he no notion of that holy instinct which bids us look with awe tward the great ruler of heaven and earth and of that conscious pleasure arising in the soul when bending low in humble reverence we pay homage due to the prime power of all who called us forth from the abyss of nothing into being placed us above the unthinking grazing herd gave to us reason by whose power we stand foremost of all his works lords of this world who framed the universe for us alone and for our pleasure hung the flaming sky with all its glowing orbs adorned the earth with fruits with flowers and herbs of various sorts filled earth and air and oceans womb immense with subject creatures who might yield him homage or be to him for food have thou no notion  aruns plague on thy notions plague upon thy questions think thou the gods highthroned if such there be ever heed such sneaking abject twoleggd animals as thou and i are from our praise what glory can they obtain or from our first existence what satisfaction speculative dreamers may fancy things like these but chief your busy crafty pretenders who well know to soothe the ear of ignorance tell these curious tales they know to profit by it the easy fool swallows their canting potion glibly down and looks on them as heavens own oracles it is all a jest a may game or what is worse whatever knaves may teach or asses credit ease is the pleasure of the immortal gods and interest is the god of mortal men  collatinus easy twould be to prove how ill they merit the name of deities who sit inactive in slothful state while chance that is while nothing governs the world and turns heavens hinges round to prove that man is from contemptible far far removed that there are some of real and undissembled piety who feel what they profess and from these feelings teach who in the exercise of their devotion taste greater joy than kings have power to give nor would for the unlocked wealth of the wide earth offend against that fixed monitor within easy it were these things to prove to ears of sober sense and serious meditation  aruns oh mock me not i am as serious as father winter when the cold northeast blowing between his shoulders through a chink brooding he sits and rakes the embers up in his illfurnished heart  to prove it hence take it ye winds it is my religion  hence lightened of this now collatine and i may talk together without quarrelling i know not what it is good for but to make men sour and splenetic i will never speak more or for it or against it prythee collatine forgive me if in too impertinent and bold a strain i spoke in its defense twas irony my friend sheer irony i thank thee that thou did retaliate i see the absurdity and bid a long adieu to it for ever  hold thy tongue  it is gone it is hence it is no where it is a theme for priests for idiots thou have cured me quite i have no qualms not one away away adieu  it is well  and now my collatine i prythee tell me nay without a jest in earnest seriousness what do thou here and what employed thy meditations when first i saw thee  collatinus will thou tell me aruns how i shall answer thee for never yet that i remember did i give to thee an answer thou were pleased withal if grave twas mighty dull if gay twas vastly silly even answer for me aruns here i am look round what say the objects which thou see what say the objects which thou leftst behind  aruns the objects which i left behind are good the objects which i see are good all is good  i should not speak at all  a camp a wood a wood a camp  why i might beat my brains for ever ever rouse up one new idea  thou art indeed a moralizer thou can pick a sentence out of every stone and make the springy grass on which thou treadst thy monitor i am stupid fancy with me is long since dead to each external thing i am as indifferent as if they never filled up their corner of existence blessing upon the powers above who steeled my nerves and blunted every sentient faculty so that in vain they would dart before my sight their flaming thunderbolt  but what of me i from this time appoint thee my preceptor i have improved already i will improve still more tell me thy meditations  collatinus i will nor do i think what i would not utter to all mankind i wish with equal truth all the whole world could say so  i will own i came not to the camp with my good will i have no quarrel against the ardeates they never injured me nor do i know a roman whom they did but twas my duty i was commanded and obeyed where danger raged in the fight i was not backward thou can witness for me mid the foremost bands i braved the ruffian death  my minds my own my service is my kings i own i pitied those against whom i fought nor wished to conquer the brave the injured mid the roar of war i longed for peace and when the fight was over i would have found it in my tent but there it was denied if i gave up one moment to short reflection strait intruded on me shoals of your newcreated officers pert coxcombs who in words flame in the front and stare each terror of the field in the face though when in arms halfdead they only know each motion by report these brother soldiers for such they scruple not to call themselves worried my ears to death i left the camp  aruns no wonder such as these disgrace the name of manhood often i have seen them pale and wan not dare to lift an arm against the foe yet talk at such a swelling boisterous rate as they would equal our god ancestor and slay whole hosts alone  collatinus quite discontented with myself and them i hither came  i cast my eyes around i saw the labors of the husbandman destroyed i saw the smoking villages a thousand horrid thoughts of misery struck on my mind i heard a thousand groans of fathers mothers children  i could not refrain from tears i could not as i live to think that industry and innocence and sweet content and genial homebred joy should from their native mansions be expelled and their possessors slain perhaps by the hands of brutal violence or doomed to lead a life not worth the name the prey of want of woe of anguish twas indeed with tears i thought upon it and each human glory faded before me  aruns twas most lamentable and melancholious i could weep methinks at the relation had i not sworn solemnly when some years since lost in the melting mood i played the fool egregiously never more to weep at any rate  these are sweet feelings i lose a deal of joy i know full well by not indulging them but it is no matter  what a fine tale have thou been telling me of troublesome companions dismal sights and soft compassion melting into tears  think thou i cannot see through all these pretenses once but not lately once when yet a boy i felt i know not what of odd emotions the peevish amorous whining doting god had with his arrow pierced my liver through when absent from my love but not my wife i sighed and groaned and shook my pensive head and sought out desert rocks and nodding pines and murmuring streams to soothe my sickening soul and if a friend by chance had found me out and asked what ailed me ail me gravely said i i am pitying the vices of the world and thinking of its follies though myself was then a child of folly and as true a one as any she ever bore a womans fool  but do not weep again when these same wars these cursed wars are over it shall see its own true love again yes that it shall it shall it shall  collatinus now may i die   aruns no false professions good my friend die say thou no live live while thou may  we stand upon a hanging bank fast crumbling in the stream of headlong time if swollen by rains or vexed by raging winds perhaps an hour a moment sweeps us away and shall we aid ourselves each fatal accident heap up a load upon our shoulders doubling our own weight and plunging in the waves before our day  likest thou the metaphor come then with me and well tonight laugh off these clogging weights so that at least we will insure ourselves some twelve hours longer hence with discontent why should we purse our brows up when the hand of youth would keep them smooth come we are expected sextus will have no nay and go with me willing or not you must  collatinus well i will follow go you before  aruns no thou shall with me go if once the fowler cast aside his eyes the stricken bird he thought a destined prize hides in the sedge he looks around in vain the shy eluder never shall he obtain exeunt end of the second act act iii scene i the tent of sextus sextus titus aruns brutus collatinus horatius herminius and others as drinking after the banquet brutus pretending drunkenness i say it was not right it was not right  to herminius and had you been in greece you would have learned otherwise contrary to all the rules of war why look ye sir  what is your name  you know no more of the matter than a cracked egg  a general indeed  what signify numbers  superiority i say superiority is a word i have no complaisance for  no sir none  and i would beat the rutili though their armies were full of superiorities  aruns he would indeed you stand no chance herminius if you talk with brutus on the art of war  brutus i think so i think so truly let my head alone for the art of war i have a brain i have  look ye  the art of war  is a fine art you must not talk with me indeed you must not no no  hard grating task but it is the end the end lie still each spark of reason deep obscured aside beneath dissimulations closedrawn veil  herminius i humbly ask your wisdoms pardon brutus i did not mean offense and know in argument i should come off with you at second best  brutus i do believe t indeed  the art of war you talk of the art of war  sextus no more no more come fill your glasses round till they overflow here is to the art of war and noble brutus  all here is to the art of war and noble brutus  sextus would i would a crown of laurel here to bind around the brow of brutus green as that which shades apollos everyouthful front never feared by the blasting lightning or burnt up by the suns scorching ray  but i have none  what honors shall we give to noble brutus  titus resign thy seat create him arbiter and bend before him  brutus yes i will be arbiter  what we have more virtues friends than one or two  bacchus himself is but a fool to me i will cry io longer than he shall  i will teach you how to drink come never flinch it  here is to the cultivation now of ethics ethos our mos it is of greek extraction aye and i would have you all to know it too i am a scholar that i am and learning i sucked it with my milk  collatine  aside o miserable and degraded type of man unhandy and halffinishd work of nature is this a thing to laugh at no i could not laugh though smiles were plenty with me as the hairs upon my head  sextus come my good brute why sit we still our lips are thirsty and with earnestness desire the beverage of the god put round put round  brutus we will so when we please brute say you brute are we not arbiter are we not royal king of the feast  brute brute sir in your teeth what brute indeed  aruns most noble arbiter  titus most royal king of the feast if it please your greatness the dignity and height of your large excellency  sextus most worthy and renowned absolute sir  brutus we are mollisied and bear not callous ears  sextus come then here is to the fairest nymph in italy and she is in rome  aruns here is to the fairest nymph in italy and she is not in rome  sextus where is she then  aruns ask collatine he will swear she is at collatia  sextus his wife  aruns even so  titus is it so collatine well it is praiseworthy in this vicious age to see a young man true to his own spouse  oh it is a vicious age  when i behold one who is bold enough to steer against the wind and tide of custom i behold him with veneration it is a vicious age  herminius to horatius true things are spoke in jest i like not this  horatius nor i  brutus  aside our youths are waxing warm  to my feigned part pretended sleep shall give some little pause  collatinus princes i ask you not to stay your mirth though i am the subject if to love my wifes ridiculous i will join the laugh though happily i shall not laugh at myself  aruns the conscious wood was witness to his sighs the conscious dryads wiped their watery eyes for they beheld the wight forlorn today and so did i  but i shall not betray  here now he is however thanks to me that is his semblance for his soul dwells hence  how was it when you parted she  my love fear not good sooth i will very constant prove  he  and so will i for wherefoeer i steer it is but this mortal clay my soul is here  sextus and pry thee collatine in what array did the god hymen come to thee how dressed and how equipped i fear me much he left his torch behind so that thou could not see a fault in thy beloved but have since judged by the touch alone or was the blaze so burning bright that thy bedazzled eyes have since refused their office  collatinus and does sextus judge by his own experience then of others to him i make no doubt has hymens torch discovered faults enough what pity twas he had not likewise in his other hand a mirror brought wherein to have read himself  sextus it is well i like thee now and this i answer now thou art gay i will be mighty grave and much we shall not lose by the interchange in sober sadness this my own experience has taught me this is my opinion of which i would not give a tittle up though straitlaced pallas should appear in person that women are most dear delicious inconstant creatures artful amorous fruitful in schemes to please their changeful fancies and fruitful in resources when discovered before assurance and a tongue wellhinged they fall by thousands a strait back a leg wellturnd and nimble cutting quick vaults well a lively eye yet in their presence bending as if oerawed these with the aforesaid graces will madden them by millions from the girl who feeds on chalk to the grave married matron who is so chaste forsooth she wipes her mouth after her husband lest the breath of man if settling there too long should taint her virtue i use them as they are their native passion i know is love of novelty however others more subaltern as love of riches grandeur and show may seem to oversway it hence though they swear they love me wondrous well after some little time i know the gentle and pretty creatures heed not the strict truth i know it is not for myself they love me so delicacy bids me rove again i please their darling passion and am blessed  collatinus this is the common cant the stale gross idle unmeaning jargon of all those who conscious of their own littleness of soul avoid with timid eye the face of modest virtue all those who to the name of womanhood join dignity of soul and innocence unstained by inward base desire who flushed with triumphs over those they dare attack the weak or forward those whose lines of feature proclaim there is no resistance to be made or those who spring obtrusive forth and meet halfway the doughty champions strait declare and fain would make their shallow notions current that womankind are all alike all arrant and willing daughters of the game and hoot at virtue wheresoever she passes by them i have seen sparks like these and i have seen a little worthless village cur all night bay with incessant noise the silver moon while she serene throned in her pearled car sailed in full state along  but sextus judgment owns not his words and the resemblance glances on others not on him  sextus let it glance where and upon whom it will sextus is mighty careless of the matter when to the moon we stray for similes it is to be feared our wit is lunatic however my intent went with my words now hear what i have seen i have seen some fathers who have with care kept up their daughters housed for no deformity of mind or person no not in the least though wherefore otherwise they chain them thus heaven knows i have seen men who have these monsters married pardon me i meant these extraordinary beauties young men indeed and novices that way and they at such a rate have doated on them   collatinus sextus no more lest i forget myself and thee i tell thee prince   aruns i tell you both  great king of gods and men why must we tonguetied sit and mute attending to brawls like these are these fit offerings for bacchus shrine he peaceful god delights in other gifts a plague upon you both if ye must needs rail thus stay till tomorrow and to it fasting  collatine think not i discommend thy warmth it is becoming  titus indeed i rate it high in estimation fidelity in love is a rare quality and merits praise but how much rarer is it and more deserving praise in married life hold sextus hold for shame  sextus why pray good sir may i not praise the wife of this same testy froward gentleman her shape slender and delicate her face breathing the air of beauty her sweet eyes their fire mellowly tempered though i never beheld her in my life yet why might not my tongue prompted by pregnant fancy form her a type of excellent perfection and from her person turning as i should had i not been withheld by interruption have on her many virtues descanted but on his cheek offense must quivering sit and dreamdof insult the abortive child of misconstruction whose nearsighted eye discerns not jest from real  collatinus and would sextus persuade me that i am indeed so weak as that my brain confused blends opposite and sundry kinds of fantasies together letting go all distinction that i read the acts and words of others always contrary to their intent even think so there is no harm in it i heed it not jest on i will aid your humor let aruns use me for his mirth and laughter and titus deck me with ironic praise with all my care i will foster the mistake nor shall my selfimportance undeceive you but when you touch a nearer dearer subject perish the man nay may he doubly perish who can sit still and hear with sneaking coolness the least abuse or shadow of a slight cast on the woman whom he loves though here your praise and blame are equally alike nor really add the least or take away from her a hundredth minim of a grain of her true value more than they would add to the holy gods or from their state diminish  aruns if that a man might dare to open his lips when collatinus frowns he i presume without incurring censure of profaneness or blasphemy against his domestic private conjugal goddess might enlarge upon the qualities belonging to his own i grant you that lucretia is divine i dont deny her apotheosis yet will i say my wife is not amiss that is taken as a woman your divinities need not regard the duties of the house their minds are too sublime it is theirs to range in quest of pleasure pleasure is divine and mortals must not think to grasp at it yet as a woman could my eyes but reach as far as rome i make no doubt they would see my wife far otherwise employed and better far better as a woman than the deity residing at collatia  titus and mine beyond them both employed more careful more housewife like  sextus welltimed i will seize the occasion view this lucretia ever i sleep and satisfy my senses whether bruiting fame says true aside i will stake my life and let us mount our horses and post away this instant toward rome that we shall find thy wife and his and his making the most of this their liberty what it is the sex enjoying to the full the swing of license which their husbands absence affords i will stake my life that this is true and that my own ill as i may deserve it knows her state best keeps best within the bounds her situation claims that she is with her family while yours are feasting at their neighbors houses or rioting at home  what say thou collatine  collatinus had i two lives i would stake them on the trial nor fear to live both out  sextus let us away then  aruns with all mine heart  titus and mine  collatinus what mean you pray you are not really mad  sextus he would retract what he has said but well proceed to trial you go with us by jupiter  collatinus is it right think you had we a cause more urgent thus to quit the camp should tarquin hear of it   sextus oh heed not tarquin pray you good sir peace well wing our horses well we may get there and back again ever the shrillsounding bird pipe to the morning star yet ever we go once let the flagon circle to our wives what says our arbiter  brutus starting out of his feigned sleep wives aye aye yes yes wives there is mine a paragon when time was aye and virtuous chaste as the lily aye and prudent too and a good housewife sour a little or so tart tart and humoursome sextus tarquin sextus you old kings youngest son say am i drunk i am not drunk by saturn you are aruns no you are sextus ah i love thee sextus i will be heard what do thou laugh at villain  to claudius who attends i am arbiter i say i am arbiter and to be laughed at why herminius laughed at why how what oh  pretends to sleep again  sextus what my unconquerable brute again deceased quite gone come crown the arbiter the empty bowl sit emblem of the head it sits upon  come let us haste to horse i long to see this phoenix of her sex this earthly deity this divine mortal who has alone possession taken of heaven and keeps out all the rest of women a plague it is rather hard on them rather in her shows not an overburthen of goodnature to hoard up all perfection in herself her qualities dealt forth among the rest would make them oreads dryads no contemptible objects of worship  collatine why grave tut man you are not the first that has mistaken a cloud for a substance women have fine outsides fair blushing cheeks and modestlooking eyes and tongues more sost  aye and hearts too hearts hearts my collatinus and in them  come come be gay  collatinus i am not sad  sextus but fearful for the event  collatinus not in the least  sextus a little  collatinus not a whit you do not know lucretia  sextus but we shall come without more delay do you along horatius and herminius  horatius we are ordered on duty by the king your father  sextus well even what you will  aruns but what of brutus there shall we take him with us  sextus oh by all means his shallow brain is soon oerflowed with wine and soon the quick tide ebbs and leaves him dry well to thy tent aruns let him sleep here just ever we mount our horses well send for him though he is so poor a brute yet some how custom makes necessary vile society come will you hence exeunt brutus alone poor poor indeed for no one is my friend and i am friend to none but i say false for i am a friend to all mankind but tyrants yet have i never known the dear affinity which springs from mutual trust when the full heart bounds to meet heart never felt the double joy caught from communication and fierce grief has in my breast emptied his store of arrows nor have i dared seek out one kind physician to pour his lenient balm pitied by some laughed at by most by my own wife despised who for convenience wedded as did i for sake of offspring would to heaven i had not for i have been no father to my sons i could be none their minds unschoold nay worse corrupt which they i fear and i shall rue and let us rue it friendship i give up and tear each private tie from my fixed heart happy beyond all possibility of small contracted life could i achieve that purpose  could achieve aye that is it  why can i not achieve it oh that gnaws i feel it deeply here  the tyrant lives a politic tyrant curse on s policy forever has he kept the state in motion nor given a resting place on which to set a foot against him war eternally abroad or works of slavery at home busy the youth of rome these last i know ill suit their freeborn minds and discontent sat lowering in their looks when they left rome the hopes of plunder only drew them thence and that forced ardour cooled by this delay they murmur in their hearts and curse the power and wild ambition which has brought them hither  enter claudius ho brutus  brutus say what would thou  claudius come with me  brutus thou might at least have said if i so please  claudius so please the princes did not please to say so  brutus go tell the princes then whether they please or thou i beat thee thus and thus  claudius o jove i will never jest with a fool more when he is drunk his wit lies in his hand  brutus begone unless thou waitest for the other blow and please to tell the princes i will be with them strait  exit claudius brutus this bears a face hold  let me see  to give these madmen now the slip and when they are gone rush in the midst of the camp put on myself and with the impetuous language of the soul rouse up the enthusiast flame  the soldiers without doubt will see the change with wonder and amaze and to possess them some god had wrought the miracle would be an holy lie which they perhaps would swallow and so their passions might be worked to a pitch even of desperation which would prove fatal to the archtyrant but these passions will soon subside and fond of novelty they will from the son expect a milder reign and by fair words and silver promises again be bubbled and repent too late and what becomes of me i die naught done or skulk away my life in banishment for ever preyed on by remorse not cheered by one faint gleam of what has long sustained me hope and which still forsakes me not besides his sons may have possession of the city and there are hostages the wives the children of all the soldiery sure certain pledges of their fidelity of this no more  as i am known to none for what i am to me all men are open and discover their inmost thoughts though not in words express yet in the speaking motions of their eyes and lines of face in which my mind unseen as the airy ministers reads those of others valerius is the soul of honesty brave generous hating arbitrary sway so is lucretius so are the prime of the army horatius and herminius say to these i should unsold myself i will tonight when i reach rome i will seek out the two first and if i find on trial they are apt will lay some share of the load on them which i have borne so long alone i think together ever leaden time shall creep on many a day we may contrive some glorious means to free our bleeding country from the savage gripe of lawless power heal all her festering wounds and once again attire her in the robes of godlike freedom exit scene ii rome lucretius to a servant if any messenger comes from the camp or with particular and urgent business you will find me with valerius otherwise to whomsoeer enquires give for an answer that i am gone abroad you know not whither  servant i shall my lord  lucretius this night in undisturbed society i will commune with valerius what a man in whom i doubt which most to admire the strict severity of manners he possesses and unaffected virtue which might well become the days of yore ever saturn left these our hesperian fields and the just maid sought the supernal mansions or the unfeigned and pious love he bears his bleeding country or the sincere strongbeaming warmth of friendship friendship oh truly glorious name not that giddy and thoughtless which instinctively leads tward a fancied good deluded youth by health begotten and quick flow of spirits often fading from the moment it is born not that which courtiers deal in and the knave professes to his mate which lasts no longer than shines the sun of fortune but which proved by true experiment and frequent use is found a settled principle a tie strengthened by habit what is fair and honest linked to what is fair and honest sure the man who knows not this is wretched he who knows it can never be totally unhappy exit enter brutus to the servant belongst thou to lucretius  servant yes  brutus i pry thee tell him unless business of consequence employs his time i fain would speak with him  servant he that would speak with him at present wants what he is not likely to obtain  brutus why so if he is at home   servant but if he is not at home  my if for yours  brutus but know thou where he is  servant perhaps i do what then  brutus acquaint me where he may be spoke withal  servant bring you a message came you from tarquin  brutus no  servant then i know not where you can find him  brutus but he must be found matters of moment have i to impart and what concern him nearly  servant nothing material can he have i warrant his company may always well be spared aside i know not where he is nor can i give directions where to find him but some time ever midnight he will return or if you stay until the morning chance is on your side but you may see him  brutus prythee honest friend   servant honest indeed but not a fool i trow  brutus do thou know me  servant oh mighty well good night i mean not to get cold by waiting on you exit brutus alone thus it is we plan and thus our favorite schemes are blasted in the bud we travel on the road of life we cast our sight far forward we think we spy the goal our eyes are fixed and fancy gives us earnest of possession meanwhile ten thousand thousand accidents each as minute and imperceptible as the fine floating threads of midsummer obliquely cross us small yet strong as fate our progress is denied the nerves of action are firmly fettered as with idle toil we strive to extricate ourselves dark night steals on we fall and happily never rise again never see the ruddy face of morn or lost in fogs and mists rove darkling till arrived at where we first set out we strive again again are baffled by the sturdy trifles and sink at last fatigued and quite overcome into the arms of death sorrowful thought but yet in strictness true  come life come death he has not lived in vain who so has lived to satisfy himself  poor argument in reason good in practice weak  for me i am not satisfied nor will be satisfied missing the mark  tut  this is womans play mere words mere words  deeds are the test of man and there i fail a pufillanimous tame indolent vile driveler  but cease cease can i command occasion wrest the sway of mortal things from the strong rule of heaven and to my will bend the reluctant step of coy contingency o you high powers into your hands do i resign myself might i be used the humble instrument to free my country oh how blessed were i if rome must sink if i must live in vain and die as i have lived i will not murmur i am nothing you are wise and just and good  yet why not seek valerius heaven and earth it is too late here come the rioters i cannot escape them yet a time may be  yet hence despair still thou and i are twain  enter sextus titus collatinus aruns aruns may they all hang or starve or drown themselves and may each several kind of death be mine when i again presume to promise aught upon a womans head  titus we are trappd indeed and collatine will bear away the bell  sextus i do not think so man what though our wives love music there is music at collatia what though they love dancing and jollity there are trim gallants at collatia what though they love feasting and revelry are they not feasts and revels at collatia  aruns but such a hubbub such a monstrous din so wild a roar i never heard before i could have sworn the frantic bacchanals were come from thrace the shrieks of the sabine maids when ravished were not heard so far away as this shrill mirth i feared to pass the threshold and trembled for my head yet it was well that they were all together for it saved our precious time yet do not triumph collatine or rather triumph now for now thou may crestfallen shall thou be anon  collatinus for me to triumph were absurd more sober joy believe me shall be mine as for my crest i trust a single fiber of the plume shall not be soiled tonight  sextus well try that soon whom have we here hah it is our runaway come hither fugitive where have thou been how daredst thou leave us what art doing here  brutus doing here i was doing naught at all at yonder corner of the street i missed you and thought you turned this way  sextus my witty brute give thee a possibility of wrong and thou will never go right  brutus i could not help it twas no fault of mine i came this way and deemed that i was right though balked by fortune i could not attain the soughtfor end but will you turn again toward my house shall we not see my wife  sextus thy wife without a doubt well see thy wife but not at present some weeks hence or months will serve the turn and in the interim take heed thou give her warning of our purpose that she may be at home  now to our horses come hurry it grows late i am all impatience to place this haughty sir on an equality with those he seems to mock a little hour will turn the laugh when he may dear repent this fancied mastership  collatinus proceed and try speak at your leisure  sextus so sanguine still so full of hopes  collatinus so sure in stable knowledge  sextus vain selfflattery i will hear no more haste haste brutus before and lead the way  the alertness of our chief methinks should animate us  titus certainly  aruns it does i haste with all convenient speed exeunt scene iii collatia lucretia at work with her maids lucretia i thank thee for thy tale lavinia though little heeded it would raise my mirth sometimes though now i could not but retreat to that which clelia had before related and did thou know the youth my clelia  clelia full well i knew him twas my sisters son often ever he died for he was long a dying i went to see him oftimes he ran over each circumstance of his unhappy love and the cold scorn which preyed upon his heart and when his cheeks were wan and his fair eyes which once the liveliest that ever glanced the flame of ardent faithful passion were grown dim and scarce to be perceived when his strength sailed and in a low weak tone he called me to him entreated me if ever i esteemed him to keep the secret from the cruel maid nor offer his departed soul a violence by giving of her pain then with a feeble and trembling motion pressed my hand to his bosom till i was almost dead as well as he  lucretia and what became of her i think thou said she with remorse was seized and at the hour of midnight starting from her bed sought out the grave where he was buried  clelia there she died i think that with the assistance of camilla i can make out a dittie which was framed on that occasion but it is melancholy and you have heard enough of woe already  lavinia oh for the sake of heaven keep to yourself your gloomy dirge remember that my mistress lies all alone she will not wink an eye or if she does will dream of them and wake in sad affright  lucretia oh fear not my lavinia though much i like these tales of native woe i have no superstition and no fears which will disturb repose how thou art moved i know not but to me a pleasing calm succeeds these narratives of grief oerpast and though i sympathise when they are told it is a joy i would not be without for always in my mind lavinia the soft delight which feeling pity brings though but indulged a moment far excels an age of wanton gay festivity which the vague soul enjoys not while it tastes clelia begin camilla you assist her  ballad   daughter of fruitless woe arise and quit this yewtrees noxious shade over nature midnight brooding lies and poisonous vapors load the glade ii ah gentle stranger leave i pray a wretch with woe forlorn like me i wish to be alone thy stay does but augment my misery iii daughter of fruitless woe arise the clouds of heaven begin to lour the cold northeast now bleakly flies and drives along the sleety shower iv stranger in vain thou seekst to move this pillow shall support my head this grave in which lies my true love ah when alas shall i be dead v daughter of fruitless woe arise do thou not know how vain thy tears can thou recall him by thy sighs will he return to all thy prayers vi stranger thou did not know the youth nor yet the love to me he bore thou were no witness to his truth never heardst thou his persuasive lore vii too well i know my fruitless woe can never recall his vital breath but i to his embrace can go and seek him in the house of death viii daughter of fruitless woe arise alas to ears all deaf i speak cold damps suffuse her dying eyes lifes quivering beam forsakes her cheek  lucretia thanks clelia thanks camilla in this humor i will pray unto the gods and then to rest aside how wears the night my damsels are your tasks near ended  gracious powers who enters here my lord most welcome   enter collatinus titus sextus brutus aruns collatinus welcome these my friends lucretia our right royal masters sons passing this way i have prevailed with them to honor our poor house  lucretia welcome yourself and doubly welcome that you bring such friends to whom i offer silent thankfulness my heart is full of joy  retire my damsels and think on other work  aruns rather fair lady you should be angry that unseasonably and with abrupt intrusion we have thus broke upon your privacy  lucretia no my good lord those to whom my love and my respect is due can never intrude upon me had i known this visit you perhaps might have been treated with better cheer not a more kind reception this evening little did i think my house would have possessed such lodgers  titus rather lady such birds of passage we must hence tonight  lucretia to night does not my lord say no to that  collatinus i would lucretia but it cannot be if the house yields a small collation to set before your guests i pray prepare it we must be at the camp ever morning dawn an hour or two will be the utmost limit allowed us here  lucretia with all the speed i can i will play the caterer though i am tempted would that delay your journey to be tardy and prove a sluggish housewife exit aruns this is indeed a wife here the dispute must end henceforth there is no comparison i could have sworn it was not in my nature to envy any married man his bargain nor do i envy thee but it is a wife of wives i cannot but own a jewel picked from out the common pebbles to have found her at work among her maids at this late hour plying the needle is not strange at all when i have seen what i beheld just now and yet i could not have believed even that but to be pleased at our rude interruption not to squeeze out a quaint apology as i am quite ashamed so unprepared who could have thought would i had known of it and suchlike tacit hints to tell her guests she wishes them away this carriage causes some little wonder  envy no  yes  no i give thee joy my friend and yet her beauty might in some men raise envy but i know not what envy means  you are happy collatine thou must be happy if thou know thy happiness what think thou brutus  brutus happiness consists in thought in thinking that is to say that happiness is ours if we are happy  that is to say we are happy if we think that happiness is ours then we are happy  aruns that is all true or that is to say in verity thy words are truly wise the cream of rhetoric and marrow of morality is thine  titus i must express my satisfaction too and glad i am that our dispute occasioned this journey hither if once collatine complained of my ironic praise his conscience must tell him i am sincere when i affirm i think him blessed beyond comparison in such a peerless dame  collatinus enough enough the gods forbid i should affect indifference and say you flatter me i am most happy but sextus heeds us not he seems quite lost  aruns regard him not these reveries you know are common to him he will soon recover  sextus to himself had she staid here till now i should have done nothing but gaze nymphs goddesses are fables nothing can in heaven or earth be half so fair venus in flesh and blood loves true divinity if such the charms which meet the eye oh what delicious beauties with what a frenzy of delight  but these the husband must alone  to me the senses are bounded yet my warm imagination pregnant with rapture   aruns brutus go and wake yon absent dreamer  brutus what ho sextus sextus  sextus what ho sir brute come sir a salian dance well done most brisk and active why a nimbler and lighter heel an attitude more graceful i never beheld by jove i will recommend thee to the priests and thou shall head the band what say thou and spite of thy nickname well have it posted in flaming characters upon thy back this is a man lest by thy motions cheated the people take thee for a bear  what mean thou how dare thou laugh at me am i thy jest say sir  brutus i know not what you mean not i i did not laugh say did i aruns titus  aruns you did i needs must say it  titus and at him  brutus at him i never laughed at him in all my life  titus nay then thou did at us  aruns what do thou see in us ridiculous are our faces changed look we like monkeys are our noses flattend and tails grown out  brutus nay now i see you laugh at me now are you not in jest i pray was you not sextus yes you think perhaps i cannot see through it when you laugh at me but i perhaps read men a little deeper than you imagine  aruns why i never doubted of thy sagacity i always found thee most wise most apt shrewd quick and capable yet when thou please to relax thy wit leaves me in doubt whether i should prefer the mirthengendering friend or cool adviser  brutus that is spoken like himself now that is like aruns  titus brutus i heard the strangest thing last week   brutus aye aye what was it tell me ar brut tit coll apart sextus i must and will  what then i do not care marriage a trick nature never meant it  marriage why how dare any man assume a right to keep from me that beauty heaven created tinflame my soul when looked on and placed there passions to take the alarm and with wild wing rush maddening tward the object they desire i must possess her but her chastity  away frosty idea  others chaste have seemed and but have seemed the snow would lie for ages unassaild by the warm air but should she  force no no and yet why not peace undigested thoughts down down till ripened by farther time ye bloom titus and aruns laughing aruns to titus who sextus yes i have seen such an one i saw him at the siege of ardea i thought he was a soldier of indifferent moderate valor twas reported though a little fearful but being son to the king the common people dared but mutter it  sextus i thank you what you think me meditating i know not but both now and heretofore my mind was in the camp how wine could heat us to such a mad exploit at such a time is shameful to reflect on let us mount this instant and return  collatinus now we are here we shall incroach but little on our time if we partake the slender fare together which will by this await us pray my lords this way  sextus along i will follow strait  ye walls disclose not my dark conceptions i will ere long return till when my soul by this fierce sting tormented will rage unsatisfied and feel no rest exit end of the third act act iv scene i the camp aruns titus aruns a knave a baseborn knave but if he does not severely pay for the insult  such a villain i offered him the value of his horse he would not part with it not he he would not but force perforce he shall a slave  a traitor  i will have the horse were there a guard around it of fifty thousand men all of them knights  aye and his head to boot  titus what brother has the wind affronted you talk you to air and chide the passing gale for blowing in your face  aruns he had the assurance to reason with me too but if i do not mar all his reasoning for the future may i  what titus  titus even he  aruns you see me moved  would you have thought it such a paltry base illmannerd groom a roman knight do you call him a roman hind  a vile unpolished hind  an unlickd cub   titus say who is this my brother  aruns who is this he there  what do you call him fabius a knight a villain but may all the gods lay on me all their heaviest punishments if he within these two hours does not treat the hungry worms nay and i will mount his horse the horse he loves so well the horse he would not part with to me i will mount that very horse and make him prance upon the very spot where his warm corpse lies buried and ram in his earthen bed full closely round about him then see who will reason who will pretend to prate then see   titus why what is this i hear of fabius of fabius and a horse and threats on threats be calm be cool  aruns i have not been in a passion no not in the least but if i dont make him a fearful specimen of my revenge a lesson to be read with shivering horror by all the knights in the army  if i do not never may my pallid cheek again be red never may my wrinkled brow again be smooth never may the flash of anger quit my eye may my whole visage never regain its turn of native feature if i am not revenged may all the complicated ills of life assail me  titus oh ye gods how passion alters the noblest of your works and is this aruns is this the son of tarquin this the brother of sextus and of titus fie fie fie what turned a woman had my wife thus raged in impotence of words denied a bauble i should not thus have wondered oh for shame had thou desired what thou could not possess i might forgive thee could thou not revenge i might excuse this storming with thy tongue but when thou may possess what thou desire and when revenge attends upon thy beck ready to punish insult why this clamor this idle ineffectual rhapsody of empty words  aruns empty or not i reck not i spoke to please myself must i be curbed by every one not speak nay titus stay you leave me not  titus then prythee speak to the purpose  aruns i will speak of this same horse no other theme and of the baseborn varlet who bestrode it a currish miscreant but that is no matter should one of phoebus steeds tire in his wain this would supply its place a whoreson slave i asked him if he would exchange with me and bade him cull my stud  the head so formed answering in nicest symmetry each limb  such harmony of shape such just proportion i never saw strength with beauty so combined an eye of fire a neck clad in effulgence and glorious as the arched bow of heaven  he told me twas the only thing he loved his sole delight his pride asked me if i would willingly give up the thing i loved suppose my mistress begged i would not desire him was sorry that he must refuse me would i give him the best italia ever produced nay give him three for one in brief he could not he would not part with it  such a fine creature it never was got by mortal sire the dam must have been by the northern wind impregnd the grass bends not beneath his feet he is swifter in his career than is a morning sunbeam and graceful as the wing of mercury sliding to earth upon an azure cloud the herald of the gods a vital spirit informs each fiber and directs its motions  titus enough enough  aruns no it is not enough this horse is mine it shall be mine at least i would not part with it for half a kingdom poor foolish fabius little does he think my minister of vengeance dogs his heels when thou dismountest fabius clap his neck speak lovingly to him as thou were wont take thy last leave nor see the hand of death aimed at thy unarmed side  enter claudius aruns is the deed done  claudius fabius is fled my lord  aruns fled say thou whither  claudius suspecting as i think my lord some ill and conscious of his just deserts he rode toward the postern gate i followed him resolved to execute what you commanded far off upon the distant hills appeared a band of the rutilian foragers he both his spurs stuck in his horses sides gave him the reign and mingled with them strait they shouted wheeled away toward the right and soon escaped my eye  aruns thou were too slow my purpose known thou should have put on wings as quick as thought thou were too slow too slow  claudius my lord unless i had been more than human and could have trod with step invisible and swifter than the passing moments do i could not have done more it was impossible  aruns impossible tut there is a word impossible there is no such thing but in the vapid brain of fools and cowards why thou sluggish varlet do thou not know it  claudius what my gracious lord  aruns if thou do not go hence about thy business and dream of it by the way  exit claud no matter though he that lets slip an opportunity deserves to lose the sight of it for ever it is but an accident it does not signify  titus why thou art quite become the slave of humor tetchy and froward as a squalling child of two months old ever dissatisfied unless he feels the nipple in his mouth or cries himself asleep  aruns oh heavenly wisdom i see thy shining progress mid the stars brightening the galaxy to thee the orbs pay adoration from their lucent spheres thou crownst the everlasting fount of day with dazzling radiance thou leadst on the year the seasons in their varied liveries and more than all the rest inspirst the soul of thy warm votary titus  let me feel oh sacred goddess but the faintest touch of thy benignity and i will look with such a gravity an air so solemn as does thy bird from out the hollow oak circled with clasping ivy  oh what pity that i should pray in vain who pray so seldom what then remains to hurl a curse or two at that blind strumpet fortune who takes care always to break my shins with her damned wheel to laugh in spite of her a peevish laugh to wish all men no happier than myself to wish that i were such a fool as brutus as they are happiest whose sense is smallest since i cannot be so wise so sage as titus and so farewell i will even go to my tent and try if i can sleep out this long siege for waking slumber is the worst of sleep and so farewell  titus farewell  aruns but stay inform me if all thy gravity and wisdom knows where sextus leads his vagrant feet last night i missed him privately as i am informed he left the camp but for his destination i could not learn it know thou  titus no i know not  aruns i might have guessed so twere a thing as easy to say when last jove put on his disguise slunk out at heavens back gate and what alcmena received him to her arms a plague on secret mysterious hidden letchery i say why cannot a man be open in his dealings give me the easy fair who will not blush though the broad sun should stare her full in the face a plague on pains taking your fly intriguers are the only whoremasters all the rest are chaste and fornication is necessity imagination must forsooth be tickled your squeamish stomachs must be tantalized ever they will be hungry hence your amorous parlies whispering from windows squeezing of the hand glances the lewd interpreters of thought hence all the monkey tricks which even the woman who causes laughs at  foh i am sick to death  such worse than asses in the shape of men a pimping pleasure too not worth the toil of stretching out an arm thus far when juno will be my paramour i will turn gallant get me a pair of wings and every night mount up to her etherial bedchamber till when i leave intrigues to thee and sextus and so farewell i will to my contemplations exit titus i know thy contemplations well beneath that garb of chiding spleen and discontent ambition couches though thou seem unsteady as the vague moon now gay as florio spring intent upon delight now clouded over and four as bleak december rating in the morn what thou in the evening prizedst yet the eagle looks not with eye more fixed upon the sun than thou on royalty i have seen thee through and sextus is not so enslaved to pleasure but that ambition claims the upper seat in his aspiring mind i have seen through both three kings at once no that can never be one only bird arises from the ashes of the imperial phoenix in the sky there is but one glorious light let tarquin die and these young scyons must not spoil the growth of the elder towering oak to oertop their heads and keep them down cannot perhaps be done they grow too quick but still they may be blasted the cankerworm may prey on them in secret or one good blow of a keen axe urged home in all their pride of foliage lays them low  but peace sextus i see is near at hand enter sextus sextus well met what you have i will warrant you from when the sun left his wavequilted couch full of anxiety and watchful care been traversing the camp how stand the soldiers affected to their duty do thou think our ditch and palisades will guard us well and is the rampart strong in every quarter or have thou been a spy toward the city keep they the guard of the wall with usual strictness have thou found out a weaker place unknown or has thy working brain yet wove the net or limed the twig or dug the fatal pitfall for their destruction  sextus every hour of time has got its business allotted to it there is an hour for war and vigorous action there is an hour for counsel and advice there is an hour for wine and noise and madness there is an hour for pleasure and the feats which wanton venus ever joys to look on last night my titus   titus was the hour of time when sextus   sextus prythee take the fact at once lay with lucretia  why that mooneyed stare lay with lucretia  do thou understand me lay with lucretia  need i to repeat it it is what my tongue could dwell upon with rapture through the infinite descent of rolling ages let my eyes sparkling with the newcaught joy let my cheeks stained with a more genial hue let all the dancing transports which play over my face let these two arms which held her close in twined embrace let these two lips which kissed her sucked in her charms and now still taste the impression let every atom of this body tell thee that i enjoyed lucretia  titus what the wife of collatine thy friend thy kinsman  sextus the wife of collatine my friend my kinsman nearer related now indeed than ever but what is titus conscience then grown squeamish was it debauched last night that it is so sickly so puling in the morning  titus not a whit but struck with some astonishment however lucretia and the wife of collatine by her consent too  sextus yes  titus by some sly trick then some damned insidious circumvention some dark thick plot some artifice closecouchd of cunning stratagem or else through fear of some worse ill than death say now how was it for if there ever was among the sex or purity or innocence twas there she could not be a hypocrite her face her look her outward manners spoke a heart unknowing of deceit a soul of honor where frozen chastity had fixed her feat and unpolluted nuptial sanctity i do suspect thee much it is but a boast or else an act of low of mean revenge to blast that virtue which thy utmost efforts can never subdue  sextus sextus is wont to boast of favors which he never received or take a pleasure in thin unsubstantial mischief  titus no i acquit thee there  sextus even as thou will but i suspect shrewdly thou enviest me which more to raise know that this soul of honor this piece of unthawd snow this pattern rare of nuptial purity i found to be a woman found her all alone at midnight found her in bed undressed found her reluctant found her indeed chaste to outrageousness though that but added fuel to the flame yet used no violence and yet enjoyed her  titus thou talk in riddles  sextus hear then the plain truth now two nights since when first we saw lucretia her air her voice her look her every motion inkindled passion in me even to madness thou do remember how my soul was buried in senselessness to every object round though then perhaps thou did not guess the cause i swore then to possess her all that evening she unadvisedly with new incentives stirred up my purpose but quite unresolved how to pursue that purpose i last night again went thither only one attendant accompanied me business of importance feigned for my quick return her husbands friend and tarquins son she could not but receive a nightly guest yet in her eye methought she bore no great good will to tarquins son she without doubt had heard his character and hard twas to dissemble i naught heeded this air of coldness but with sage discourse and temperate entertained her talked of modesty of selfdenying virtue of strict honor and mutual holy faith twixt man and man of wedlocks happy league and the young brood of smiling innocents then turned my talk to battles sieges dreadful deeds of arms adventures rare by martial prowess won a subject to the which all womankind open a greedy ear but not a word of love nor yet a sally of loose thought escaped me thus i fell in with her humor and unsuspecting she retired to rest  titus and whither thou but i will not interrupt thee  sextus now was the depth of midnight silence reigned through all the house not the least sound was there you might have heard a feather fall to the ground and sleep on every brow had fixed his dead and leaden hand as nature lent her aid to my design kind nature lent her aid nor i refused the call with cautious tread suppose thou see me entering the room where lay that sleepy venus in one hand my sword a lamp in the other think thou see me reading her naked charms think but thou can not it is impossible had thou not seen her what i then felt my soul was all on fire my limbs all trembled and my salient heart beat as twould find a passage through my ribs half between sleep and wake lucretia cries art come my lord but when she thoroughly waked what a wild look of horror and surprise she knew my purpose well or if she did not i kept her not in long suspense nor wasted the time in vain apology my sword threatened her instant death without compliance and willingly she cried yes willingly i will die ten thousand deaths oh my dear lord where where art thou oh sextus i conjure thee by every sacred every tender name make me not despicable to myself but slay me and i will thank thee  all that feeling passionate nature could suggest she uttered  titus and did thou still proceed did thou not find thy bosom moved  sextus i did but with desire for fear had from her every other thought removed her hair disheveled hid but loosely her blaze of beauties as she kneeling strove to clasp my knees i raised her and embraced she shrieked aloud fearing she might awake the menial train i had but one resource i rushed forth to the door where i had placed my trusty slave and dragging him by s locks swore i would slay them both upon her bed and publish to the world i caught them there in the act of shame she found resistance vain the conflict twixt the dread of public infamy and private crime inwrappd her in despair i marked the strugglings of her soul and seized the joy she would but dared not to refuse  titus thus having spoke forever hold thy tongue my breast is not cast in that tender mould strongly to feel the goadings of compunction nor have i dealt in those punctilious niceties which bind the vulgar but this act of thine almost calls up the water in my eye and raises new emotions in my heart for her i am touched with pity and on thee i look with something tending toward horror oh hold thy tongue never mention what thoust done lest that the very earth on which thou treadst cry out against thee  sextus this rebuke from thee this to a stranger urge to him who knows thee not and he may be deceived i cannot but laugh when i behold hypocrisy arrayed in the unbecoming robe she stole from virtue not hiding half her nakedness come swear by all the gods and gulp down the perjury that all thy life has been inculpable that thou have never broke the chains of wedlock nor ever wilt and then to prove thy truth lust after the next roman dame thou see and as you are wont pursue her to possession  titus whatever artifice i may have used however with bribes corrupted or with prayers assailed the silly soul of yielding woman never did i use the argument of force  sextus because thou never metst with the temptation  titus it is just i well deserve his infidelity nor have so lived as to be credited aside but setting this apart do thou behold no future perils from this bold effect of unrestrained desire compelled to suffer what she detested in the frantic rage or deep despair of violated virtue may she not to her husband or her father disclose the cause  sextus what then thou think her something superhuman did i not tell thee that she was a woman and on my life she will act like any woman with words like these she will lull her frantic rage and puff the depth of her despair away it is done and cannot be undone it is not known so there is no harm guilt is no guilt in secret why should i make myself a wretch by blabbing why tell my husband what he cannot find out sextus must love me wonderfully well or he would never have undergone this hazard no marvel though when beauty such as mine enticed him then she looks upon her mirror vanity shows her figure passing fair she smiles and thus proceeds beauteous as ever why what a peevish thing this virtue is and sextus is a prince and what is collatine now comes she mark me to comparisons what is collatine a private man ambition now flits before her eyes and she is blinded to hold the prince a captive in her chains grandeur is hers and pomp and dignity and all the world holds dear and precious oh your strongworking passions never last long she cooled ever i had mounted on my horse ever i had rode ten paces she saw things in the same light which i have represented and now no longer coy reserved and stubborn sends off a messenger to invite me back oh i shall riot after this my titus and shall possess her to satiety  titus if thou art not found a deceitful prophet i will give up all pretensions to the reading any event hereafter it cannot be i wish we may not all repent of this at least i see perplexity and trouble which will ensue inevitably  sextus whence can danger come her father and her husband  and will they dare to think of a revenge they may as well contrive to wrest the club from the hand of hercules but lest mischance should work a miracle as for the husband i will give ever long a good account of him if he does not meet death placed in the way of every mortal sally there are means to bring him to his grave and mother earth is a most admirable vengeancecooler as for the father riches are a crime which the hand of tarquin never fails to punish upon due accusation  but our father has he enquired for me or found me absent  titus i do believe he has not  sextus well well go this instant to his tent from thence to mine where we will hold some farther intercourse touching these loose imperfect hints i have offered exeunt scene ii collatine brutus collatine no more  my business is not of that consequence or private nature but that thy society upon the road will be acceptable nay and when we arrive at rome well go together to the dwelling of lucretius and i will take care no servant shall again refuse thee entrance what then would with him if thou will not reveal keep to thyself i shall not trouble thee  brutus whatever it is you will know in time perhaps too with no small degree of pleasure  collatine yes it may be so enter a messenger whence come thou thus begrimd with dust and faint and breathless with fatigue how is lucretia is all well   messenger i know no more than that i bring this letter which i was ordered to convey to you with utmost speed another messenger was sent at the same time with the same orders to rome unto lucretius  collatine reading a deed too dreadful for my pen to write  extremity  without delay  bring with you one only friend  eternal gods what means this a friend the time is precious i will take him  a moment cannot be lost to cull and choose will thou with me lucius i know thou will haste then this moment bring our horses forth what dire portending mystery my mind attempts in vain to fathom it  if sickness  that cannot be she would have told me so  her father sent for too with equal speed thought wastes but time come lucius hence with me we go not now to rome but to collatia exeunt scene iii collatia lucretia alone oh agony of agonies down heart  down swelling bosom  o shame shame shame covered with shame  oh conscious innocence where art thou fled long inmate in my breast are we forever parted shall my soul no more attend thy gentle whisperings or when i rise in early morn or when i seek my bed of slumber where by thee shadowed calm sleep and happy dreams were mine no more no more must i never see again my husbands face with joy never to my heart strain him with rapture while he too with joy would listen to my tale of tenderness no never never no lucretia thou that were once chaste pure and virtuous art now polluted vile abominable how i detest myself wretch that i am how loathsome to my soul which fain would fly from out its odious prison  why had i not braved the adulterers sword so had i fallen a spotless victim yet so too my name would have been rendered infamous declared a most abandoned prostitute no tongue my vindicator and the bleeding proof of my supposed sin weltering by my side  bitter alternative dreadful to think on turn turn reflection for across thy course lies madness and each desperate deed of frenzy i cannot bear it  enter lavinia say did you call my mistress  lucretia no  begone  yet stay come hither is thy lord arrived  lavinia he is not madam  lucretia would to heaven he were fixing her eyes on the ground  lavinia what fatal accident has caused this misery i know not but so good so kind a mistress never had servants never till this instant heard i a word expressive of impatience come from her lips good heavens what load of grief works in her breast and labors for its birth would that i could remove that look of woe from that sweet face i would myself endure no small misfortune  that still silent anguish pierces me through i would speak to her but sobs will not suffer me  lucretia what ails thee art not well why do thou weep  lavinia ah can you ask me madam what ails thee do i not behold you miserable  lucretla i am indeed lavinia  but thy lords arrival will heal all  i prythee go and quickly to the end of the garden wall and when thou see him at a distance haste and bring me word  lavinia i will oh you good gods give her relief pour comfort in her bosom exit lucretia that was a look of prayer of prayer for me may it with blessings fall on her own head a thousand fold for me the time is over fruitless are all petitions unless jove could bid the past be as it had not been could render void existence root out memory poor honest wretch i could methinks drop tears in sympathy with her but for myself not one have i to spare my griefs too great it is all within no tears but tears of blood can speak my feelings or wash off my guilt what though with all the abhorrence virtue knows when forced to look on sin i saw the deed yet twas committed twas permitted too fatal necessity oh wherefore was i formed all alive to honors nicest sense why from my mothers breast did i imbibe its generous pride why foster it with care brood over it delighted hold it here more precious than a diamond of price if thus   enter lavinia lavinia madam my lord is just arrived with him your father and valerius and lucius junius  lucretia it is well  tremble not heart keep fast thy fixed intent formed from that moment this daggers point is sharp but sharper far the tongue of calumny its wounds more painful sharper the loss of that selfsatisfaction with which in the happier days of purity thou could thyself contemplate and admire can i endure to move the spectacle perhaps of insult and exulting baseness glorying over humbled virtue can i bear to see the gaze of curiosity the nod the whispers or to be at all marked out as something that is peculiar or can i bear myself and my own thoughts no thou must die lucretia thou must die hark hark it is they  how shall i bear my husbands and fathers faces oh support me heaven this once support me in this interview the thoughts of which almost take life away oh how shall i go through it  enter collatine lucretius valerius brutus collatine how is it lucretia how does my dearest wife  lucretius my daughter say why have thou sent for us  lucretia nay come not near me  thou must not call me wife thou my dear lord prized by me as my soul nor thou my father whom from my infancy unto this day i have beheld almost with adoration thou must not call me daughter thou valerius must not call me thy friend nor lucius thou i am not now myself cut off deprived of every near relationship each name of tender estimation i am lost  lost to my friends lost to myself  collatine what accident of more than human power can cancel thus thy interest in my breast i must embrace thee press thee close to my heart call thee my wife my best beloved faithful wife assure thee that all thy grief is mine  oh calm this ecstasy thou shakst all over as in an ague fit and deadly pale now throws upon thy cheek a hue like to the grave now suddenly glowing with hot vermilion  lucretius oh lucretia believe me when i tell thee not thy mother was dearer to me when as chaste and pure as dians self blooming in innocence i led the virgin to her bridal bed than thou her pledge and lively pourtraiture no nothing can withdraw my love from thee while like that pattern of her sex thou live and so thy life has been in thee wellpleased i have beheld her form revived her virtues and femalegracing ornaments of soul  lucretia there was a time when praises from that mouth would have thrilled through my secret mind with pleasure tuned to harmonious selfcomplacency discovered in each corresponding action winged with alacrity and joy but now it is far far otherwise thou good old man these words have pierced me to the quick  my pain was keen enough before why would thou make it doubly excruciating why bring my guilt in stronger colors to my view  collatine thy guilt not heaven itself is freer from all taint of guilt or the least stain of blame than thou is reason thine  lucretia reason is mine indeed  though i could envy those who are distracted the mad is happier on his bed of straw than the poor wretch bereaved of innocence who yet esteems that innocence though lost and who with fixed eye gazing on her is hurried into evil  lucretius explain thyself  how dreadful is thy prelude keep not thus in torturous suspense thy father husband and friends  lucretia oh would one word could tell it all can you not guess the whole when i name sextus the youngest son of tarquin  brutus  aside curse on the name i fear  i fear  luckless undone lucretia  valerius say what of him  lucretius speak daughter speak  collatine from him what ill could flow to thee thou never saw him but once and that the other night brought here by me say what is this lucretia  lucretia would i had seen him but that other night or would that other night that i had died a sudden death but a sad fatal night has passed between oh tongue perform thine office and tell my husband that these eyes beheld him that second night tell him  oh collatine oh hide me hide me from myself  how vain no let me stand and dare your piercing eyes with bold assurance wherefore are they fixed all fixed in silence on the ground on me direct them full lo here i stand the mark of shame of ignominy  lucretius daughter patience if without thy consenting heart this deed   lucretia no twas by my consent he would have slain his slave and me laid both on the same bed then published to the world that i with him was a vile base adulteress  lucretius oh woe is me off off ye hoary hairs oh daughter ruined ruined yet in virtue  collatine burst heart oh how shall i find utterance  valerius damned be the wretch doubly and trebly damned when forth he walks may the red flaming sun strike him with livid plagues may he be shunned by all mankind be odious to himself breed vipers in his conscience gnawing vipers wish hourly for his death yet be in tortures a thousand years expiring  if this fate attends on virtue let us to the stews for wives bring up our daughters prostitues no more let holy wedlock be esteemed but rank commixture like the general herd of beasts inform the dwellings of mankind  brutus  aside oh noble warmth from forth a generous mind with such a colleague might i shake the tarquins from off their throne now is the time arrived  but stay  nor yet let me unfold myself  collatine when came he hither say lucretia  lucretia last evening in the dark affairs of consequence brought him he told me to collatia my soul above suspicion thought no ill i entertained him as became myself and him at midnight to my chamber stole the ruffian  witness all ye powers above i heeded not the sword which armed his hand i prayed for death with greater earnestness than the departing miser prays for life he told me of his love his odious love entreated promised intermingled threats assailed on every side my womans soul at length dragged in his slave and would have slain us together on the bed  collatine oh fool fool fool vainglorious boaster that could not conceal thy treasure but rather than not be known to be possessed of wealth must take the thief the first notorious thief thou metst and show him the glittering store unhooded let him trace each winding avenue and give to him a guiding clue by which whenever he pleased he might return and bear it all away oh my lucretia all the fault is mine to me may guilt with justice be imputed thou art as free as the young innocent hid in its mothers womb  lucretia yes collatine believe me when i tell thee not the least wish that ere was formed in deepest secrecy has my soul breathed toward another man yet though my mind is free my bodys guilty the load from thence recoils upon my mind which shrinks beneath as shunning intercourse with its polluted yokemate death must break these links of union ere she can be happy  lucretius what say thou death oh daughter hold i charge thee the thought is horrible it harrows up my soul committing there the wildest waste i charge thee if thou have the least regard for this old hoary head which many a time when thou unconscious young one sleptst full sound hung over thee and surveyed thy infant face with tenderness fondest love unsay that word let me conjure thee by thy mothers memory by all her soft anxieties for thee her sleepless nights and busy days attendant upon thy welfare from thy breast unharbour that rash intruding thought  lucretia can any word fall from that tongue unheeded by thy daughter  but deaths the only test the only evidence i now can give of my integrity and undefiled intentions  collatine no one can suspect thee my lucretia hesitation will not against thee dare to elevate her stuttering tongue no many happy days shall yet be ours many sweet social years blessing and blessed  and our delighted children  alas what sudden thought what new emotion scatters a wilder terror over thy face dyed with a deeper pale  lucretia did thou say children  oh it is a thought which darted cross my brain like to the blasting lightning  children said thou who knows  how if  the ravisher  that thought would of itself determine as to him be it yours to judge what chastisement is due for me when i am dead the babbling world perhaps will do me justice in your minds at least my memory shall survive unsullied though i absolve myself from wilful crime i cannot from punishment nor shall a woman hereafter by the example of lucretia outlive her loss of honor stabs herself  collatine oh hold thy hand  what do thou  it is too late  who could have thought so suddenly rash action too surely done  that groan life issued with it oh could my arms bring back thy fleeted breath thus ever would i hold thee even thus in one indissoluble union never to be severed would we live lucretia that blow has killed us both oh wife wife wife  lucretius horror of horros wherefore did i wed why get a daughter why with pride elated behold  oh ruined virtue damned monster had he ever loved a child with my affection  no breath  quite still and silent  come despair and welcome to my breast  fixed are her eyes never shall i drink their genial beams again never hear that voice  now now could i blaspheme oh gods  patience patience  here i stand mute and resigned to your eternal wills but is it thus the good meet their reward art thou my daughter  oh oh oh  valerius no tongue can blame this grief thou gentlest best bedecked with every grace each ornament which dignifies exalts   brutus grasping the dagger now by this blood i swear immaculate before the tarquin rape and you oh gods bear witness to my oath that i will pursue with fire and sword and every other means which righteous indignation shall supply tarquin the proud his impious wife his sons and all the accursed race nor suffer them or any other to be kings in rome if that i break one tittle of this vow may death be mine but not like thine lucretia triumphant glorious but detested base and ignominious as the meanest slaves the most contemptuous vilest malefactors  valerius what do i see what hear surely my senses are bassled by some vain illusion  and my eyes see not nor my ears draw in what i suppose they see and hear  while brutus is speaking lucretius and collatinus are divided sometimes looking with astonishment on brutus sometimes with grief on lucretia when he ceases the latter gets the mastery and they are wholly taken up with her collatine oh wife dear dearest half of me gone gone for ever  lucretius child of my soul supporter of my being but soon my heart will burst and i shall be locked in the arms of death as thou art now staff of my age lost lost for ever lost  brutus what are ye men there lies your bleeding child there lies your tender wife will tears again her lifeless corse reanimate will tears revenge her timeless death i now methinks behold the ruffian glorying in the deed telling the tale of shame to his lewd brothers and riotous associates who agape listen with greedy ear and grin applause to the rank act of lust while thus says he i said thus did and thus and thus the wife of collatinus and lucretius daughter you choose to have your names garnish the tale of foul obscenity without a doubt you like it well and to be bandied round mid bawdy revellers think you to live thus branded with ignominy go show your bloodshot eyes and furrowed cheeks to tarquin and beg him on your knees for that his son has done this damned deed to spare your lives tell him you are meek men you bear no malice your hearts are formed for injuries your weapons are shortdrawn sighs and briny flowing tears he will believe you he is credulous so are his sons an inoffensive race and merciful witness that bleeding wound witness this reeking steel is this a time for tears for vain laments now rouse up all that is of manhood in us swear with me swear all upon this dagger to revenge this execrable deed unparalled this deed at which the conscious night which saw it turned pale with horror at which nature shudders oh jove supreme and thou paternal mars and unpolluted vesta hear again my oath repeated to the death i swear i will pursue the two prime regal monsters and all their progeny should they take wings they shall not scape my vengeance should they hide in deepest caverns there i will penetrate and drag them forth nor rest till they are swept from off the earth which groans beneath their wickedness this from the bottom of my soul i swear deeds soon shall follow words here take it swear lucretius  lucretius wonder and astonishment seize on   brutus of that hereafter speak now swear  lucretius i swear  brutus swear collatine  collatine i swear  brutus valerius swear  valerius i swear  brutus and now my friends the first i ever could call so let me embrace you round now after long long penance done i am again myself i see you hardly yet believe your eyes wondering but scarce convicted in suspense though strong persuasion tell you all is real think my good friends that hitherto you saw my shadow only and my mock resemblance the mimic of myself and ape ridiculous never till now appeared i as i am heretofore in my place to the eyes of men has an impostor a poor stupid wretch insensible to insult void of shame contemned by all though in his own opinion of great importance which but served to make his folly more conspicuous to the eyes of men i say this brutish character has in my place appeared now is he vanished and i roused up from that lethargic slumber in which i lay for twenty years or more now take again my rank in the file of men call reason mine and boast me in the name of longlost lateassumed humanity my soul feels double strength from this inertness i burn for action for the glorious day when freedom shall be ours when i may say to the chaste manes of lucretia now rest at peace ye are at full revenged when i shall say rejoice imperial rome for tyranny is extinct and oppression no more shall rule you with an iron rod  bear forth the body to the marketplace then shut the gates that none may from collatia bear any news to the camp go you before and tell the melancholy tale myself will follow after and discourse the people thence unto rome  and oh you powers on high propitious prove and let your aid be nigh still prompt the generous thought keep firm my soul that i may safely reach the purposed goal that i may pull ambition to the ground and liberty may pour her gifts around  end of the fourth act act v scene i a street in rome enter two citizens one of collatia the other of rome first citizen i told you how this melancholy sight the history of the deed shown in its true and native colors by the afflicted husband and father with the artless eloquence of real grief how the discovery of brutus and his speech affected us each braver youth stood quickly by their side arrayed in arms burning with indignation pent in their breasts we left collatia and entered rome a sight so new and strange with the armed multitude first struck the inhabitants with fear and terror but when they beheld the order of our march peaceful and solemn they soon put off their fears and thronged to gaze undressed unornamented on her bier lay scarce yet cold lucretias chaste remains beauteous in death you might have taken her so and placed her in a temple twould be sworn twas venus image cut in alabaster or for her hair confusedly scattered over her comely face and neck dian reclined after her toil upon a mount exposed to the rude winds while in her breast the wound she gave herself would cause you to admire what sacrilegious hand should dare to stab and give a deity to death  second citizen where now is this procession and how far behind you  first citizen they must by this have wellnigh reached the forum where brutus who is tribune of the guards a place of trust which tarquin only gave him as he appeared an object of contempt has called together all the centuries he and valerius are mean time to meet the snators who are by this convened the few whom tarquins sword has left alive to lay before them his intent his plans and to be guided by their wise advice while in the forum with lucretias corse laid forth to view the father and the husband relate the manner of her death when this is finished brutus shall harangue the people  second citizen great matters as i think may rise from this  first citizen the greatest that can rise the most desired and least expected ever to have happened if you at rome equal in generous sentiments us at collatia  second citizen what they are i guess and would myself with joy hazard my life was there a probability shown to me of gaining what we now so long have lost but rash adventurers seldom meet with profit and a dead sleep of five and twenty years is what men cannot be easily awaked from but curiosity if nothing else will lead me to the forum  first citizen i will attend you i came this nearer way to avoid the crowd and glad i am i found you exeunt scene ii the forum at rome lucretius and collatinus standing by the body of lucretia the roman people round them the rostrum behind lucretius thus thus my friends fast as our breaking hearts permitted utterance have we unfolded this narrative of sad distress for us what now remains robbed as we are of all which gave a joy to life but to pursue the example she has set us to invoke the timeless destinies and end our beings with our own wretched hands  oh vile old age which for her sake alone i wished to see oh luckless youth whose sorrow equals mine for thou alas have lost an equal blessing merciless villain dearest dearest daughter yet let us mix our sorrows let us drop our tears together on her lifeless clay nor will your tender hearts my countrymen forbear to sympathize with us and join your sigh of grief to ours  first roman oh piteous deed  second roman oh lamentable sight  third roman illfated

matrons mourn and let our virgins strew roses on her bier  first roman come then away and let us all prepare the funeral pile  lucretius for this compassion   first roman silence all attend  lucretius for this your tenderness my gentle friends i thank you from my soul but know you not the tribune of the guards has called you hither hear lucius junius first you know not what he has to impart to you private affairs must yield to public until he has finished i will not suffer you bestow a thought on me and mine unusual is this call your meetings long neglected nay i will tell you for why from you should i hide any thing it is for me and mine that he appears for me for him for every roman here but lo he comes make way my countrymen and i beseech you list to what he utters with deepest silence  first roman room there room make away  second roman let him ascend the rostrum  third roman surely this is errant madness hear a fool harangue  fourth roman be patient fool or not is he not tribune and dont the laws permit him to harangue  fifth roman besides lucretius has desired our silence  sixth roman hist he begins methinks his looks are altered  brutus romans and friends you see before you now no blundering idiot bearing to your ears the mandates of a tyrant and disgracing this rostrum with the servile repetition by many who are present this assertion may not be credited so warily i have played the imposture which necessity compelled me to assume for when your king king do i call him when the monster tarquin slew as you most of you may well remember and those who do not may have heard reported my father marcus and my elder brother envying their virtues and with covetous and greedy eye desiring to possess their tempting wealth what treatment at that time could i have hoped for where could i have found protection had i not put on the mask of unsuspected unrevenging folly the mask which having to this day preserved me this day of my discovery which i long have wished i now forever throw aside  first roman most wonderful  second roman who ever heard the like  third roman i am lost in admiration  fourth roman twas well thought on he had no other way to save himself i should myself have done the very same  fifth roman how we were all deceived  sixth roman aye and the king and his three sons who used to laugh at him  fourth roman well i saw always something in his face that looked i thought like as if who should say i am not what you take me for  first roman peace peace he cannot proceed silence he speaks again  brutus would you know why i summoned you together ask you what brings me here behold this dagger clotted with gore behold that frozen corse see these unhappy men whose tale of woe of horrid woe you from their mouths have heard and mingled social tears oh chastity is this thy fate oh rome how will thou mourn thy thinnd inhabitants if goodness virtue treated as crimes must meet the stroke of death if youth and beauty must be fingled out first preyed on by rapacious lust then murdered oh i could mourn thy fate lucretia could like thy father and thy husband mourn could in laments vie with each roman soul who now beholds thee and lament i will i cannot refrain my heart is wrung with grief unutterable inconceivable  first roman alas lucretia  second roman poor unhappy matron  third roman why were thou good and beautiful and young  fourth roman her father and her husband are half dead  fifth roman brutus methinks is moved as much they  fourth roman brutus why brutus did not hear him say he was no more an idiot  fifth roman true i heard it but use is not so easily overcome  sixth roman silence attend see he proceeds again  brutus did i my countrymen say i could mourn lucretias death  what sorrow must i feel when i beheld before my eyes as now methinks i do each roman matron dead when i behold each roman maid abused for who shall circumscribe the range of lust what numbers shall fill up his ravenous gorge and bid his raging appetite be still when i behold each roman citizen who has a muchloved wife a darling daughter doomed like these two to death because with grief surcharged they do not sit in silence down but dare proclaim their feelings  public murder for such a crime shall snatch them from the world or they shall fall by the midnight assassin nor must their friends say how they met their death but lay the blame upon their own despair  first roman they shall not die  second roman we will protect them both  third roman we will defend them from the tyrants wrath  brutus defend them say you miserable men you know not what you say protect them both can you protect yourselves you have committed treason against the tyrant and his brood of monster sons you have dared to look with pity you have dropped a tear on murdered innocence you have seen lucretia and have wept her fate youre partners with her father and her husband in guilty sorrow you have listened too to me a wretch who twenty lingering years have for your sakes imposed upon the tyrant and borne the grossest insults you have done all this and do you not expect to feel the weight of punishment which is your due are you not tarquins slaves for so he calls you and dont you dread the whip does he not name you the herd the beast with many heads and will not the fury massacre let loose among you revel kneedeep in blood  first roman instruct us brutus what we shall do  second roman well follow thee in all things  third roman thou shall direct us  fourth roman give us thy commands and well obey  fifth roman instruct us brutus  brutus must you be taught then what to do look there once more look that way she one night alone outrage and violence sustained not all the entreaties of her friends her weeping father begging as he would extort a gift from heaven not all her husbands tender supplication could shake her purpose with a fearful hand but an undaunted soul a womans feelings but more than manly thought deep in her breast she plunged this sharpedged steel which set her free yes thou art free lucretia thou art gone noblest of women where no tarquins dwell lust gloats not on the dead nor cruelty and bestial fierceness riot in the grave oh most illustrious of thy sex inspire our spiritwanting minds with but a portion however small of thy bright excellence yet even that i fear would be in vain we are inured too much to slavery to dare resist we are quite reconciled determined still to drudge beneath the yoke to shrink each hour at sight of some new murder some deed of baseness treachery and horror yet with our lips cry hail allgracious tarquin to work in sewers all day shut up mid damps denied the sight of heavens blessed sun yet in the eve when we halfchoakd revisit the upper air to praise benignant tarquin to see his sons rush into every house to see our wives ravished before our eyes to see each ripening tender maid deflowerd to see them kill themselves to see their pale and ashy corses in the public forum ranged all arow  yet then we are determined to bless kind tarquin mercyloving tarquin and beg him to beget some dozen more of sturdy sons with such like acts of kindness to bless his humble faithful citizens if this were not your fixed determination say would you seek instructions would you ask what you should do ask ye yon conscious walls which saw his poisoned brother saw the incest committed there and they will cry revenge ask ye yon conscious street where tullia drove over her dead fathers corse twill cry revenge ask yonder senate house whose stones are purple with human blood and it will cry revenge go to the tomb where lies his murdered wife and the poor queen who loved him as her son their unappeased ghosts will shriek revenge the temples of the gods the allviewing heavens the gods themselves shall justify the cry and swell the general sound revenge revenge  all revenge revenge revenge  brutus and we will be revenged my countrymen brutus shall lead you on brutus a name which will when youre revenged be dearer to him than all the splendent titles earth can boast nor i alone see where valerius brings the noblest of the city see where stand lucretius collatine nor age nor grief depress their spirits so as not to seek glorious revenge  you are this moment free i see the tyrant fled his soul dies in him the voice of liberty has reached the camp i see the gladful soldiers hasting home big to enjoy that freedom you possess each one clasps close his friend weeps on his neck unable to express the bursting pleasure stretching his heart but when you name revenge his eyes flash living fire and he resolves with you to hunt the monsters through the world for tyranny once having found a foe meets not with an upholder once again let me pronounce you free again it is yours to bring your votes and the first case before you is what becomes of tarquin  all we banish him the city we banish him the city  brutus and now what course will you yourselves pursue  all arms brutus arms well march against the tyrant lead us against him  brutus if you will by my advice be overswayd   all give it us give it we will follow it  brutus myself with some of the patrician youth wellmounted will away unto the camp do you each man furnished with arms prepared for action or advice immediately haste to the campus martius there valerius shall with the senate to your ears impart and to be ratified by your consent that plan of government by me delineated when in my fatuous state each thought was busied for you and rome  guard well the city gates pay the last duties to lucretias corse and soon expect to see my safe return and with me all your friends the immortal gods are your defense fear nothing but be bold  first roman oh noble brutus

years would fail i am wholly yours and long as i shall breathe the breath of life will only live for you now i descend and will accompany you without the forum there well separate you for your arms i to the camp at ardea the gods who long have in the book of fate foreseen this time the gods who hate injustice who punish perfidy and cruel deeds go with us both their influence i obey the humble instrument they have appointed to rescue you from bondage to restore your ancient rites to give you days of peace and liberty the attribute of man but grant me one request though real joy i know ill brooks restraint keep back this tumult of your applause your love i would fain acquire heaven is my witness i would die to acquire it but clamor ever shows illguided counsels the voice of rashness the argument of numbers of reason destitute not so the plan which we pursue the surest grounds are ours maturely founded and late brought to light let us accomplish then the end proposed with prudent zeal with decent vigor firm intrepid hope and silent resolution exeunt scene iii the camp tarquins tent tarquin messenger guards tarquin take this collatian scarecrow guard him safe if that the news thou bringst shall be found false prepare thee for the tortures of the cross  messenger my lord it is too true  tarquin away with him exeunt messenger and guards brutus it cannot be the gods themselves

public forum curious to know the cause i too went thither soon was brought forth the body of lucretia attended by lucretius and her husband and a large body of collatian youth in arms by turns they spoke unto the people often interrupted were their words with sighs and tears   tarquin proceed be brief  messenger they said lucretia by sextus ravished had foredone herself the people moved with pity heard the tale and every eye was wet  tarquin thy tediousness is insupportable haste to the end  messenger then brutus came and mounting in the rostrum first having shown that his stupidity was only forged proceeded   tarquin it is enough no more without prepare with utmost speed a band of chosen horse where are my sons why stand you thus where are my sons i say what followed after he had spoke  messenger the people all with one voice when he proposed the question of what becomes of tarquin cried we banish him  tarquin how  dared they  hah it is well what afterward  messenger he then directed them first to take arms and while he hasted hither to the camp to meet valerius and the senators in the campus martius who would lay before them a scheme of government this having heard i hurried straight away  tarquin thy loyalty shall meet with its reward for them  who waits where are my sons quick bid those horsemen mount and wait for my commands deep hypocrite beyond example  oh i see through all but short shall be his reign mysterious dark unfathomable villain but his life his forfeit life  and the quick easywrought inconstant crowd them i will reduce much lower than beasts of burden they have lived too fat kick they their master thus  why did i leave one senator alive i had done well to have extirpated all both root and branch had done is passed the present hour is mine and that shall be well used on dangers verge to act unmoved recoil into himself see every train of possible design and judge the best is the great character of the superior soul this is the time of trial tarquin this the grand event to stamp thee fortuneproof this enemy the tenor of his life his perseverance marks the most dangerous thence the most worthy thou ever had to cope withal but he if he has gained not every mortal engine to aid his purpose draws upon his head sure ruin  to leave rome and seek the camp he falls in his own snare enter aruns and titus my sons you come in wished for time you know these accidents  titus we heard them with amazement  tarquin where is sextus the ravisher of matrons who inspires idiots with sense and raises insurrections against his father  aruns we in vain enquired he was not in his tent  tarquin well may he fear to meet my presence by the immortal gods this hand should slay him for a fool a dolt a common thief would ere he robbed a house first kill the mastiff at the gate who else might worry him returning as this tale by busy rumor to the soldiers ears may get access and if it does his presence may be with fatal consequence attended bid him still hide himself or to withdraw entirely from the camp myself will hence and with these lightarmed horsemen intercept this brutus on the road which being done i doubt not but to get speedy admittance into the city where the unruly mob distract with fear and multitude of counsels will of themselves be ready for submission should he escape my hands in every avenue place trusty guards and give strict orders to them to slay him ere he reach the camp  titus we shall not be wanting on our part  tarquin alas my sons  aruns what ails my father  tarquin i am well again a sudden damp and creeping horror seized me it is over now i thought my throne fixed firm as the everlasting basis of the earth fool that i was to trust to quibbling gods when to the delphic fane you took your way what said the dark expounder who perplexes in double maze what she pretends tunfold these were the words of the pythian sorceress beasts shall enjoy the reason of mankind ever tarquin from the snake disturbance find this is the beast this is the fated snake whom you and i have cherished in our bosoms and now he brandishes his forked sting and casts his baneful mortal venom round threatening destruction but avaunt vain fears i have been scared by omens but the wretch who yields to superstition well deserves to fall its sacrifice i will haste away cowards and fools misfortunes antedate in his own hand the brave man holds his fate exeunt scene iv sextus s tent aruns sextus titus aruns i do not blame the deed the simple deed oh you mistake me quite the deed might stand enrolled i will read it rape nothing but rape plain rape i would turn my eyes another way nor add one transient slight remark of mine to those of conscientious babbling sniveling mouthwatering knaves who envy every man the dainty morsel they cannot eat themselves but i see wrote in equal characters bad consequences such as these to wit revenge and mutiny and insurrection and banishment and loss of empire these denominate the deed with me and these i still will harrass and perplex thee with and ring thee such alarms that thou shall wish the cutthroat brutus or the cuckold collatine stood by thee rather with their sharpened swords levelled against thy throat  sextus prythee no more i dont repent the deed as for the consequences thy words cannot add a sting to my reflections  aruns yet i will sting thee i will taunt thee still  no rather let me like a loving brother turn thy apologist and make excuses as thus when lust revels predominant folly and frenzy cut wild capriols in reasons court or thus with languid eye and whining tone  when beauty fires the sense beauty soft tyrant amiable invader consideration turns an hoodwinked ass or thus in grave and philosophic vein  what mortal man can with his finite glance survey the boundless waste of future time and cull out the events which there are sown crude unexistent till the allpotent hand of jove uplifts them from the dark abyss and gives them form substantial  oh man man what a vile fool art thou by heaven and earth the stalking monster man grows every day more and more stupid and ridiculous see the erect machine he lifts his head proclaims himself a godling bend ye abject inferior animals  oh could i set thee proud miscreant in thy place there is not a beast but i would raise above thee reason thine the matchless gift of speech an ox an ape could i interpret talks as well as thou do his actions prove it  not foresee events with all thy reason instinct then is better which of the herd will plunge into the tide expect the liquid element to change and bear him as on land did ever the eagle forth from his lofty ayerie dart to the ground and not expand his wings ever he enjoys his loving mistress the stern bull knows well that he must beat his rival from the pasture but why thus throw away my time on trifles the most insipid theme that man can talk of is of mankind titus see there behold he too will boast his reason yet he knows not the veriest insect will when trod upon endeavor at resistance  titus to what purpose this tends i cannot conceive oh aruns aruns ever we set up for masters it were well did we ourselves still practice what we teach  aruns thou with thy musty rules  patience herself at opening of thy mouth would stop her ears or run away fast as her heels could bear her pour in thy potions titus his hot blood wants cooling medicines sedative morality sextus attend thy fever shall abate and thou shall fall into a leaden slumber and so i leave you both either to other wise leach may phoebus aid thee at thy need so shall thy patients health be sound as thine exit sextus adieu dissatisfied and chiding humorist  titus did i not tell thee what i feared would follow  sextus i prythee do not thou reproach me too rather advise me in this hour of danger how i had best dispose myself to leave the camp would argue fear would argue shame nor would i mid the rabble so exalt their selfconceit to think i aught could do to make me in their presence hang my head for one or the other cause besides i doubt not but that our fathers everready mind which like the sierce tide against the rushing tempest still rises stronger meeting opposition will prompt him with the means of wished success that he will gain admittance into rome i little question and should brutus turn a different way toward the camp those bands which with strict orders watch each avenue will render us as good account of him a shout what sound is that methought it was a shout as of a multitude  titus it was perhaps the guards have taken brutus prisoner or slain him  enter claudius claudius fly fly my lords brutus is in the camp i saw him with these eyes he waves aloft the bloody dagger all the soldiers hear him with wildest admiration and applause he speaks as if he held the souls of men in his own hand and molded them at pleasure they look on him as they would view a god who from a darkness which invested him springs forth and knitting his stern brow in frowns proclaims the vengeful doom of angry jove herminius and horatius too have joined him all cry aloud revenge revenge on tarquin death to his sons  fly fly and save yourselves  titus herminius and horatius traitors  how passed he the guards  claudius they brought him in triumphant  titus where is aruns  claudius he is fled my lord to caere and bids you follow him with utmost haste  titus whither will thou  sextus i shall straitway to gabii as to a safe asylum fare thee well  titus farewell to sextus  oh pernicious fortune from this day forth i date the utter ruin of tarquin and his sons exeunt scene v the walls of rome tarquin at the gate above lucretius collatinus valerius and roman people lucretius whatever he says to you ye gentle romans let me entreat you answer not a word who is he that asks admittance  tarquin am i then altered so much of late that old lucretius knows not his king why are these gates fast barred and who is it that dares refuse me entrance  lucretius this shall i answer strait as for my king i know thee not though tarquin well i know and know him for a tyrant who long time many a dreadful year of servitude held rome inslaved against that cruel tyrant these gates are barred those who refuse him entrance are all the roman people who have dared proclaim him banished from their land for ever  tarquin is this thy gratitude old man from me thou had the authority thou now usurpst the government of rome  lucretius when thou were king i held from thee the government i own it thou from the people then did hold thy crown who have since deposed thee from the people now i hold the interregal dignity when brutus from the camp shall with him bring the enfranchised army if to him and collatine as they have determined they deliver up the delegated trust their future consuls i shall with readiness and pleasure yield into their hands my transitory sway  tarquin had any others in the roman state fomented mid the people this rebellion i should not thus have wondered but that you you three whom i have admitted to my councils loaded with honors dignities and gifts of price that you should with the ungrateful brutus whom as my child i have fostered join to ruin your gracious master and kind benefactor is one of those strange accidents i labor in vain to reconcile to probability  lucretius for all the various favors i have received from tarquin and his race i am most grateful but chiefly grateful for my murdered daughter  collatine i for my ravished and selfslaughterd wife  valerius i in the name of all the roman people confess my gratitude the many favors on them bestowed now for these many a year my greatest happiness have constituted for brutus who is absent let me thank thee both for his murdered father and his brother  tarquin oh collatine lucretius all the powers who rule this universe can witness for me how i detest that hateful deed none feels more for the injured father and the husband none curses more the impious perpetrator though from these loins he sprang than i myself no let the criminal bear all the weight of your just vengeance let him be brought forth before the roman people stand his trial as by my royal word i swear he shall were he three times my son and is his death decreed he surely dies but must the innocent be with the guilty punished must the father bear the sons crimes the crimes which he abhors yes when i heard the tale lucretius i started back with horror while my heart wept tears of blood  lucretius such tears thou sheddst over thy poisoned brother  collatine such over thy wife brought to her timeless end  valerius such tears thou sheddst over thy good old king  lucretius such over each assassinated noble  collatine such over every murdered roman knight  valerius such over every deathdoomd citizen  tarquin how much you wrong my nature you yourselves shall be the living judges prove my mercy return to your allegiance reconcile to my authority the ductile crowd by you seduced do this and here i swear in presence of the gods by every tie which binds mankind my eyes shall overlook all that is passed nay more i will submit me to your advice in all things nor shall ought that you can ask not be by me performed  lucretius can thou restore my daughter to my arms  collatine can thou call forth my wife from her dark tomb  valerius can thou bring back to life ten thousand romans by thy ambition slain or cruelty  tarquin oh romans oh my countrymen to you do i appeal from these injurious men lo here i stand helpless and destitute imploring pity only where i ought to claim obedience prayers are the arms i use does this bespeak a tyrant  see these locks gray with the cares of government these rather bespeak the father i have governed you for five and twenty years during which time i have fought your battles against your enemies from whom you have returned with honor crowned loaded with spoils i am covered over with scars for you received for ill does he deserve the name of royalty who braves not peril who shrinks affrighted at the frown of death yet tells his subjects he is not terrible and bids them meet the fury face to face for you and for your glory has my life been still employed i am wearied out with toil endured for you to raise your name abroad and make each kingdom round you mention rome and what belongs to rome with awe  all this i have done for you for you have borne the frost of keen december and for you sustained the torrid dog star have i ever hoarded my share of the plunder filled my treasury with stuff which i despised but as it served to add to rome new luster  look behind you are not for you these sumptuous buildings raised and for your honor let the gods themselves declare my motives who now dwell in temples fitting their dignity and romes magnificence for which of these my works am i exiled oh you have been deceived grossly deceived if i am accused of any fancied crimes artfully lodged against me till the time you bid me reign i shall as it behooves me lay by my crown admit me then unarmed thus as a suppliant with his naked head admit your king he begs at your tribunal to plead his cause he asks but common justice but to be heard before he is condemned  lucretius who can refrain from laughter at this sight tarquin the most unjust of mortal men requiring justice tarquin who never heeded a suppliants prayers or in his wrath remembered sweet mercy asking pity of a people whom he has ever harrassd with oppression their glory did thou seek no twas thy own proud man had thou thy peoples glory sought or had thou truly known wherein thy own consisted thou would have desired to see them happy and free what glory ever did slaves receive from conquest or what happiness can slaves enjoy seeing a splendid palace or gorgeous temple  while within the heart freedom sits not enthroned and in that shrine where heavens pure flame should dwell lurks discontent and struggling though depressed the generous ardor they from their ancestors inherited what roman is alive to any thought but one the secret wish of righteous vengeance retire false wretch odious to gods and men retire ever it is too late lest now provoked we open our gates indeed and rushing on thee thy sentence change from banishment to death  enter claudius to tarquin claudius i come sent by the princess   tarquin in thy face i read thy news draw nearer and disclose it but whisper low that none may overhear thee  claudius the guards instead of seizing brutus brought him into the camp he gained the soldiers there as he before had gained the citizens titus and aruns are to caere fled sextus to gabii brutus is at hand with all the cavalry if you delay my gracious lord a moment you are lost  tarquin ye factious demagogues and stubborn people once more attend your king this messenger brings me advice the army is at hand to aid their master brutus the archrebel is by their loyal ardor done to death now then prepare to feel the utmost weight of my avengement if i enter in in all my terror by the immortal gods i will have no remorse i will show no pity i will decimate the rebel crew your limbs shall feed the foxes and each bird obscene unburied scattered over the bloodstained earth what do ye tremble  yet deluded people if ever the army come you open your gates throw down your wearpons ask my clemency you shall as little as you have deserved it or may expect such clemency from me all meet with mercy and a gracious pardon nay and at your request i will spare your leaders provided they exile themselves from rome  valerius tyrant thou speak in vain thy artifice is shallow and pierced through i saw pale fear sit on the chalked face of thy messenger the army cannot degenerate so far from those brave men whom they have left behind they are not from thy native place tarquinii but romans born and will with joy receive him who proclaims them free  but should he perish should brutus which avert ye righteous powers have failed in his great enterprise and met a glorious death glorious in such a cause and hallowed though by the hands of villains slain of regal fools know tarquin there are still enough to assume the part which he began not one but fifty brutuss are here who will in the defense of liberty resist thy power till the last drop shall leave their noble hearts we are resolved while life is ours to live like men if die we must as soon or late all shall like men to die shout at a distance  lucretius hear tyrant hear this is the sound of fate which peals forth thy destruction it is the shout of liberty the signal of success brutus returns in triumph let us all prepare in worthy manner to receive our great deliverer this is the hour by destiny decreed to teach mankind but chiefly guilty kings that there are gods who care for mortal deeds and rule with justice the realms of heaven above and earth below exeunt tarquin ye furies glut yourselves if there are gods who bend so much from their prerogative to league with rebel subjects against their kings make sure your work strike here blast me at once use me as i would use the roman people were they all as one worm beneath my feet thus would i trample them and thus  i leave thee hightowering city keep thy bulwarks firm with double strength cement thy stones together for if i err not i will raise such a flame throughout hetruria as shall not be quenched till thou and all thy sons be burnt as stubble fired with one general blaze should to their aid their traitors guardian gods descend i will bear the hurrying storm along the troubled air by vengeance raised impelled by brave despair exit scene vi rome brutus and collatinus as consuls with lictors valerius lucretius and others brutus indeed my noble friends you judge me rightly these honors little move the mind of brutus never did i covet gewgaws or the farce of windblown pomp it is not the purple robe the curule chair the lictors keenedgd ax enforcing homage which ever drew one thought of mine aside but to behold a state delivered from oppression to expel base ignominious slavery with those who forged her chains for a free peoples neck to see that people blessed with liberty and think that we shall hand down to our children the most invaluable gift of heaven twas this expectancy alone which cast a light through that black shade in which i dwelt and now this having seen could i enjoy the assurance of its being still continued again without a scruple i would retreat to my obscurity known to myself alone hailed by no tongue seen by no eye  valerius that may not be yet in her infancy her joints quite slack unable to perform their motions and proceed alone rome wants thy thinking head thy executive hand and fathers care  i will not say my joy superior is to thine but sure it is equal at least the force of it cannot strain a point beyond its present stretch lucretius too and collatine may now feel comfort calm as a mild evening when the sun looks forth placidly shining after the fierce storms which overwhelmed the day  lucretius we do we do  collatine such fellowfeeling with my noble colleague methinks my spirit has that i almost to see this hour could venture to pass through those agonies which tore my soul in twain  enter a messenger messenger all health to rome her senate and her consuls  brutus speak on what thou have farther to impart  messenger i hither come sent by the inhabitants of gabii they desire to mix with you their share of pleasure for your late success and pray the gods you daily may increase in every earthly blessing they entreat you will still esteem them as your firm allies and ancient friends chiefly they hail the man who first conceived and dared with brave resolve reduce to action what his mind inspired lastly i bring advice of sextus death who came no sooner to the gates of gabii without his usual train attending him than mindful of their injuries sustained resenting his most cruel deeds to which they had been long unwilling witnesses the populace surrounding him with clubs and stones the weapons which first came to hand slew the unpitied homicide  brutus this message thou must deliver to the assembled fathers from them receive thy answer now lucretia thy ghost may cease to wander over the earth and rest in peace  lucretius blessed inhabitants of gabii oh ye gods your ways are just now will i sit me down and try to bear hateful old age the affliction of mortality but hastening on its remedy and cure  collatine yet i regret the villain should be slain by any hand but mine  enter claudius claudius is brutus here my business is with him  brutus another messenger i know thee well disclose thy errand strait  claudius i come from aruns what he bade me utter if liberty of speech be granted me i shall deliver  brutus speak thy words are free  claudius then thus he says tell brutus tell that traitor that fool who was that knave who ever will be that should i meet him in the field of battle were his skull trebly thicker than it is i would thoroughly examine its contents is this denied me when i bear the sway with titus which perhaps he may remember we earned together i will send to delphi on purpose for that cudgel he presented unto the god with which each day his shoulders shall be so flayed that he shall wish his feigned were turned to real insensibility treated with this correction during life ask him too if his bravery wars with women and whether he has slain the aged queen  brutus and do thou bring no other message  claudius none  brutus it is worthy of the sender and the sent go tell thy pleasant master that i bear jointly with collatine chief sway in rome tell him the oracle is now fulfilled tell him i kissed my mother when i fell even in the very portico of the temple the earth the general parent of us all and if twill farther please him that the cudgel i to the god presented was an emblem expressive of myself a golden rod beneath a case of wood as to his threats tell him i heed them as the chiding gale or the ocean wave beating at the fixed base of a high promontory though should i meet him mid the ensanguind field in glorious fight engaged for the great cause of liberty i will dare the proudest of my countrys foes and with the sword of vengeance on his crest engrave a mark indelible tell him no roman murders women that we leave to tarquin and his sons even the crowd pursued her only through the streets with curses invoked the furies of her parents on her and saw her pass the city gate so hence in safety go to him who sent thee hither  exit claudius valerius that missionary did but ill deserve so civil a discharge  brutus were aruns us neither would he have found it now my friends tomorrow will horatius and herminius the ardeates having to a truce agreed for fifteen years lead all the army homeward then in the common meeting of the people lest they should think two kings instead of one though chosen annually may lord it over them one of us collatine will lay aside our symbols of command only resumed alternate month by month the good papirius king of the holy things shall offer up our general sacrifice while we again and every individual then assembled both for ourselves and our posterity renew our solemn oath never to admit one of the tarquin race this night more grateful than cloudsof inconse let our secret prayers our private gratitude and thanks ascend to the highruling powers for howsoeer vain man may think he plans with arduous care it is they alone his sentiments inspire they fill his breast with more than mortal fire it is they alone light up the patriot flame they lift the humble and the haughty tame they every human accident foresee to them not accident but certainty  finis
