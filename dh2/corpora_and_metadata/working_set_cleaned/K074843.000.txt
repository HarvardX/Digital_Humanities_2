pharmacopoeia pauperum  or the hospital dispensatory  containing the medicines used in the hospitals of london by the direction of dr coatsworth dr mead dr cade dr wadsworth dr hales etc with suitable instructions for their common use  homo qui erranti comiter monstrat viam quasi lumen de suo lumine accendat facit nihilominus ipsi lucet cum illi accenderit  ennius apud tullium london printed for t warner at the blackboy in paternoster row       the preface it may seem strange to publish any thing of this kind after a new dispensatory that has drawn together all that is valuable in medicine but this manual is ventured into the world notwithstanding such disadvantage because it contains the prescriptions of the most eminent physicians in our nation which were contrived on purpose for the poorer sort of people and are at present constantly used in the hospitals of london and therefore it is a collection of the most cheap and most efficacious medicines that the whole art does supply  to render it the more useful here are annexed to every prescription explanations of their virtues and uses after the manner of dr quincy in his new dispensatory  the physicians whose names this bears in the title it is hoped will not in the least take it amiss that what they have been at the pains to contrive for the use of those particularly under their care is in this manner made more extensive for a common good  pharmacopoeia pauperum or the hospital dispensatory the waters most commonly in use in the public hospitals are the aqua lactis alex  cerasor nigr  cinnam sort  hord  menthae  pulegii

consumptions as proceed from a sharp thin blood especially in those who have been injured by a venereal taint or have any hereditary remains of scrophulous or leprous humors it is ordered to be drank for some time together the quantity of a quart or two in a day it is also directed to wash foul ulcers and does good service in such cases  aqua liberans rassur lig sassafr sine cortice ij lig guiac

require absorbents and sweetners especially in all venereal affections after salivation it will assist much likewise in the itch and all foulnesses which lodge upon the skin it may be drank at discretion and ought to be used for some time together  aqua limacum d m limac hortens depur and contus cong vj lumbric depur and contus cong iij fol absynth vulg heder ter card ben a lbiss pulegii

for cheapness and efficacy and for persons whose circumstances and manner of living have not habituated them to any delicacies it is as good a snailwater as can be made and with the two former are the chief that are used in the hospitals and as they are mostly given in consumptions contracted from vicious practices and venereal contagions this is the constant drink of those who are under the like weaknesses and decays from a malum stamen and require principally nourishment from such substances as will with the least trouble possible be assimulated for that purpose  aqua ad strumas d m rad

though without any inconveniency upon that account the points of the medicine being left gross enough to velicate and draw the stomach into such contractions this also avails considerably in venereal

i to ss in a chlorosis and all menstrual obstructions it is likewise a good medicine in all hypochondriacal affections but as the cure of such patients consists generally more in their way of living than in medicine an hospital cares not for the admission of such invalids  balsam lucatelli ol olivar opt terebinth ven a lbiv cerae flavae tenuiter incisae lbijss liquescant simul addendo sang

this is too churlish to be given but to athletick constitutions  bolus hydropicus gambog pulv gr xv cremor tartari ss sir e spin c q s f bolus an hydropick bole take gamboge    grains cream of tartar

self is indeed very rough and works sometimes with great nauseousness vomiting and griping but the tartar much corrects it by dividing its viscid parts and making them less sensibly velicate the coats of the stomach and bowels as all resinous purges are apt to do it has sometimes also mixed with it a drop or two of oil of aniseed or any other of the carminitive oils to render it less griping this thoroughly purges off watery and viscous humors and greatly promotes the discharge by urine but to render the cure of a dropsy lasting there is a necessity afterward of restoring and strengthening the tone of the parts by proper medicines for such purposes else they will soon fill again with as much water as this has carried away  bolus mercurialis purgat elect lenitiv lbss pulv rad jallapi jss

is only just to cleanse off so much choler or irritating humors as it finds already separated by the intestinal glands and it then so astringes them as to prevent any further flux of that kind upon them this bolus is also frequently given to compose and resettle the bowels after the operation of such strong catharticks as cannot well be born without such a restorative  bolus mercurialis cum

asthmatick and dropsical habits this is an admirable medicine for it greatly scours away those viscidities which stuff the vessels and hinder due circulation and detaches them off by the kidneys but its use is to be complied with for some time together and if so continued the most obstinate obstructions of the small vessels that cause both dropsies and asthmas will give way to its efficacy

are sometimes attended with very surprising symptoms this is a good medicine both to help on their discharge and defend the part against mortifications and gangrenes which frequently happen in such cases in confirmed dropsies likewise where the lower parts have received more water than can be carried off by the common evacuations and the legs are forced to be scarifyd this is of good service both to prevent mortification and forward the drain of such humors insomuch that the tone of a part is sometimes retrieved by this means which would otherwise from a partial mortification induce a

there intolerable pains and which will not give way to any other means it is to be applied as often as the symptoms and urgency of pain require and the part can bear for it is so hot as frequently to vesicate the skin but it then generally has the best effect the pain most commonly abating upon drawing out by perspiration such humors as will raise a dew upon the skin and sometimes lift it up into

otherwise would be but short in all scorbutic habits likewise especially where the extremes tend toward too great a fullness and corpulency this is of real service if the patients are kept to it for some time together in all tendencies likewise toward a palsy it does much good both by drying away watery and sloughy humors which destroy due sensation and giving warmth and briskness to the juices

those are both good to discuss hard tumors but the latter with quicksilver is much the most efficacious in those which are obstinate and frequently arise from venereal and scrophulous causes great care in making is to be used to incorporate the quicksilver well with turpentine else it will not be so mixed but that in spreading the plaster for use it will separate and run into globules if this be carefully made it is preferable to the frogplaster with quicksilver in the london dispensatory although that is vastly more troublesome to make being stuffed with many ingredients that are of no real service but only to perplex the compounder and amuse the expectations of the ignorant  emplastrum epispasticum d w empl discutien simpl vel adhaesiv batean q s extend crassius super alutam

is much more certain than the common plasters into which the flies are mixed for it cannot fail of its intention but some are apprehensive that by this means the flies get more into the blood and are more liable to create stranguries and such inconveniences as make their inward use so dangerous but whether there be any thing in this or not there is not room here to consider however those who choose this way are obliged to leave the edges of the plaster uncovered with the flies or to stick strops on it crossways spread with somewhat sticking else it will not keep upon the part to which it
