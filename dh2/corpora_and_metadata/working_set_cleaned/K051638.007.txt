clarissa or the history of a young lady comprehending the most important concerns of private life and particularly showing the distresses that may attend the misconduct both of parents and children in relation to marriage published by the editor of pamela vol vii  london printed for s richardson and sold by john osborn in paternoster row by andrew millar over against catharinestreet in the strand by j and j rivington in st pauls churchyard and by j leake at bath mdccxlviii  the history of miss clarissa harlowe vol vii letter i mr belford to robert lovelace esquire tuesday aug    i have been under such concern for the poor man whose exit i almost hourly expect and at the shocking scenes his illness and his agonies exhibit that i have been only able to make memoranda of the melancholy passages from which to draw up a more perfect account for the instruction of us all when the writingappetite shall return  it is returned indignation has revived it on receipt of thy letters of sunday and yesterday by which i have reason to reproach thee in very serious terms that thou have not kept thy honor with me and if thy breach of it be attended with such effects as i fear it will be i shall let thee know more of my mind on this head  if thou would be thought in earnest in thy wishes to move the poor lady in thy favor thy ludicrous behavior at smiths when it comes to be represented to her will have a very consistent appearance will it not  it will indeed confirm her in her opinion that the grave is more to be wishedfor by one of her serious and pious turn than a husband incapable either of reflection or remorse just recovered as thou art from a dangerous at least a sharp illness  i am extremely concerned for the poor unprotected lady she was so excessively low and weak on saturday that i could not be admitted to her speech and to be driven out of her lodgings when it was fitter for her to be in bed is such a piece of cruelty as he only could be guilty of who could act as thou have done by such an angel  can thou thyself say on reflection that it has not the look of a wicked and hardened sportiveness in thee for the sake of a wanton humor only since it can answer no end that thou proposest to thyself but the direct contrary to hunt from place to place a poor lady who like a harmless deer that has already a barbed shaft in her breast seeks only a refuge from thee in the shades of death  but i will leave this matter upon thy own conscience to paint thee such a scene from my memoranda as thou perhaps wilt be moved by more effectually than by any other because it is such a one as thou thyself must one day be a principal actor in and as i thought had very lately in apprehension and is the last scene of one of thy most intimate friends who has been for the four past days laboring in the agonies of death for lovelace let this truth this undoubted truth be engraven on thy memory in all thy gaieties that the life we are so fond of is hardly life a mere breathingspace only and that at the end of its longest date thou must die as well as belton  thou know by tourville what we had done as to the poor mans worldly affairs and that we had got his unhappy sister to come and live with him little did we think him so very near his end and so i will proceed to tell thee that when i arrived at his house on saturday night i found him excessively ill but just raised and in his elbowchair held up by his nurse and mowbray the roughest and most untouched creature that ever entered a sick mans chamber while the maidservants were trying to make that bed easier for him which he was to return to his mind ten times uneasier than that could be and the true cause that the down was no softer to him  he had so much longed to see me his sister told me whom i sent for down to enquire how he was that they all rejoiced when i entered here said mowbray here tommy is honest jack belford  where where said the poor man  i hear his voice cried mowbray coming up stairs  in a transport of joy he would have raised himself at my entrance but had like to have pitched out of the chair and when recovered called me his best friend his kindest friend but burst out into a flood of tears o jack o belford said he see the way i am in see how weak so much and so soon reduced do you know me do you know your poor friend belton  you are not so much altered my dear belton as you think you are but i see you are weak very weak  and i am sorry for it  weak weak indeed my dearest belford said he and weaker in my mind if possible than in my body and wept bitterly  or i should not thus unman myself i who never feared any thing to be forced to show myself such a nursling  i am quite ashamed of myself  but dont despise me dear belford dont despise me i beseech thee  i ever honored a man that could weep for the distresses of others and ever shall said i and such a one cannot be insensible to his own  however i could not help being visibly moved at the poor fellows emotion  now said the brutal mowbray do i think thee insufferable jack our poor friend is already a peg too low and here thou art letting him down lower and lower still this soothing of him in his dejected moments and joining thy womanish tears with his is not the way i am sure it is not if our lovelace were here he would tell thee so  thou art an impenetrable creature replied i unfit to be present at a scene thou will not be able to feel the terrors of till thou feel them in thyself and then if thou have time for feeling my life for thine thou behavest as pitifully as those thou think most pitiful  then turning to the poor sick man tears my dear belton are no signs of an unmanly but contrarily of a humane nature they ease the overcharged heart which would burst but for that kindly and natural relief  give sorrow words says shakespeare the grief that does not speak whispers the oerfrought heart and bids it break i know my dear belton thou usedst to take pleasure in repetitions from the poets but thou must be tasteless of their beauties now yet be not discountenanced by this uncouth and unreflecting mowbray for as juvenal says tears are the prerogative of manhood  it is at least seasonably said my dear belford it is kind to keep me in countenance for this womanish weakness as mowbray has been upbraidingly calling it ever since he has been with me and in so doing whatever i might have thought in such high health as he enjoys has convinced me that bottlefriends feel nothing but what moves in that little circle  well well proceed in your own way jack i love my friend belton as well as you can do yet for the blood of me i cannot but think that soothing a mans weakness is increasing it  if it be a weakness to be touched at great and concerning events in which our humanity is concerned said i thou may be right  i have seen many a man said the rough creature going up holbournhill that has behaved more like a man than either of you  ay but mowbray replied the poor man those wretches have not had such infirmities of body as i have long labored under to enervate their minds thou art a shocking fellow and ever were but to be able to remember nothing in these moments but what reproaches me and to know that i cannot hold it long and what may then be my lot if  but interrupting himself and turning to me give me thy pity jack it is balm to my wounded soul and let mowbray sit indifferent enough to the pangs of a dying friend to laugh at us both  the hardened fellow then retired with the air of a lovelace only more stupid yawning and stretching instead of humming a tune as thou did at smiths  i assisted to get the poor man into bed he was so weak and low that he could not bear the fatigue and fainted away and i verily thought was quite gone but recovering and his doctor coming and advising to keep him quiet i retired and joined mowbray in the garden who took more delight to talk of the living lovelace and his levities than of the dying belton and his repentance  i just saw him again on saturday night before i went to bed which i did early for i was surfeited with mowbrays frothy insensibility and could not bear him it is such a horrid thing to think of that a man who had lived in such strict terms of amity with another the proof does not come out so as to say friendship who had pretended so much love for him could not bear to be out of his company would ride a hundred miles an end to enjoy it and would fight for him be the cause right or wrong yet now could be so little moved to see him in such misery of body and mind as to be able to rebuke him and rather ridicule than pity him because he was more affected by what he felt than he had seen a malefactor hardened perhaps by liquor and not softened by previous sickness on his going to execution  this put me strongly in mind of what the divine miss harlowe once said to me talking of friendship and what my friendship to you required of me depend upon it mr belford said she that one day you will be convinced that what you call friendship is chaff and stubble and that nothing is worthy of that sacred name that has not virtue for its base  sunday morning i was called up at six of clock at his earnest request and found him in a terrible agony o jack jack said he looking wildly as if he had seen a spectre  come nearer me reaching out both arms  come nearer me  dear dear belford save me then clasping my arm with both his hands and rearing up his head toward me his eyes strangely rolling save me dear belford save me repeated he  i put my other arm about him  save you from what my dear belton save you from what  nothing shall hurt you  what must i save you from  recovering from his terror he sunk down again o save me from myself said he save me from my own reflections o dear jack what a thing it is to die and not to have one comfortable reflection to revolve  what would i give for one year of my passed life  only one year  and to have the same sense of things that i now have  i tried to comfort him as well as i could but freelivers to freelivers are sorry deathbed comforters and he broke in upon me o my dear belford said he i am told and i have heard you ridiculed for it that the excellent miss harlowe has wrought a conversion in you may it be so you are a man of sense o may it be so now is your time now that you are in full vigor of mind and body but your poor belton alas kept his vices till they left him and see the miserable effects in debility of mind and despondency were mowbray here and were he to laugh at me i would own that this is the cause of my despair that gods justice cannot let his mercy operate for my comfort for oh i have been very very wicked and have despised the offers of his grace till he has withdrawn it from me for ever  i used all the arguments i could think of to give him consolation and what i said had such an effect upon him as to quiet his mind for the greatest part of the day and in a lucid hour his memory served him to repeat those lines of dryden grasping my hand and looking wistfully upon me o that i less could fear to lose this being which like a snowball in my cowardband the more it is grasped the faster melts away   in the afternoon of sunday he was inquisitive after you and your present behavior to miss harlowe i told him how you had been and how light you made of it mowbray was pleased with your impenetrable hardness of heart and said bob lovelace was a good edgetool and steel to the back and such coarse but hearty praises he gave thee as an abandoned man might give and only an abandoned man could wish to deserve  but had thou heard what the poor dying wisetoolate belton said on this occasion perhaps it would have made thee serious an hour or two at least  when poor lovelace is brought said he to a sickbed as i am now and his mind forebodes that it is impossible he should recover which his could not do in his late illness if it had he could not have behaved so lightly in it  when he revolves his past misspent life his actions of offense to helpless innocents in miss harlowes case particularly what then will he think of himself or of his past actions his mind debilitated his strength turned into weakness unable to stir or to move without help not one ray of hope darting in upon his benighted soul his conscience standing in the place of a thousand witnesses his pains excruciating weary of the poor remnant of life he drags yet dreading that in a few short hours his bed will be changed to worse nay to worst of all and that worst of all to last beyond time and to all eternity o jack what will he then think of the poor transitory gratifications of sense which now engage all his attention tell him dear belford tell him how happy he is if he knows his own happiness how happy compared to his poor dying friend that he has recovered from his illness and has still an opportunity lent him for which i would give a thousand worlds had i them to give  i approved exceedingly of what he said as reflections suited to his present circumstances and inferred consolations to him from a mind so properly touched  he proceeded in the like penitent strain i have lived a very wicked life so have we all we have never made a conscience of doing all the mischief that either force or fraud put it in our power o do we have laid snares for the innocent heart and have not scrupled by the tooready sword to extend as occasions offered the wrongs we did to the persons whom we had before injured in their dearest relations but yet i think in my heart that i have less to answer for than either lovelace or mowbray for i by taking to myself that accursed deceiver from whom thou have freed me and who for years unknown to me was retaliating upon my own head some of the evils i had brought upon others and retiring and living with her as a wife was not party to half the mischiefs that i doubt they and tourville and even you belford committed as to the ungrateful thomasm i hope i have met with my punishment in her but notwithstanding this do thou not think that such an action  and such an action  and such an action and then he recapitulated several enormities in which led on by false bravery and the heat of youth and wine we have all been concerned do thou not think that these villainies let me call them now by their proper name joined to the wilful and gloriedin neglect of every duty that our better sense and education gave us to know were required of us as men and christians are not enough to weigh down my soul into despondency  indeed indeed they are and now to hope for mercy and to depend upon the efficacy of that gracious attribute when that no less shining one of justice forbids me to hope how can i  i who have despised all warnings and taken no advantage of the benefit i might have reaped from the lingering consumptive illness i have labored under but left all to the last stake hoping for recovery against hope and driving off repentance till that grace is denied me for oh my dear belford i can now neither repent nor pray as i ought my heart is hardened and i can do nothing but despair   more he would have said but overwhelmed with grief and infirmity he bowed his head upon his pangful bosom endeavoring to hide from the sight of the hardened mowbray who just then entered the room those tears which he could not restrain  prefacd by a phlegmatic hem sad very sad truly cried mowbray who sat himself down on one side of the bed as i on the other his eyes half closed and his lips pouting out to his turndup nose his chin curdled to use one of thy descriptions leaving one at a loss to know whether stupid drowsiness or intense contemplation had got most hold of him  an excellent however uneasy lesson mowbray said i by my faith it is  it may one day who knows how soon be our own case  i thought of thy yawning fit as described in thy letter of aug    for up started mowbray writhing and shaking himself as in an aguefit his hands stretched over his head  with thy hoy hoy hoy yawning  and then recovering himself with another stretch and a shake what is a clock cried he pulling out his watch  and stalking by long tiptoe strides through the room down stairs he went and meeting the maid in the passage i heard him say  betty bring me a bumper of claret thy poor master and this damned belford are enough to throw a hercules into the vapors  mowbray after this amusing himself in our friends library which is as thou know chiefly classical and dramatical found out a passage in lees oedipus which he ould needs have to be extremely apt and in he came full fraught with the notion of the courage it would give the dying man and read it to him it is poetical and pretty this is it  when the sun sets shadows that showed at noon but small appear most long and terrible so when we think fate hovers over our heads our apprehensions shoot beyond all bounds owls ravens crickets seem the watch of death natures worst verman scare her godlike sons echoes the very leavings of a voice grow babbling ghosts and call us to our graves each molehill thought swells to a huge olympus while we fantastic dreamers heave and puff and sweat with our imaginations weight he expected praises for finding this out but belton turning his head from him ah dick said he these are not the reflections of a dying man what thou will one day feel if it be what i now feel will convince thee that the evils before thee and with thee are more than the effects of imagination  i was called twice on sundaynight to him for the poor fellow when his reflections on his past life annoy him most is afraid of being left with the women and his eyes they tell me hunt and roll about for me where is mr belford  but i shall tire him out cries he  yet beg of him to step to me  yet dont  yet do were once the doubting and changeful orders he gave and they called me accordingly  but alas what could belford do for him belford who had been but too often the companion of his guilty hours who wants mercy as much as he does and is unable to promise it to himself though it is all he can bid his poor friend rely upon  what miscreants are we what figures shall we make in these terrible hours  if miss harlowes glorious example on one hand and the terrors of this poor mans on the other affect me not i must be abandoned to perdition as i fear thou will be if thou benefittest not thyself from both  among the consolatory things i urged when i was called up the last time on sundaynight i told him that he must not absolutely give himself up to despair that many of the apprehensions he was under were such as the best men must have on the dreadful uncertainty of what was to succeed to this life it is well observed said i by a poetical divine who was an excellent christian the rev mr norris of bemerton that death could not a more sad retinue find sickness and pain before and darkness all behind   about eight oclock yesterday monday morning i found him a little calmer he asked me who was the author of the two lines i had repeated to him and made me speak them over again a sad retinue indeed said the poor man and then expressing his hopelessness of life and his terrors at the thoughts of dying and drawing from thence terrible conclusions with regard to his future state there is said i such a natural aversion to death in human nature that you are not to imagine that you my dear belton are singular in the fear of it and in the apprehensions that fill the thoughtful mind upon its approach but you ought as much as possible to separate those natural fears which all men must have on so solemn an occasion from those particular ones which your justlyapprehended unfitness fills you with lord roscommon in his prospect of death which i dipped into last night from a collection in your closet and which i put into my pocket says and turning to the place merely to die no man of reason fears for certainly we must as we are born return to dust it is the last point of many lingering years but whither then we go whither we fain would know but human understanding cannot show this makes us tremble    my lord roscommon therefore proceeded i had such apprehensions of this dark state as you have and the excellent divine i hinted at last night who had very little else but human frailties to reproach himself with and whose miscellanies fell into my hands among my uncles books in my attendance upon him in his last hours says it must be done my soul but it is a strange a dismal and mysterious change when thou shall leave this tenement of clay and to an unknown  somewhere  wing away when time shall be eternity and thou shall be  thou know not what  and live  thou know not how amazing state no wonder that we dread to think of death or view the dead thoure all wrapped up in clouds as if to thee our very knowledge had antipathy then follows what i repeated death could not a more sad retinue find sickness and pain before and darkness all behind   alas my dear belford inferred the unhappy deepthinker what poor creatures does this convince me we mortals are at best  but what then must be the case of such a profligate as i who by a past wicked life have added force to these natural terrors if death be so repugnant a thing to human nature that good men will be startled at it what must it be to one who has lived a life of sense and appetite nor ever reflected upon the end which i now am within view of  what could i say to an inference so fairly drawn mercy mercy unbounded mercy was still my plea though his repeated opposition of justice to it in a manner silenced it and what would i have given to have had rise to my mind one good one eminently good action to have remembered him of in order to combat his fears with it  i believe lovelace i shall tire thee and that more with the subject of my letter than even with the length of it but really i think thy spirits are so offensively up since thy recovery that i ought as the melancholy subjects offer to endeavor by them to reduce thee to the standard of humanity and then thou can not but be curious to know every thing that concerns the poor man for whom thou have always expressed a great regard i will therefore proceed as i have begun if thou likest not to read it now lay it by if thou will till the like circumstances befall thee till like reflections from those circumstances seize thee and then take it up and compare the two cases together  at his earnest request i sat up with him last night and poor man it is impossible to tell thee how easy and safe he thought himself in my company for the first part of the night a drowning man will catch at a straw the proverb well says and a straw was i with respect to any real help i could give him he often awaked in terrors and once calling out for me dear belford said he where are you  oh there you are  give me your friendly hand  then grasping it and putting his clammy halfcold lips to it  how kind i fear every thing when you are absent but the presence of a friend a sympathizing friend  oh how comfortable   but about four in the morning he frighted me much he waked with three terrible groans and endeavored to speak but could not presently  and when he did  jack jack jack five or six times repeated he as quick as thought now now now save me save me save me  i am going  going indeed  i threw my arms about him and raised him upon his pillow as he was sinking as if to hide himself in the bedcloaths  and staring wildly where am i said he a little recovering did you not see him turning his head this way and that horror in his countenance did you not see him  see who see what my dear belton  o lay me upon the bed again cried he  let me not die upon the floor lay me down gently and stand by me leave me not all all will soon be over  you are already my dear belton upon the bed you have not been upon the floor  this is a strong delirium you are faint for want of refreshment for he had refused several times to take any thing let me persuade you to take some of this cordial julep i will leave you if you will not oblige me  he then readily took it but said he could have sworn that tom metcalfe had been in the room and had drawn him out of bed by the throat upbraiding him with the injuries he had first done his sister and then him in the duel to which he owed that fever which cost him his life  thou know the story lovelace too well to need my repeating it but mercy on us if in these terrible moments all the evils we do rise to our affrighted imaginations if so what shocking scenes have i but still more have thou to go through if as the noble poet says if any sense at that sad time remains  the doctor ordered him an opiate this morning early which operated so well that he dosed and slept several hours more quietly than he had done for the two past days and nights though he had sleeping draughts given him before but it is more and more evident every hour that nature is almost worn out in him  mowbray quite tired with this house of mourning intends to set out in the morning to find you he was not a little rejoiced to hear you were in town i believe to have a pretense to leave us  he has just taken leave of his poor friend intending to go away early an everlasting leave i may venture to say for i think he will hardly live till tomorrow night  i believe the poor man would not have been sorry had he left him when i arrived for it is a shocking creature and enjoys too strong health to know how to pity the sick then to borrow an observation from thee he has by nature strong bodily organs which those of his soul are not likely to whet out and he as well as the wicked friend he is going to may last a great while from the strength of their constitutions though so greatly different in their talents if neither the sword nor the halter interpose  i must repeat that i cannot but be very uneasy for the poor lady whom thou so cruelly persecutest and that i do not think thou have kept thy honor with me i was apprehensive indeed that thou would attempt to see her as soon as thou gottest well enough to come up and i told her as much making use of it as an argument to prepare her for thy visit and to induce her to stand it but she could not it is plain bear the shock of it and indeed she told me that she would not see thee though but for one half hour for the world  could she have prevailed upon herself i know that the sight of her would have been as affecting to thee as thy visit could have been to her when thou had seen to what a lovely skeleton for she is really lovely still nor can she with such a form and features be otherwise thou have in a few weeks reduced one of the most charming women in the world and that in the full bloom of her youth and beauty  mowbray undertakes to carry this that he may be more welcome to you he says were it to be sent unsealed the characters we write in would be hebrew to the dunce i desire you to return it and i will give you a copy of it upon demand for i intend to keep it by me as a guard against the infection of thy company which might otherwise perhaps some time hence be apt to weaken the impressions i always desire to have of the awful scene before me god convert us both  letter ii mr belford to robert lovelace esquire wednesdaymorn    of clock i believe no man has two such servants as i have because i treat them with kindness and do not lord it over my inferiors and damn and curse them by looks and words like mowbray or beat their teeth out like lovelace but cry prythee harry do this and prythee jonathan do that the fellows pursue their own devices and regard nothing i say but what falls in with these here this vile harry who might have brought your letter of yesterday in good time came not in with it till past eleven last night drunk i suppose and concluding that i was in bed as he pretends because he was told i sat up the preceding night brought it not to me and having over slept himself just as i had sealed up my letter in comes the villain with the forgotten one shaking his ears and looking as if he himself did not believe the excuses he was going to make i questioned him about it and heard his pitiful pleas and though i never think it becomes a gentleman to treat people insolently who by their stations are humbled beneath his feet yet could i not forbear to lovelace and mowbrayhim most cordially  and this detaining mowbray who was ready to set out to thee before while i write a few lines upon it the fierce fellow who is impatient to exchange the company of a dying belton for that of a too lively lovelace affixed a supplement of curses upon the staring fellow that was larger than my book  nor did i offer to take off the bear from such a mongrel since he deserved not of me on this occasion the protection which every master owes to a good servant  he has not done cursing him yet for stalking about the courtyard with his boots on the poor fellow dressing his horse and unable to get from him he is at him without mercy and i will heighten his impatience since being just under the window where i am writing he will not let me attend to my pen by telling thee how he fills my ears as well as the fellows with his  hay sir and g  d d  n ye sir and were you my servant ye dog ye and must i stay here till the midday sun scorches me to a parchment for such a mangey dogs drunken neglect  ye lie sirrah ye lie i tell you  i hear the fellows voice in an humble excusatory tone though not articulately ye lie ye dog  i would a good mind to thrust my whip down your drunken throat damn me if i would not flay the skin from the back of such a rascal if thou were mine and have dogsskin gloves made of it for thy brother scoundrels to wear in remembrance of thy abuses of such a master  the poor horse suffers for this i doubt not for what now and stand still and be damned to ye cries the fellow with a kick i suppose which he better deserves himself for these varlets where they can are mowbrays and lovelaces to man or beast and not daring to answer him is flaying the poor horse  i hear the fellow is just escaped the horse better curryed than ordinary i suppose in half the usual time by his clanking shoes and mowbrays silence letting me know that i may now write on and so i will tell thee that in the first place little as i as well as you regard dreams i would have thee lay thine to heart for i could give thee such an interpretation of it as would shock thee perhaps and if thou asks me for it i will  mowbray calls to me from the courtyard that it is a cursed hot day and he shall be fried by riding in the noon of it and that poor belton longs to see me so i will only add my earnest desire that thou will give over all thoughts of seeing the lady if when this comes to thy hand thou have not seen her and that it would be kind if thoudst come and for the last time thou will ever see thy poor friend share my concern for him and in him see what in a little time will be thy fate and mine and that of mowbray tourville and the rest of us  for what are ten fifteen twenty or thirty years to look back to in which period forward we shall all perhaps be mingled with the dust we sprung from  letter iii mr lovelace to john belford esquire wednesdaymorn aug    all alive dear jack and in ecstasy likely to be once more a happy man for i have received a letter from my beloved miss harlowe in consequence i suppose of advices that i mentioned in my last from her sister and i am setting out for berks directly to show the contents to my lord m and to receive the congratulations of all my kindred upon it  i went last night as i intended to smiths but the dear creature was not returned at near ten oclock and lighting upon tourville i took him home with me and made him sing me out of my megrims i went to bed tolerably easy at two had bright and pleasant dreams not such a frightful one as that i gave thee an account of and at eight this morning as i was dressing to be in readiness against will came back whom i had sent to enquire after his ladys return i had this letter brought me by a chairman  to robert lovelace esquire tuesday night    oclock aug    sir i have good news to tell you i am setting out with all diligence for my fathers house i am bid to hope that he will receive his poor penitent with a goodness peculiar to himself for i am overjoyed with the assurance of a thorough reconciliation through the interposition of a dear blessed friend whom i always loved and honored i am so taken up with my preparation for this joyful and longwishedfor journey that i cannot spare one moment for any other business having several matters of the last importance to settle first so pray sir dont disturb or interrupt me  i beseech you dont  you may in time possibly see me at my fathers at least if it be not your own fault  i will write a letter which shall be sent you when i am got thither and received till when i am etc  clarissa harlowe   i dispatched instantly a letter to the dear creature assuring her with the most thankful joy that i would directly set out for berks and wait the issue of the happy reconciliation and the charming hopes she had filled me with i poured out upon her a thousand blessings i declared that it should be the study of my whole life to merit such transcendent goodness and that there was nothing which her father or friends should require at my hands that i would not for her sake comply with in order to promote and complete so desirable a reconciliation  i hurried it away without taking a copy of it and i have ordered the chariotandsix to be got ready and hey for m hall  let me but know how belton does i hope a letter from thee is on the road and if the poor fellow can spare thee make haste i advise thee to attend this truly divine lady or else thou may not see her of months perhaps at least not while she is miss harlowe and favor me with one letter before she sets out if possible confirming to me and accounting for this generous change  but what accounting for it is necessary the dear creature cannot receive consolation herself but she must communicate it to others how noble  she would not see me in her adversity but no sooner does the sun of prosperity begin to shine upon her than she forgives me  i know to whose mediation all this is owing it is to col mordens she always as she says loved and honored him and he loved her above all his relations  i shall now be convinced that there is something in dreams the ceiling opening is the reconciliation in view the bright form lifting her up through it to another ceiling stuck round with golden cherubims and seraphims indicates the charming little boys and girls that will be the fruits of this happy reconciliation the welcomes thrice repeated are those of her family now no more to be deemed implacable yet are they a family too that my soul cannot mingle with  but then what is my tumbling over and over through the floor into a frightful hole  descending as she ascends ho only this it alludes to my disrelish to matrimony which is a bottomless pit a gulf and i know not what and i suppose had i not awoke in such a plaguey fright i had been soused into some river at the bottom of the hole and then been carried mundified or purified from my past iniquities by the same bright form waiting for me upon the mossy banks to my beloved girl and we should have gone on cherubiming of it and carolling to the end of the chapter  but what are the black sweeping mantles and robes of my lord m thrown over my face and what are those of the ladies oh jack i have these too they indicate nothing in the world but that my lord will be so good as to die and leave me all he has so rest to thy good natured soul honest lord m  lady sarah sadleir and lady betty lawrance will also die and leave me swindging legacies  miss charlotte and her sister  what will become of them  o they will be in mourning of course for their uncle and aunts  that is right  as to mordens flashing through the window and crying die lovelace and be damned if thou will not repair my cousins wrongs that is only that he would have sent me a challenge had i not been disposed to do the lady justice  all i dislike is this part of the dream for even in a dream i would not be thought to be threatened into any measure though i liked it ever so well  and so much for my prophetic dream  dear charming creature what a meeting will there be between her and her father and mother and uncles what transports what pleasure will this happy longwished for reconciliation give her dutiful heart and indeed now methinks i am glad she is so dutiful to them for her duty to parents is a conviction to me that she will be as dutiful to her husband since duty upon principle is an uniform thing  why prythee now jack i have not been so much to blame as thou think for had it not been for me who have led her into so much distress she could neither have received nor given the joy that will now overwhelm them all so here rises great and durable good out of temporary evil  i knew they loved her the pride and glory of their family too well to hold out long  i wish i could have seen arabellas letter she has always been so much eclipsed by her sister that i dare say she has signified this reconciliation to her with intermingled phlegm and wormwood and her invitation most certainly runs all in the rockwater style  i shall long to see the promised letter too when she is got thither which i hope will give an account of the reception she will meet with  there is a solemnity however i think in the style of her letter which pleases and affects me at the same time but as it is evident she loves me still and hopes soon to see me at her fathers she could not help being a little solemn and halfashamed dear blushing pretty rogue to own her love after my usage of her  and then her subscription till when i am clarissa harlowe as much as to say after that i shall be if not your own fault clarissa lovelace  o my best love my ever generous and adorable creature how much does this thy forgiving goodness exalt us both  i for the occasion given thee thou for turning it so gloriously to thy advantage and to the honor of both  and if my beloved creature you will but connive at the imperfections of your adorer and not play the wife upon me if while the charms of novelty have their force with me i should happen to be drawn aside by the intricacies of intrigue and of plots that my soul loves to form and pursue and if thou will not be openeyed to the follies of my youth a transitory state every excursion shall serve but the more to endear thee to me till in time and in a very little time too i shall get above sense and then charmed by thy soulattracting converse and brought to despise my former courses what i now at distance consider as a painful duty will be my joyful choice and all my delight will center in thee  mowbray is just arrived with thy letters i therefore close my agreeable subject to attend to one which i doubt will be very shocking i have engaged the rough varlet to bear me company in the morning to berks where i shall file off the rust he has contracted in his attendance upon the poor fellow  he tells me that between the dying belton and the preaching belford he shall not be his own man these three days and says that thou addest to the unhappy fellows weakness instead of giving him courage to help him to bear his destiny  i am sorry he takes the unavoidable lot so heavily but he has been long ill and sickness enervates the mind as well as the body as he himself very significantly observed to thee  letter iv mr lovelace to john belford esquire wedn evening i have been reading thy shocking letter  poor belton what a multitude of lively hours have we passed together twas a fearless cheerful fellow  whod have thought all should end in such dejected whimpering and terror  but why did thou not comfort the poor man about the rencounter between him and that poltroon metcalfe he acted in that affair like a man of true honor and as i should have acted in the same circumstances tell him i say so and what happened he could neither help nor foresee  some people are as sensible of a scratch from a pins point as others from a push of a sword and who can say any thing for the sensibility of such fellows metcalfe would resent for his sister when his sister resented not for herself had she demanded her brothers protection and resentment that would have been another mans matter as lord m phrases it but she herself thought her brother a coxcomb to busy himself undesired in her affairs and wished for nothing but to be provided for decently and privately in her lyingin and was willing to take the chance of maintenoning his conscience in her favor madam maintenon was reported to have prevailed upon lewis xiv of france in his old age sunk as he was by ill success in the field to marry her by way of compounding with his conscience for the freedoms of his past life to which she attributed his public losses  and getting him to marry when the little stranger came for she knew what an easy goodnatured fellow he was and indeed if she had prevailed upon him it might have been happy for both as then he would not have fallen in with his cursed thomasin but truly this officious brother of hers must interpose this made a trifling affair important and what was the issue metcalfe challenged belton met him disarmed him gave him his life but the fellow more sensible in his skin than in his head having received a scratch he was frighted it gave him first a puke then a fever and then he died that was all and how could belton help that  but sickness a long tedious sickness will make a bugbear of any thing to a languishing heart i see that and so far was mowbray apropos in the verses from not lee which thou have transcribed  merely to die no man of reason fears is a mistake say thou or say thy author what ye will and thy solemn parading about the natural repugnance between life and death is a proof that it is  let me tell thee jack that so much am i pleased with this world in the main though in some points too the world to make a person of it has been a rascal to me so delighted am i with the joys of youth with my worldly prospects as to fortune and now newly with the charming hopes given me by dear thrice dear and forever dear miss harlowe that were i even sure that nothing bad would come hereafter i should be very loath very much afraid if thou will have it so to lay down my life and them together and yet upon a call of honor no man fears death less than myself  but i have not either inclination or leisure to weigh thy leaden arguments except in the pig or as thou would say in the lump  if i return thy letters let me have them again some time hence that is to say when i am married or when poor belton is halfforgotten or when time has enrolled the honest fellow among those whom we have so long lost that we may remember them with more pleasure than pain and then i may give them a serious perusal and enter with thee as deeply as thou will into the subject  when i am married said i  what a sound has that  i must wait with patience for a sight of this charming creature till she is at her fathers and yet as the but blossoming beauty as thou tellest me is reduced to a shadow i should have been exceedingly delighted to see her now and every day till the happy one that i might have the pleasure of beholding how sweetly hour by hour she will rise to her pristine glories by means of that state of ease and contentment which will take place of the stormy past upon her reconciliation with her friends and our happy nuptials  letter v mr lovelace to john belford esquire well but now my heart is a little at ease i will condescend to take some brief notice of some other passages in thy letters  i find i am to thank thee that the dear creature has avoided my visit things are now in so good a train that i must forgive thee else should thou have heard more of this new instance of disloyalty to thy general  thou art continually giving thyself high praise by way of opposition as i may say to others gently and artfully blaming thyself for qualities thou would at the same time have to be thought and which generally are thought praiseworthy  thus in the airs thou assumest about thy servants thou would pass for a mighty humane mortal and that at the expense of mowbray and me whom thou representest as kings and emperors to our menials yet art thou always unhappy in thy attempts of this kind and never can make us who know thee believe that to be a virtue in thee which is but the effect of constitutional phlegm and absurdity  know thou not that some men have a native dignity in their manner that makes them more regarded by a look than either thou can be in thy low style or mowbray in his high  i am fit to be a prince i can tell thee for i reward well and i punish seasonably and properly and i am generally as well served as any man  the art of governing these underbred varlets lies more in the dignity of looks than in words and thou art a sorry fellow to think humanity consists in acting by thy servants as men must act who are not able to pay them their wages or had made them masters of secrets which if divulged would lay them at the mercy of such wretches  now to me who never did any thing i was ashamed to own and who have more ingenuity than ever man had who can call a villainy by its right name though practiced by myself and by my own readiness to reproach myself anticipate all reproach from others who am not such a hypocrite as to wish the world to think me other or better than i am it is my part to look a servant into his duty if i can nor will i keep one who knows not how to take me by a nod or a wink and who when i smile shall not be all transport when i frown all terror if indeed i am out of the way a little i always take care to reward the varlets for bearing patiently my displeasure but this i hardly ever am but when a fellow is egregiously stupid in any plain points of duty or will be wiser than his master and when he shall tell me that he thought acting contrary to my orders was the way to serve me best  one time or other i will enter the lists with thee upon thy conduct and mine to servants and i will convince thee that what thou would have pass for humanity if it be indiscriminately practiced to all tempers will perpetually subject thee to the evils thou complainest of and justly too and that he only is fit to be a master of servants who can command their attention as much by a nod as if he were to prythee a fellow to do his duty on one hand or to talk of flaying and horsewhipping like mowbray on the other for the servant who being used to expect thy creeping style will always be master of his master and he who deserves to be treated as the other is not fit to be any mans servant nor would i keep such a fellow to rub my horses heels  i shall be the readier to enter the lists with thee upon this argument because i have presumption enough to think that we have not in any of our dramatic poets that i can at present call to mind one character of a servant of either sex that is justly hit off so absurdly wise some and so sottishly foolish others and both sometimes in the same person foils drawn from the lees or dregs of the people to set off the characters of their masters and mistresses nay sometimes which is still more absurd introduced with more wit than the poet has to bestow upon their principals  mere stints and steels to strike fire with  or to vary the metaphor to serve for whetstones to wit which otherwise could not be made apparent  or for engines to be made use of like the machinery of the ancien poets or the still more unnatural soliloquy to help on a sorry plot or to bring about a necessary eclaircissement to save the poet the trouble of thinking deeply for a better way to wind up his bottoms  of this i am persuaded whatever my practice be to my own servants that thou will be benefited by my theory when we come to controvert the point for then i shall convince thee that the dramatic as well as natural characteristics of a good servant ought to be fidelity common sense cheerful obedience and silent respect that wit in his station except to his companions would be sawciness that he should never presume to give his advice that if he ventured to expostulate upon any unreasonable command or such a one as appeared to him to be so he should do it with humility and respect and take a proper season for it but such lessons do most of the dramatic performances i have seen give where servants are introduced as characters essential to the play or to act very significant or long parts in it which of itself i think a fault such lessons i say do they give to the footmens gallery that i have not wondered we have so few modest or good menservants among those who often attend their masters or mistresses to plays then how miserably evident must that poets conscious want of genius be who can stoop to raise or give force to a clap by the indiscriminative roar of the partycolored gallery  but this subject i will suspend to a better opportunity that is to say to the happy one when my nuptials with my clarissa will oblige me to increase the number of my servants and of consequence to enter more nicely into their qualifications  although i have the highest opinion that man can have of the generosity of my dear miss harlowe yet i cannot for the heart of me account for this agreeable change in her temper but one way faith and troth belford i verily believe laying all circumstances together that the dear creature unexpectedly finds herself in the way i have so ardently wished her to be in and that this makes her at last incline to favor me that she may set the better face upon her gestation when at her fathers  if this be the case all her sailing away and her fainting fts are charmingly accounted for nor is it surprising that such a sweet novice in these matters should not know to what to attribute her frequent indispositions if this should be the case how shall i laugh at thee and when i am sure of her at the dear novice herself that all her grievous distresses shall end in a manchild which i shall love better than all the cherubims and seraphims that may come after though there were to be as many of them as i beheld in my dream in which a vast expanse of ceiling was stuck as full of them as it could hold  i shall be afraid to open thy next lest it bring me the account of poor beltons death yet as there are no hopes of his recovery  but what should i say unless the poor man were better fitted  but thy heavy sermon shall not affect me too much neither  i enclose thy papers and do thou transcribe them for me or return them for there are some things in them which at a proper season a mortal man should not avoid attending to and thou seem to have entered deeply into the shocking subject  but here i will end lest i grow too serious  thy servant called here about an hour ago to know if i had any commands i therefore hope that thou will have this early in the morning and if thou can let me hear from thee do i will stretch an hour or two in expectation of it yet i must be at lord ms tomorrow night if possible though ever so late  thy fellow tells me the poor man is much as he was when mowbray left him  would thou think that this varlet mowbray is sorry that i am so near being happy with miss harlowe and egad jack i know not what to say to it now the fruit seems to be within my reach but let what will come i will stand to it for i find i cannot live without her  letter vi mr belford to robert lovelace esquire wedn three oclock i will proceed where i left off in my last  as soon as i had seen mowbray mounted i went to attend upon poor belton whom i found in dreadful agonies in which he awoke as he generally does  the doctor came in presently after and i was concerned at the scene that passed between them  it opened with the dying mans asking him with melancholy earnestness if nothing if nothing at all could be done for him  the doctor shook his head and told him he doubted not  i cannot die said the poor man i cannot think of dying i am very desirous of living a little longer if i could but be free from these horrible pains in my stomach and head can you give me nothing to make me pass one week but one week in tolerable ease that i may die like a man  if i must die  but doctor i am yet a young man in the prime of my years  youth is a good subject for a physician to work upon can you do nothing nothing at all for me doctor  alas sir replied his physician you have been long in a bad way i fear i fear nothing in physic can help you  he was then out of all patience what then is your art sir  i have been a passive machine for a whole twelvemonth to be wrought upon at the pleasure of you people of the faculty i verily believe had i not taken such doses of nasty stuff i had been now a well man  but who the plague would regard physicians whose art is to cheat us with hopes while they help to destroy us and who not one of you know any thing but by guess  sir continued he fiercely and with more strength of voice and coherence than he had shown for several hours before if you give me over i give you over  the only honest and certain part of the art of healing is surgery a good surgeon is worth a thousand of you i have been in surgeons hands often and have always found reason to depend upon their skill but your art sir what is it  but to dawb dawb dawb load load load plaster plaster plaster till ye utterly destroy the appetite first and the constitution afterward which you are calledin to help i had a companion once  my dear belford thou knew honest blomer  as pretty a physician he would have made as any in england had he kept himself from excess in wine and women and he always used to say there was nothing at all but pickpocket parade in the physicians art and that the best guesser was the best physician and i used to believe him too and yet fond of life and fearful of death what do we do when we are taken ill but call ye in and what do ye do when called in but nurse our distempers till from pigmies you make giants of them  and then ye come creeping with solemn faces when ye are ashamed to prescribe or when the stomach will not bear its natural food by reason of your poisonous potions alas i am afraid physic can do no more for him  nor need it when it has brought to the brink of the grave the poor wretch who placed all his reliance in your cursed slops and the flattering hopes you gave him  the doctor was out of countenance but said if we could make mortal men immortal and would not all this might be just  i blamed the poor man yet excused him to the physician to die dear doctor when like my poor friend we are so desirous of life is a melancholy thing we are apt to hope too much not considering that the seeds of death are sown in us when we begin to live and grow up till like rampant weeds they choke the tender flower of life which declines in us as those weeds flourish we ought therefore to begin early to study what our constitutions will bear in order to root out by temperance the weeds which the soil is most apt to produce or at least to keep them down as they rise and not when the flower or plant is withered at the root and the weed in its full vigor expect that the medical art will restore the one or destroy the other when that other as i hinted has been rooting itself in the habit from the time of our birth  this speech bob thou will call a prettiness or a white bear  but the allegory is just and thou have not quite cured me of the metaphorical  very true said the doctor you have brought a good metaphor to illustrate the thing i am sorry i can do nothing for the gentleman and can only recommend patience and a better frame of mind  well sir said the poor angry man vexed at the doctor but more at death you will perhaps recommend the next in succession to the physician when he can do no more and i suppose will send your brother to pray by me for those virtues which you wish me  it seems the physicians brother is a clergyman in the neighborhood  i was greatly concerned to see the gentleman thus treated and so i told poor belton when he was gone but he continued impatient and would not be denied he said the liberty of talking to a man who had taken so many guineas of him for doing nothing or worse than nothing and never declined one though he knew all the time he could do him no good  it seems the gentleman though rich is noted for being greedy after sees and poor belton went on raving at the extravagant fees of english physicians compared with those of the most eminent foreign ones but poor man he like the turks who judge of a general by his success out of patience to think he must die would have worshipped the doctor and not grudged three times the sm could he have given him hopes of recovery  but nevertheless i must needs say that gentlemen of the faculty should be more moderate in their fees or take more pains to deserve them for generally they only come into a room feel the sick mans pulse ask the nurse a few questions inspect the patients tongue and perhaps his water then sit down look plaguey wise and write the golden fee finds the ready hand and they hurry away as if the sick mans room were infectious so to the next they troll and to the next if men of great practice valuing themselves upon the number of visits they make in a morning and the little time they make them in they go to dinner and unload their pockets and sally out again to refill them and thus in a little time they raise vast estates for as ratcliffe said when first told of a great loss which befell him it was only going up and down a hundred pair of stairs to fetch it up  mrs sambre beltons sister had several times proposed to him a minister to pray by him but the poor man could not he said bear the thoughts of one for that he should certainly die in an hour or two after and he was willing to hope still against all probability that he might recover and was often asking his sister if she had not seen people as bad as he was who almost to a miracle when every body gave them over had got up again  she shaking her head told him she had but once saying that their disorders were of an acute kind and such as had a crisis in them he called her smallhopes and jobs comforter and bid her say nothing if she could not say more to the purpose and what was fitter for a sick man to hear and yet poor fellow he has no hopes himself as is plain by his desponding terrors one of which he fell into and a very dreadful one soon after the doctor went   wednesday   oclock at night the poor man has been in convulsions terrible convulsions for an hour past o lord lovelace death is a shocking thing by my faith it is  i wish thou were present on this occasion it is not merely the concern a man has for his friend but as death is the common lot we see in his agonies how it will be one day with ourselves i am all over as if cold water were poured down my back or as if i had a strong ague fit upon me i was obliged to come away and i write hardly knowing what  i wish thou were here   though i left him because i could stay no longer i cannot be easy by myself but must go to him again  eleven oclock poor belton  drawing on apace yet was he sensible when i went in too sensible poor man he has something upon his mind to reveal he tells me that is the worst action of his life worse than ever you or i knew of him he says it must be then very bad  he ordered every body out but was seized with another convulsionfit before he could reveal it and in it he lies struggling between life and death but i will go in again   one oclock in the morning all now must soon be over with him poor poor fellow he has given me some hints of what he wanted to say but all incoherent interrupted by dying hiccoughs and convulsions  bad enough it must be heaven knows by what i can gather alas lovelace i fear i fear he came too soon into his uncles estate  if a man were to live always he might have some temptation to do base things in order to procure to himself as it would then be everlasting ease plenty or affluence but for the sake of ten twenty thirty years of poor life to be a villain  can that be worth while with a conscience singing him all the time too and when he comes to wind up all such agonizing reflections upon his past guilt all then appearing as nothing what he most valued most disgustful and not one thing to think of as the poor fellow says twenty and twenty times over but what is attended with anguish and reproach  to hear the poor man wish he had never been born to hear him pray to be nothing after death good god how shocking  by his incoherent hints i am afraid it is very bad with him no pardon no mercy he repeats can lie for him  i hope i shall make a proper use of this lesson laugh at me if thou will but never never more will i take the liberties i have taken but whenever i am tempted will think of beltons dying agonies and what my own may be   thursday three in the morning he is now at the last gasp  rattles in the throat has a new convulsion every minute almost what horror is he in his eyes look like breathstained glass they roll ghastly no more are quite set his face distorted and drawn out by his sinking jaws and erected staring eyebrows with his lengthened furrowed forehead to double its usual length as it seems it is not it cannot be the face of belton thy belton and my belton whom we have beheld with so much delight over the social bottle comparing notes that one day may be brought against us and make us groan as they very lately did him  that is to say while he had strength to groan for now his voice is not to be heard all inward lost not so much as speaking by his eyes yet strange how can it be the bed rocking under him like a cradle   four oclock alas he is gone that groan that dreadful groan was the last farewell of the parting mind the struggling soul has bid a long adieu to its late mansion  fled  ah whither fled now is all indeed over  poor poor belton by this time thou know if thy crimes were above the size of gods mercies now are every ones cares and attendance at an end now do we thy friends poor belton know the worst of thee as to this life thou art released from insufferable tortures both of body and mind may those tortures and thy repentance expiate for thy offenses and may thou be happy to all eternity  we are told that god desires not the death the spiritual death of a sinner and it is certain that thou did deeply repent i hope therefore as thou were not cut off in the midst of thy sins by the sword of injured friendship which more than once thou had braved the dreadfullest of all deaths next to suicide because it gives no opportunity for repentance that this is a merciful earnest that thy penitence is accepted and that thy long illness and dreadful agonies in the last stages of it will be thy only punishment  i wish indeed i heartily wish we could have seen one ray of comfort darting in upon his benighted mind before he departed but all alas to the very last gasp was horror and confusion and my only fear arises from this that till within the four last days of his life he could not be brought to think he should die though in a visible decline for months and in that presumption was too little inclined to set about a serious preparation for a journey which he hoped he should not be obliged to take and when he began to apprehend that he could not put it off his impatience and terror and apprehension showed too little of that reliance and resignation which afford the most comfortable reflections to the friends of the dying as well as to the dying themselves  but we must leave poor belton to that mercy which we have all so much need of and for my own part do you lovelace and the rest of the fraternity as ye will i am resolved i will endeavor to begin to repent of my follies while my health is sound my intellects untouched and while it is in my power to make some atonement as near to restitution as is possible to those i have wronged or missed and do ye outwardly and from a point of false bravery make as light as ye will of my resolution as ye are none of ye of the class of abandoned and stupid sots who endeavor to disbelieve the future existence which ye are afraid of i am sure you will justify me in your hearts if not by your practices and one day you will wish you had joined with me in the same resolution and will confess there is more good sense in it than now perhaps you will own   seven of clock thursday morning you are very earnest by your last letter just given me to hear again from me before you set out for berks i will therefore close with a few words upon the only subject in your letter which i can at present touch upon and this is the letter you give me a copy of from the lady  want of rest and the sad scene i have before my eyes have rendered me altogether incapable of accounting for it in any shape you are in ecstasies upon it you have reason to be so if it be as you think nor would i rob you of your joy but i must say that i am amazed at it  surely lovelace this surprising letter cannot be a forgery of thy own in order to carry on some view and to impose upon me yet by the style of it it cannot though thou art a perfect proteus too  i will not however add another word after i have desired the return of this and have told you that i am  your true friend and wellwisher j belford   letter vii mr lovelace to john belford esquire aug    thursday morn i received thy letter in such good time by thy fellows dispatch that it gives me an opportunity of throwing in a few paragraphs upon it i read a passage or two of it to mowbray and we both agree that thou art an absolute master of the lamentable  poor belton what terrible conflicts were thy last conflicts  i hope however that he is happy and i have the more hope because the hardness of his death is likely to be such a warning to thee if it have the effect thou declarest it shall have what a world of mischief will it prevent how much good will it do how many poor wretches will rejoice at the occasion if they know it however melancholy in itself which shall bring them in a compensation for injuries they had been forced to sit down contented with but jack though thy uncles death has made thee a rich fellow art thou sure that the making good of such a vow will not totally bankrupt thee  thou say i may laugh at thee if i will not i jack i do not take it to be a laughing subject and i am heartily concerned at the loss we all have in poor belton and when i get a little settled and have leisure to contemplate the vanity of all sublunary things a subject that will nowandthen in my gayest hours obtrude itself upon me it is very likely that i may talk seriously with thee upon these topics and if thou have not got too much the start of me in the repentance thou art entering upon will go handinhand with thee in it if thou have thou will let me just keep thee in my eye for it is an uphill work and i shall see thee at setting out at a great distance but as thou art a much heavier and clamsier fellow than myself i hope that without much puffing and sweating only keeping on a good round dogtrot i shall be able to overtake thee  mean time take back thy letter as thou desire i would not have it in my pocket upon any account at present nor read it once more  i am going down without seeing my beloved i was a hasty fool to write her a letter promising that i would not come near her till i saw her at her fathers for as she is now actually at smiths and i so near her one short visit could have done no harm  i sent will two hours ago with my grateful compliments and to know how she does how must i adore this charming creature for i am ready to think my servant a happier fellow than myself for having been within a pair of stairs and an apartment of her  mowbray and i will drop a tear apiece as we ride along to the memory of poor belton  as we ride along i say for we shall have so much joy when we arrive at lord ms and when i communicate to him and my cousins the dear creatures letter that we shall forget every thing grievous since now their familyhopes in my reformation the point which lies so near their hearts will all revive it being an article of their faith that if i marry repentance and mortification will follow of course  neither mowbray nor i shall accept of thy verbal invitation to the funeral we like not these dismal formalities and as to the respect that is supposed to be shown to the memory of a deceased friend in such an attendance why should we do any thing to reflect upon those who have made it a fashion to leave this parade to people whom they hire for that purpose  adieu and be cheerful thou can now do no more for poor belton were thou to howl for him to the end of thy life  letter viii mr belford to robert lovelace esquire sat aug    on thursday afternoon i assisted at the opening of poor beltons will in which he has left me his sole executor and bequeathed me a legacy of  00 guineas which i shall present to his unfortunate sister to whom he has not been so kind as i think he ought to have been he has also left  0 l apiece to mowbray tourville thyself and me for a ring to be worn in remembrance of him  after i had given some particular orders about the preparations to be made for his funeral i went to town but having made it late before i got in on thursday night and being fatigued for want of rest several nights before and low in my spirits i could not help it lovelace i contented myself to send my compliments to the innocent sufferer to inquire after her health  my servant saw mrs smith who told him she was very glad i was come to town for that the lady was worse than she had yet been  it is impossible to account for the contents of her letter to you or to reconcile those contents to the facts i have to communicate  i was at smiths by seven yesterday friday morning and found that the lady was just gone in a chair to st dunstans to prayers she was too ill to get out by six to covent garden church and was forced to be supported to her chair by mrs lovick they would have persuaded her against going but she said she knew not but it would be her last opportunity mrs lovick dreading that she would be taken worse at church walked thither before her  mrs smith told me she was so ill on wednesday night that she had desired to receive the sacrament and accordingly it was administered to her by the parson of the parish whom she besought to take all opportunities of assisting her in her solemn preparation  this the gentleman promised and called in the morning to enquire after her health and was admitted at the first word he staid with her about half an hour and when he came down with his face turned aside and a faltering accent mrs smith said he you have an angel in your house  i will attend her again in the evening as she desires and as often as i think it will be agreeable to her  her increased weakness she attributed to the fatigues she had undergone by your means and to a letter she had received from her sister which she answered the same day  mrs smith told me that two different persons had called there one on thursday morning one in the evening to inquire after her state of health and seemed as if commissioned from her relations for that purpose but asked not to see her only were very inquisitive after her visitors particularly it seems after me what could they mean by that after her way of life and expenses and one of them inquired after her manner of supporting them to the latter of which mrs smith said she had answered as the truth was that she had been obliged to sell some of her clothes and was actually about parting with more at which the inquirist a grave old farmerlooking man held up his hands and said good god  this will be sad sad news to somebody i believe i must not mention it but mrs smith says she desired he would let him come from whom he would he shook his head and said if she died the flower of the world would be gone and the family she belonged to would be no more than a common family this man came from her  hereafter  i was pleased with the mans expression  you may be curious to know how she passed her time when she was obliged to leave her lodging to avoid you  mrs smith tells me that she was very ill when she went out on monday morning and sighed as if her heart would break as she came down stairs and as she went through the shop into the coach her nurse with her as you had informed me before that she ordered the coachman whom she hired for the day to drive anywhither so it was unto the air he accordingly drove her to hamstead and thence  ate there she lighted at the bowlinggree  remely ill and having breakfasted ordered  coa  to drive very slowly anywhere h  ellhill and put up at a public house there where she employed herself two hours in writing though exceedingly weak and low till the dinner she had ordered was brought in she endeavored to eat but could not her appetite was gone quite gone she said and then she wrote on for three hours more after which being heavy she dozed a little in an elbowchair when she awoke she ordered the coachman to drive her very slowly to town to the house of a friend of mrs lovick whom as agreed upon she met there but being extremely ill she would venture home at a late hour although she heard from the widow that you had been there and had reason to be shocked at your behavior she said she found there was no avoiding you she was apprehensive she should not live many hours and it was not impossible but the shock the sight of you must give her would determine her fate in your presence  she accordingly went home she heard the relation of your astonishing vagaries with hands and eyes often lifted up and with the words shocking creature incorrigible wretch and will nothing make him serious intermingled and not being able to bear an interview with a man so hardened she took to her usual chair early in the morning and was carried to the templestairs whither she had ordered her nurse before her to get a pair of oars in readiness for her fatigues the day before made her unable to bear a coach and then she was rowed to chelsea where she breakfasted and after rowing about put in at the swan at brentfordaight where she dined and would have written but had no convenience either of tolerable pens or ink or private room and then proceeding to richmond they rowed her back to mortlack where she put in and drank tea at a house her waterman recommended to her she wrote there for an hour and returned to the temple and when she landed made one of the watermen get her a chair and so was carried to the widows friend as the night before where she again met the widow who informed her that you had been after her twice that day  mrs lovick gave here there her sisters letter see letter xi  and she was so much affected with the contents of it that she was twice very near fainting away and wept bitterly as mrs lovick told mrs smith dropping some warmer expressions than ever they had heard proceed from her lips in relation to her friends calling them cruel and complaining of ill offices done her and of vile reports raised against her  while she was thus disturbed mrs smith came to her and told her that you had been there a third time and was just gone at half an hour after nine having left word how civil and respectful you would be but that you was determined to see her at all events  she said it was hard she could not be permitted to die in peace that her lot was a severe one that she began to be afraid she should not forbear repining and to think her punishment greater than her fault but recalling herself immediately she comforted herself that her life would be short and with the assurance of a better  by what i have mentioned you will conclude with me that the letter brought her by mrs lovick the superscription of which you saw to be written in her sisters hand could not be the letter on the contents of which she grounded that she wrote to you on her return home and yet neither mrs lovick nor mrs smith nor the servant of the latter know of any other brought her but as the women assured me that she actually did write to you i was eased of a suspicion which i had begun to entertain that you for some purpose i could not guess at had forged the letter from her of which you sent me a copy  on wednesday morning when she received your letter in answer to hers she said necessity may well be called the mother of invention  but calamity is the test of integrity  i hope i have not taken an inexcusable step  and there she stopped a minute or two and then said i shall now perhaps be allowed to die in peace  i staid till she came in she was glad to see me but being very weak said she must sit down before she could go up stairs and so went into the backshop leaning upon mrs lovick and when she had sat down i am glad to see you mr belford said she i must say so  let misreporters say what they will  i wondered at this expression explained hereafter  but would not interrupt her  oh sir said she i have been grievously harassed your friend who would not let me live with reputation will not permit me to die in peace  you see how i am  is there not a great alteration in me within this week  but it is all for the better  yet were i to wish for life i must say that your friend your barbarous friend has hurt me greatly  she was so very weak so shortbreathed and her words and action so very moving that i was forced to walk from her the two women and her nurse turning away their faces also weeping  i have had madam said i since i saw you a most shocking scene before my eyes for days together my poor friend belton is no more he quitted the world yesterday morning in such dreadful agonies that the impression it has left upon me has so weakened my mind  i was loath to have her think that my grief was owing to the weak state i saw her in for fear of dispiriting her  that is only mr belford interrupted she in order to strengthen it if a proper use be made of the impression  but i should be glad since you are so humanely affected with the solemn circumstance that you could have written an account of it in the style and manner you are master of to your gay friend who knows as it would have come from an associate and of an associate how it might have affected him  that i had done i told her in such a manner as had i believed some effect upon you  his behavior in this honest family so lately said she and his cruel pursuit of me give but little hopes that any thing serious or solemn will affect him  we had some alk about beltons dying behavior and i gave her several particulars of the poor mans impatience and despair to which she was very attentive and made fine observations upon the subject of procrastination  a letter and pacqet were brought her by a man on horseback from miss how while we were talking she retired upstairs to read it and while i was in discourse with mrs smith and mrs lovick the doctor and apothecary both came in together they confirmed to me my fears as to the dangerous way she is in they had both been apprized of the new instances of implacableness in her friends and of your persecutions and the doctor said he would not for the world be either the unforgiving father of that lady or the man who had brought her to this distress her hearts broke she will die said he there is no saving her but how were i either the one or the other of the people i have named i should support myself afterward i cannot tell  when she was told we were all three together she desired us to walk up she arose to receive us and after answering two or three general questions relating to her health she addressed herself to us to the following effect  as i may not said she see you three gentlemen together again let me take this opportunity to acknowledge my obligations to you all i am inexpressibly obliged to you sir and to you sir courtesying to the doctor and to mr goddard for your more than friendly your paternal care and concern for me humanity in your profession i dare say is far from being a rare qualification because you are gentlemen by your profession but so much kindness so much humanity did never desolate creature meet with as i have met with from you both but indeed i have always observed that where a person relies upon providence it never fails to raise up a new friend for every old one that falls off  this gentleman bowing to me who some people think should have been one of the last i should have thought of as my executor  is nevertheless such is the strange chance of things the only one i can choose and therefore i have chosen him for that charitable office and he has been so good as to accept of it for rich as i may boast myself to be i am rather so in right than in fact at this present i repeat therefore my humble thanks to you all three and beg of god to return to you and yours looking to each an hundredfold the kindness and favor you have shown me and that it may be in the power of you and of yours to the end of time to confer benefits rather than to be obliged to receive them this is a godlike power gentlemen i once rejoiced in it in some little degree and much more in the prospect i had of its being enlarged to me though i have had the mortification to experience the reverse and to be obliged almost to every body i have seen or met with but all originally through my own fault so i ought to bear the punishment without repining and i hope i do  forgive these impertinencies a grateful heart that wants the power it wishes for to express itself suitably to its own impulses will be at a loss what properly to dictate to the tongue and yet unable to restrain its overflowings will force it to say weak and silly things rather than appear ingratefully silent once more then i thank ye all three for your kindness to me and god almighty make you that amends which at present i cannot  she retired from us to her closet with her eyes full and left us looking upon one another  we had hardly recovered ourselves when she quite easy cheerful and smiling returned to us doctor said she seeing we had been moved you will excuse me for the concern i give you and so will you mr goddard and you mr belford for it is a concern that only generous natures can show and to such natures sweet is the pain if i may so say that attends such a concern but as i have some few preparations still to make and would not though in ease of mr belfords future cares which is and ought to be part of my study undertake more than it is likely i shall have time lent me to perform i would beg of you to give me your opinions you see my way of living and you may be assured that i will do nothing wilfully to shorten my life how long it may possibly be before i may hope to be released from all my troubles  they both hesitated and looked upon each other dont be afraid to answer me said she each sweet hand pressing upon the arm of each gentleman with that mingled freedom and reserve which virgin modesty mixed with conscious dignity can only express and with a look serenely earnest tell me how long you think i may hold it and believe me gentlemen the shorter you tell me my time is likely to be the more comfort you will give me  with what pleasing woe said the doctor do you fill the minds of those who have the happiness to converse with you and see the happy frame you are in what you have undergone within a few days past has much hurt you and should you have fresh troubles of those kinds i could not be answerable for your holding it  and there he paused  how long doctor  i believe i shall have a little more ruffling  i am afraid i shall  but there can happen only one thing that i shall not be tolerably easy under  how long then sir   he was silent  a fortnight sir  he was still silent  ten days  a week  how long sir with smiling earnestness  if i must speak madam if you have not better treatment than you have lately met with i am afraid  there again he stopped  afraid of what doctor dont be afraid  how long sir  that a fortnight or three weeks may deprive the world of the finest flower in it  a fortnight or three weeks yet doctor  but gods will be done i shall however by this means have full time if i have but strength and intellect to do all that is now upon my mind to do and so sirs i can but once more thank you turning to each of us for all your goodness to me and having letters to write will take up no more of your time  only doctor be pleased to order me some more of those drops they cheer me a little when i am low and putting a fee into his unwilling hand  you know the terms sir  then turning to mr goddard you will be so good sir as to look in upon me tonight or tomorrow as you have opportunity and you mr belford i know will be desirous to set out to prepare for the last office for your late friend so i wish you a good journey and hope to see you when that is performed  she then retired with a cheerful and serene air the two gentlemen went away together i went down to the women and inquiring found that mrs lovick was this day to bring her twenty guineas more for some other of her apparel  the widow told me that she had taken the liberty to expostulate with her upon the occasion she had for raising this money to such great disadvantage and it produced the following short and affecting conversation between them  none of my friends will wear any thing of mine said she i shall leave a great many good things behind me  and as to what i want the money for  dont be surprised  but suppose i want it to purchase a house  you are all mystery madam i dont comprehend you  why then mrs lovick i will explain myself i have a man not a woman for my executor and think you that i will leave to his care any thing that concerns my own person  now mrs lovick smiling do you comprehend me  mrs lovick wept  o fie proceeded the lady drying up her tears with her own handkerchief and giving her a kiss  why this kind weakness for one whom you have been so little a while acquainted with dear good mrs lovick dont be concerned for me on a prospect which i have occasion to be pleased with but go tomorrow to your friends and bring me the money they have agreed to give you  thus lovelace is it plain that she means to bespeak her last house here is presence of mind here is tranquillity of heart on the most affecting occasion  this is magnanimity indeed  could thou or could i with all our boisterous bravery and offensive false courage act thus  poor belton how unlike was thy behavior  mrs lovick tells me that the lady spoke of a letter she had received from her favorite divine dr lewin in the time of my absence and of an answer she had returned to it but mrs lovick knows not the contents of either  when thou receivest this letter thou will see what will soon be the end of all thy injuries to this divine lady i say when thou receivest it for i will delay it for some little time lest thou should take it into thy head under pretense of resenting the disappointment her letter must give thee to molest her again  this letter having detained me by its length i shall not now set out for epsom till tomorrow  i should have mentioned that the lady explained to me what the one thing was that she was afraid might happen to ruffle her it was the apprehension of what may result from a visit which col morden as she is informed designs to make you  letter ix the revd dr lewen to miss cl harlowe friday aug    presuming dearest and everrespectable young lady upon your former favor and upon your opinion of my judgment and sincerity i cannot help addressing you by a few lines on your present unhappy situation  i will not look back upon the measures which you have either been led or driven into but will only say as to those that i think you are the least to blame of any young lady that was ever reduced from happy to unhappy circumstances and i have not been wanting to say as much where i hoped my freedom would have been better received than i have had the mortification to find it to be  what i principally write for now is to put you upon doing a piece of justice to yourself and to your sex in the prosecuting for his life i am assured his life is in your power the most profligate and abandoned of men as he must be who could act so basely as i understand mr lovelace has acted by you  i am very ill and am now forced to write upon my pillow my thoughts confused and incapable of method i shall not therefore aim at method but to give you in general my opinion and that is that your religion your duty to your family the duty you owe to your honor and even charity to your sex oblige you to give public evidence against this very wicked man  and let me add another consideration the prevention by this means of the mischiefs that may otherwise happen between your brother and mr lovelace or between the latter and your cousin morden who is now i hear arrived and resolves to have justice done you  a consideration which ought to affect your conscience forgive me dearest young lady i think i am now in the way of my duty and to be of more concern to you than that hard pressure upon your modesty which i know the appearance against him in an open court must be of to such a lady as you and which i conceive will be your great difficulty but i know madam that you have dignity enough to become the blushes of the most naked truth when necessity justice and honor exact it from you rakes and ravishers would meet with encouragement indeed and most from those who had the greatest abhorrence of their actions if violated modesty were never to complain of the injury it received from the villainous attempters of it  in a word the reparation of your family dishonor now rests in your own bosom and which only one of these two alternatives can repair to wit either to marry or to prosecute him at law bitter expedients for a soul so delicate as yours  he and all his friends i understand solicit you to the first and it is certainly now all the amends within his power to make but i am assured that you have rejected their solicitations and his with the indignation and contempt that his foul actions have deserved but yet that you refuse not to extend to him the christian forgiveness he has so little reason to expect provided he will not disturb you further  but madam the prosecution i advise will not let your present and future exemption from fresh disturbance from so vile a molester depend upon his courtesy i should think so noble and so rightlyguided a spirit as yours would not permit that it should if you could help it  and can indignities of any kind be properly pardoned till we have it in our power to punish them to pretend to pardon while we are laboring under the pain or dishonor of them will be thought by some to be but the vaunted mercy of a pusilanimous heart trembling to resent them the remedy i propose is a severe one but what pain can be more severe than the injury or how will injuries be believed to grieve us that are never honorably complained of  i am sure miss clarissa harlowe however injured and oppressed remains unshaken in her sentiments of honor and virtue and although she would sooner die than deserve that her modesty should be drawn into question yet she will think no truth immodest that is to be uttered in the vindicated cause of innocence and chastity little very little difference is there my dear young lady between a suppressed evidence and a false one  it is a terrible circumstance i once more own for a young lady of your delicacy to be under the obligation of telling so shocking a story in public court but it is still a worse imputation that she should pass over so mortal an injury unresented  conscience honor justice and the cares of heaven are on your side and modesty would by some be thought but an empty name should you refuse to obey their dictates  i have been consulted i own on this subject i have given it as my opinion that you ought to prosecute the abandoned man but without my reasons these i reserved with a resolution to lay them before you unknown to any body that the result if what i wish might be your own  i will only add that the misfortunes which have befallen you had they been the lot of a child of my own could not have affected me more than yours have done my own child i love but i both love and honor you since to love you is to love virtue good sense prudence and every thing that is good and noble in woman  wounded as i think all these are by the injuries you have received you will believe that the knowledge of your distresses must have afflicted beyond what i am able to express  your sincere admirer and humble servant arthur lewen i just now understand that your sister will by proper authority propose this prosecution to you i humbly presume that the reason why you resolved not upon this step from the first was that you did not know that it would have the countenance and support of your relations    letter x miss cl harlowe to the rev dr lewen sat aug    reverend and dear sir i thought till i received your affectionate and welcome letter that i had neither father uncle brother left nor hardly a friend among my former favorers of your sex yet knowing you so well and having no reason to upbraid myself with a faulty will i was to blame even although i had doubted the continuance of your good opinion to decline the trial whether i had forfeited it or not and if i had whether i could not honorably reinstate myself in it  but sir it was owing to different causes that i did not partly to shame to think how high in my happier days i stood in your esteem and how much i must be sunk in it since those so much nearer in relation to me gave me up partly to deep distress which makes the humbled heart diffident and made mine afraid to claim the kindred mind in yours which would have supplied to me in some measure all the dear and lost relations i have named  then so loath as i sometimes was to be thought to want to make a party against those whom both duty and inclination bid me reverence so long trailed on between hope and doubt so little mine own mistress at one time so fearful of making or causing mischief at another and not being encouraged to hope by your kind notice that my application to you would be acceptable  apprehending that my relations had engaged your silence at least the stiff visit this good divine was prevailed upon to make her as mentioned vol ii p     of which however she was too generous to remind him might warrant the lady to think that he had rather inclined to their party as the parental side than to hers   these  but why these unavailing retrospections now i was to be unhappy  in order to be happy that is my hope  resigning therefore to that hope i will without any further preamble write a few lines if writing to you i can write but a few in answer to the subject of your kind letter  permit me then to say that i believe your arguments would have been unanswerable in almost every other case of this nature but in that of the unhappy clarissa harlowe  it is certain that creatures who cannot stand the shock of public shame should be doubly careful how they expose themselves to the danger of incurring private guilt which may possibly bring them to it but as to myself suppose there were no objections from the declining way i am in as to my health and supposing i could have prevailed upon myself to appear against this man was there not room to apprehend that the end so much wished for by my friends to wit his condign punishment would not have been obtained when it came to be seen that i had consented to give him a clandestine meeting and in consequence of that had been weakly tricked out of myself and further still had not been able to avoid living under one roof with him for several weeks which i did not only without complaint but without cause of complaint  little advantage in a court perhaps bandied about and jested profligately with would some of those pleas in my favor have been which out of court and to a private and serious audience would have carried the greatest weight against him  such particularly as the infamous methods to which he had recourse  it would no doubt have been a ready retort from every mouth that i ought not to have thrown myself into the power of such a man and that i ought to take for my pains what had befallen me  but had the prosecution been carried on to effect and had he even been sentenced to death can it be thought that his family would not have had interest enough to obtain his pardon for a crime thought too lightly of though one of the greatest that can be committed against a creature valuing her honor above her life  while i had been censured as pursuing with sanguinary views a man who offered me early all the reparation in his power to make  and had he been pardoned would he not then have been at liberty to do as much mischief as ever  i dare say sir such is the assurance of the man upon whom my unhappy destiny threw me and such his inveteracy to my family which would then have appeared to be justified by their known inveteracy to him and by their earnest endeavors to take away his life that he would not have been sorry to have had an opportunity to confront me and my father uncles and brother at the bar of a court of justice on such an occasion in which case would not on his acquittal or pardon resentments have been reciprocally heightened and then would my brother or my cousin morden have been more secure than now  how do these considerations aggravate my fault my motives at first were not indeed blameable but i had forgotten the excellent caution which yet i was not ignorant of that we ought not to do evil that good may come of it  in full conviction of the purity of my heart and of the firmness of my principles why may i not thus called upon say what i am conscious of and yet without faulty pride since all is but a duty and i should be utterly inexcusable could i not justly say what i do in this full conviction he has offered me marriage he has avowed his penitence a sincere penitence i have reason to think it though perhaps not a christian one and his noble relations kinder to the poor sufferer than her own on the same conviction and his own not ungenerous acknowlegements have joined to intercede with me to forgive and accept of him although i cannot comply with the latter part of their intercession have not you sir from the best rules and from the divinest example taught me to forgive injuries  the injury i have received from him is indeed of the highest nature and it was attended with circumstances of unmanly baseness and premeditation yet i bless god it has not tainted my mind it has not hurt my morals no thanks indeed to the wicked man that it has not no vile courses have followed it my will is unviolated the evil respecting myself and not my friends is merely personal no credulity no weakness no want of vigilance have i to reproach myself with i have through grace triumphed over the deepest machinations i have escaped from him i have renounced him the man whom once i could have loved i have been enabled to despise and shall not charity complete my triumph and shall i not enjoy it  and where would be my triumph if he deserved my forgiveness  poor man he has had a loss in losing me i have the pride to think so because i think i know my own heart i have had none in losing him  but i have another plea to make which alone would have been enough as i presume to answer the contents of your very kind and friendly letter  i know my dear and reverend friend the spiritual guide and director of my happier days i know that you will allow of my endeavor to bring myself to this charitable disposition when i tell you how near i think myself to that great and awful moment in which and even in the ardent preparation to which every sense of indignity or injury that concerns not the immortal soul ought to be absorbed in higher and more important contemplations  thus much for myself  and for the satisfaction of my friends and favorers miss how is sollicitous to have all those letters and materials preserved which will set my whole story in a true light the good dr lewen is one of the principal of those friends and favorers  the warning that may be given from those papers to all such young creatures as may have known or heard of me may be more efficacious as i humbly presume to think to the end wished for than my appearance could have been in a court of justice pursuing a doubtful event under the disadvantages i have mentioned and if my dear and good sir you are now on considering every thing of this opinion and i could know it i should consider it as a particular felicity being as sollicitous as ever to be justified in what i may in your eyes  i am sorry sir that your indisposition has reduced you to the necessity of writing upon your pillow but how much am i obliged to that kind and generous concern for me which has impelled you as i may say to write a letter containing so many paternal lines with such inconvenience to yourself  may the almighty bless you dear and reverend sir for all your goodness to me both of now and of long standing continue to esteem me to the last as i do and will venerate you and let me bespeak your prayers the continuance i should say of your prayers for i doubt not that i have always had them and to them perhaps has in part been owing as well as to your pious precepts through my earlier youth that i have been able to make the stand i have made although every thing that you prayed for has not been granted to me by that divine wisdom which knows what is best for its poor creatures  my prayers for you are that it will please god to restore you to your affectionate flock and after as many years of life as shall be for his service and to your own comfort give us a happy meeting in those regions of blessedness which you have taught me as well by example as by precept to aspire to  clarissa harlowe  letter xi miss arab harlowe to miss cl harlowe in answer to hers to her uncle antony of aug     monday aug    sister clary i find by your letters to my uncles that they as well as i are in great disgrace with you for writing our minds to you  we cannot help it sister clary  you dont think it worth your while i find to press for the blessing you pretend to be so earnest about a second time you think no doubt that you have done your duty in asking for it so you will sit down satisfied with that i suppose and leave it to your wounded parents to repent hereafter that they have not done theirs in giving it to you at the first word and in making such enquiries about you as you think ought to have been made fine encouragement to inquire after a runaway daughter living with her fellow as long as he would live with her you repent also with your full mind as you modestly call it that you wrote to me  so we are not likely to be applied to any more i find in this way  well then since this is the case sister clary let me with all humility address myself with a proposal or two to you to which you will be graciously pleased to give an answer  now you must know that we have had hints given us from several quarters that you have been used in such a manner by the villain you ran away with that his life would be answerable for his crime if it were fairly to be proved and by your own hints something like it appears to us  if clary there be any thing but jingle and affecting period in what proceeds from your full mind and your dutiful consciousness and if there be truth in what mrs norton and mrs how have acquainted us with you may yet justify your character to us and to the world in every thing but your scandalous elopement and the law may reach the villain and could we but bring him to the gallows what a meritorious revenge would that be to our whole injured family and to the innocents he has deluded as well as the saving from ruin many others  let me therefore know if you please whether you are willing to appear to do yourself and us and your sex this justice if not sister clary we shall know what to think of you for neither you nor we can suffer more than we have done from the scandal of your fall and if you will mr ackland and counselor derham will both attend you to make proper enquiries and to take minutes of your story to found a process upon if it will bear one with as great a probability of success as we are told it may be prosecuted with  but by what mrs how intimates this is not likely to be complied with for it is what she hinted to you it seems by her lively daughter but without effect vol vi letter xxiv  and then again possibly you may not at present behave so prudently in some certain points as to entitle yourself to public justice which if true the lord have mercy upon you  one word only more as to the above proposal  your admirer dr lewen is clear in his opinion that you should prosecute the villain  but if you will not agree to this i have another proposal to make to you and that in the name of every one in the family which is that you will think of going to pensylvania to reside there for some few years till all is blown over and if it please god to spare you and your unhappy parents till they can be satisfied that you behave like a true and uniform penitent at least till you are oneandtwenty you may then come back to your own estate or have the produce of it sent you thither as you shall choose a period which my papa fixes because it is the custom and because he thinks your grandfather should have fixed it and because let me add you have fully proved by your fine conduct that you were not at years of discretion at eighteen poor doting though good old man  your grandfather he thought  but i would not be too severe  mr hartley has a widowsister at pensylvania with whom he will undertake you may board and who is a sober sensible and wellread woman and if you were once well there it would rid your father and mother of a world of cares and fears and scandal and i think is what you should wish for of all things  mr hartley will engage for all accommodations in your passage suitable to your rank and fortune and he has a concern in a ship which will sail in a month and you may take your secretkeeping hannah with you or whom you will of your newer acquaintance it is presumed it will be of your own sex  these are what i had to communicate to you and if you will oblige me with an answer which the hand that conveys this will call for on wednesday morning it will be very condescending  arabella harlowe  letter xii miss clarissa harlowe to miss arabella harlowe tuesday aug    write to me my hardhearted sister in what manner you please i shall always be thankful to you for your notice but think what you will of me i cannot see mr ackland and the counselor on such a business as you mention  the lord have mercy upon me indeed for none else will  surely i am believed to be a creature past all shame or it could not be thought of sending two gentlemen to me on such an errand  had my mother required of me or would modesty have permitted you to enquire into the particulars of my sad story or had mrs norton been directed to receive them from me methinks it had been more fit and i presume to think more in every ones character too had they been required of me before such heavy judgment had passed upon me as has been passed  i know that this is dr lewens opinion he has been so good as to enforce it in a kind letter to me i have answered his letter and given such reasons as i hope will satisfy him i could wish it were thought worth while to ask to see them this letter was not asked for and the reverend gentlemans death which fell out soon after he had received it was the reason that it was not communicated to the family till it was too late to do the service that might have been hoped for from it   to your other proposal of going to pensylvania this is my answer  if nothing happen within a month which may full as effectually rid my parents and friends of that world of cares and fears and scandals which you mention and if i am then able to be carried on board of ship i will cheerfully obey my father and mother although i were sure to die in the passage and if i may be forgiven for saying so you shall set over me instead of my poor obliging but really unculpable hannah your betty barnes to whom i will be answerable for all my conduct and i will make it worth her while to accompany me  i am equally surprised and concerned at the hints which both you and my uncle antony give of new points of misbehaviour in me  what can be meant by them  i will not tell you miss harlowe how much i am afflicted at your severity and how much i suffer by it and by your hardhearted levity of style because what i shall say may be construed into jingle and period and because i know it is intended very possibly for kind ends to mortify me all i will therefore say is that it does not lose its end if that be it  but nevertheless divesting myself as much as possible of all resentment i will only pray that heaven will give you for your own sake a kinder heart than at present since a kind heart i am convinced is a greater blessing to its possessor than it can be to any other person under this conviction i subscribe myself my dear bella  your everaffectionate sister cl harlowe  letter xiii mrs judith norton to miss cl harlowe in answer to hers of thursday aug    tuesday aug    my dearest young lady the letters you sent me i now return by the hand that brings you this  it is impossible for me to express how much i have been affected by them and your last of the   th indeed my dear miss clary you are very harshly used indeed you are and if you should be taken from us what grief and what punishment are they not treasuring up against themselves in the heavy reflections which their rash censures and unforgiveness will occasion them  but i find what your uncle antonys cruel letter is owing to as well as one you will be still more afflicted by god help you my poor dear child when it comes to your hand written by your sister with proposals to you  it was finished to send you yesterday i know and i apprise you of it that you should fortify your heart against the contents of it  the motives which incline them all to this severity if wellgrounded would authorize any severity they could express and which while they believe them to be so both they and you are to be equally pitied  they are owing to the information of that officious mr brand who has acquainted them from some enemy of yours in the neighborhood about you that visits are made you highly censurable from a man of a free character and an intimate of mr lovelace who is often in private with you sometimes twice or thrice a day  betty gives herself great liberties of speech upon this occasion and all your friends are too ready to believe that things are not as they should be which makes me wish that let the gentlemans views be ever so honorable you could entirely drop acquaintance with him  something of this nature was hinted at by betty to me before but so darkly that i could not tell what to make of it and this made me mention it to you so generally as i did in my last  your cousin morden has been among them he is exceedingly concerned for your misfortunes and as they will not believe mr lovelace would marry you he is determined to go to lord ms in order to inform himself from mr lovelaces own mouth whether he intends to do you that justice or not  he was extremely caressed by every one at his first arrival but i am told there is some little coldness between them and him at present  i was in hopes of getting a sight of this letter of mr brands a rash officious man but it seems mr morden had it given him yesterday to read and he took it away with him  god be your comfort my dear miss but indeed i am exceedingly disturbed at the thoughts of what may still be the issue of all these things i am  my beloved young lady your most affectionate and faithful judith norton  letter xiv mrs norton to miss clarissa harlowe tuesday aug    after i had sealed up the enclosed i had the honor of a private visit from your aunt hervey who has been in a very lowspirited way and kept her chamber for several weeks past and is but just got abroad  she longed she said to see me and to weep with me on the hard fate that had befallen her beloved niece  i will give you a faithful account of what passed between us as i expect that it will upon the whole administer hope and comfort to you  she pitied very much your good mamma who she assured me is obliged to act a part entirely contrary to her inclinations as she herself she owns had been in a great measure  she said that the poor lady was with great difficulty withheld from answering your letter to her which had as was your aunts expression almost broken the heart of every one that she had reason to think that she was neither consenting to your two uncles writing nor approving of what they wrote  she is sure they all love you dearly but have gone so far that they know not how to recede  that but for the abominable league which your brother had got everybody into he refusing to set out for scotland till it was renewed and till they had all promised to take no step toward a reconciliation in his absence but by his consent and to which your sisters resentments kept them up all would before now have happily subsided  that nobody knew the pangs which their inflexible behavior gave them ever since you had begun to write to them in so affecting and humble a style  that however they were not inclined to believe that you were either so ill or so penitent as you really are and still less that mr lovelace is in earnest in his offers of marriage  she is sure she says that all will soon be well and the sooner for mr mordens arrival who is very zealous in your behalf  she wished to heaven that you would accept of mr lovelace wicked as he has been if he were now in earnest  it had always she said been matter of astonishment to her that so weak a pride in her cousin james of making himself the whole family should induce them all to refuse an alliance with such a family as mr lovelaces was  she would have it that your goingoff with mr lovelace was the unhappiest step for your honor and your interest that could have been taken for that although you would have had a severe trial the next day yet it would probably have been the last and your pathetic powers must have drawn you off some friends  hinting at your mamma at your uncle harlowe at your uncle hervey and herself  but here i must observe that the regret that you did not trust to the event of that meeting may not in your present low way too much afflict you that it seems a little too evident from this opinion of your aunts that it was not so absolutely determined that all compulsion was designed to be avoided since your freedom from it must have been owing to the party to be made among them by your persuasive eloquence and dutiful expostulation  she owned that some of them were as much afraid of meeting you as you could be of meeting them  but why so if they designed in the last instance to give you your way  she told me that mrs williams your mammas former housekeeper had been with her to ask her opinion i it would be taken amiss if she desired leave to go up to attend her dearest young lady in her calamity she referred her to your mamma but had heard no more of it  her daughter miss dolly she said had been frequently earnest with her on the same subject and renewed her request with the greatest fervor when your first letter came to hand  your aunt says that being then very ill she wrote to your mother upon it hoping it would not be taken amiss if she permitted miss dolly to go but that your sister as from your mamma answered her that now you seemed to be coming to and to have a due sense of your faults you must be left entirely to their own management  miss dolly she said had pined ever since she had heard of mr lovelaces baseness being doubly mortified by it first on account of your sufferings next because she was one who rejoiced in your getting off and vindicated you for it and had incurred censure and ill will on that account especially from your brother and sister so that she seldom went to harloweplace  make the best use of these intelligences my dearest young lady for your consolation  i will only add that i am with the most fervent prayers for your recovery and restoration  your everfaithful judith norton  letter xv miss cl harlowe to mrs judith norton thursday aug    the relation of such a conversation as passed between my aunt and you would have given me pleasure had it come some time ago because it would have met with a spirit more industrious than mine now is to pick out remote comfort in the hope of a favorable turn that might one day have rewarded my patient duty  i did not doubt my aunts good will to me her affection i did not doubt but shall we wonder that kings and princes meet with so little control in their passions be they ever so violent when in a private family an aunt nay even a mother in that family shall choose to give up a once favored child against their own inclinations rather than oppose an aspiring young man who had armed himself with the authority of a father who when once determined never would be expostulated with  and will you not blame me if i say that good sense that relationly indulgence must be a little offended at the treatment i have met with and if i own that i think that great rigor has been exercised toward me and yet i am now authorized to call it rigor by the judgment of two excellent sisters my mother and my aunt who acknowledge as you tell me from my aunt that they have been obliged to join against me contrary to their inclinations and that even in a point which concerns my eternal welfare  but i must not go on at this rate for may not the inclination my mother has given up be the effect of a too fond indulgence rather than that i merit the indulgence and yet so petulantly perverse am i that i must tear myself from the subject  all then that i will say further to it at this time is that were the intended goodness to be granted to me but a week hence it would possibly be too late  too late i mean to be of the consolation to me that i would wish from it for what an inefficacious preparation must i have been making if it has not by this time carried me above  but above what  poor mistaken creature  unhappy selfdeluder  that finds herself above nothing nor able to subdue her own faulty impatience  but in deed to have done with a subject that i dare not trust myself with if it come in your way let my aunt hervey let my dear cousin dolly let the worthy mrs williams know how exceedingly grateful to me their kind intentions and concern for me are and as the best warrant or justification of their good opinions since i know that their favor for me is founded on the belief that i loved virtue tell them that i continued to love virtue to my last hour as i presume to hope it may be said and assure them that i never made the least wilful deviation however unhappy i became for one faulty step which nevertheless was not owing to unworthy or perverse motives  i am very sorry that my cousin morden has taken a resolution to see mr lovelace  my apprehensions on this intelligence are a great abatement to the pleasure i have in knowing that he still loves me  my sisters letter to me is a most afflicting one  so needlessly so ludicrously taunting  but for that part of it that is so i ought rather to pity her than to be so much concerned at it as i am  i wonder what i have done to mr brand  i pray god to forgive both him and his informants whoever they be but if the scandal arise solely from mr belfords visits a very little time will confute it  mean while the packet i shall send you which i sent to miss how will i hope satisfy you my dear mrs norton as to my reasons for admitting his visits  my sisters taunting letter and the inflexibleness of my dearer friends  but how do remoterbegun subjects tend to the point which lies nearest the heart  as newcaught bodily disorders all crowd to a fractured or distempered part  i will break off with requesting your prayers that i may be blessed with patience and due resignation and with assuring you that i am and will be to the last hour of my life  your equally grateful and affectionate cl harlowe  letter xvi miss how to miss clarissa harlowe in reply to hers of friday aug    yarmouth isle of wight aug    my dearest friend i have read the letters and copies of letters you favored me with and i return them by a particular hand  i am extremely concerned at your indifferent state of health but i approve all your proceedings and precautions in relation to the naming of a man for an office that i hope will not require to be filled up for many many years  i admire and so we do all that greatness of mind which can make you so steadfastly despise through such inducements as no other woman could resist and in such desolate circumstances as you are in the wretch that ought to be so heartily despised and detested  what must the contents of those letters from your relations be which you will not communicate to me fie upon them how my heart rises  but i dare say no more  though you yourself now begin to think they use you with great severity  every body here is so taken with mr hickman and the more from the horror they conceive at the character of such a wretch as lovelace that i have been teazed to death almost to name a day this has given him airs and did i not keep him to it he would behave himself as carelessly and as insolently as if he were sure of me i have been forced to mortify him no less than four times since we have been here  i made him lately undergo a severe penance for some negligences that were not to be passed over not designed ones he said but that was a poor excuse as i told him for had they been designed he should never have come into my presence more that they were not showed his want of thought and attention and those were inexcuseable in a man only in his probatory state  he hoped he had been more than in a probatory state he said  and therefore sir might be more careless  so you add ingratitude to negligence and make what you plead as accident that itself wants an excuse design which deserves none  i would not see him for two days and he was so penitent and so humble that i had like to have lost myself to make him amends for as you have said a resentment carried too high often ends in an amends too humble  i long to be nearer to you but that must not yet be it seems pray my dear let me hear from you as often as you can  may heaven increase your comforts and restore your health are the prayers of  your ever faithful and affectionate anna how p s excuse me that i did not write before it was owing to a little coasting voyage i was obliged to give into    letter xvii miss clarissa harlowe to miss how friday aug    you are very obliging my dear miss how to account to me for your silence i was easy in it as i doubted not that among such near and dear friends as you are with you was diverted from writing by some such agreeable excursion as that you mention  i was in hopes that you had given over at this time of day those very sprightly airs which i have taken the liberty to blame you for as often as you have given me occasion for it and that has been very often  i was always very grave with you upon this subject and while your own and a worthy mans future happiness are in the question i must enter into it whenever you forget yourself although i had not a day to live and indeed i am very ill  i am sure it was not your intention to take your future husband with you to the little island to make him look weak and silly among those of your relations who never before had seen him yet do you think it possible for them however prepared and resolved they may be to like him to forbear smiling at him when they see him suffering under your whimsical penances a modest man should no more be made little in his own eyes than in the eyes of others if he be he will have a diffidence which will give an aukwardness to every thing he says or does and this will be no more to the credit of your choice than to that of the approbation he meets with from your friends or to his own credit  i love an obliging and even an humble deportment in a man to the woman he addresses it is a mark of his politeness and tends to give her that opinion of herself which it may be supposed bashful merit wants to be inspired with but if the lady exacts it with a high hand she shows not either her own politeness or gratitude although i must confess she does her courage i gave you expectation that i would be very serious with you  o my dear that had it been my lot as i was not permitted to live single to have met with a man by whom i could have acted generously and unreservedly  mr lovelace it is now plain in order to have a pretense against me taxed my behavior to him with stifness and distance you at one time thought me guilty of some degree of prudery difficult situations should be allowed for which often make occasions for censure unavoidable i deserved not blame from him who made mine difficult and you my dear if i had had any other man to deal with or had he had but half the merit which mr hickman has should have found that my doctrine on this subject should have governed my practice  but to put myself out of the question  i will tell you what i should think were i an indifferent bystander of these high airs of yours in return for mr hickmans humble demeanor the lady thinks of having the gentleman i see plainly would i say but i see as plainly that she has a very great indifference to him and to what may this indifference be owing to one or all of these considerations no doubt that she receives his addresses rather from motives of convenience than choice that she thinks meanly of his endowments and intellects at least more highly of her own or she has not the generosity to use that power with moderation which his great affection for her puts into her hands  how would you like my dear to have any of these things said  then to give but the shadow of a reason for freelivers and freespeakers to say or to imagine that miss how gives her hand to a man who has no reason to expect any share in her heart i am sure you would not wish that such a thing should be so much as supposed then all the regard from you to come afterward none to be shown before must i should think be capable of being construed as a compliment to the husband made at the expense of the wifes delicacy  there is no fear that attempts could be formed by the most audacious two lovelaces there cannot be upon a character so revered for virtue and so charmingly spirited as miss howes yet to have any man encouraged to despise a husband by the example of one who is most concerned to do him honor what my dear think you o that  it is but too natural for envious men and who that knows miss how will not envy mr hickman to sco at and to jest upon those who are treated with or will bear indignity from a woman if a man so treated have a true and ardent love for the woman he addresses h will be easily overawed by her displeasure and this will put him upon acts of submission which will be called meanness and what woman of true spirit would like to have it said that she would impose any thing upon the man from whom she one day expected protection and defense that should be capable of being construed as a meanness or unmanly abjectness in his behavior even to herself  nay i am not sure and i ask it of you my dear to resolve me whether in your own opinion it is no likely that a woman of spirit will despise rather than val more the man who will take patiently an insult at he hands especially before company  i have always observed that prejudices in disfavour  a person at his first appearance fix deeper and are much more difficult to be removed when fixed than prejudice in favor whether owing to envy or to that malignant principle so eminently visible in little minds which makes them wish to bring down the more worthy characters to their own low level i pretend not to determine when once therefore a woman of your good sense give room to the world to think she has not an high opinion of the lover whom nevertheless she entertains it wi be very difficult for her afterward to make that wor think so well as she would have it of the husband she ha chosen  give me leave to observe that to condescend with dignity and to command with such kindness and sweetness manners as should let the condescension while single b seen and acknowleged are points which a wise woman knowing her man should aim at and a wise woman should think would choose to live single all her life rather than give herself to a man whom she thinks unwothy of a treatment so noble  but when a woman lets her lover see that she has the generosity to approve of and reward a wellmeant service that she has a mind that lifts her above the little captious follies which some too licentiously i hope attribute to the sex in general that she resents not if ever she thinks she has reason to be displeased with petulance or through pride nor thinks it necessary to insist upon little points to come at or secure great ones perhaps not proper to be aimed at nor leaves room to suppose she has so much cause to doubt her own merit as to put the love of the man she intends to favor upon disagreeable or arrogant trials but lets reason be the principal guide of her actions  she will then never fail of that true respect of that sincere veneration which she wishes to meet with and which will make her judgment after marriage consulted sometimes with a preference to a mans own at other times as a delightful confirmation of it  and so much my beloved miss how for this subject now and i dare say for ever  i will begin another letter byandby and send both together  mean time i am etc  in the promised next letter the lady acquaints miss how with mr brands report with her sisters proposals either that she will go abroad or prosecute mr lovelace she complains of the severe letter of her uncle antony and her sister but in milder terms than they deserved  she sends her dr lewens letter and the copy of her answer to it  she tells her of the difficulties she had been under to avoid seeing mr lovelace gives her the contents of the letter she wrote to him is afraid she says that it is a step that is not strictly right if allegory and metaphor be not allowable to one in her circumstances  she informs her of her cousin mordens arrival and readiness to take her part with her relations of his designed interview with mr lovelace and tells her what her apprehensions are upon it  she gives her the purport of the conversation between her aunt hervey and mrs norton and then adds  but were they ever so favorably inclined to me now what can they do for me i wish and that for their sakes more than for my own that they would yet relent  but i am very ill  i must drop my pen  a sudden faintness overspreads my heart  excuse my crooked writing  adieu my dear  adieu  three of clock friday once more i resume my pen i thought i had taken my last farewell of you i never was so very oddly affected something that seemed totally to overwhelm my faculties  i dont know how to describe it  i believe i do amiss in writing so much and taking too much upon me but an active mind though clouded by bodily illness cannot be idle  i will see if the air and a discontinued attention will help me  but if it will not dont be concerned for me my dear  i shall be happy nay i am more so already than of late i thought i could ever be in this life  yet how this body clings  how it incumbers   seven of clock i could not send this letter away with so melancholy an ending as you would have thought it so i deferred closing it till i saw how i should be on my return from my airing and now i must say i am quite another thing so alert  that i could proceed with as much spirit as begun and add more preachment to your lively subject if i had not written more than enough upon it already  i wish you would let me give you and mr hickma joy do my dear  i should take some to myself you would  my respectful compliments to all your friends as well to those i have the honor to know as to those i do not know  i have just now been surprised with a letter from one whom i long ago gave up all thoughts of hearing from from mr wyerley i will enclose it you will be surprised at it as much as i was this seems to be a m whom i might have reclaimed but i could not love him yet i hope i never treated him with arrogance indeed my dear if i am not too partial to myself i think i refused him with more gentleness than you retain somebody else and this recollection gives me less pain than i should have had in the other case on receiving this instance of generosity that affects me i will also enclose the roug draught of my answer as soon as i have transcribed it  if i begin another sheet i shall write to the end of it wherefore i will only add my prayers for your hono and prosperity and for a long long happy life and that when it comes to be wound up you may be as calm and as easy at quitting it as i hope in god i shall be who am and will be to the latest moment  your truly affectionate and obliged servant cl harlowe   letter xviii mr wyerley to miss clarissa harlowe wednesday aug    dearest madam you will be surprised to find renewed at this distance of time an address so positively though so politely discouraged but however it be received i must renew it every body has heard that you have been vilely treated by a man who to treat you ill must be the vilest of men every body knows your just resentment of his base treatment that you are determined never to be reconciled to him and that you persist in these sentiments against all the entreaties of his noble relations against all the prayers and repentance of his ignoble self and all the world that have the honor to know you or have heard of him applaud your resolution as worthy of yourself worthy of your virtue and of that strict honor which was always attributed to you by every one who spoke of you  but madam were all the world to have been of a different opinion it could never have altered mine i ever loved you i ever must love you yet have i endeavored to resign to my hard fate when i had so many ways in vain sought to move you in my favor i sat down seemingly contented i even wrote to you that i would sit down contented and i endeavored to make all my friends and companions think i was but no body knows what pangs this selfdenial cost me in vain did the chase in vain did travel in vain did lively company offer themselves though embraced each in its turn yet with redoubled force did my passion for you bring on my unhappiness when i looked into myself into my own heart for there did your charming image sit inthroned and you engrossed ne all  i truly deplore those misfortunes and those sufferings for your own sake which nevertheless encourage me to renew my bold hope i know not particulars i dare not inquire after them because my sufferings would be increased with the knowledge of what yours have been i therefore desire not to know more than what common report wounds my ears with and what is given me to know by your absence from your cruel family and from the sacred place where i among numbers of your rejected admirers used to be twice a week sure to behold you doing credit to that service of which your example gave me the highest notions but whatever be those misfortunes of whatsoever nature those sufferings i shall bless the occasion for my own sake though for yours curse the author of them if they may give me the happiness to know that this my renewed address may not be absolutely rejected only give me hope that it may one day meet with encouragement if in the interim nothing happen either in my morals or behavior to give you fresh offense give me but hope of this  not absolutely to reject me is all the hope i ask for and i will love you if possible still more than i ever loved you  and that for your sufferings for well you deserve to be loved even to adoration who can for honor and for virtues sake subdue a passion which common spirits i speak by cruel experience find invincible and this at a time when the black offender kneels and supplicates as i am well assured he does all his friends likewise supplicating for him to be forgiven  that you cannot forgive him not forgive him so as to receive him again to favor is no wonder his offense is against virtue that is a part of your essence  what magnanimity is this how just to yourself and to your spotless character is it any merit to admire more than ever so exalted a distinguisher it is not i cannot plead it  what hope have i left may it be said when my address was before rejected now that your sufferings so nobly borne have with all good judges exalted your character yet madam i have to pride myself in this that while your friends not looking upon you in the just light i do persecute and banish you while your fortune and estate is withheld from you and threatened as i know to be withheld as long as the chicaning law or rather the chicaneriers of its practicers can keep it from you while you are destitute of protection every body standing aloof either through fear of the injurer of one family or of the hardhearted of the other i pride myself i say to stand forth and offer my fortune and my life at your devotion with a selfish hope indeed i should be too great an hypocrite not to own this and i know how much you abhor insincerity  but whether you encourage that hope or not accept my best services i beseech you madam and be pleased to excuse me for a piece of hone start which the nature of the case doubting the honor of your notice otherwise makes me choose to conclude with  it is this  if i am to be still the most unhappy of men let your pen by one line tell me so if i am permitted to indulge a hope however distant your silence shall be deemed by me the happiest indication of it that you can give  except that still happier  the happiest that can befall me a signification that you will accept the tender of that life and fortune which it would be my pride and my glory to sacrifice in your service leaving the reward to yourself  be your determination as it may i must for ever admire and love you nor will i ever change my condition while you live whether you change yours or not for having once had the presumption to address you i cannot stoop to think of any other woman and this i solemnly declare in the presence of that god whom i daily pray to bless and protect you be your determination what it will with regard to dearest madam  your most devoted and everaffectionate and faithful servant alexander wyerley  letter xix miss cl harlowe to alex wyerley esquire sat aug    sir the generosity of your purpose would have commanded not only my notice but my thanks although you had not given me the alternative you are pleased to call artful and i do therefore give you my thanks for your kind letter  at the time you distinguished me by your favorable opinion i told you sir that my choice was the single life and most truly did i tell you so  when that was not permitted me and i looked round upon the several gentlemen who had been proposed to me and had reason to believe that there was not one of them against whose morals or principles there lay not some exception it would not have been much to be wondered at if fancy had been allowed to give a preference where judgment was at a loss to determine  far be it from me to say this with a design to upbraid you sir or to reflect upon you i always wished you well you had reason to think i did you had the generosity to be pleased with the frankness of my behavior to you as i had with that of yours to me and i am sorry to be now told that the acquiescence you obliged me with gave you so much pain  had the option i have mentioned been allowed me afterward as i not only wished but proposed things had not happened that did happen but there was a kind of fatality by which our whole family was impelled as i may say and which none of us were permitted to avoid but this is a subject that cannot be dwelt upon  as matters are i have only to wish for your own sake that you will encourage and cultivate those good motions in your mind to which many passages in your kind and generous letter now before me must be owing depend upon it sir that such motions wrought into habit will yield you pleasure at a time when nothing else can and at present shining out in your actions and conversation will commend you to the worthiest of our sex for sir the man who is good upon choice as well as by education has that quality in himself which ennobles the human race and without which the most dignified by birth or rank are ignoble  as to the resolution you so solemnly make not to marry while i live i should be concerned at it were i not morally sure that you may keep it and yet not be detrimented by it since a few a very few days will convince you that i am got above all human dependence  and that there is no need of that protection and favor which you so generously offer to sir  your obliged wellwisher and humble servant cl harlowe  letter xx mr lovelace to j belford esquire monday noon aug    about the time of poor beltons interrment last night as near as we could guess lord m mowbray and myself toasted once to the memory of honest tom belton and by a quick transition to the living health to miss harlowe which lord m obligingly began and to the happy reconciliation and then we stuck in a remembrance to honest jack belford who of late we all agreed was become an useful and humane man preferring his friends service to his own  but what is the meaning i hear nothing from thee mr belford had not yet sent him his lastwritten letter his reason for which see p        and why do thou not let me into the grounds of the sudden reconciliation between my beloved and her friends and the cause of the generous invitation which she gives me of attending her at her fathers some time hence  thou must certainly have been let into the secret by this time and i can tell thee i shall be plaguey jealous if there be any one thing pass between my angel and thee that is to be concealed from me for either i am a principal in this cause or i am nothing i have dispatched will to know the reason of thy neglect  but let me whisper a word or two in thy ear i begin to be afraid after all that this letter was a stratagem to get me out of town and for nothing else for in the frst place tourville in a letter i received this morning tells me that the lady is actually very ill  i am sorry for it with all my soul this thou wilt say i may think a reason why she cannot set out as yet but then i have heard on the other hand but last night that the family is as implacable as ever and my lord and i expect this very afternoon a visit from colonel morden who undertakes it seems to question me as to my intention with regard to his cousin  this convinces me that if she has apprised them of my offers to her they will not believe me to be in earnest till they are assured that i am so from my own mouth and then i understand that the intended visit is an officiousness of mordens own without the desire of any of her friends  now jack what can a man make of all this my intelligence as to the continuance of her familys implacableness is not to be doubted and yet when i read her letter what can one say surely the dear little rogue will not lie  i never knew her dispense with her word but once and that was when she promised to forgive me after the dreadful fire that had like to have happened at our mothers and yet would not see me next day and afterward made her escape to hamstead in order to avoid forgiving me and as she severely smarted for this departure from her honor given for it is a sad thing for good people to break their word when it is in their power to keep it one would not expect that she should set about deceiving again more especially by the premeditation of writing you perhaps will ask what honest man is obliged to keep his promise with a highwayman for well i know your unmannerly way of making comparisons but i say every honest man is  and i will give you an illustration  here is a marauding varlet who demands your money with his pistol at your breast you have neither money nor valuable effects about you and promise solemnly if he will spare your life that you will send him an agreedupon sum by such a day to such a place the question is if your life is not in the fellows power  how he came by the power is another question for which he must answer with his life when caught  so he runs risque for risque  now if he gives you your life does he not give think you a valuable consideration for the money you engage your honor to send him if not the sum must be exorbitant or your life is a very paltry one even in your own opinion  i need not make the application and i am sure that even thou thyself who never sparest me and think thou know my heart by thy own can not possibly put the case in a stronger light against me  then why do good people take upon themselves to censure as they do persons less scrupulous than themselves is it not because the latter allow themselves in any liberty in order to carry a point and can my not doing my duty warrant another for not doing his thou will not say it can  and how would it sound to put the case as strongly once more as my greatest enemy would put it both as to fact and in words here has that profligate wretch lovelace broken his vow with and deceived miss clarissa harlowe  a vile fellow would an enemy say but it is like him but when it comes to be said that the pious miss clarissa harlowe has broken her word with and deceived lovelace good lord would every one say sure it cannot be  upon my soul jack such is the veneration i have for this admirable woman that i am shocked barely at putting the case and so will thou if thou respectest her as thou ought for thou know that men and women all the world over form their opinions of one another by each persons professions and known practices in this lady therefore it would be as unpardonable to tell a wilful untruth as it would be strange if i kept my word  in lovecases i mean for as to the rest i am an honest moral man as all who know me can testify  and what after all would this lady deserve if she has deceived me in this case for did she not set me prancing away upon lord ms best nag to lady sarahs and to lady bettys with an erect and triumphing countenance to show them her letter to me and i have received their congratulations upon it well and now cousin lovelace cries one well and now cousin lovelace cries the other i hope you will make the best of husbands to so excellent and so forgiving a lady and now we shall soon have the pleasure of looking upon you as a reformed man added one and now we shall see you in the way we have so long wihed you to be in exulted the other  my cousins montague also have been ever since rejoicing in the new relationship their charming cousin and their lovely cousin at every word  and how dearly they will love her  what lessons will they take from her  and yet charlotte who pretends to have the eye of an eagle was for finding out some mystery in the style and manner till i overbore her and laughed her out of it  as for lord m he has been in hourly expectation of being sent to with proposals of one sort or other from the harlowes and still will have it that such proposals will be made by colonel morden when he comes and that the harlowes only put on a face of irreconcileableness till they know the issue of mordens visit in order to make the better terms with us  indeed if i had not undoubted reason as i said to believe the continuance of their antipathy to me and implacableness to her i should be apt to think there might be some foundation for my lords conjecture for there is a cursed deal of low cunning in all that family except in the angel of it who has so much generosity of soul that she despises cunning both name and thing  what i mean by all this is to let thee see what a stupid figure i should make to all my own family if my clarissa has been capable as gulliver in his abominable yahoostory phrases it of saying the thing that is not by my soul jack if it were only that i should be outwitted by such a novice at plotting and that it would make me look silly to my kinswomen here who know i value myself upon my contrivances it would vex me to the heart and i would instantly clap a featherbed into a coach and fix and fetch her away sick or well and marry her at my leisure  but col morden is come and i must break off  letter xxi mr belford to robert lovelace esquire monday night aug    i doubt you will be all impatience that you have not heard from me since mine of thursday last you would be still more so if you knew that i had by me a letter readywritten  i went early yesterday morning to epsom and found every thing disposed according to the directions i had left on friday and at night the solemn office was performed tourville was there and behaved very decently and with greater concern than i thought he would ever have expressed for any body  thomasine they told me in a kind of disguise was in an obscure pew out of curiosity for it seems she was far from showing any tokens of grief to see the last office performed for the man whose heart she had so largely contributed to break  i was obliged to stay till this afternoon to settle several necessary matters and to direct inventories to be taken in order for appraisement for every thing is to be turned into money by his will i presented his sister with the  00 guineas the poor man left me as his executor and desired her to continue in the house and take the direction of every thing till i could hear from his nephew at antigua who is heir at law he had left her but  0 l although he knew her indigence and that it was owing to a vile husband and not to herself that she was indigent  the poor man left about  00 l in money and  00 l in two east india bonds and i will contrive if i can to make up the poor womans  0 l and my  00 guineas  00 l to her and then she will have some little matter coming in certain which i will oblige her to keep out of the hands of a son who has completed that ruin which his father had very near effected  i gave tourville his  0 l and will send you and mowbray yours by the first order and so much for poor beltons affairs till i see you  i got to town in the evening and went directly to smiths i found mrs lovick and mrs smith in the backshop and i saw they had been both in tears they rejoiced to see me however and told me that the doctor and mr goddard were but just gone as was also the worthy clergyman who often comes to pray by her and all three were of opinion that she would hardly live to see the entrance of another week i was not so much surprised as grieved for i had feared as much when i left her on saturday  i sent up my compliments and she returned that she would take it for a favor if i would call upon her in the morning by eight oclock mrs lovick told me that she had fainted away on saturday while she was writing as she had done likewise the day before and having received benefit then by a little turn in a chair she was carried abroad again she returned somewhat better and wrote till late yet had a pretty good night and went to covent garden church in the morning but came home so ill that she was obliged to lie down  when she arose seeing how much grieved mrs lovick and mrs smith were for her she made apologies for the trouble she gave them  you were happy said she before i came hither it was a cruel thing in me to come among honest strangers and to be sick and die with you  when they touched upon the irreconcileableness of her friends she said she had ill offices done her to them and they did not know how ill she was nor would they believe any thing she should write but yet she could not but sometimes think it a little hard that she should have so many near and dear friends living and not one to look upon her  no old servant no old friend she said to be permitted to come near her without being sure of incurring displeasure and to have such a great work to go through by herself a young creature as she was and to have every thing to think of as to her temporal matters and to order to her very interrment no dear mother said she to pray by me and bless me  no kind sister to sooth and comfort me  but come said she how do i know but all is for the best  if i can but make a right use of the dispensation  pray for me mrs lovick  pray for me mrs smith that i may  i have great need of your prayers  this cruel man has discomposed me his persecutions have given me a pain just here  putting her hand to her heart what a step has he made me take to avoid him  who can touch pitch and not be defiled he has made a bad spirit take possession of me i think  broken in upon all my duties and will not yet i doubt let me be at rest indeed he is very cruel  but this is one of my trials i believe by gods grace i shall be easier tomorrow and especially if i have no more of his tormentings and if i can can get a tolerable night and i will sit up till eleven that i may  she said that though this was so heavy a day with her she was at other times within these few days past especially blessed with bright hours and particularly that she had nowandthen such joyful assurances which she hoped were not presumptuous ones that god would receive her to his mercy that she could hardly contain herself and was ready to think herself above this earth while she was in it and what inferred she to mrs lovick must be the state itself the very aspirations after which have often cast a beamy light through the thickest darkness and when i have been at the lowest ebb have dispelled the black clouds of despondency  as i hope they soon will this spirit of repining  she had a pretty good night it seems and this morning went in a chair to st dunstans church  the chairmen told mrs smith that after prayers for she did not return till between nine and ten they carried her to a house in fleet street where they never waited on her before and where do think this was  why to an undertakers good god what a woman is this she went into the backshop and talked with the master of it about half an hour and came from him with great serenity he waiting upon her to her chair with a respectful countenance but full of curiosity and seriousness  it is evident that she then went to bespeak her house that she talked of see p      as soon as you can sir were her words to him as she got into the chair mrs smith told me this with the same surprise and grief that i heard it  she was so ill in the afternoon having got cold either at st dunstans or at chapel that she sent for the clergyman to pray by her and the women unknown to her sent both for dr h and mr goddard who were just gone as i told you when i came to pay my respects to her this evening  and thus i have recounted from the good women what passed to this night since my absence  i long for tomorrow that i may see her and yet it is such a melancholy longing as i never experienced and know not how to describe   tuesday aug    i was at smiths at half an hour after seven they told me that the lady was gone in a chair to st dunstans but was better than she had been in either of the two preceding days and said to mrs lovick and mrs smith as she went into the chair i have a good deal to answer for to you my good friends for my vapourish conversation of last night  if mrs lovick said she smiling i have no new matters to discompose me i believe my spirits will hold out purely  she returned immediately after prayers  mr belford said she as she entered the backshop where i was and upon my approaching her i am very glad to see you you have been performing for your poor friend a kind last office it is not long ago since you did the same for a near relation is it not a little hard upon you that these troubles should fall so thick to your lot but they are charitable offices and it is a praise to your humanity that poor dying people know not where to choose so well  i told her i was sorry to hear she had been so ill since i had the honor to attend her but rejoiced to find that now she seemed a good deal better  it will be sometimes better and sometimes worse replied she with poor creatures when they are balancing between life and death but no more of these matters just now i hope sir you will breakfast with me i was quite vapourish yesterday i had a very bad spirit upon me had i not mrs smith but i hope i shall be no more so and today i am perfectly serene this day rises upon me as if it would be a bright one  she desired me to walk up and invited mr smith and his wife and mrs lovick also to breakfast with her i was better pleased with her liveliness than with her looks  the good people retiring after breakfast the following conversation passed between us  pray sir let me ask you said she if you think i may promise myself that i shall be no more molested by your friend  i hesitated for how could i answer for such a man  what shall i do if he comes again  you see how i am  i cannot fly from him now  if he has any pity left for the poor creature whom he has thus reduced let him not come  but have you heard from him lately and will he come  i hope not madam i have not heard from him since thursday last that he went out of town rejoicing in the hopes your letter gave him of a reconciliation between your friends and you and that he might in good time see you at your fathers and he is gone down to give all his friends joy of the news and is in high spirits upon it  alas for me i shall then surely have him come up to persecute me again as soon as he discovers that that was only a stratagem to keep him away he will come up and who knows but even now he is upon the road i thought i was so bad that i should have been out of his and every bodys way before now for i expected not that this contrivance would serve me above two or three days and by this time he must have found out that i am not so happy as to have any hope of a reconciliation with my family and then he will come if it be only in revenge for what he will think a deceit  i believe i looked surprised to hear her confess that her letter was a stratagem only for she said you wonder mr belford i observe that i could be guilty of such an artifice i doubt it is not right but how could i see a man who had so mortally injured me yet pretending sorrow for his crimes and wanting to see me could behave with so much shocking levity as he did to the honest people of the house yet it is strange too that neither you nor he found out my meaning on perusal of my letter you have seen what i wrote no doubt  i have madam and then i began to account for it as an innocent artifice  thus far indeed sir it is innocent that i meant him no hurt and had a right to the effect i hoped for from it and he had none to invade me but have you sir that letter of his in which he gives you as i suppose he does the copy of mine  i have madam and pulled it out of my lettercase but hesitating  nay sir said she be pleased to read my letter to yourself  i desire not to see his  and see if you can be longer a stranger to a meaning so obvious  i read it to myself  indeed madam i can find nothing but that you are going down to harloweplace to be reconciled to your father and other friends and mr lovelace presumed that a letter from your sister which he saw brought when he was at mr smiths gave you the welcome news of it  she then explained all to me and that as i may say in six words  a religious meaning is couched under it and that is the reason that neither you nor i could find it out  read but for my fathers house heaven said she and for the interposition of my dear blessed friend suppose the mediation of my savior which i humbly rely upon and all the rest of the letter will be accounted for  i read it so and stood astonished for a minute at her invention her piety her charity and at thine and my own stupidity to be thus taken in  and now thou vile lovelace what have thou to do the lady all consistent with herself and no hopes left for thee but to hang drown or shoot thyself for an outwitted triumpher  my surprise being a little over she proceeded as to the letter that came from my sister while your friend was here you will soon see sir that it is the cruelest letter she ever wrote me  and then she expressed a deep concern for what might be the consequence of col mordens intended visit to you and besought me that if now or at any time hereafter i had opportunity to prevent any further mischief without detriment or danger to myself i would do it  i assured her of the most particular attention to this and to all her commands and that in a manner so agreeable to her that she invoked a blessing upon me for my goodness as she called it to a desolate creature who suffered under the worst of orphanage those were her words  she then went back to her first subject her uneasiness for fear of your molesting her again and said if you have any influence over him mr belford prevail upon him that he will give me the assurance that the short remainder of my time shall be all my own i have need of it indeed i have why will he wish to interrupt me in my duty has he not punished me enough for my preference of him to all his sex has he not destroyed my same and my fortune and will not his causeless vengeance upon me be complete unless he ruins my soul too  excuse me sir this vehemence but indeed it greatly imports me to know that i shall be no more disturbed by him and yet with all this aversion i would sooner give way to his visit though i were to expire the moment i saw him than to be the cause of any fatal misunderstanding between you and him  i assured her that i would make such a representation of the matter to you and of the state of her health that i would undertake to answer for you that you would not attempt to come near her  and for this reason lovelace do i lay the whole matter before you and desire you will authorize me as soon as this and mine of saturday last come to your hands to dissipate her fears  this gave her a little satisfaction and then she said that had i not told her i could promise for you she was determined ill as she is to remove somewhere out of my knowledge as well as out of yours and yet to have been obliged to leave people i am but just got acquainted with said the poor lady and to have died among perfect strangers would have completed my hardships  this conversation i found as well from the length as the nature of it had fatigued her and seeing her change color once or twice i made that my excuse and took leave of her desiring her permission to attend her in the evening and as often as possible for i could not help telling her that every time i saw her i more and more considered her as a beatified spirit and as one sent from heaven to draw me after her out of the miry gulf in which i had been so long immersed  and laugh at me if thou will but it is true that every time i approach her i cannot but look upon her as one just entering into a companionship with saints and angels this thought so wholly possessed me that i could not help begging as i went away her prayers and her blessing and that with the reverence due to an angel and with an earnestness like that which expecting intimates manifest when they seek to make an interest with a person who is just exalted into a prime degree of power by the favor of his prince  in the evening she was so low and weak that i took my leave of her in less than a quarter of an hour i went directly home where to the pleasure and wonder of my cousin and her family i now pass many honest evenings which they impute to your being out of town  i shall dispatch my packet tomorrow morning early by my own servant to make you amends for the suspense i must have kept you in you will thank me for that i hope but will not i am sure for sending your servant back without a letter  i long for the particulars of the conversation between you and mr morden the lady as i have hinted is full of apprehensions about it send me back this packet when perused for i have not had either time or patience to take a copy of it  and i beseech you enable me to make good my engagements to the poor lady that you will not invade her again   letter xxii mr belford to robert lovelace esquire wednesday aug  0 i have a conversation to give you that passed between this admirable lady and dr h which will furnish a new instance of the calmness and serenity with which she can talk of death and prepare for it as if it were an occurrence as familiar to her as dressing and undressing  as soon as i had dispatched my servant to you with my letters of the   th   th and yesterday the   th i went to pay my duty to her and had the pleasure to find her after a tolerable night pretty lively and cheerful she was but just returned from her usual devotions and doctor h alighted as she entered the door  after enquiring how she did and hearing her complaints of shortness of breath which she attributed to inward decay precipitated by her late harasses as well from her friends as from you he was for advising her to go into the air  what will that do for me said she tell me truly good sir with a cheerful aspect you know you cannot disturb me by it whether now you do not put on the true physician and despairing that any thing in medicine will help me advise me to the air as the last resource  can you think the air will avail in such a malady as mine  he was silent  i ask said she because my friends who will possibly some time hence inquire after the means i used for my recovery may be satisfied that i omitted nothing which so worthy and so skilful a physician prescribed  the air madam may possibly help the difficulty of breathing which has so lately attacked you  but sir you see how weak i am you must see that i have been consuming from day to day and now if i can judge by what i feel in myself putting her hand to her heart i cannot continue long if the air would very probably add to my days though i am far from being desirous to have them lengthened i would go into it and the rather as i know mrs lovick would kindly accompany me but if i were to be at the trouble of removing into new lodgings a trouble which i think now would be too much for me and this only to die in the country i had rather the scene were to be shut up here for here have i meditated the spot and the manner and every thing as well of the minutest as of the highest consequence that can attend the solemn moments so doctor tell me truly may i stay here and be clear of any imputations of curtailing through wilfulness or impatiency or through resentments which i hope i am got above a life that might otherwise be prolonged  tell me sir you are not talking to a coward in this respect indeed you are not  unaffectedly smiling  the doctor turning to me was at a loss what to say lifting up his eyes only in admiration of her  never had any patient said she a more indulgent and more humane physician  but since you are loath to answer my question directly i will put it in other words you dont injoin me to go into the air doctor do you  i do not madam nor do i now visit you as a physician but as a person whose conversation i admire and whose sufferings i condole and to explain myself more directly as to the occasion of this days visit in particular i must tell you madam that understanding how much you suffer by the displeasure of your friends and having no doubt but that if they knew the way you are in they would alter their conduct to you and believing it must cut them to the heart when too late they shall be informed of everything i have resolved to apprise them by letter stranger as i am to their persons how necessary it is for some of them to attend you very speedily for their sakes madam let me press for your approbation of this measure  she paused and at last said this is kind very kind in you sir but i hope that you do not think me so perverse and so obstinate as to have left till now any means unessayed which i thought likely to move my friends in my favor but now doctor said she i should be too much disturbed at their grief if they were any of them to come or to send to me and perhaps if i found they still loved me wish to live and so should quit unwillingly that life which i am now really fond of quitting and hope to quit as becomes a person who has had such a weaningtime as i have been favored with  i hope madam said i we are not so near as you apprehend to that deplorable deprivation you hint at with such an amazing presence of mind and therefore i presume to second the doctors motion if it were only for the sake of your father and mother that they may have the satisfaction if they must lose you to think they were first reconciled to you  it is very kindly very humanely considered said she but if you think me not so very near my last hour let me desire this may be postponed till i see what effect my cousin mordens mediation may have perhaps he may vouchsafe to make me a visit yet after his intended interview with mr lovelace is over of which who knows mr belford but your next letters may give an account i hope it will not be a fatal one to any body  will you promise me doctor to forbear writing for two days only and i will communicate to you any thing that occurs in that time and then you shall take your own way mean time i repeat my thanks for your goodness to me  nay dear doctor hurry not away from me so precipitately for he was going for fear of an offered fee i will no more affront you with tenders that have pained you for some time past and since i must now from this kindly offered favor look upon you only as a friend i will assure you henceforth that i will give you no more uneasiness on that head and now sir i know i shall have the pleasure of seeing you oftener than heretofore  the worthy gentleman was pleased with this assurance telling her that he had always come to see her with great pleasure but parted with her on the account she hinted at with as much pain and that he should not have forborne to double his visits could he have had this kind assurance as early as he wished for it  there are few instances of like disinterestedness i doubt in this tribe till now i always held it for gospel that friendship and physician were incompatible things and little imagined that a man of medicine when he had given over his patient to death would think of any visits but those of ceremony that he might stand well with the family against it came to their turns to go through his turnpike  after the doctor was gone she fell into a very serious discourse of the vanity of life and the wisdom of preparing for death while health and strength remained and before the infirmities of body impaired the faculties of the mind and disabled them from acting with the necessary efficacy and clearness the whole calculated for everyones meridian but particularly as it was easy to observe for thine and mine  she was very curious to know further particulars of the behavior of poor belton in his last moments you must not wonder at my inquiries mr belford said she for who is it that is to undertake a journey into a country they never traveled to before that inquires not into the difficulties of the road and what accommodations are to be expected in the way  i gave her a brief account of the poor mans terrors and unwillingness to die and when i had done thus mr belford said she must it always be with poor souls who have never thought of their long voyage till the moment they are to imbark for it  she made such other observations upon this subject as coming from the mouth of a person who will so soon be a companion for angels i shall never forget and indeed when i went home that i might ingraft them the better on my memory i entered them down in writing but i will not let you see them until you are in a frame more proper to benefit by them than you are likely to be in one while  thus far i had written when the unexpected early return of my servant with your packet yours and he meeting at slough and exchanging letters obliged me to leave off to give its contents a reading  here therefore i close this letter  letter xxiii mr lovelace to john belford esquire tuesday morn aug    now jack will i give thee an account of what passed on occasion of the visit made us by col morden  he came on horseback attended by one servant and lord m received him as a relation of miss harlowes with the highest marks of civility and respect  after some general talk of the times and of the weather and such nonsense as englishmen generally make their introductory topics to conversation the colonel addressed himself to lord m and to me as follows  i need not my lord and mr lovelace as you know the relation i bear to the harlowe family make any apology for entering upon a subject which on account of that relation you must think is the principal reason of the honor i have done myself in this visit  miss harlowe miss clarissa harlowes affair said lord m with his usual forward bluntness that sir is what you mean she is by all accounts the most excellent woman in the world  i am glad to hear that is your lordships opinion of her it is every ones  it is not only my opinion col morden proceeded the prateing peer but it is the opinion of all my family of my sisters of my nieces and of mr lovelace himself  col would to heaven it had been always mr lovelaces opinion of her  lovel you have been out of england colonel a good many years perhaps you are not yet fully apprised of all the particulars of this case  col i have been out of england sir about seven years my cousin clary harlowe was then about twelve years of age but never was there at twenty so discreet so prudent and so excellent a creature all that knew her or saw her admired her mind and person never did i see such promises of perfection in any young lady and i am told nor is it to be wondered at that as she advanced to maturity she more than justified and made good those promises  then as to fortune  what her father what her uncles and what i myself intended to do for her besides what her grandfather had done  there is not a finer fortune in the county  lovel all this colonel and more than this is miss clarissa harlowe and had it not been for the implacableness and violence of her family all resolved to push her upon a match as unworthy of her as hateful to her she had still been happy  col i own mr lovelace the truth of what you observed just now that i am not thoroughly acquainted with all that has passed between you and my cousin but permit me to say that when i first heard that you made your addresses to her i knew but of one objection against you that indeed a very great one and upon a letter sent me i gave her my free opinion upon the subject vol iii p      but had it not been for that i own that in my private mind there could not have been a more suitable match for you are a gallant gentleman graceful in your person easy and genteel in your deportment and in your family fortunes and expectations happy as a man can wish to be then the knowledge i had of you in italy although give me leave to say your conduct there was not wholly unexceptionable convinces me that you are brave and few gentlemen come up to you in wit and vivacity your education has given you great advantages your manners are engaging and you have traveled and i know if you will excuse me you make better observations than you are governed by all these qualifications make it not at all surprising that a young lady should love you and that this love joined to that indiscreet warmth wherewith my cousins friends would have forced her inclinations in favor of men who are far your inferiors in the qualities i have named should throw her upon your protection but then if there were these two strong motives the one to induce the other to impel her let me ask you sir if she were not doubly entitled to generous usage from a man whom she chose for her protector and whom let me take the liberty to say she could so amply reward for the protection he was to afford her  lovel miss clarissa harlowe was entitled sir to the best usage that man could give her i have no scruple to own it i will always do her the justice she so well deserves i know what will be your inference and have only to say that time past cannot be recalled perhaps i wish it could  the colonel then in a very manly strain set forth the wickedness of attempting a woman of virtue and character he said that men had generally too many advantages over the weakness credulity and inexperience of the fair sex who were too apt to be hurried into acts of precipitation by their reading inflaming novels and idle romances that his cousin however he was sure was above the reach of common seduction or to be influenced to the rashness her parents accused her of by weaker motives than their violence and the most solemn promises on my part but nevertheless having those motives and her prudence eminent as it was being rather the effect of constitution than experience a fine advantage however he said to ground an unblameable future life upon she might not be apprehensive of bad designs in a man she loved it was therefore a very heinous thing to abuse the confidence of such a lady  he was going on in this trite manner but interrupting him i said these general observations colonel perhaps suit not this particular case but you yourself are a man of gallantry and possibly were you to be put to the question might not be able to vindicate every action of your life any more than i  col you are welcome sir to put what questions you please to me and i thank god i can both own and be ashamed of my errors  lord m looked at me but as the colonel did not by his manner seem to intend a reflection i had no occasion to take it for one especially as i can as readily own my errors as he or any man can his whether ashamed of them or not  he proceeded as you seem to call upon me mr lovelace i will tell you without boasting of it what has been my general practice till lately that i hope i have reformed it a good deal  i have taken liberties which the laws of morality will by no means justify and once i should have thought myself warranted to cut the throat of any young fellow who should make as free with a sister of mine as i have made with the sisters and daughters of others but then i took care never to promise any thing i intended not to perform a modest ear should as soon have heard downright obscenity from my lips as matrimony if i had not intended it young ladies are generally ready enough to believe we mean honorably if they love us and it would look like a strange affront to their virtue and charms that it should be supposed needful to put the question whether in your address you mean a wife but when once a man makes a promise i think it ought to be performed and a woman is well warranted to appeal to every one against the perfidy of a deceiver and is always sure to have the world of her side  now sir continued he i believe you have so much honor as to own that you could not have made way to so eminent a virtue without promising marriage and that very explicitly and solemnly   i know very well colonel interrupted i all you would say  you will excuse me i am sure that i break in upon you when you find it is to answer the end you drive at  i own to you then that i have acted very unworthily by miss clarissa harlowe and i will tell you further that i heartily repent of my ingratitude and baseness to her nay i will say still further that i am so grossly culpable as to her that even to plead that the abuses and affronts i daily received from her implacable relations were in any manner a provocation to me to act vilely by her would be a mean and low attempt to excuse myself  so low and so mean that it would doubly condemn me and if you can say worse speak it  he looked upon lord m and then upon me two or three times and my lord said my kinsman speaks what he thinks i will answer for him  lovel i do sir and what can i say more and what further in your opinion can be done  col done sir why sir in a haughty tone he spoke i need not tell you that reparation follows repentance and i hope you make no scruple of justifying your sincerity as to the one by the other  i hesitated for i relished not the manner of his speech and his haughty accent as undetermined whether to take proper notice of it or not  col let me put this question to you mr lovelace  is it true as i have heard it is that you would many my cousin if she would have you  what say you sir   this wound me up a peg higher  lovel some questions as they may be put imply commands colonel i would be glad to know how i am to take yours and what is to be the end of your interrogatories  col my questions are not meant by me as commands mr lovelace the end is to prevail upon a gentleman to act like a gentleman and a man of honor  lovel  briskly and by what arguments sir do you propose to prevail upon me  col by what arguments sir prevail upon a gentleman to act like a gentleman  i am surprised at that question from mr lovelace  lovel why so sir  col why so sir  angrily  let me   lovel  interrupting i dont choose colonel to be repeated upon in that accent  lord m come come gentlemen i beg of you to be willing to understand one another you young gentlemen are so warm   col not i my lord  i am neither very young no unduly warm your nephew my lord can make me be every thing he would have me to be  lovel and that shall be whatever you please to be colonel  col  fiercely the choice be yours mr lovelace friend or foe as you do or are willing to do justice to one of the finest women in the world  lord m i guessed from both your characters what would be the case when you met let me interpose gentlemen and beg you but to understand one another you both shoot at one mark and if you are patient will both hit it let me beg of you colonel to give no challenges   col challenges my lord  they are things i ever was readier to accept than to offer but does your lordship think that a man so nearly related as i have the honor to be to the most accomplished woman on earth   lord m  interrupting we all allow the excellencies of the lady  and we shall all take it as the greatest honor to be allied to her that can be conferred upon us  col so you ought my lord  a perfect chamont thought i see otways orphan   lord m so we ought colonel and so we do  and pray let every one do as he ought  and no more than he ought and you colonel let me tell you will not be so hasty  lovel  coolly come come col morden dont let this dispute whatever you intend to make of it go farther than with you and me you deliver yourself in very high terms higher than ever i was talked to in my life ut here beneath this roof twould be inexcusable for me to take that notice of it which perhaps it would become me to take elsewhere  col this is spoken as i wish the man to speak whom should be pleased to call my friend if all his actions ere of a piece and as i would have the man speak whom i would think it worth my while to call my foe love a man of spirit as i love my soul but mr lovece as my lord thinks we aim at one mark let me say at were we permitted to be alone for six minutes i dare  we should soon understand one another perfectly well and he moved to the door  lovel i am entirely of your opinion sir and will attend you  my lord rung and stepped between us colonel return i beseech you said he for he had stepped out of the room while my lord held me  nephew you shall not go out  the bell and my lords raised voice brought in mowbray and clements my lords gentleman the former in his careless way with his hands behind him what is the matter bobby what is the matter my lord  only only only stammerd the agitated peer these young gentlemen are are are  young gentlemen that is all  pray colonel morden who again entered the room with a sedater aspect let this cause have a fair trial i beseech you  col with all my heart my lord  mowbray whispered me what is the cause bobby  shall i take the gentleman to task for thee my boy  not for the world whispered i the colonel is a gentleman and i desire you will not say one word  well well well bobby i have done i can turn thee loose to the best man upon gods earth that is all bobby strutting off to the other end of the room  col i am sorry my lord i should give your lordship the least uneasiness i came not with such a design  lord m indeed colonel i thought you did by your taking fire so quickly i am glad to hear you say you did not how soon a little spark kindles into a flame especially when it meets with such combustible spirits  col if i had had the least thought of proceeding to extremities i am sure mr lovelace would have given me the honor of a meeting where i should have been less an intruder but i came with an amicable intention  to reconcile differences rather than to widen them  lovel well then col morden let us enter upon the subject in your own way i dont know the man i should sooner choose to be upon terms with than one whom miss clarissa harlowe so much respects but i cannot bear to be treated either in word or accent in a menacing way  lord m well well well well gentlemen this is somewhat like angry men make to themselves beds of nettles and when they lie down in them are uneasy with every body but i hope you are friends let me hear you say you are  i am persuaded colonel that you dont know all this unhappy story you dont know how desirous my kinsman is as well as all of us to have this matter end happily you dont know do you colonel that mr lovelace at all our requests is disposed to marry the lady  col at all your requests my lord  i should have hoped that mr lovelace was disposed to do justice for the sake of justice and when at the same time the doing of justice was doing himself the highest honor  mowbray lifted up his before halfclosed eyes to the colonel and glanced them upon me  lovel this is in very high language colonel  mowbr by my soul i thought so  col high language mr lovelace is it not just language  lovel it is colonel and i think the man that does honor to miss clarissa harlowe does me honor but nevertheless there is a manner in speaking that may be liable to exception where the words without that manner can bear none  col your observation in the general is undoubtedly just but if you have the value for my cousin that you say you have you must needs think   lovel you must allow me sir to interrupt you  if have the value i say i have  i hope sir when i say i ave that value there is no room for that if pronounced you pronounced it with an emphasis  col you have broken in upon me twice mr lovelace  am as little accustomed to be broken in upon as you are  be repeated upon  lord m two barrels of gunpowder by my conence what a devil will it signify talking if thus you  to blow one another up at every wry word  lovel no man of honor my lord will be easy to e his veracity called in question though but by impliion  col had you heard me out mr lovelace you would e found that my if was rather an if of inference than doubt but it is really a strange liberty gentlemen of free principles take who at the same time that they would resent unto death the imputation of being capable of telling an untruth to a man will not scruple to break through the most solemn oaths and promises to a woman i must assure you mr lovelace that i always made a conscience of my vows and promises  lovel you did right colonel but let me tell you sir that you know not the man you talk to if you imagine he is not able to rise to a proper resentment when he sees his generous confessions taken for a mark of basespiritedness  col  warmly and with a sneer far be it from me mr lovelace to impute to you the baseness of spirit you speak of for what would that be but to imagine that a man who has done a very flagrant injury is not ready to show his bravery in defending it   mowbr this is damned severe colonel it is by jove i could not take so much at the hands of any man breathing as mr lovelace before this took at yours  col who are you sir what pretense have you to interpose in a cause where there is an acknowleged guilt on one side and the honor of a considerable family wounded in the tenderest part by that guilt on the other  mowbr  whispering to the colonel my dear child you will oblige me highly if you will give me the opportunity of answering your question and was going out  the colonel was held in by my lord and i brought in mowbray  col pray my good lord let me attend this officious gentleman i beseech you do i will wait upon your lordship in three minutes depend upon it  lovel mowbray is this acting like a friend by me to suppose me incapable of answering for myself and shall a man of honor and bravery as i know colonel morden to be rash as perhaps in this visit he has shown himself have it to say that he comes to my lord ms house in a manner naked as to attendants and friends and shall not for that reason be rather borne with than insulted this moment my dear mowbray leave us you have really no concern in this business and if you are my friend i desire you will ask the colonel pardon for interfering in it in the manner you have done  mowbr well well bob thou shall be arbiter in this matter i know i have no business in it  and colonel  holding out his hand i leave you to one who knows how to defend his own cause as well as any man in england  col  taking mowbrays hand at lord ms request you need not tell me that mr mowbray i have no doubt of mr lovelaces ability to defend his own cause were it a cause to be defended and let me tell you mr lovelace that i am astonished to think that a brave man and a generous man as you have appeared to be in two or three instances that you have given in the little knowledge i have of you should be capable of acting as you have done by the most excellent of her sex  lord m well but gentlemen now mr mowbray is gone and you have both shown instances of courage and generosity to boot let me desire you to lay your heads together amicably and think whether there be any thing to be done to make all end happily for the lady  lovel but hold my lord let me say one thing now mowbray is gone and that is that i think a gentleman ought not to put up tamely one or two severe things that the colonel has said  lord m what the devil can thou mean i thought all had been over why thou have nothing to do but to confirm to the colonel that thou art willing to marry miss harlowe if she will have thee  col mr lovelace will not scruple to say that i suppose notwithstanding all that has passed but if you think mr lovelace i have said any thing i should not have said i suppose it is this that the man who has shown so little of the thing honor to a defenseless unprotected woman ought not to stand so nicely upon the empty name of it with a man who is expostulating with him upon it i am sorry to have cause to say this mr lovelace but i would on the same occasion repeat it to a king in all his glory and surrounded by all his guards  lord m but what is all this but more sacks upon the mill more coals upon the fire you have a mind to quarrel both of you i see that are you not willing nephew are you not most willing to marry this lady if she can be prevailed upon to have you  lovel damn me my lord if i would marry an empress upon such treatment as this  lord m why now bob thou art more choleric than the colonel it was his turn just now and now you see he is cool you are all gunpowder  lovel i own the colonel has many advantages over me but perhaps there is one advantage he has not if it were put to the trial  col i came not hither as i said before to seek the occasion but if it be offered me i will not refuse it  and since we find we disturb my good lord m i will take my leave and will go home by the way of st albans  lovel i will see you part of the way with all my heart colonel  col i accept your civility very cheerfully mr lovelace  lord m  interposing again as we were both for going out and what will this do gentlemen suppose you kill one another will the matter be bettered or worsted by that will the lady be made happier or unhappier do you think by either or both of your deaths your characters are too well known to make fresh instances of the courage of either needful and i think if the honor of the lady is your view colonel it can be no other way so effectually promoted as by marriage and sir if you would use your interest with her it is very probable that you may succeed though no body else can  lovel i think my lord i have said all that a man can say since what is passed cannot be recalled and you see col morden rises in proportion to my coolness till it is necessary for me to assert myself or even he would despise me  lord m let me ask you colonel have you any way any method that you think reasonable and honorable to propose to bring about a reconciliation with the lady that is what we all wish for and i can tell you sir it is not a little owing to her family and to their implacable usage of her that her resentments are heightened against my kinsman who however has used her vilely but is willing to repair her wrongs   lovel not my lord for the sake of her family nor for this gentlemans haughty behavior but for her own sake and in full sense of the wrongs i have done her  col as to my haughty behavior as you call it sir i am mistaken if you would not have gone beyond it in the like case of a relation so meritorious and so unworthily injured and sir let me tell you that if your motives are not love honor and justice and if they have the least tincture of mean compassion for her or of an unchearful assent on your part i am sure it will neither be desired or accepted by a person of my cousins merit and sense nor shall i wish that it should  lovel dont think colonel that i am meanly compounding off a debate that i should as willingly go through with you as to eat or drink if i have the occasion given me for it but thus much i will tell you that my lord that lady sarah sadleir lady betty lawrance my two cousins montague and myself have written to her in the most solemn and sincere manner to offer her such terms as no one but herself would refuse and this long enough before col mordens arrival was dreamt of  col what reason sir may i ask does she give against listening to so powerful a mediation and to such offers  lovel it looks like capitulating or else   col it looks not like any such thing to me mr lovelace who have as good an opinion of your spirit as man can have and what pray is the part i act and my motives for it are they not in desiring that justice may be done to my cousin clarissa harlowe that i seek to establish the honor of mrs lovelace if matters can once be brought to bear  lovel were she to honor me with her acceptance of that name mr morden i should not want you or any man to assert the honor of mrs lovelace  col i believe it but till she has honored you with that acceptance she is nearer to me than to you mr lovelace and i speak this only to show you that in the part i take i mean rather to deserve your thanks than your displeasure though against yourself were there occasion nor ought you to take it amiss if you rightly weigh the matter for sir whom does a lady want protection against but her injurers and who has been her greatest injurer  till therefore she becomes entitled to your protection as your wife you yourself cannot refuse me some merit in wishing to have justice done my cousin but sir you was going to say that if it were not to look like capitulating you would hint the reasons my cousin gives against accepting such an honorable mediation  i then told him of my sincere offers of marriage i made no difficulty i said to own my apprehensions that my unhappy behavior to her had greatly affected her but that it was the implacableness of her friends that had thrown her into despair and given her a contempt for life i told him that she had been so good as to send me a letter to divert me from a visit my heart was set upon making her a letter on which i built great hopes because she assured me in it that she was going to her fathers and that i might see her there when she was received if it were not my own fault  col is it possible and were you sir thus earnest and did she send you such a letter  lord m confirmed both and also that in obedience to her desires and that intimation i had come down without the satisfaction i had proposed to myself in seeing her  it is very true colonel said i and i should have told you this before but your heat made me decline it for as i said it had an appearance of meanly capitulating with you an abjectness of heart of which had i been capable i should have despised myself as much as i might have expected you would despise me  lord m proposed to enter into the proof of all this he said in his phraseological way that one story was good till another was heard that the harlowe family and i twas true had behaved like so many orsons to one another and that they had been very free with all our family besides that nevertheless for the ladys sake more than for theirs or even for mine he could tell me he would do greater things for me than they could ask if she could be brought to have me and that this he wanted to declare and would sooner have declared if he could have brought us sooner to patience and a good understanding  the colonel made excuses for his warmth on the score of his affection to his cousin  my regard for her made me readily admit them and so a fresh bottle of burgundy and another of champagne being put upon the table we sat down in good humor after all this blustering in order to enter closer into the particulars of the case which i undertook at both their desires to do  but these things must be the subject of another letter which shall immediately follow this if it do not accompany it  mean time you will observe that a bad cause gives a man great disadvantages for i myself think that the interrogatories put to me with so much spirit by the colonel made me look cursedly mean at the same time that it gave him a superiority which i know not how to allow to the best man in europe so that literally speaking as a good man would infer guilt is its own punisher in that it makes the most lofty spirit look like the miscreant he is  a good man i say so jack proleptically i add thou have no right to make the observation  letter xxiv mr lovelace in continuation tuesday afternoon aug    i went back in this part of our conversation to the day that i was obliged to come down to attend my lord in the dangerous illness which some feared would have been his last  i told the colonel what earnest letters i had written to a particular friend to engage him to prevail upon the lady not to slip a day that had been proposed for the private celebration of our nuptials and of my letters see vol v p       0         written to herself on that subject for i had stepped to my closet and fetched down all the letters and draughts and copies of letters relating to this affair  i read to him several passages in the copies of those letters which thou will remember make not a little to my honor and i told him that i wished i had kept copies of those to my friend on the same occasion by which he would have seen how much in earnest i was in my professions to her although she would not answer one of them and thou may remember that one of those four letters accounted to herself why i was desirous she should remain where i had left her see vol v p       i then proceeded to give him an account of the visit made by lady sarah and lady betty to lord m and me in order to induce me to do her justice of my readiness to comply with their desires and of their high opinion of her merit of the visit made to miss how by my cousins montague in the name of us all to engage her interest with her friend in my behalf of my conversation with miss how at a private assemblee to whom i gave the same assurances and besought her interest with her friend  i then read the copy of the letter though so much to my disadvantage which was written to her by miss charlotte montague aug   see vol vi p     entreating her alliance in the names of all our family  this made him ready to think that his fair cousin carried her resentment against me too far he did not imagine he said that either myself or our family had been so much in earnest  so thou see belford that it is but glossing over one part of a story and omitting another that will make a bad cause a good one at any time what an admirable lawyer should i have made and what a poor hand would this charming creature with all her innocence have made of it in a court of justice against a man who had so much to say and to show for himself  i then hinted at the generous annual tender which lord m and his sisters made to his fair cousin in apprehension that she might suffer by her friends implacableness  and this also the colonel highly applauded and was pleased to lament the unhappy misunderstanding between the two families which had made the harlowes less fond of an alliance with a family of so much honor as this instance showed ours to be  i then told him that having by my friend meaning thee who was admitted into her presence and who had always been an admirer of her virtues and had given me such advice from time to time in relation to her as i wished i had followed been assured that a visit from me would be very disagreeable to her i once more resolved to try what a letter would do and that accordingly on the  th of august i wrote her one  this colonel is the copy of it i was then out of humor with my lord m and the ladies of my family you will therefore read it to yourself see vol vi p       this letter gave him high satisfaction you write here mr lovelace from your heart it is a letter full of penitence and acknowlegement your request is reasonable  to be forgiven only as you shall appear to deserve it after a time of probation which you leave to her to six pray sir did she return an answer to this letter  she did but with reluctance i own and not till i had declared by my friend that if i could not procure one i would go up to town and throw myself at her feet  i wish i might be permitted to see it sir or to hear such parts of it read as you shall think proper  turning over my papers here it is sir see vol vi p      i will make no scruple to put it into your hands  this is very obliging mr lovelace  he read it my charming cousin  how strong her resentments  yet how charitable her wishes good god that such an excellent creature  but mr lovelace it is to your regret as much as to mine i doubt not   interrupting him i swore that it was  so it ought said he nor do i wonder that it should be so i shall tell you byandby proceeded he how much she suffers with her friends by false and villainous reports but sir will you permit me to take with me these two letters i shall make use of them to the advantage of you both  i told him i would oblige him with all my heart and this he took very kindly as he had reason and put them in his pocketbook promising to return them in a few days  i then told him that upon this refusal i took upon myself to go to town in hopes to move her in my favor and that though i went without giving her notice of my intention yet had she got some notion of my coming and so contrived to be out of the way and at last when she found i was fully determined at all events to see her before i went abroad which i shall do said i if i cannot prevail upon her she sent me the letter i have already mentioned to you desiring me to suspend my purposed visit and that for a reason which amazes and confounds me because i dont find there is any thing in it and yet i never knew her once dispense with her word for she always made it a maxim that it was not lawful to do evil that good might come of it and yet in this letter for no reason in the world but to avoid seeing me to gratify a humor only has she sent me out of town depending upon the assurance she had given me  col this is indeed surprising but i cannot believe that my cousin for such an end only or indeed for any end according to the character i hear of her should stoop to make use of such an artifice  lovel this colonel is the thing that astonishes me and yet see here  this is the letter she wrote me  nay sir it is her own hand  col i see it is and a charming hand it is  lovel you observe colonel that all her hopes of reconciliation with her parents are from you you are her dear blessed friend she always talked of you with delight  col would to heaven i had come to england before she left harloweplace nothing of this had then happened not a man of those whom i have heard that her friends proposed for her should have had her nor you mr lovelace unless i had found you to be the man every one who sees you must wish you to be and if you had been that man no one living should i have preferred to you for such an excellence  my lord and i both joined in the wish and faith i wished it most cordially  the colonel read the letter twice over and then returned it to me it is all a mystery said he i can make nothing of it for alas her friends are as averse to a reconciliation as ever  lord m i could not have thought it but dont you think there is something very favorable to my nephew in this letter  something that looks as if the lady would comply at last  col let me die if i know what to make of it this letter is very different from her preceding one  you returned an answer to it mr lovelace  lovel an answer colonel no doubt of it and an answer full of transport i told her i would directly set out for lord ms in obedience to her will i told her that i would consent to any thing she should command in order to promote this happy reconciliation i told her that it should be my hourly study to the end of my life to deserve a goodness so transcendent but i cannot forbear saying that i am not a little shocked and surprised if nothing more be meant by it than to get me into the country without seeing her  col that cannot be the thing depend upon it sir there must be more in it than that for were that all she must think you would soon be undeceived and that you would then most probably resume your intention  unless indeed she depended upon seeing me in the interim as she knew i was arrived but i own i know not what to make of it only that she does me a great deal of honor if it be me that she calls her blessed friend whom she always loved and honored indeed i ever loved her and if i die unmarried and without children shall be as kind to her as her grandfather was and the rather as i fear that there is too much of envy and selflove in the resentments her brother and sister endeavor to keep up in her father and mother against her but i shall know better how to judge of this when my cousin james comes from edinburgh and he is every hour expected  but let me ask you mr lovelace what is the name of your friend who is admitted so easily into my cousins presence is it not belford pray  lovel it is sir a man of honor and a great admirer of your fair cousin  was i right as to the first jack the last i have such strong proof of that it makes me question the first since she would not have been out of the way of my intended visit but for thee  col are you sure sir that mr belford is a man of honor  lovel i can swear for him colonel what makes you put this question  col only this that an officious pragmatical novice has been sent up to inquire into my cousins life and conversation and would you believe it the frequent visits of this gentleman have been interpreted basely to her disreputation  read that letter mr lovelace and you will be shocked at every part of it  this cursed letter no doubt is from the young levite whom thou jack describedst as making inquiry of mrs smith about miss harlowes character and visiters vol vi p       i believe i was a quarter of an hour in reading it for i made it though not a short one six times as long as it is by the additions of oaths and curses to every pedantic line lord m too helped to lengthen it by the like execrations and thou jack wilt have as much reason to curse it as we  you cannot but see said the colonel when i had done reading it that this fellow has been officious in his malevolence for what he says is mere hearsay and that hearsay conjectural scandal without fact or the appearance of fact to support it so that an unprejudiced eye upon the face of the letter would condemn the writer of it as i did and acquit my cousin but yet such is the spirit by which the rest of my relations are governed that they run away with the belief of the worst it insinuates and the dear creature has had shocking letters upon it the pedants hints are taken and a voyage to one of the colonies has been proposed to her as the only way to avoid mr belford and you i have not seen these letters indeed but they took a pride in repeating some of their contents which must have cut the poor soul to the heart and these joined to her former sufferings  what have you not mr lovelace to answer for  lovel who the devil could have expected such consequences as these who could have believed there could be parents so implacable brother and sister so envious and give me leave to say a lady so immoveably fixed against the only means that could be taken to put all right with every body  and what now can be done  lord m i have great hopes that col morden may yet prevail upon his cousin and by her last letter it runs in my mind that she has some thoughts of forgiving all that is past do you think colonel if there should not be such a thing as a reconciliation going forward at present that her letter may not imply that if we could bring such a thing to bear with her friends she would be reconciled to mr lovelace  col such an artifice would better become the italian subtlety than the english simplicity your lordship has been in italy i presume  lovel my lord has read boccacio perhaps and that is as well as to the hint he gives which may be borrowed from one of that authors stories but miss clarissa harlowe is above all artifice she must have some meaning i cannot fathom  col well my lord i can only say that i will make some use of the letters mr lovelace has obliged me with and after i have had some talk with my cousin james who is hourly expected and when i have dispatched two or three affairs that press upon me i will pay my respects to my dear cousin and shall then be able to form a better judgment of things mean time i will write to her for i have sent to inquire about her and find she wants consolation  lovel if you favor me colonel with the damned letter of that fellow brand for a day or two you will oblige me  col i will but remember the man is a parson mr lovelace an innocent one too they say else i had been at him before now and these college novices who think they know every thing in their cloisters and that all learning lies in books make dismal figures when they come into the world among men and women  lord m brand brand it should have been firebrand i think in my conscience  thus ended this doughty conference  i cannot say jack but i am greatly taken with col morden he is brave and generous and knows the world and then his contempt of the parsons is a certain sign that he is one of us  we parted with great civility lord m not a little pleased that we did and as greatly taken with the colonel repeated his wish after the colonel was gone that he had arrived in time to save the lady if that would have done it  i wish so too for by my soul jack i am every day more and more uneasy about her but i hope she is not so ill as i am told she is  i enclose this firebrands letter as my lord calls him i reckon it will rouse all thy phlegm into vengeance  i know not what to advise as to showing it to the lady yet perhaps she will be able to reap more satisfaction than concern from it knowing her own innocence in that it will give her to hope that her friends treatment of her is owing as much to misrepresentation as to their own natural implacableness such a mind as here is i know would be glad to find out the shadow of a reason for the shocking letters the colonel says they have sent her and for their proposal to her of going to some one of the colonies confound them all  but if i begin to curse i shall never have done  then it may put her upon such a defense as she might be glad of an opportunity to make and to shame them for their monstrous credulity  but this i leave to thy own fatheaded prudence  only it vexes me to the heart that even scandal and calumny should dare to surmise the bare possibility of any mans sharing the favors of a lady whom now methinks i could worship with a veneration due only to a divinity  charlotte and her sister could not help weeping at the base aspersion when when said patty lifting up her hands will this sweet ladys sufferings be at an end  oh cousin lovelace   and thus am i blamed for every ones faults  when her brutal father curses her it is i i upbraid her with her severe mother her stupid uncles implacableness is all mine her brothers virulence and her sisters spite and envy are entirely owing to me this rascal brands letter is of my writing  o jack what a wretch is thy lovelace  returned without a letter  this damned fellow will is returned without a letter yet the rascal tells me that he hears you have been writing to me these two days  plague confound thee who must know my impatience and the reason for it  to send a man and horse on purpose as i did my imagination chained to the belly of the beast in order to keep pace with him now he is got to this place now to that now to london now to thee  now a letter given him whip and spur upon the return this town just entered not staying to bait that village passed by leaves the wind behind him in a foaming sweat man and horse  and in this way did he actually enter lord ms courtyard  the reverberating pavement brought me down  the letter will the letter dog  the letter sirrah  no letter sir  then wildly staring round me fists clenched and grinning like a maniac confound thee for a dog and him that sent thee without one  this moment out of my sight or i will scatter thy stupid brains through the air snatching from his holsters a pistol while the rascal threw himself from the foaming beast and run to avoid the fate which i wished with all my soul thou had been within the reach of me to have met with  but to be as meek as a lamb to one who has me at his mercy and can wring and torture my soul as he pleases what can thou mean to send back my varlet without a letter  i will send away by daydawn another fellow upon another beast for what thou have written and i charge thee on thy allegiance that thou dispatch him not back emptyhanded  letter xxv mr brand to john harlowe esquire enclosed in the preceding  worthy sir my very good friend and patron i arrived in town yesterday after a tolerable pleasant journey considering the hot weather and dusty roads i put up at the bull and gate in holborn and hastened to covent garden i soon found the house where the unhappy lady lodges and in the backshop had a good deal of discourse vol vi p     with mrs smith her landlady whom i found to be so highly prepossessed in her favor that i saw it would not answer your desires to take my informations altogether from her and being obliged to attend my patron who to my sorrow miserum est aliena vivere quadra i find wants much waiting upon and is another sort of man than he was at college for sir  inter nos honors change manners for the aforesaid causes i thought it would best answer all the ends of the commission you honored me with to engage in the desired scrutiny the wife of a particular friend who lives almost over against the house where she lodges and who is a gentlewoman of character and sobriety a mother of children and one who knows the world well  to her i applied myself therefore and gave her a short history of the case and desired she would very particularly enquire into the conduct of the unhappy young lady her present way of life and subsistence her visiters her employments and suchlike for these sir you know are the things whereof you wished to be informed  accordingly sir i waited upon the gentlewoman aforesaid this day and to my very great trouble because i know it will be to yours and likewise to all your worthy familys i must say that i do find things look a little more darkly than i hoped they would for alas sir the gentlewomans report turns not out so favorable for misss reputation as i wished as you wished and as every one of her friends wished but so it is throughout the world that one false step generally brings on another and peradventure a worse and a still worse till the poor limed soul a very fit epithet of the divine quarless is quite entangled and without infinite mercy lost for ever  it seems sir she is notwithstanding in a very ill state of health in this both gentlewomen that is to say mrs smith her landlady and my friends wife agree yet she goes often out in a chair to prayers as it is said but my friends wife tells me that nothing is more common in london than that the frequenting of the church at morning prayers is made the pretense and cover for private assignations what a sad thing is this that what was designed for wholesome nourishment to the poor soul should be turned into rank poison but as mr daniel de foe an ingenious man though a dissenter observes but indeed it is an old proverb only i think he was the first that put it into verse god never had a house of prayer but satan had a chapel there   yet to do the lady justice nobody comes home with her nor indeed can they because she goes forward and backward in a sedan or chair as they call it but then there is a gentleman of no good character an intimado of mr lovelaces who is a constant visiter of her and of the people of the house whom he regales and treats and has of consequence their high good words  i have hereupon taken the trouble for i love to be exact in any commission i undertake to inquire particularly about this gentleman as he is called albeit i hold no man so but by his actions for as juvenal says  nobilitas sola est atque unica virtus and this i did before i would sit down to write to you  his name is belford he has a paternal estate of upwards of  000 pounds by the year and is now in mourning for an uncle who left him very considerably besides he bears a very profligate character as to women for i enquired particularly about that and is mr lovelaces more especial privado with whom he holds a regular correspondence and has been often seen with miss tete a tete at the window in no bad way indeed but my friends wife is of opinion that all is not as it should be and indeed it is mighty strange to me if miss be so notable a penitent as is represented and if she have such an aversion to mr lovelace that she will admit his privado into her retirements and see no other company  i understand from mrs smith that mr hickman was to see her some time ago from miss how and i am told by another hand you see sir how diligent i have been to execute the commissions you had given me that he had no extraordinary opinion of this belford at first though they were seen together one morning by the opposite neighbor at breakfast with miss and another time this belford was observed to watch mr hickmans coming from her so that as it should seem he was mighty zealous to ingratiate himself with mr hickman no doubt to engage him to make a favorable report to miss how of the intimacy he was admitted into by her unhappy friend who  as she is very ill may mean no harm in allowing his visits for he it seems brought to her or recommended at least the doctor and apothecary that attend her but i think upon the whole it looks not well  i am sorry sir i cannot give you a better account of the young ladys prudence but what shall we say uvaque conspecta livorem ducit ab uva as juvenal observes  one thing i am afraid of which is that miss may be under necessities and that this belford who as mrs smith owns has offered her money which she at the time refused may find an opportunity to take advantage of those necessities and it is well observed by the poet that aegre formosam poteris servare puellam nunc proce nunc auro forma petita ruit   and this belford who is a bold man and has as they say the look of one may make good that of horace with whose writings you are so well acquainted nobody better audax omnia perpeti gens humana ruit per vetitum nefas   forgive me sir for what i am going to write but if you could prevail upon the rest of your family to join in the scheme which you and her virtuous sister miss arabella and the archdeacon and i once talked of which is to persuade the unhappy young lady to go in some creditable manner to some one of the foreign colonies it might save not only her own credit and reputation but the reputation and credit of all her family and a great deal of vexation moreover for it is my humble opinion that you will hardly any of you enjoy yourselves while this  once innocent young lady is in the way of being so frequently heard of by you and this would put her out of the way both of this belford and of that lovelace and it might peradventure prevent as much evil as scandal  you will forgive me sir for this my plainness ovid pleads for me  adulator nullus amicus erit  and i have no view but that of approving myself a zealous wellwisher to all your worthy family whereto i owe a great number of obligations and very particularly sir  your obliged and humble servant elias brand wedn aug   p s i shall give you further hints when i come down which will be in a few days and who my informants were but by these you will see that i have been very assiduous for the time in the task you set me upon  the length of my letter you will excuse for i need not tell you sir what narrative complex and conversation letters such a one as mine require every one to his talent letterwriting is mine i will be bold to say and that my correspondence was much coveted at the university on that account but this i should not have taken upon me to mention only in defense of the length of my letter for nobody writes shorter or pithier when the subject is upon common forms only  but in apologizing for my prolixity i am adding to the fault if it were one which however i cannot think it to be the subject considered but this i have said before in other words so sir if you will excuse my postcript i am sure you will not find fault with my letter  i think i have nothing to add until i have the honor of attending you in person but that i am as above etc etc etc  e b    letter xxvi mr belford to robert lovelace esquire wednesday night aug  0 it was lucky enough that our two servants met at hannahs the windmill near slough  which gave them so good an opportunity of exchanging their letters time enough for each to return to his master early in the day  thou do well to brag of thy capacity for managing servants and to set up for correcting our poets in their characters of this class of people see letter v of this vol p     when like a mad man thou can beat their teeth out and attempt to shoot them through the head for not bringing to thee what they had no power to obtain  you well observe see p  0  that you would have made a thoroughpacd lawyer the whole of the conversationpiece between you and the colonel affords a convincing proof that there is a black and a white side to every cause but what must the conscience of a partial whitener of his own cause or blackener of anothers tell him while he is throwing dust in the eyes of his judges and all the time knows his own guilt  the colonel i see is far from being a faultless man but while he sought not to carry his point by breach of faith he has an excuse which thou have not but withrespect to him and to us all i can now with detestation of some of my own actions see that the taking advantage of another persons good opinion of us to injure perhaps to ruin that other is the most ungenerous wickedness that can be committed  man acting thus by man we should not be at a loss to give such actions a name but is it not doubly and trebly aggravated when such advantage is taken of an inexperienced and innocent young creature whom we pretend to love above all the women in the world and when we seal our pretenses by the most solemn vows and protestations of inviolable honor that we can invent  i see that this gentleman is the best match thou ever could have had upon all accounts his spirit such another impetuous one as thy own soon taking fire vindictive and only differing in this that the cause he ingages in is a just one but commend me to honest brutal mowbray who before he knew the cause offers his sword in thy behalf against a man who had taken the injured side and whom he had never seen before  as soon as i had run through your letters and that incendiary brands by the latter of which i saw to what cause a great deal of this last implacableness of the harlowe family is owing i took coach to smiths although i had been come from thence but about an hour and had taken leave of the lady for the night  i sent down for mrs lovick and desired her in the first place to acquaint the lady who was busied in her closet that i had letters from berks in which i was informed that the interview between col morden and mr lovelace had ended without ill consequences that the colonel intended to write to her very soon and was interesting himself mean while in her favor with her relations that i hoped that this agreeable news would be a means of giving her good rest and i would wait upon her in the morning by the time she should return from prayers with all the particulars  she sent me word that she should be glad to see me in the morning and was highly obliged to me for the good news i had sent her up  i then in the backshop read to mrs lovick and to mrs smith brands letter and asked them if they could guess at the mans informant they were not at a loss mrs smith having seen the same fellow brand who had talked with her as i mentioned in a former vol vi p      come out of a milliners shop over against them which milliner she said had also been lately very inquisitive about the lady  i wanted no further hint but bidding them take no notice to the lady of what i had read i shot over the way and asking for the mistress of the house she came to me  retiring with her at her invitation into her parlour i desired to know if she was acquainted with a young country clergyman of the name of brand she hesitatingly seeing me in some emotion owned that she had some small knowledge of the gentleman just then came in her husband who is it seems a petty officer in the excise and not an illbehaved man who owned a fuller knowledge of him  i have the copy of a letter said i from this brand in which he has taken great liberties with my character and with that of the most unblameable lady in the world which he grounds upon informations that you madam have given him and then i read to them several passages in his letter and asked what foundation she had for giving that fellow such impressions of either of us  they knew not what to answer but at last said that he had told them how wickedly the young lady had run away from her parents what worthy and rich people they were in what favor he stood with them and that they had employed him to inquire after her behavior visiters etc  they said that indeed they knew very little of the young lady but that curse upon their censoriousness it was but too natural to think that where a lady had given way to a delusion and taken so wrong a step she would not stop there that the most sacred places and things were but too often made a cloak for bad actions that mr brand had been informed perhaps by some enemy of mine that i was a man of very free principles and an intimado as he calls it of the man who had ruined her and that their cousin barker a mantuamaker who lodged up one pair of stairs had often from her window seen me with the lady in her chamber talking very earnestly together and that mr brand being unable to account for her admitting my visits and knowing i was but a new acquaintance of hers and an old one of mr lovelaces thought himself obliged to lay these matters before her friends  this was the sum and substance of their tale o how i cursed the censoriousness of this plaguey triumvirate a parson a milliner and a mantuamaker the two latter not more by business led to adorn the person than generally by scandal to destroy the reputations of those they have a mind to exercise their talents upon  the two women took great pains to persuade me that they were people of conscience  of consequence i told them too much addicted i doubted to censure other people who pretended not to their strictness for that i had ever found censoriousness narrowness and uncharitableness to prevail too much with those who affected to be thought more pious than their neighbors  that was not them they said and that they had since inquired into the ladys character and manner of life and were very much concerned to think any thing they had said should be made use of against her and as they heard from mrs smith that she was not likely to live long they should be sorry she should go out of the world a sufferer by their means or with an ill opinion of them though strangers to her the husband offered to write if i pleased to mr brand in vindication of the lady and the two women said they should be glad to wait upon her in person to beg her pardon for any thing she had reason to take amiss from them because they were now convinced that there was not such another young lady in the world  i told them that the least said of the affair to the lady in her present circumstances was best that she was fond of taking all occasions to find excuses for her relations on their implacableness to her that therefore i should take some notice to her of the uncharitable and weak surmizes which gave birth to so vile a scandal but that i would have him mr walton for that is the husbands name write to his acquaintance brand as soon as possible as he had offered  and so i left them  letter xxvii mr belford to robert lovelace esquire thursday    oclock aug    i am just come from the lady whom i left cheerful and serene  she thanked me for my communication of the preceding night i read to her such parts of your letters as i could read to her and i thought it was a good test to distinguish the froth and whiptsyllabub in them from the cream in what one could and could not read to a woman of so fine a mind since four parts out of six of thy letters which i thought entertaining as i read them to myself appeared to me when i would have read them to her most abominable stuff and gave me a very contemptible idea of thy talents and of my own judgment  she was far from rejoicing as i had done at the disappointment her letter gave you when explained  she said she meant only an innocent allegory that might carry instruction and warning to you when the meaning was taken as well as answer her own hopes for the time it was run off in a hurry she was afraid it was not quite ight in her but hoped the end would excuse if it could not justify the means and then she again expressed a good deal of apprehension lest you should still take it into your head to molest her when her time she says is so hort that she wants every moment of it repeating what he had once said before that when she wrote she was o ill that she believed she should not have lived till now if she had thought she should she must have thought of an expedient that would have better answered her intentions hinting at a removal out of the knowledge of us both  but she was much pleased that the conference between you and colonel morden ended so amicably after two or three such violent sallies as i acquainted her you had had between you and said she must absolutely depend upon the promise i had given her to use my utmost endeavors to prevent further mischief on her account  she was pleased with the justice you did her character to her cousin  she was glad to hear that he had so kind an opinion of her and that he would write to her  i was under an unnecessary concern how to break to her that i had the copy of brands vile letter unnecessary i say for she took it just as you thought she would as an excuse she wished to have for the implacableness of her friends and begged i would let her read it herself for said she the contents cannot disturb me be they what they will  i gave it her and she read it to herself a tear nowandthen ready to start and a sigh sometimes interposing  she gave me back the letter with great and surprising calmness considering the subject  there was a time said she and that not long since when such a letter as this would have greatly pained me but i hope i have now got above all these things for i can refer to your kind offices and miss howes the justice that will be done to my memory among my friends there is a good and a bad light in which every thing that befalls us may be taken if the human mind will busy itself to make the worst of every disagreeable occurrence it will never want woe this letter affecting as the subject of it is to my reputation gives me more pleasure than pain because i can gather from it that had not my friends been prepossessed by misinformed or rash and officious persons who are always at hand to flatter or sooth the passions of the affluent they could not have been so immoveably determined against me but now they are sufficiently cleared from every imputation of unforgiveness for while i appeared to them in the character of a vile hypocrite pretending to true penitence yet giving up myself to profligate courses how could i expect either their pardon or blessing  but madam said i you will see by the date of this letter august   that their severity previous to that cannot be excused by it  it imports me much replied she on account of my present wishes as to the office you are so kind to undertake that you should not think harshly of my friends i must own to you that i have been apt sometimes myself to think them not only severe but cruel suffering minds will be partial to their own cause and merits knowing their own hearts if sincere they are apt to murmur when harshly treated but if they are not believed to be innocent by persons who have a right to decide upon their conduct according to their own judgments how can it be helped besides sir how do you know that there are not about my friends as wellmeaning misrepresenters as mr brand really seems to be but be this as it will there is no doubt that there are and have been multitudes of persons as innocent as myself who have suffered upon surmises as little probable as those on which mr brand founds his judgment your intimacy sir with mr lovelace and may i say a character which it seems you have been less sollicitous formerly about justifying than perhaps you will be for the future and your frequent visits to me may well be thought to be questionable circumstances in my conduct  i could only admire her in silence  but you see sir proceeded she how necessary it is for young people of our sex to be careful of our company and how much at the same time it behooves young gentlemen to be chary of their own reputation were it only for the sake of such of ours as they may mean honorably by and who otherwise may suffer in their good names for being seen in their company  as to mr brand continued she he is to be pitied and let me injoin you mr belford not to take up any resentments against him which may be detrimental either to his person or his fortunes let his function and his good meaning plead for him he will have concern enough when he finds every body whose displeasure i now labor under acquitting my memory of perverse guilt and joining in a general pity for me  this lovelace is the lady whose life thou have curtailed in the blossom of it  how many opportunities must thou have had of admiring her inestimable worth yet could have thy senses so much absorbed in the woman in her charming person as to be blind to the angel that shines out in such full glory in her mind indeed i have ever thought myself when blessed with her conversation in the company of a real angel and i am sure it would be impossible for me were she to be as beautiful and as crimsoned over with health as i have seen her to have the least thought of sex when i heard her talk   thursday three oclock aug    on my revisit to the lady i found her almost as much a sufferer from joy as she had sometimes been from grief for she had just received a very kind letter from her cousin morden which she was so good as to communicate to me as she had already begun to answer it i begged leave to attend her in the evening that i might not interrupt her in it  the letter is a very tender one      here mr belford gives the substance of it upon his memory see the next letter and then adds    but alas all will be now too late for the decree is certainly gone out the world is unworthy of her   letter xxviii colonel morden to miss cl harlowe tuesday aug    my dear cousin permit me to condole those misfortunes which have occasioned so unhappy a difference between you and the rest of your family and to offer my assistance to enable you to make the best of what has happened  you have fallen into most unworthy hands the letter i wrote to you from florence see vol iii p     i find came too late to have its hopedfor effect i am very sorry it did as i am that i did not come sooner to england in person  but forgetting past things let us look forward i have been with mr lovelace and lord m i need not tell you it seems how desirous all the family are of the honor of an alliance with you nor how exceedingly earnest the former is to make you all the reparation in his power  i think my dear cousin that you cannot now do better than to give him the honor of your hand he says such just and great things of your virtue and so heartily condemns himself that i think there is great and honorable room for your forgiving him and the more as it seems you are determined against a legal prosecution  your effectual forgiveness of him it is evident to me will accelerate a general reconciliation for at present my other cousins cannot persuade themselves that he is in earnest to do you justice or that you would refuse him if you believed he was  but my dear cousin there may possibly be something in this affair to which i may be a stranger if there be and you will acquaint me with it all that a naturally warm heart can do in your behalf shall be done  nothing but my endeavor to serve you here has hitherto prevented me from assuring you of this by word of mouth for i long to see you after so many years absence i hope i shall be able in my next visits to my several cousins to set all right proud spirits when convinced that they have carried resentments too high want but a good excuse to condescend and parents must always love the child they once loved  mean while i beg the favor of a few lines to know if you have reason to doubt mr lovelaces sincerity for my part i can have none if i am to judge from the conversation that passed yesterday between him and me in presence of lord m  you will be pleased to direct for me at your uncle antonys  permit me my dearest cousin till i can procure a happy reconciliation between you and your father and brother and uncles to supply the place to you of all those near relations as well as that of  your affectionate kinsman and humble servant wm morden  letter xxix miss cl harlowe to wm morden esquire thursday aug    i most heartily congratulate you dear sir on your return to your native country  i heard with much pleasure that you were come but i was both afraid and ashamed till you encouraged me by a first notice to address myself to you  how consoling is it to my wounded heart to find that you have not been carried away by that tide of resentment and displeasure with which i have been so unhappily overwhelmed  but that while my still nearer relations have not thought fit to examine into the truth of vile reports raised against me you have informed yourself and generously credited the information that my error was owing more to my misfortune than my fault  i have not the least reason to doubt mr lovelaces sincerity in his offers of marriage nor that all his relations are heartily desirous of ranking me among them i have had noble instances of their esteem for me on their apprehending that my fathers displeasure must have subjected me to difficulties and this after i had absolutely refused their pressing solicitations in their kinsmans favor as well as his own  nor think me my dear cousin blameable for refusing him i had given mr lovelace no reason to think me a weak creature if i had a man of his character might have thought himself warranted to endeavor to make ungenerous advantage of the weakness he had been able to inspire the consciousness of my own weakness in that case might have brought me to a composition with his wickedness  i can indeed forgive him but that is because i think his crimes have set me above him can i be above the man sir to whom i shall give my hand and my vows and with them a sanction to the most premeditated baseness no sir let me say that your cousin clarissa were she likely to live many years and that if she married not this man in penury and want despised and forsaken by all her friends puts not so high a value upon the conveniences of life nor upon life itself as to seek to reobtain the one or to preserve the other by giving such a sanction a sanction which  were she to perform her duty would reward the violater  nor is it so much from pride as from principle that i say this what sir when virtue when chastity is the crown of a woman and particularly of a wife shall your cousin stoop to marry the man who could not form an attempt upon hers but upon a presumption that she was capable of receiving his offered hand when he had found himself mistaken in the vile opinion he had conceived of her hitherto he has not had reason to think me weak nor will i give him an instance so flagrant that weak i am in a point in which it would be criminal to be found weak  one day sir you will perhaps know all my story but whenever it is known i beg that the author of my calamities may not be vindictively sought after he could not have been the author of them but for a strange concurrence of unhappy causes as the law will not be able to reach him when i am gone any other sort of vengeance terrifies me but to think of it for in such a case should my friends be safe what honor would his death bring to my memory if any of them should come to misfortune how would my fault be aggravated  god long preserve you my dearest cousin and bless you but in proportion to the consolation you have given me in letting me know that you still love me and that i have one near and dear relation who can pity and forgive me and then will you be greatly blessed is the prayer of  your evergrateful and affectionate clarissa harlowe  letter xxx mr lovelace to john belford esquire in answer to bis letters of august         thursday aug    i cannot but own that i am cut to the heart by this miss harlowes interpretation of her letter she ought never to be forgiven she a meek person and a penitent and innocent and pious and i know not what who can deceive with a foot in the grave   it is evident that she sat down to write this letter with a design to mislead and deceive and if she be capable of that at such a crisis she has as much need of gods forgiveness as i have of hers and with all her cant of charity and charity if she be not more sure of it than i am of her real pardon and if she take the thing in the light she ought to take it in she will have a few darker moments yet to come than she seems to expect  lord m himself who is not one of those to speak in his own phrase who can penetrate a millstone sees the deceit and thinks it unworthy of her though my cousins montague vindicate her and no wonder this cursed partial sex i hate em all  by my soul i hate em all will never allow anything against an individual of it where ours is concerned and why because if they censure deceit in another they must condemn their own hearts  she is to send me a letter after she is in heaven is she the devil take such allegories and the devil take thee for calling this absurdity an innocent artifice  i insist upon it that if a woman of her character at such a critical time is to be justified in such a deception a man in full health and vigor of body and mind as i am may be excused for all his stratagems and attempts against her and thank my stars i can now sit me down with a quiet conscience on that score by my soul i can jack nor has anybody who can acquit her a right to blame me but with some indeed everything she does must be good everything i do must be bad  and why because she has always taken care to coax the stupid misjudging world like a woman while i have constantly defied and despised its censures like a man  but notwithstanding all you may let her know from me that i will not molest her since my visits would be so shocking to her and i hope she will take this into her consideration as a piece of generosity that she could harly expect after the deception she has put upon me and let her further know that if there be anything in my power that will contribute either to her ease or honor i will obey her at the very first intimation however disgraceful or detrimental to myself all this to make her unapprehensive and that she may have nothing to pull her back  if her cursed relations could be brought as cheerfully to perform their parts i would answer life for life for her recovery  but who that has so many ludicrous images raised in his mind by thy awkward penitence can forbear laughing at thee spare i beseech thee dear belford for the future all thy own aspirations if thou would not dishonor those of an angel indeed  when i came to that passage where thou say that thou considerest her see p    as one sent from heaven to draw thee after her  for the heart of me i could not for an hour put thee out of my head in the attitude of dame elizabeth carteret on her monument in westminsterabbey if thou never observedst it go thither on purpose and there will thou see this dame in effigy with uplifted head and hand the latter taken hold of by a cupid every inch of stone one clumsy foot lifted up also aiming as the sculptor designed it to ascend but so executed as would rather make one imagine that the figure without shoe or stocken as it is though the rest of the body is robed was looking up to its corncutter the other riveted to its native earth bemired like thee  immersed thou call it beyond the possibility of unsticking itself both figures thou will find seem to be in a contention the bigger whether it should pull down the lesser about its ears  the lesser a chubby fat little varlet of a fourth part of the others bigness with wings not much larger than those of a butterfly whether it should raise the larger to a heaven it points to hardly big enough to contain the great toes of either  thou will say perhaps that the dames figure in stone may do credit in the comparison to thine both in grain and shape wooden as thou art all over but that the lady who in everything but in the trick she has played me so lately is truly an angel is but sorrily represented by the fat flanked cupid this i allow thee but yet there is enough in thy aspirations to strike my mind with a resemblance of thee and the lady to the figures on the wretched monument for thou ought to remember that prepared as she may be to mount to her native skies it is impossible for her to draw after her a heavy fellow who has so much to repent of and amend  but now to be serious once more let me tell you belford that if the lady be really so ill as you write she is it will become you  no roman style here in a case so very affecting to be a little less pointed and sarcastic in your reflections for upon my soul the matter begins to grate me most confoundedly  i am now so impatient to hear oftener of her that i take the hint accidentally given me by our two fellows meeting at slough and resolve to go to our friend dolemans at uxbridge whose wife and sister as well as he have so frequently pressed me to give them my company for a week or two there shall i be within two hours ride if anything should happen to induce her to see me for it will well become her piety and avowed charity should the worst happen the lord of heaven and earth however avert that worst to give me that pardon from her lips which she has not denied me by pen and ink and as she wishes my reformation she knows not what good effects such an interview may have upon me  i shall accordingly be at dolemans to morrow morning by eleven at furthest my fellow will find me there at his return from you with a letter i hope i shall have joel with me likewise that i may send the oftener as matters fall out were i to be still nearer or in town it would be impossible to withold myself from seeing her  but if the worst happen  as by your continual knelling i know not what to think of it  yet once more heaven avert that worst  how natural is it to pray when one cannot help ones self  then say not in so many dreadful words what the event is  only that you advise me to take a trip to paris and that will stab me to the heart  i so well approve of your generosity to poor beltons sister that i have made mowbray give up his legacy as i do mine toward her india bonds when i come to town tourville shall do the like and we will buy each a ring to wear in memory of the honest fellow with our own money that we may perform his will as well as our own  my fellow rides the rest of the night i charge you jack if you would save his life that you send him not back emptyhanded  letter xxxi mr belford to robert lovelace esquire thursday night aug    when i concluded my last i hoped that my next attendance upon this surprising lady would furnish me with some particulars as agreeable as now could be hoped for from the declining way she is in by reason of the welcome letter she had received from her cousin morden but it proved quite otherwise to me though not to herself for i think i never was more shocked in my life than on the occasion i shall mention presently  when i attended her about seven in the evening she told me that she had found herself since i went in a very petulant way strange she said that the pleasure she had received from her cousins letter should have had such an effect upon her but she had given way to a comparative humor as she might call it and thought it very hard that her nearer relations had not taken the methods with her which her cousin morden had begun with by inquiring into her merit or demerit and giving her cause a fair audit before condemnation  she had hardly said this when she started and a blush overspread her face on hearing as i also did a sort of lumbering noise upon the stairs as if a large trunk were bringing up between two people and looking upon me with an eye of concern blunderers said she they have brought in something two hours before the time  dont be surprised sir it is all to save you trouble  before i could speak in came mrs smith o madam said she what have you done  mrs lovick entering made the same exclamation lord have mercy upon me madam cried i what have you done  for she stepping at the instant to the door the women told me it was a coffin  o lovelace that thou had been there at the moment  thou the causer of all these shocking scenes surely thou could not have been less affected than i who have no guilt as to her to answer for  with an intrepidity of a piece with the preparation having directed them to carry it into her bedchamber she returned to us they were not to have brought it in till after dark said she  pray excuse me mr belford and dont you mrs lovick be concerned nor you mrs smith why should you there is nothing more in it than the unusualness of the thing why may we not be as reasonably shocked at going to the church where are the monuments of our ancestors with whose dust we even hope our dust shall be one day mingled as to be moved at such a sight as this  we all remaining silent the women having their aprons at their eyes  why this concern for nothing at all said she  if i am to be blamed for anything it is for showing too much solicitude as it may be thought for this earthly part i love to do everything for myself that i can do i ever did every other material point is so far done and taken care of that i have had leisure for things of lesser moment minutenesses may be observed where greater articles are not neglected for them i might have had this to order perhaps when less fit to order it i have no mother no sister no mrs norton no miss how near me some of you must have seen this in a few days if not now perhaps have had the friendly trouble of directing it and what is the difference of a few days to you when i am gratified rather than discomposed by it  i shall not die the sooner for such a preparation  should not everybody make their will that has anything to bequeath and who that makes a will should be afraid of a coffin  my dear friends to the women i have considered these things do not give me reason to think you have not with such an object before you as you have had in me for weeks  how reasonable was all this  it showed indeed that she herself had well considered of it but yet we could not help being shocked at the thoughts of the coffin thus brought in the lovely person before our eyes who is in all likelihood so soon to fill it  we were all silent still the women in grief i in a manner stunned she would not ask me she said but would be glad since it had thus earlier than she had intended been brought in that her two good friends would walk in and look upon it they would be less shocked when it was made more familiar to their eye than while their thoughts ran large upon it dont you lead back said she a starting steed to the object he is apt to start at in order to familiarize him to it and cure his starting the same reason will hold in this case come my good friends i will lead you in  i took my leave telling her she had done wrong very wrong and ought not by any means to have such an object before her  the women followed her in  it is a strange sex nothing is too shocking for them to look upon or see acted that has but novelty and curiosity in it  down i posted got a chair and was carried home extremely shocked and discomposed yet weighing the ladys arguments i know not why i was so affected  except as she said at the unusualness of the thing  while i waited for a chair mrs smith came down and told me that there were devices and inscriptions upon the lid lord bless me is a coffin a proper subject to display fancy upon  but these great minds cannot avoid doing extraordinary things  letter xxxii mr belford to robert lovelace esquire friday morn sept   it is surprising that i a man should be so much affected as i was at such an object as is the subject of my former letter who also in my late uncles case and poor beltons had the like before me and the directing of it when she a woman of so weak and tender a frame who was to fill it so soon perhaps to fill it could give orders about it and draw out the devices upon it and explain them with so little concern as the women tell me she did to them last night after i was gone  i really was ill and restless all night thou were the subject of my execration as she of my admiration all the time i was quite awake and when i dozed i dreamt of nothing but of flying hourglasses deaths heads spades mattocks and eternity the hint of her devices as given me by mrs smith running in my head  however not being able to keep away from smiths i went thither about seven the lady was just gone out she had slept better i found than i though her solemn repository was under her window not far from her bedside  i was prevailed upon by mrs smith and her nurse shelburne mrs lovick being abroad with her to go up and look at the devices mrs lovick has since shown me a copy of the draught by which all was ordered and i will give thee a sketch of the symbols  the principal device neatly etched on a plate of white metal is a crowned serpent with its tail in its mouth forming a ring the emblem of eternity and in the circle made by it is this inscription  clarissa harlowe  april x  then the year  aetat xix  for ornaments at top an hourglass winged at bottom an urn  under the hourglass on another plate this inscription here the wicked cease from troubling and here the weary be at rest  job iii    over the urn near the bottom turn again unto thy rest o my soul for the lord has rewarded thee and why thou have delivered my soul from death mine eyes from tears and my feet from falling  ps cxvi     over this text is the head of a white lily snapt short off and just falling from the stalk and this inscription over that between the principal plate and the lily the days of man are but as grass for he flourishes as a flower of the field for as soon as the wind goes over it it is gone and the place thereof shall know it no more  ps ciii       she excused herself to the women on the score of her youth and being used to draw for her needleworks for having shown more fancy than would perhaps be thought suitable on so solemn an occasion  the date april  0 she accounted for as not being able to tell what her closingday would be and as that was the fatal day of her leaving her fathers house  she discharged the undertakers bill

present to have admired it too  mrs lovick said she took the liberty to blame her and wished the removal of such an object  from her bedchamber at least and was so affected with the noble answer she made upon it that she entered it down the moment she left her  to persons in health said she this sight may be shocking and the preparation and my unconcernedness in it may appear affected but to me who have had so gradual a weaningtime from the world and so much reason not to love it i must say i dwell on i indulge and strictly speaking i enjoy the thoughts of death for believe me looking steadfastly at the awful receptacle believe what at this instant i feel to be most true that there is such a vast superiority of weight and importance in the thought of death and its hoped for happy consequences that it in a manner annihilates all other considerations and concerns believe me my good friends it does what nothing else can do it teaches me by strengthening in me the force of the divinest example to forgive the injuries i have received and shuts out the remembrance of past evils from my soul  and now let me ask thee lovelace do thou think that when the time shall come that thou shall be obliged to launch into the boundless ocean of eternity thou will be able any more than poor belton was to act thy part with such true heroism as this sweet and tender blossom of a woman has manifested and continues to manifest  o no it cannot be  and why cannot it be  the reason is evident she has no wilful errors to look back upon with selfreproach  and her mind is strengthened by the consolations which flow from that religious rectitude which has been the guide of all her actions and which has taught her rather to choose to be a sufferer than an aggressor  this was the support of the divine socrates as thou have read when led to execution his wife lamenting that he should suffer being innocent thou fool said he would thou wish me to be guilty  letter xxxiii mr belford to robert lovelace esquire friday sept   how astonishing in the midst of such affecting scenes is thy mirth on what thou call my own aspirations never surely was there such another man in this world thy talents and thy levity taken together  surely what i shall send thee with this will affect thee if not nothing can till thy own hour come  and heavy will then thy reflections be  i am glad however that thou enablest me to assure the lady that thou will no more molest her that is to say in other words that after having ruined her fortunes and all her worldly prospects thou will be so gracious as to let her lie down and die in peace  thy giving up to poor beltons sister the little legacy and thy undertaking to make mowbray and tourville follow thy example is i must say to thy honor of a piece with thy generosity to thy rosebud and her johnny and to a number of other good actions in pecuniary matters although thy rosebuds is i believe the only instance where a pretty woman was concerned of such a disinterested bounty  upon my faith lovelace i love to praise thee and often and often as thou know have i studied for occasions to do it insomuch that when for the life of me i could not think of anything done by thee that deserved it i have taken pains to applaud the not ungraceful manner in which thou have performed actions that merited the gallows  now thou art so near i will dispatch my servant to thee if occasion requires but i fear i shall soon give thee the news thou apprehendest for i am just now sent for by mrs smith who has ordered the messenger to tell me that she knew not if the lady will be alive when i come   friday sept   two of clock at smith s i could not close my letter in such an uncertainty as must have added to your impatience for you have on several occasions convinced me that the suspense you love to give would be the greatest torment to you that you could receive a common case with all aggressive and violent spirits i believe i will just mention then your servant waiting here till i have written that the lady has had two very severe fits in the last of which whilst she lay they sent to the doctor and mr goddard who both advised that a messenger should be dispatched for me as her executor being doubtful whether if she had a third it would not carry her off  she was tolerably recovered by the time i came and the doctor made her promise before me that she would not attempt any more while so weak to go abroad for by mrs lovicks description who attended her the shortness of her breath her extreme weakness and the fervor of her devotions when at church were contraries which pulling different ways the soul aspiring the body sinking ore her tender frame in pieces  so much for the present i shall detain will no longer than just to beg that you will send me back this packet and the last your memory is so good that once reading is all you ever give or need to give to anything and who but ourselves can make out our characters were you inclined to let anybody see what passes between us if i cannot be obliged i shall be tempted to withold what i write till i have time to take a copy of it it may not be amiss to observe that mr belfords solicitude to get back his letters was owing to his desire of fulfilling the ladys wishes that he would furnish miss how with materials to vindicate her memory   a letter from miss how is just now brought by a particular messenger who says he must carry back a few lines in return but as the lady is just retired to lie down the man is to call again byandby     letter xxxiv mr lovelace to john belford esquire uxbridge sept   twelve of clock at night i send you the papers with this you must account to me honestly and fairly when i see you for the earnestness with which you write for them and then also will we talk about the contents of your last dispatch and about some of your severe and unfriendly reflections  mean time whatever thou do dont let the wonderful creature leave us set before her the sin of her preparation as if she thought she could depart when she pleased she will persuade herself at this rate that she has nothing to do when all is ready but to lie down and go to sleep and such a lively fancy as hers will make a reality of a jest at any time  a jest i call all that has passed between her and me a mere jest to die for  for has she not from first to last infinitely more triumphed over me than suffered from me  would the sacred regard i have for her purity even for her personal as well as intellectual purity permit i could prove this as clear as the sun therefore tell the dear creature she must not be wicked in her piety there is a too much as well as a too little even in righteousness perhaps she does not think of that  o that she would have permitted my attendance as obligingly as she does of thine  the dear soul used to love humor i remember the time that she knew how to smile at a piece of apropos humor and let me tell thee a smile upon the lips must have had its correspondent cheerfulnesses in a heart so sincere as hers  tell the doctor i will make over all my possessions and all my reversions to him if he will but prolong her life for one twelvemonth to come but for one twelvemonth jack  he will lose all his reputation with me and i shall treat him as belton did his doctor if he cannot do this for me on so young a subject but nineteen belford  nineteen cannot so soon die of grief if the doctor deserve that name and so blooming and so fine a constitution as she had but three or four months ago  but what need the doctor have asked her leave to write to her friends could he not have done it without letting her know anything of the matter that was one of the likeliest means that could be thought of to bring some of them about her since she is so desirous to see them at least it would have induced them to send up her favorite norton but these plaguey solemn fellows are great traders in parade and for the hearts of them cannot get out of it be the occasion what it will they will cram down your throat their poisonous drugs by wholesale without asking you a question and have the assurance to own it to be prescribing but when they are to do good they are to ask your consent  how the dear creatures character rises in every line of thy letters  but it is owing to the uncommon occasions she has met with that she blazes out upon us with such a meridian luster  how but for those occasions could her noble sentiments her prudent consideration her forgiving spirit her exalted benevolence and her equanimity in view of the most shocking prospects which set her in a light so superior to all her sex and even to the philosophers of antiquity have been manifested  i know thou will think i am going to claim some merit to myself for having given her such opportunities of signalizing her virtues but i am not for if i did i must share that merit with her implacable relations who would justly be entitled to two thirds of it at least and my soul disdains a partnership in anything with such a family  but this i mention as an answer to thy reproaches that i could be so little edified by perfections to which thou supposest i was for so long together daily and hourly a personal witness  when admirable as she was in all she said and in all she did occasion had not at that time ripened and called forth those amazing perfections which now astonish and confound me  hence it is that i admire her more than ever i did and that my love for her is less personal as i may say more intellectual than ever i thought it could be to woman  hence also it is that i am confident would it please the fates to spare her and make her mine i could love her with a purity that would draw on my own future as well as insure her temporal happiness  and hence by necessary consequence shall i be the most miserable of all men if i am deprived of her  thou severely reflectest upon me for my levity in the abbey instance and i will be ingenuous enough to own that as thou see not my heart there may be passages in every one of my letters which the melancholy occasion considered deserve thy most pointed rebukes but faith jack thou art such a tragicomical mortal with thy leaden aspirations at one time and thy flying hourglasses and dreaming terrors at another that as prior says what serious is thou turnst to farce and it is impossible to keep within the bounds of decorum or gravity when one reads what thou writest  but to restrain myself for my constitutional gaiety was ready to run away with me again i will repeat i must ever repeat that i am most egregiously affected with the circumstances of the case and were this paragon actually to quit the world should never enjoy myself one hour together though i were to live to the age of methusalem  indeed it is to this deep concern that my very levity is owing for i struggle and struggle and try to buffet down these reflections as they rise and when i cannot do it i am forced as i have often said to try to make myself laugh that i may not cry for one or other i must do and is it not philosophy carried to the highest pitch for a man to conquer such tumults of soul as i am sometimes agitated by and in the very height of the storm to be able to quaver out an horselaugh  your senecas your epictetuss and the rest of your stoical tribe with all their apathynonsense could not come up to this they could forbear wry faces bodily pains they could well enough seem to support and that was all but the pangs of their own smittendown souls they could not laugh over though they could at the follies of others they read grave lectures but they were grave this high point of philosophy to laugh and be merry in the midst of the most soulharrowing woes when the heart strings are just bursting asunder was reserved for thy lovelace  there is something owing to constitution i own and that this is the laughingtime of my life for what a woe must that be which for an hour together can mortify a man of six or seven and twenty in high blood and spirits of a naturally gay disposition who can sing dance and scribble and take and give delight in them all  but then my grief as my joy is sharperpointed than most other mens and like what dolly welby once told me describing the parturient throes if there were not lucid intervals  if they did not come and go  there would be no bearing them  after all as i am so little distant from the dear creature and as she is so very ill i think i cannot excuse myself from making her one visit nevertheless if i thought her so near  what word shall i use that my soul is not shocked at and that she would be too much discomposed by a visit i would not think of it  yet how can i bear the recollection that when she last went from me her innocence so triumphant over my premeditated guilt as was enough to reconcile her to life and to set her above the sense of injuries so nobly sustained that she should then depart with an incurable fracture in her heart and that that should be the last time i should ever see her  how how can i bear this reflection  o jack how my conscience that gives edge even to hy blunt reflections tears me  even this moment would i give the world to push the cruel reproacher from me by one gay intervention  sick of myself  sick of the remembrance of my vile plots and of my light my momnary ecstasy villainous burglar felon thief that i was which has brought upon me such durable and such heavy remorse what would i give that i had not been guilty of such barbarous and ungrateful perfidy to the most excellent of gods creatures  i would end methinks with one sprightlier line  but it will not be  let me tell thee then and rejoice at it if thou will that i am  inexpressibly miserable  letter xxxv mr belford to robert lovelace esquire sat morning sept   i have some little pleasure given me by thine just now brought me i see now that thou have a little humanity left would to heaven for the dear ladys sake as well as for thy own that thou had romaged it up from all the dark forgotten corners of thy soul a little sooner  the lady is alive and serene and calm and has all her noble intellects clear and strong but nineteen will not however save her she says she will now content herself with her closetduties and the visits of the parishminister and will not attempt to go out nor indeed will she i am afraid ever walk up or down a pair of stairs again  i am sorry at my soul to have this to say but it would be a folly to flatter thee  as to thy seeing her i believe the least hint of that sort now would cut off some hours of her life  what has contributed to her serenity it seems is that taking the alarm her fits gave her she has entirely finished and signed and sealed her last will which she had deferred doing till this time in hopes as she said of some good news from harloweplace which would have occasioned the alteration of some passages in it  miss howes letter was not given her till four in the afternoon yesterday at what time the messenger returned for an answer she admitted him to her presence in the dining room ill as she then was and would have written a few lines as desired by miss how but not being able to hold a pen she bid the messenger tell her that she hoped to be well enough to write a long letter by the next days post and would not now detain him  saturday six in the afternoon i called just now and found the lady writing to miss how she made me a melancholy compliment that she showed me not miss howes letter because i should soon have that and all her papers before me but she told me that miss how had very considerately obviated to colonel morden several things which might have occasioned misapprehensions between him and me and had likewise put a lighter construction for the sake of peace on some of your actions than they deserved  she added that her cousin morden was warmly engaged in her favor with her friends and one good piece of news miss howes letter contained that her father would give up some matters which appertaining to her of right would make my executorship the easier in some particulars that had given her a little pain  she owned she had been obliged to leave off in the letter she was writing through weakness  will says he shall reach you tonight i shall send in the morning and if i find her not worse will ride to edgware and return in the afternoon   letter xxxvi miss how to miss clarissa harlowe tuesday aug    my dearest friend i am at length returned to this place and had intended to wait on you in london but my mamma is very ill  alas my dear she is very ill indeed  and you are likewise very ill  i see that by yours of the   th  what shall i do if i lose two such near and dear and tender friends she was taken ill yesterday at our last stage in our return home  and has a violent surfeit and fever and the doctors are doubtful about her  if she should die how will all my pertnesses to her fly in my face  why why did i ever vex her  she says i have been all duty and obedience  she kindly forgets all my faults and remembers everything i have been so happy as to oblige her in and this cuts me to the heart  i see i see my dear you are very bad  and i cannot bear it do my beloved miss harlowe if you can be better do for my sake be better and send me word of it let the bearer bring me a line be sure you send me a line if i lose you my more than sister and lose my mamma i shall distrust my own conduct and will not marry and why should i  creeping cringing in courtship  o my dear these men are a vile race of reptils in our day and mere bears in their own see in lovelace all that was desirable in figure in birth and in fortune but in his heart a devil  see in hickman  indeed my dear i cannot tell what anybody can see in hickman to be always preaching in his favor and is it to be expected that i who could hardly bear control from a mother should take it from a husband  from one too who has neither more wit nor more understanding than myself yet he to be my instructor  so he will i suppose but more by the insolence of his will than by the merit of his counsel it is in vain to think of it  i cannot be a wife to any man breathing whom i at present know  this i the rather mention now because on my mothers danger i know you will be for pressing me the sooner to throw myself into another sort of protection should i be deprived of her but no more of this subject or indeed of any other for i am obliged to attend my mamma who cannot bear me out of her sight  wednesday aug  0 my mother heaven be praised has had a fine night and is much better her fever has yielded to medicine and now i can write once more with freedom and ease to you in hopes that you also are better if this be granted to my prayers i shall again be happy i write with still the more alacrity as i have an opportunity given me to touch upon a subject in which you are nearly concerned  you must know then my dear that your cousin morden has been here with me he told me of an interview he had on monday at lord ms with lovelace and asked me abundance of questions about you and about that villainous man  i could have raised a fine flame between them if i would but observing that he is a man of very lively passions and believing you would be miserable if anything should happen to him from a quarrel with a man who is known to have so many advantages at his sword i made not the worst of the subjects we talked of but as i could not tell untruths in his favor you must think i said enough to make him curse the wretch  i dont find well as they all used to respect colonel morden that he has influence enough upon them to bring them to any terms of reconciliation  what can they mean by it  but your brother is come home it seems so the honor of the house  the reputation of the family is all the cry  the colonel is exceedingly out of humor with them all yet has he not hitherto it seems seen your brutal brother  i told him how ill you were and communicated to him some of the contents of your letter he admired you cursed lovelace and raved against all your family  he declared that they were all unworthy of you  at his earnest request i permitted him to take some brief notes of such of the contents of your letter to me as i thought i could read to him and particularly of your melancholy conclusion see p      he says that none of your friends think you so ill as you are nor will believe it  he is sure they all love you and that dearly too  if they do their present hardness of heart will be the subject of everlasting remorse to them should you be taken from us  but now it seems barbarous wretches you are to suffer within an inch of your life  he asked me questions about mr belford and when he had heard what i had to say of that gentleman and his disinterested services to you he raved at some villainous surmises thrown out against you by that officious pedant brand who but for his gown i find would come off poorly enough between your cousin and lovelace  he was so uneasy about you himself that on thursday the   th he sentup an honest serious man see p     one alston a gentleman farmer to inquire of your condition your visiters etc who brought him word that you was very ill and was put to great streights to support yourself but as this was told him by the gentlewoman of the house where you lodge who it seems mingled with it some tart though deserved reflections upon your relations cruelty it was not credited by them and i myself hope it cannot be true for surely you could not be so unjust i will say to my friendship as to suffer any inconveniences for want of money i think i could not forgive you if it were so  the colonel as one of your trustees is resolved to see you put into possession of your estate and in the mean time he has actually engaged them to remit to him for you the produce of it accrued since your grandfathers death a very considerable sum and proposes himself to attend you with it but by a hint he dropped i find you had disappointed some peoples littleness by not writing to them for money and supplies since they were determined to distress you and to put you at defiance  like all the rest  i hope i may say that without offense  your cousin imagines that before a reconciliation takes place they will insist that you shall make such a will as to that estate as they shall approve of but he declares he will not go out of england till he has seen justice done you by everybody and that you shall not be imposed on either by friend or foe   by relation or foe should he not have said  for a friend will not impose upon a friend  so my dear you are to buy your peace if some people were to have their wills  your cousin not i my dear though it was always my opinion see vol i p     says that the whole family is too rich to be either humble considerate or contented and as for himself he has an ample fortune he says and thinks of leaving it wholly to you  had this villain lovelace consulted his worldly interest only what a fortune would he have had in you even although your marrying him had deprived you of your paternal share  i am obliged to leave off here but having a good deal still to write and my mother better i will pursue the subject in another letter although i send both together i need not say how much i am and will ever be  your affectionate etc anna how   letter xxxvii miss how to miss clarissa harlowe thursday aug    the colonel thought fit once to speak it to the praise of lovelaces generosity that  as a man of honor ought he took to himself all the blame and acquitted you of the consequences of the precipitate step you had taken since he said as you loved him and was in his power he must have had advantages which he would not have had if you had continued at your fathers or at any friends  mighty generous i said were it as he supposed in such insolent reflecters the best of them who pretend to clear reputations which never had been sullied but by falling into their dirty acquaintance but in this case i added that there was no need of anything but the strictest truth to demonstrate lovelace to be the blackest of villains you the brightest of innocents  this he caught at and swore that could he find that there were anything uncommon or barbarous in the seduction as one of your letters had indeed seemed to imply that is to say my dear anything worse than perjury breach of faith and abuse of a generous confidence  sorry fellows he would avenge his cousin to the utmost  i urged your apprehensions on this hed from your last letter to me but he seemed capable of taking what i know to be real greatness of soul in an unworthy sense for he mentioned directly upon it the expectation your friends had that you should previous to any reconciliation with them appear in a court of justice against the villain  if you could do it with the advantage to yourself that i hinted might be done  and truly if i would have heard him he had indelicacy enough to have gone into the nature of the proof of the crime upon which they wanted to have lovelace arraigned yet this is a gentleman improved by travel and learning  upon my word my dear i who have been accustomed to the most delicate conversation ever since i had the honor to know you despise this sex from the gentleman to the peasant  upon the whole i find that mr morden has a very slender notion of womens virtue in particular cases for which reason i put him down though your favorite as one who is not entitled to cast the first stone  i never knew a man who deserved to be well thought of himself for his morals who had a slight opinion of the virtue of our sex in general for if from the difference of temperament and education modesty chastity and piety too and these from principle are not to be found in our sex preferably to the other i should think it a sign of a much worse nature in ours  he even hinted as from your relations indeed that it is impossible but there must be some will where there is much love these sort of reflections are enough to make a woman who has at heart her own honor and the honor of her sex to look about her and consider what she is doing when she enters into an intimacy with these wretches since it is plain that whenever she throws herself into the power of a man and leaves for him her parents or guardians everybody will believe it to be owing more to her good luck than to her discretion if there be not an end of her virtue and let the man be ever such a villain to her she must take into her own bosom a share of his guilty baseness  i am writing to general cases you my dear are out of the question your story as i have heretofore said will afford a warning as well as an example vol iv p     for who is it that will not infer that if a person of your fortune character and merit could not escape ruin after she had put herself into the power of her hyaena what can a thoughtless fond giddy creature expect  every man they will say is not a lovelace  true but then neither is every woman a clarissa  and allow for the one and the other the example must be of general use  i prepared this gentleman to expect your appointment of mr belford for an office that we both hope he will have no occasion to act in nor anybody else for many very many years to come he was at first startled at it but upon hearing your reasons which had satisfied me he only said that such an appointment were it to take place would exceedingly affect his other cousins  he told me he had a copy of lovelaces letter to you imploring your pardon and offering to undergo any penance to procure it see vol vi p      and also of your answer to it see vol vi p       i find he is willing to hope that a marriage between you may still take place which he says will heal up all breaches  i would have written much more  on the following particulars especially to wit of the wretched mans hunting you out of your lodgings of your relations strange implacableness i am in haste and cannot think of a word you would like better just now of your last letter to lovelace to divert him from pursuing you of your aunt herveys penitential conversation with mrs norton of mr wyerleys renewed address of your lessons in hickmans behalf so approveable were the man more so than he is but indeed i am offended with him at this instant and have been these two days  of your sisters transportationproject  and of twenty and twenty other things  but am obliged to leave off to attend my two cousins spilsworth and my cousin herbert who are come to visit us on account of my mothers illness  i will therefore dispatch these by rogers and if my mother gets well soon as i hope she will i am resolved to see you in town and tell you everything that now is upon my mind and particularly mingling my soul with yours how much i am and will ever be my dearest dear friend  your affectionate anna how let rogers bring one line i pray you i thought to have sent him this afternoon but he cannot set out till tomorrow morning early  i cannot express how much your staggering lines and your conclusion affect me    letter xxxviii mr belford to robert lovelace esquire sunday evening sept   i wonder not at the impatience your servant tells me you express to hear from me i was designing to write you a long letter and was just returned from smiths for that purpose but since you are so urgent you must be contented with a short one  i attended the lady this morning just before i set out for edgware she was so ill overnight that she was obliged to leave her letter to miss how unfinished but early this morning she made an end of it and had just sealed it up as i came she was so fatigued with writing that she told me she would lie down after i was gone and endeavor to recruit her spirits  they had sent for mr goddard when she was so ill last night and not being able to see him out of her own chamber he for the first time saw her house as she calls it he was extremely shocked and concerned at it and chid mrs smith and mrs lovick for not persuading her to have such an object removed from her bedchamber and when they excused themselves on the little authority it was reasonable to suppose they must have with a lady so much their superior he reflected warmly on those who had more authority and who left her to proceed in such a shocking and solemn whimsy as he called it  it is placed near the window like a harpsichord though covered over to the ground and when she is so ill that she cannot well go to her closet she writes and reads upon it as others would upon a desk or table but only as she was so ill last night she chooses not to see anybody in that apartment  i went to edgware and returning in the evening attended her again she had a letter brought her from mrs norton a long one as it seems by its bulk just before i came but she had not opened it and said that as she was pretty calm and composed she was afraid to look into the contents lest she should be ruffled expecting now to hear of nothing that could do her good or give her pleasure from that good womans dear hardhearted neighbors as she called her own relations  seeing her so weak and ill i withdrew nor did she desire me to tarry as sometimes she does when i make a motion to depart  by mrs smith i had some hints as i went away that she had appropriated that evening to some offices that were to save trouble as she called it after her departure and had been giving her nurse and mrs lovick and mrs smith orders about what she would have done when she was gone and i believe they were of a very delicate and affecting nature but mrs smith descended not to particulars  the doctor had been with her as well as mr goddard and they both joined with great earnestness to persuade her to have her house removed out of her sight but she assured them that it gave her pleasure and spirits and being a necessary preparation she wondered they should be surprised at it when she had not any of her family about her or any old acquaintance on whose care and exactness in these punctilios as she called them she could rely  the doctor told mrs smith that he believed she would hold out long enough for any of her friends to have notice of her state and to see her and hardly longer and since he could not find that she had any certainty of hearing from or seeing her cousin morden which made it plain that her relations continued inflexible he would go home and write a letter to her father take it as she would  she had spent great part of the day in intense devotions and tomorrow morning she is to have with her the same clergyman who has often attended her from whose hands she will again receive the sacrament  thou see lovelace that all is preparing that all will be ready and i am to attend her tomorrow afternoon to take some instructions from her in relation to my part in the office to be performed for her and thus omitting the particulars of a fine conversation between her and mrs lovick which the latter acquainted me with as well as another between her and the doctor and apothecary which i had a design this evening to give you they being of a very affecting nature i have yielded to your impatience  i shall dispatch harry tomorrow morning early with her letter to miss how an offer she took very kindly as she is extremely solicitous to lessen that young ladys apprehensions for her on not hearing from her by saturdays post and yet to write the truth how can her apprehensions be lessened    letter xxxix miss clarissa harlowe to miss how saturday sept   i write my beloved miss how though very ill still but i could not by the return of your messenger for i was then unable to hold a pen  your mothers illness as by the first part of your letter gave me great distress for you till i read further you bewail it as it becomes a daughter so sensible may you be blessed in each other for many very many happy years to come i doubt not that even this sudden and grievous indisposition by the frame it has put you in and the apprehension it has given you of losing so dear a mother will contribute to the happiness i wish you for alas my dear we never know how to value the blessings we enjoy till we are in danger of losing them or have actually lost them and then what would we give to have them restored to us  what i wonder has again happened between you and mr hickman although i know it not i dare say it is owing to some pretty petulance to some halfungenerous advantage taken of his obligingness and assiduity will you never my dear give the weight you and all our sex ought to give to the qualities of sobriety and regularity of life and manners in that sex must bold creatures and forward spirits for ever and by the best and wisest of us as well as by the indiscreetest be the most kindly used  my dear friends know not that i have actually suffered within less than an inch of my life  poor mr brand he meant well i believe  i am afraid all will turn heavily upon him when he probably thought that he was taking the best method to oblige but were he not to have been so light of belief and so weakly officious but had given a more favorable and it would be strange if i could not say a juster report things would have been nevertheless exactly as they are  i must lay down my pen i am very ill i believe i shall be better byandby the bad writing would betray me although i had a mind to keep from you what the event must soon   now i resume my trembling pen excuse the unsteady writing it will be so   i have wanted no money so dont be angry about such a trifle as money yet am i glad of what you incline me to hope that my friends will give up the produce of my grandfathers estate since it has been in their hands because knowing it to be my right and that they could not want it i had already disposed of a good part of it and could only hope they would be willing to give it up at my last request and now how rich shall i think myself in this my last stage  and yet i did not want before  indeed i did not  for who that has many superfluities can be said to want  do not my dear friend be concerned that i call it my last stage for what is even the long life which in high health we wish for what but as we go along a life of apprehension sometimes for our friends oftener for ourselves and at last when arrived at the old age we covet one heavy loss or deprivation having succeeded another we see ourselves stripped as i may say of everyone we loved and find ourselves exposed as uncompanionable poor creatures to the slights to the contempts of jostling youth who want to push us off the stage in hopes to possess what we have  and superadded to all our own infirmities every day increasing of themselves enough to make the life we wishedfor the greatest disease of all dont you remember the lines of howard which once you read to me in my ivybower these are the lines the lady refers to from death we rose to life it is but the same through life to pass again from whence we came with shame we see our passions can prevail where reason certainty and virtue fail honor that empty name can death despise scorned love to death as to a refuge flies and sorrow waits for death with longing eyes hope triumphs over the thoughts of death and fate cheats fools and flatters the unfortunate we fear to lose what a small time must waste till life itself grows the disease at last begging for life we beg for more decay and to be long a dying only pray      in the disposition of what belongs to me i have endeavored to do everything in the justest and best manner i could think of putting myself in my relations places and in the greater points ordering my matters as if no misunderstanding had happened  i hope they will not think much of some bequests where wanted and where due from my gratitude but if they should what is done is done and i cannot now help it yet i must repeat that i hope i hope i have pleased every one of them for i would not on any account have it thought that in my last disposition anything undaughterly unsisterly or unlike a kinswoman should have had place in a mind that is so truly free as i will presume to say from all resentment that it now overflows with gratitude and blessings for the good i have received although it be not all that my heart wished to receive were it even an hardship that i was not favored with more what is it but an hardship of half a year against the most indulgent goodness of eighteen years and an half that ever was shown to a daughter  my cousin you tell me thinks i was off my guard and that i was taken at some advantage indeed my dear i was not indeed i gave no room for advantage to be taken of me i hope one day that will be seen if i have the justice done me which mr belford assures me of  i should hope that my cousin has not taken the liberties which you by an observation not unjust seem to charge him with for it is sad to think that the generality of that sex should make so light of crimes which they justly hold so unpardonable in their own most intimate relations of ours  yet cannot commit them without doing such injuries to other families and individuals as they think themselves obliged to resent unto death when offered to their own families  but we women are too often to blame on this head since the most virtuous among us seldom make virtue the test of their approbation of the other insomuch that a man may glory in his wickedness of this sort without being rejected on that account even to the faces of women of unquestionable virtue hence it is that a libertine seldom thinks himself concerned so much as to save appearances and what is it not that our sex suffers in their opinions on this very score and what have i more than many others to answer for on this very account in the worlds eye  may my story be a warning to all how they prefer a libertine to a man of true honor and how they permit themselves to be misled where they mean the best by the specious yet foolish hope of subduing riveted habits and as i may say of altering natures  the more foolish as experience might convince us that there is hardly one in ten of even tolerably happy marriages in which the wife keeps the hold in the husbands affections which she had in the lovers what influence then can she hope to have over the morals of an avowed libertine who marries perhaps for convenience who despises the tie and whom it is too probable nothing but old age or sickness or disease the consequence of ruinous riot can reclaim  i am very glad you gave my cous    sunday morning sept   six oclock hither i had written and was forced to quit my pen and so much weaker and worse i grew that had i resumed it to have closed here it must have been with such trembling unsteadiness that it would have given you more concern for me than the delay of sending it away by last nights post can do so i deferred it to see how it would please god to deal with me and i find myself after a better night than i expected lively and clear and hope to give you a proof that i do in the continuation of my letter which i will pursue as currently as if i had not left off  i am glad you so considerately gave my cousin morden favorable impressions of mr belford since otherwise some misunderstanding might have happened between them for although i hope this gentleman is an altered man and in time will be a reformed one yet is he one of those high spirits that has been accustomed to resent imaginary indignities to himself when i believe he has not been studious to avoid giving real offenses to others men of this cast acting as if they thought all the world was made to bear with them and they with nobody in it  mr lovelace you tell me thought fit to entrust my cousin with the copy of his letter of penitence to me and with my answer to it rejecting him and his suit and mr belford moreover acquaints me how much concerned mr lovelace is for his baseness and how freely he accused himself to my cousin this shows that the true bravery of spirit is to be above doing a vile action and that nothing subjects the human mind to such meannesses as to be guilty of wilful wrongs to our fellow creatures how low how sordid are the submissions which elaborate baseness compels that that wretch could treat me as he did and then could so poorly creep to me to be forgiven and to be allowed to endeavor to repair crimes so wilful so black and so premeditated how my soul despised him for his meanness on a certain occasion of which you will one day be informed meaning his meditated second violence  see vol v letter  0 and his succeeding letters to her supplicating her pardon  and him whom ones heart despises it is far from being difficult to reject had one ever so partially favored him once  yet am i glad this violent spirit can thus creep that like a poisonous serpent he can thus coil himself and hide his head in his own narrow circlets because this stooping this abasement gives me hope that no further mischief will ensue  all my apprehension is what may happen when i am gone lest then my cousin or any other of my family should endeavor to avenge me and risk their own more precious lives on that account  if that part of cains curse were mr lovelaces to be a fugitive and vagabond in the earth that is to say if it meant no more harm to him than that he should be obliged to travel as it seems he intends though i wish him no ill in his travels and i could know it then should i be easy in the hopdfor safety of my friends from his skilful violence oh that i could hear he was a thousand miles off  when i began this letter i did not think i could have run to such a length but it is to you my dearest friend and you have a title to the spirits you raise and support for they are no longer mine and will subside the moment i cease writing to you  but what do you bid me hope for when you tell me that if your mothers health will permit you will see me in town i hope your mothers health will be perfected as you wish but i dare not promise myself so great a favor so great a blessing i will call it  and indeed i know not if i should be able to bear it now   yet one comfort it is in your power to give me and that is let me know and very speedily it must be if you wish to oblige me that all matters are made up between you and mr hickman to whom i see you are resolved with all your bravery of spirit to owe a multitude of obligations for his patience with your flightiness think of this my dear proud friend and think likewise of what i have often told you that pride in man or woman is an extreme that hardly ever fails sooner or later to bring forth its mortifying contrary  may you my dear miss how have no discomforts but what you make to yourself those as it will be in your own power to lessen them ought to be your own punishment if you do not as there is no such thing as perfect happiness here since the busy mind will make to itself evils were it to find none you will pardon this limited wish strange as it may appear till you consider it for to wish you no infelicities either within or without you were to wish you what can never happen in this world and what perhaps ought not to be wished for if by a wish one could give ones friend such an exemption since we are not to live here always  we must not in short expect that our roses will grow without thorns but then they are useful and instructive thorns which by pricking the fingers of the too hasty plucker teach future caution at the same time that they add sweets and poignancy too to enjoyments which are not overeasily attained  i must conclude   god for ever bless you and all you love and honor and reward you here and hereafter for your kindness to  your everobliged and affectionate clarissa harlowe   letter xl mrs norton to miss clarissa harlowe in answer to hers of thursday aug     thursday aug    i had written sooner my dearest young lady but that i have been endeavoring ever since the receipt of your last letter to obtain a private audience of your mother in hopes of leave to communicate it to her but last night i was surprised by an invitation to breakfast at harloweplace this morning and the chariot came early to fetch me an honor i did not expect  when i came i found there was to be a meeting of all your family with colonel morden at harloweplace and it was proposed by your mother and consented to that i should be present your cousin i understand had with difficulty brought this meeting to bear for your brother had before industriously avoided all conversation with him on the affecting subject urging that it was not necessary to talk to mr morden upon it who being a remoter relation than themselves had no business to make himself a judge of their conduct to their daughter their niece and their sister especially as he had declared himself in her favor adding that he should hardly have patience to be questioned by him on that head  i was in hopes that your mamma would have given me an opportunity of talking with her alone before the company met but she seemed studiously to avoid it i dare say however not with her inclination  i was ordered in just before mr morden came and was bid to sit down  which i did in the window  the colonel when he came began the discourse by renewing as he called it his solicitations in your favor he set before them your penitence your ill health your virtue though once betrayed and basely used he then read to them mr lovelaces letter a most contrite one indeed see vol vi p      and your highsould answer see vol vi p      for that was what he justly called it and he treated as it deserved mr brands officious information of which i had before heard he had made them ashamed by representations founded upon inquiries made by mr alston see p    of this vol  whom he procured to go up on purpose to acquaint himself with your manner of life and what was meant by the visits of that mr belford  he then told them that he had the day before waited upon miss how and had been shown a letter from you to her see p     and permitted to take some memorandums from it in which you appeared both by handwriting and the conents to be so very ill that it seemed doubtful to him if it were possible for you to get over it and when he read to them that passage where you ask miss how what can be done for you now were your friends to be ever so favorable and wish for their sakes more than for your own that they would still relent and then say you are very ill  you must drop your pen  and ask excuse for your crooked writing and take as it were a last farewell of miss how adieu my dear adieu are your words  o my child my child said your mamma weeping and clasping her hands  dear madam said your brother be so good as to think you have more children than this ungrateful one  yet your sister seemed affected  your uncle harlowe wiping his eyes o cousin said he if one thought the poor girl was really so ill   she must said your uncle antony this is written to her private friend god forbid she should be quite lost  your uncle harlowe wished they did not carry their resentments too far  i begged for gods sake wringing my hands and with a bended knee that they would permit me to go up to you engaging to give them a faithful account of the way you were in but i was chidden by your brother and this occasioned some angry words between him and mr morden  i believe sir i believe madam said your sister to her father and mother we need not trouble my cousin to read any more it does but grieve and disturb you my sister clary seems to be ill i think if mrs norton were permitted to go up to her it would be right wickedly as she has acted if she be truly penitent   here she stopped and every one being silent i stood up once more and besought them to let me go and then i offered to read a passage or two in your letter to me of the   th but i was taken up again by your brother and this occasioned still higher words between the colonel and him  your mamma hoping to gain upon your inflexible brother and to divert the anger of the two gentlemen from each other proposed that the colonel should proceed in reading the minutes he had taken from your letter  he accordingly read of your resuming your pen that you thought you had taken your last farewell and the rest of that very affecting passage in which you are obliged to break off more than once and afterward to take an airing in a chair your brother and sister were affected at this and he had recourse to his snuff box and where you comfort miss how and say you shall be happy it is more said he than she will let anybody else be  your sister called you sweet soul but with a low voice then grew hardhearted again yet said nobody could help being affected by your pathetic grief  but that it was your talent  the colonel then went on to the good effect your airing had upon you to your good wishes to miss how and mr hickman and to your concluding sentence that when the happy life you wish her comes to be wound up she may be as calm and as easy at quitting it as you hope in god you shall be your mamma could not stand this but retired to a corner of the room and sobbd and wept your father for a few minutes could not speak though he seemed inclined to say something  your uncles were also both affected  but your brother went round to each and again reminded your mamma that she had other children what was there he said in what was read but the result of the talent you had of moving the passions and he blamed them for choosing to hear read what they knew their abused indulgence could not be proof against  this set mr morden up again fie upon you cousin harlowe said he  i see plainly to whom it is owing that all relationship and ties of blood with regard to this sweet sufferer are laid aside such rigors as these make it difficult for a sliding virtue ever to recover itself  your brother pretended the honor of the family and declared that no child ought to be forgiven who abandoned the most indulgent of parents against warning against the light of knowledge as you had done  but sir and ladies said i rising from my seat in the window and humbly turning round to each if i may be permitted to speak my dear miss asks only for a blessing she begs not to be received to favor she is very ill and asks only for a last blessing  come come goody norton i need not tell you who said this you are up again with your lamentables  a good woman as you are to forgive so readily a crime that has been as disgraceful to your part in her education as to her family is a weakness that would induce one to suspect your virtue if you were to be encountered by a temptation properly adapted  by some such charitable logic as this said mr morden is my cousin arabella captivated i doubt not if to be uncharitable and unforgiving is to give a proof of virtue you mr james harlowe are the most virtuous young man in the world  i knew how it would be replied your brother in a passion if i met mr morden upon this business i would have declined it but you sir to his father would not permit me so to do but sir turning to the colonel in no other presence   then cousin james interrupted the other gentleman that which is your protection it seems is mine i am not used to bear defiances thus  you are my cousin sir  and the son and nephew of persons as dear as near to me  there he paused   are we said your father to be made still more unhappy among ourselves when the villain lives that ought to be the object of everyones resentment who has either a value for the family or for this ungrateful girl  that is the man said your cousin whom last monday as you know i went purposely to make the object of mine but what could i say when i found him so willing to repair his crime  and i give it as my opinion and have written accordingly to my poor cousin that it is best for all round that his offer should be accepted and let me tell you   tell me nothing said your father quite enraged of that very vile fellow i have a riveted hatred to him i would rather see the rebel die a hundred deaths were it possible than that she should give such a villain as him a relation to my family  well but there is no room to think said your mamma that she will give us such a relation my dear the poor girl will lessen i fear the number of our relations not increase it if she be so ill as we are told she is let us send mrs norton up to her  that is the least we can do  let us take her however out of the hands of that belford  both your uncles supported this motion the latter part of it especially  your brother observed in his illnatured way what a fine piece of consistency it was in you to refuse the vile injurer and the amends he offered yet to throw yourself upon the protection of his fast friend  miss harlowe was apprehensive she said that you would leave all you could leave to that pert creature miss how so she called her if you should die  o do not do not suppose that my bella said your poor mother i cannot think of parting with my clary  with all her faults she is my child  her reasons for her conduct are not heard it would break my heart to lose her  i think my dear to your papa none so fit as i if you will give me leave to go up and mrs norton shall accompany me  this was a sweet motion and your father paused upon it mr morden offered his service to escort her your uncles seemed to approve of it but your brother dashed all i hope sir said he to his father i hope madam to his mother that you will not endeavor to recover a faulty daughter by losing an unculpable son i do declare that if ever my sister clary darkens these doors again i never will i will set out madam the same hour you go to london on such an errand to edinburgh and there i will reside and try to forget that i have relations in england so near and so dear as you are now all to me  good god said the colonel what a declaration is this  and suppose sir and suppose madam turning to your father and mother this should be the case whether is it better think you that you should lose for ever such a daughter as my cousin clary or that your son should go to edinburgh and reside there upon an estate which will be the better for his residence upon it   your brothers passionate behavior hereupon is hardly to be described he resented it as promoting an alienation of the affection of the family to him and to such a height were resentments carried everyone siding with him that the colonel with hands and eyes lifted up cried out what hearts of flint am i related to  o cousin harlowe to your father are you resolved to have but one daughter are you madam to be taught by a son who has no bowels to forget that you are a mother  the colonel turned from them to draw out his handkerchief and could not for a minute speak the eyes of everyone but the hardhearted brother caught tears from his  but then turning to them with the more indignation as it seemed as he had been obliged to show a humanity which however no brave heart should be ashamed of i leave ye all said he fit company for one another i will never open my lips to any of you more upon this subject i will instantly make my will and in me shall the dear creature have the father uncle brother she has lost i will prevail upon her to take the tour of france and italy with me nor shall she return till ye know the value of such a daughter  and saying this he hurried out of the room went into the courtyard and ordered his horse  mr antony harlowe went to him there just as he was mounting and said he hoped he should find him cooler in the evening for he till then had lodged at his house and that then they would converse calmly and everyone mean time would weigh all matters well  but the angry gentleman said cousin harlowe i shall endeavor to discharge the obligations i owe to your civility since i have been in england but i have been so treated by that hotheaded young man who as far as i know has done more to ruin his sister than lovelace himself and this with the approbation of you all that i will not again enter into your doors or theirs my servants shall have orders whither to bring what belongs to me from your house i will see my dear cousin clary as soon as i can and so god bless you all together only this one word to your nephew if you please that he wants to be taught the difference between courage and bluster and it is happy for him perhaps that i am his kinsman though i am sorry he is mine  i wondered to hear your uncle on his return to them all repeat this because of the consequences it may be attended with though i hope it will not have bad ones  yet it was considered as a sort of challenge and so it confirmed everybody in your brothers favor and miss harlowe forgot not to inveigh against that error which had brought on all these evils  i took the liberty again but with fear and trembling to desire leave to attend you  before any other person could answer your brother said he supposed i looked upon myself to be my own mistress did i want their consents and courtship to go up if he might speak his mind we were fittest to be together  yet he wished i would not trouble my head about their familymatters till i was desired so to do  but dont you know brother said miss harlowe that the error of any branch of a family splits that family all in pieces and makes not only every common friend and acquaintance but even servants judges over both  this is one of the blessed effects of my sister clarys fault  there never was a creature so criminal said your father looking with displeasure at me who had not some weak heads to pity and side with her  i wept your mamma was so good as to take me by the hand come good woman said she come along with me you have too much reason to be afflicted at what afflicts us to want additions to your grief  but my dearest young lady i was more touched for your sake than for my own for i have been low in the world for a great number of years and of consequence must have been accustomed to snubs and rebuffs from the affluent but i hope that patience is written as legibly on my forehead as haughtiness on that of any of my obligers  your mamma led me to her chamber and there we sat and wept together for several minutes without being able to speak either of us one word to the other at last she broke silence asking me if you were really and indeed so ill as it was said you were  i answered in the affirmative and would have shown her your last letter but she declined seeing it  i would fain have procured from her the favor of a line to you with her blessing i asked what was intended by your brother and sister would nothing satisfy them but your final reprobation  i insinuated how easy it would be did not your duty and humility govern you to make yourself independent as to circumstances but that nothing but a blessing a last blessing was requested by you and many other things i urged in your behalf the following brief repetition of what she was pleased to say in answer to my pleas will give you a notion of it all and of the present situation of things  she said she was very unhappy she had lost the little authority she once had over her other children through one childs failing and all influence over mr harlowe and his brothers your father she said had besought her to leave it to him to take his own methods with you and as she valued him to take no step in your favor unknown to him and your uncles yet she owned that they were too much governed by your brother they would however give way in time she knew to a reconciliation they designed no other for they all still loved you  your brother and sister she owned were very jealous of your coming into favor again yet could but mr morden have kept his temper and stood her sons first sallies who had carried his resentment so high having always had the family grandeur in view that he knew not how to descend the conferences so abruptly broken off just now would have ended more happily for that she had reason to think that a few concessions on your part with regard to your grandfathers estate and your cousins engaging for your submission as from proper motives would have softened them all  mr brands account of your intimacy with the friend of the obnoxious man she said had for the time very unhappy effects for she had before that gained some ground but afterward dared not nor indeed had inclination to open her lips in your behalf your continued intimacy with that mr belford was wholly unaccountable accountable and as wholly inexcuseable  what made the wished for reconciliation she said more difficult was first that you yourself acknowleged yourself dishonored and it was too well known that it was your own fault that you ever were in the power of so great a profligate of consequence that their and your disgrace could not be greater than it was yet that you refused to prosecute the wretch next that the pardon and blessing hoped for must probably be attended with your marriage to the man they hate and who hates them as much very disagreeable circumstances she said i must allow to found a reconciliation upon  as to her own part she must needs say that if there were any hope that mr lovelace would become a reformed man the letter her cousin morden had read to them from him to you and the justice as she hoped it was he did your character though to his own condemnation his family and fortunes being unexceptionable and all his relations earnest to be related to you were arguments that would have weight with her could they have any with your father and uncles  to my plea of your illness she could not but flatter herself she answered that it was from lowness of spirits and temporary dejection a young creature she said so very considerate as you naturally were and fallen so low must have enough of that should they lose you which god forbid the scene would then indeed be sadly changed for then those who now most resented would be most grieved all your fine qualities would rise to their remembrance and your unhappy error would be quite forgotten  she wished you would put yourself into your cousins protection entirely and have nothing more to say to mr belford  and i would recommend it to your most serious consideration my dear miss clary whether now as your cousin who is your trustee for your grandfathers estate is come you should not give over all thoughts of mr lovelaces intimate friend for your executor more especially as that gentlemans interfering in the concerns of your family should the sad event take place which my heart aches but to think of might be attended with those consequences which you are so desirous in other cases to obviate and prevent and suppose my dear young lady you were to write one letter more to each of your uncles to let them know how ill you are  and to a their advice and offer to be governed by it in relation to the disposition of your estate and effects  i find they will send you up a large part of what has been received from that estate since it was yours together with your current cash which you left behind you and this by your cousin morden for fear you should have contracted debts which may make you uneasy  they seem to expect that you will wish to live at your grandfathers house in a private manner if your cousin prevail not upon you to go abroad for a year or two   friday morning betty was with me just now she tells me that your cousin morden is so much displeased with them all that he has refused to lodge any more at your uncle antonys and has even taken up with inconvenient lodgings till he is provided with others to his mind this very much concerns them and they repent their violent treatment of him and the more as he is resolved he says to make you his heir general and his full and whole executrix  what noble fortunes still my dearest young lady await you i am thoroughly convinced if it please god to preserve your life and your health that everybody will soon be reconciled to you and that you will see many happy days  your mamma wished me not to attend you as yet because she hopes that i may give myself that pleasure soon with everybodys good liking and even at their desire your cousin mordens reconciliation with them which they are very desirous of i am ready to hope will include theirs with you  but if that should happen which i so much dread and i not with you i should never forgive myself let me therefore my dearest young lady desire you to command my attendance if you find any danger and if you wish me peace of mind and no consideration shall withold me  i hear that miss how has obtained leave from her mother to see you and intends next week to go to town for that purpose and as it is believed to buy clothes for her approaching nuptials  mr hickmans motherinlaw is lately dead her jointure of  00 l a year is fallen in to him and she has moreover as an acknowlegement of his good behavior to her left him all she was worth which was very considerable a few legacies excepted to her own relations  these good men are uniformly good indeed could not else be good and never fare the worse for being so all the world agrees he will make that fine young lady an excellent husband and i am sorry they are not as much agreed in her making him an excellent wife but i hope a lady of her principles would not encourage his address if whether she at present loves him or not she thought she could not love him or if she preferred any other man to him  mr pocock undertakes to deliver this but fears it will be saturday night first if not sunday morning  may the almighty protect and bless you i long to see you  my dearest young lady i long to see you and to fold you once more to my fond heart i dare to say happy days are coming be but cheerful give way to hope  whether for this world or the other you must be happy wish to live however were it only because you are so well fitted in mind to make everyone happy who has the honor to know you what signifies this transitory eclipse you are as near perfection by all i have heard as any creature in this world can be for here is your glory you are brightened and purified as i may say by your sufferings  how i long to hear your whole sad yet instructive story from your own lips  for miss howes sake who in her new engagements will so much want you for your cousin mordens sake for your mothers sake if i must go no further in your family and yet i can say for all their sakes and for my sake my dearest young lady let your resumed and accustomed magnanimity bear you up you have many things to do which i know not the person who will do if you leave us  join your prayers then to mine that god will spare you to a world that wants you and your example and although your days may seem to have been numbered who knows but that with the good king hezekiah you may have them prolonged which god grant if it be his blessed will to the prayers of  your judith norton   letter xli mr belford to robert lovelace esquire monday sept   the lady would not read the letter she had from mrs norton till she had received the communion for fear it should contain anything that might disturb that happy calm which she had been endeavoring to obtain for it and when that solemn office was over she was so composed she said that she thought she could receive any news however affecting with tranquillity  nevertheless in reading it she was forced to leave off several times through weakness and a dimness in her sight of which she complained if i may say complained for so easy and soft were her complaints that they could hardly be called such  she was very much affected at diverse parts of this letter she wept several times and sighed often mrs lovick told me that these were the gentle exclamations she broke out into as she read  her unkind her cruel brother  how unsisterly  poor dear woman seeming to speak of mrs norton her kind cousin  o these flaming spirits  and then reflecting upon herself more than once  what a deep error is mine  what evils have i been the occasion of   when i was admitted to her presence i have received said she a long and not very pleasing letter from my dear mrs norton it will soon be in your hands i am advised against appointing you to the office you have so kindly accepted but you must resent nothing of these things my choice will have an odd appearance to them but it is now too late to alter it if i would  i would fain write an answer to it continued she but i have no distinct sight mr belford no steadiness of fingers  this mistiness however will perhaps be gone byandby  then turning to mrs lovick i dont think i am dying yet  not actually dying mrs lovick  for i have no bodily pain  no numbnesses no signs of immediate death i think  and my breath which used of late to be so short is now tolerable  my head clear my intellects free  i think i cannot be dying yet  i shall have agonies i doubt  life will not give up so blessedly easy i fear  yet how merciful is the almighty to give his poor creature such a sweet serenity  it is what i have prayed for  what encouragement mrs lovick so near ones dissolution to have it to hope that ones prayers are answered  mrs smith as well as mrs lovick was with her they were both in tears nor had i any more than they power to say a word in answer yet she spoke all this as well as what follows with a surprising composure of mind and countenance  but mr belford said she assuming a still sprightlier air and accent let me talk a little to you while i am thus able to say what i have to say  mrs lovick dont leave us for the women were rising to go  pray sit down and do you mrs smith sit down too  dame shelbourne take this key and open that upper drawer i will move to it  she did with trembling knees here mr belford is my will it is witnessed by three persons of mr smiths acquaintance  i dare to hope that my cousin morden will give you assistance if you request it of him my cousin morden continues his affection for me but as i have not seen him i leave all the trouble upon you mr belford this deed may want forms and it does no doubt but the less as i have my grandfathers will almost by heart and have often enough heard that canvassed i will lay it by itself in this corner putting it at the further end of the drawer  she then took up a parcel of letters enclosed in one cover sealed with three seals of black wax this said she i sealed up last night the cover sir will let you know what is to be done with what it incloses this is the superscription holding it close to her eyes and rubbing them as soon as i am certainly dead this to be broke open by mr belford  here sir i put it placing it by the will  these folded papers are letters and copies of letters disposed according to their dates miss how will do with those as you and she shall think fit if i receive any more or more come when i cannot receive them they may be put into this drawer pulling out and pushing in the lookingglass drawer youll be so kind as to observe that mrs lovick and dame shelburne to be given to mr belford be they from whom they will  here sir proceeded she i put the keys of my apparel putting them into the drawers with her papers all is in order and the inventory upon them and an account of what i have disposed of so that nobody need to ask mrs smith any questions  there will be no immediate need to open or inspect the trunks which contain my wearing apparel mrs norton will open them or order somebody to do it for her in your presence mrs lovick for so i have directed in my will they may be sealed up now i shall never more have occasion to open them  she then though i expostulated to the contrary caused me to seal them up with my seal  after this she locked the drawer where were her papers first taking out her book of meditations as she called it saying she should perhaps have use for that and then desired me to take the key of that drawer for she should have no further occasion for that neither  all this in so composed and cheerful a manner that we were equally surprised and affected with it  you can witness for me mrs smith and so can you mrs lovick proceeded she if any one ask after my life and conversation since you have known me that i have been very orderly have kept good hours and never have lain out of your house but when i was in prison and then you know i could not help it  o lovelace that thou had heard her or seen her unknown to herself on this occasion  not one of us could speak a word  i shall leave the world in perfect charity proceeded she and turning toward the women dont be so much concerned for me my good friends this is all but needful preparation and i shall be very happy  then again rubbing her eyes which she said were misty and looking more intently round upon each particularly on me  god bless you all said she how kindly are you concerned for me  who says i am friendless who says i am abandoned and among strangers  good mr belford dont be so generously humane  indeed putting her handkerchief to her charming eyes you will make me less happy than i am sure you wish me to be  while we were thus solemnly engaged a servant came with a letter from her cousin morden  then said she he is not come himself  she broke it open but every line she said appeared two to her so that being unable to read it herself she desired i would read it to her i did so and wished it were more consolatory to her but she was all patient attention tears however often trickling down her cheeks by the date it was written yesterday and this is the substance of it  he tells her that the thursday before he had procured a general meeting of her principal relations at her fathers though not without difficulty her haughty brother opposing it and when met rendering all his endeavors to reconcile them to her ineffectual he censures him as the most ungovernable young man he ever knew some great sickness he says some heavy misfortune is wanted to bring him to a knowledge of himself and of what is due from him to others and he wishes that he were not her brother and his cousin nor does he spare her father and uncles for being so implicitly led by him  he tells her that he parted with them all in high displeasure and thought never more to darken any of their doors that he declared as much to her two uncles who came to him on saturday to try to accommodate with him and who found him preparing to go to london to attend her and that notwithstanding their pressing entreaties he determined so to do and not to go with them to harloweplace or to either of their own houses and accordingly dismissed them with such an answer  but that her noble letter as he calls it of aug    see letter xxix p     being brought him about an hour after their departure he thought it might affect them as much as it did him and give them the exalted opinion of her virtue and honor which was so well deserved and at the same time convince them of what they made such difficulty to believe to wit that you and all your relations were sollicitous to obtain the honor of her alliance on her own terms and that this induced him to turn his horses head back to her uncle antonys instead of forward toward london  that accordingly arriving there and finding her two uncles together he read to them the affecting letter which left neither of the three a dry eye that the absent as is usual in such cases bearing all the load they accused her brother and sister and besought him to put off his journey to town till he could carry with him the blessings which she had formerly in vain solicited for and as they hoped the happy tidings of a general reconciliation  that not doubting but his visit would be the more welcome to her if these good ends could be obtained he the more readily complied with their desires but not being willing to subject himself to the possibility of receiving fresh insults from her brother he had given her uncles a copy of her letter for the family to assemble upon and desired to know as soon as possible the result of their deliberations  he tells her that he shall bring her up the accounts relating to the produce of her grandfathers estate and adjust them with her having actually in his hands the arrears due to her from it  he highly applauds the noble manner in which she resents your usage of her it is impossible he owns that you can either deserve her or to be forgiven but as you do justice to her virtue and offer to make her all the reparation now in your power and as she is so very earnest with him not to resent that usage and declares that you could not have been the author of her calamities but through a strange concurrence of unhappy causes and as he is not at a loss to know how to place to a proper account that strange concurrence he desires her not to be apprehensive of any vindictive measures from him  nevertheless as may be expected he inveighs against you as he finds that she gave you no advantage over her but he forbears to enter further into this subject he says till he has the honor to see her and the rather as she seems so much determined against you however he cannot but say that he thinks you a gallant man and a man of sense and that you have the reputation of being thought a generous man in every instance but where the sex is concerned in such he owns that you have taken inexcusable liberties and he is sorry to say that there are very few young men of fortune but who allow themselves in the same both sexes he observes too much love to have each other in their power yet he hardly ever knew man or woman who was very fond of power make a right use of it  if she be so absolutely determined against marrying you as she declares she is he hopes he says to prevail upon her to take as soon as her health will permit a little tour abroad with him as what will probably establish it since traveling is certainly the best physic for all those disorders which owe their rise to grief and disappointment an absence of two or three years will endear her to every one on her return and everyone to her  he expresses his impatience to see her he will set out he says the moment he knows the result of her familys determination which he doubts not will be favorable nor will he wait long for that  when i had read the letter through to the languishing lady and so my friends said she have i heard of a patient who actually died while five or six principal physicians were in a consultation and not agreed upon what name to give to his distemper the patient was an emperor the emperor joseph i think  i asked if i should write to her cousin as he knew not how ill she was to hasten up  by no means she said since if he were not already set out she was persuaded that she should be so low by the time he could receive my letter and come that his presence would but discompose and hurry her and afflict him  i hope however she is not so very near her end and without saying any more to her when i retired i wrote to colonel morden that if he expects to see his beloved cousin alive he must lose no time in setting out i sent this letter by his own servant  dr h sent away his letter to her father by a particular hand this morning  mrs walton the milaner has also just now acquainted mrs smith that her husband had a letter brought by a special messenger from parson brand within this halfhour enclosing the copy of one he had written to mr john harlowe recanting his officious one  and as all these and the copy of the ladys letter to col morden will be with them pretty much at a time the devils in the family if they are not struck with a remorse that shall burst open the doublebarred doors of their hearts  will engages to reach you with this late as it will be before you go to rest he begs that i will testify for him the hour and the minute i shall give it him it is just half an hour after ten  i pretend to be now by use the swiftest shorthand writer in england next to yourself but were matter to arise every hour to write upon and i had nothing else to do i cannot write so fast as you expect and let it be remembered that your servants cannot bring letters or messages before they are written or sent  j belford  letter xlii dr h to james harlowe senior esquire london sept   sir if i may judge of the hearts of other parents by my own i cannot doubt but you will take it well to be informed that you have yet an opportunity to save yourself and family great future regret by dispatching hither some one of it with your last blessing and your ladys to the most excellent of her sex  i have some reason to believe sir that she has been represented to you in a very different light from the true one and this it is that induces me to acquaint you that i think her on the best grounds absolutely irreproachable in all her conduct which has passed under my eye or come to my ear and that her very misfortunes are made glorious to her and honorable to all that are related to her by the use she has made of them and by the patience and resignation with which she supports herself in a painful lingering and dispiriting decay and by the greatness of mind with which she views her approaching dissolution and all this from proper motives from motives in which a dying saint might glory  she knows not that i write i must indeed acknowledge that i offered to do so some days ago and that very pressingly nor did she refuse me from obstinacy  she seems not to know what that is  but desired me to forbear for two days only in hopes that her newlyarrived cousin who as she heard was soliciting for her would be able to succeed in her favor  i hope i shall not be thought an officious man on this occasion but if i am i cannot help it being driven to write by a kind of parental and irresistible impulse  but sir whatever you do or permit to be done must be speedily done for she cannot i verily think live a week and how long of that short space she may enjoy her admirable intellects to take comfort in the favors you may think proper to confer upon her cannot be said i am sir  your most humble servant rh  letter xliii mr belford to william morden esquire london sept   sir the urgency of the case and the opportunity by your servant will sufficiently apologize for this trouble from a stranger to your person who however is not a stranger to your merit  i understand you are employing your good offices with miss clarissa harlowes parents and other relations to reconcile them to the most meritorious daughter and kinswoman that ever family had to boast of  generously as this is intended by you we here have too much reason to think all your solicitudes on this head will be unnecessary for it is the opinion of every one who has the honor of being admitted to her presence that she cannot live over three days so that if you wish to see her alive you must lose no time to come up  she knows not that i write i had done it sooner if i had had the least doubt that before now she would not have received from you some news of the happy effects of your kind mediation in her behalf i am sir  your most humble servant j belford  letter xliv mr lovelace to john belford esquire in answer to letter xli p      uxbridge tuesday morn between   and   and can it be that this admirable creature will so soon leave this cursed world for cursed i shall think it and more cursed myself when she is gone o jack thou who can sit so cool and like addisons angel direct and even enjoy the storm that tears up my happiness by the roots blame me not for my impatience however unreasonable if thou knew that already i feel the torments of the damned in the remorse that wrings my heart on looking back upon my past actions by her thou would not be the devil thou art to halloo on a worrying conscience which without thy merciless aggravations is altogether intolerable  i know not what i write nor what i would write when the company that used to delight me is as uneasy to me as my reflections are painful and i can neither help nor divert myself must not every servant about me partake in a perturbation so sincere  shall i give thee a faint picture of the horrible uneasiness with which my mind struggles and faint indeed it must be for nothing but outrageous madness can exceed it and that only in the apprehension of others since as to the sufferer it is certain that actual distraction take it out of its lucid intervals must be an infinitely more happy state than the suspense and anxieties that bring it on  forbidden to attend the dear creature yet longing to see her i would give the world to be admitted once more to her beloved presence i ride toward london three or four times a day resolving pro and con twenty times in two or three miles and at last ride back and in view of uxbridge loathing even the kind friend and hospitable house turn my horses head again toward the town and resolve to gratify my humor let her take it as she will but at the very entrance of it after infinite canvasings once more alter my mind dreading to offend and shock her lest by that means i should curtail a life so precious  yesterday in particular to give you an idea of the strength of that impatience which i cannot avoid suffering to break out upon my servants i had no sooner dispatched will than i took horse to meet him on his return  in order to give him time i loiterd about on the road riding up this lane to the one highway down that to the other just as my horse pointed all the way cursing my very being and though so lately looking down upon all the world wishing to change conditions with the poorest beggar that cried to me for charity as i rode by him  and throwing him money in hopes to obtain by his prayers the blessing my heart pants after  after i had saunteredabout an hour or two which seemed three or four tedious ones fearing i had slipped the fellow i inquired at every turnpike whether a servant in such a livery had not passed through in his return from london on a full gallop for woe had been to the dog had i met him on a sluggish trot and lest i should miss him at one end of kensington as he might take either the acton or hamersmith road or at the other as he might come through the park or not how many score times did i ride backwards and forwards from the palace to the gore making myself the subject of observation to all passengers whether on horseback or on foot who no doubt wondered to see a welldressed and wellmounted man sometimes ambling sometimes prancing as the beast had more fire than his master backwards and forwards in so short a compass  yet all this time though longing to espy the fellow did i dread to meet him lest he should be charged with fatal tidings  when at distance i saw any man galloping toward me my resemblanceforming fancy immediately made it to be him and then my heart bounded to my mouth as if it would have choked me but when the persons nearer approach undeceived me how did i curse the varlets delay and thee by turns and how ready was i to draw my pistol at the stranger for having the impudence to gallop which none but my messenger i thought had either right or reason to do for all the business of the world i am ready to imagine should stand still on an occasion so melancholy and so interesting to myself nay for this week past i could cut the throat of any man or woman i see laugh while i am in such dejection of mind  i am now convinced that the wretches who fly from a heavy scene labor under ten times more distress in the intermediate suspense and apprehension than they can do who are present at it and see and know the worst so much greater are the evils we dread than those we see  and so able is fancy or imagination the more immediate offspring of the soul to outdo fact let the subject be either joyous or grievous  and hence as i conceive it is that all pleasures are greater in the expectation or in the reflection than in fruition as all pains which press heavy upon both parts of that unequal union by which frail mortality holds its precarious tenure generally are most acute in the present tense for how easy sit upon the reflection the heaviest misfortunes especially when surmounted  but most easy i confess those in which body has more concern than soul this however is a point of philosophy i have neither time nor head just now to weigh so take it as it falls from a madmans pen  woe be to either of the wretches who shall bring me the fatal news that she is no more for it is but too likely that a shriekowl so hated will never whoot or scream again unless the shock that will probably disorder my whole frame on so sad an occasion by unsteadying my hand shall divert my aim from his head heart or bowels if it turn not against my own  but surely she will not she cannot yet die such a matchless excellence  whose mind contains a world and seems for all things framed could not be lent to be so soon demanded back again  but may it not be that thou belford art in a plot with the dear creature who will not let me attend her to convince myself in order to work up my soul to the deepest remorse and penitence and that when she is convinced of the sincerity of both and when my mind is made such wax as to be fit to take what impression she pleases to give it she will then raise me up with the joyful tidings of her returning health and acceptance of me  what would i give to have it so and when the happiness of hundreds as well as the peace and reconciliation of several eminent families depend upon her restoration and happiness why should it not be so  but let me presume it will let me indulge my former hope however improbable  i will and enjoy it too and let me tell thee how ecstatic my delight would be on the unravelling of such a plot as this  do dear belford let it be so  and o my dearest and everdear clarissa keep me no longer in this cruel suspense in which i suffer a thousand times more than ever i made thee suffer nor fear thou that i will resent or recede on an eclaircissement so desirable for i will adore thee for ever and without reproaching thee for the pangs thou have tortured me with confess thee as much my superior in noble and generous contrivances as thou art in virtue and honor  but once more  should the worst happen  say not what that worst is  and i am gone from this hated island  gone for ever  and may eternal  but i am crazed already  and will therefore conclude myself  thine more than my own and no great compliment neither r l  letter xlv mr belford to robert lovelace esquire tuesday   sept   in the morn at mr smiths when i read yours of this morning i could not help pitying you for the account you give of the dreadful anxiety and suspense you labor under i wish from my heart all were to end as you are so willing to hope but it will not be and your suspense if the worst part of your torment as you say it is will soon be over but alas in a way you wish not  i attended the lady just now she is extremely ill yet is she aiming at an answer to her mrs nortons letter which she began yesterday in her own chamber and has written a good deal but in a hand not like her own fine one as mrs lovick tells me but much larger and the lines crooked  i have accepted of the offer of a room adjoining to the widow lovicks till i see how matters go but unknown to the lady and i shall go home every night for a few hours  i would not lose a sentence that i could gain from lips so instructive nor the opportunity of receiving any command from her for an estate  in this my new apartment i now write and shall continue to write as occasions offer that i may be the more circumstantial but i depend upon the return of my letters or copies of them on demand that i may have together all that relates to this affecting story which i shall reperuse with melancholy pleasure to the end of my life  i think i will send thee brands letter to mr john harlowe recanting his base surmizes it is a matchless piece of pedantry and may perhaps a little divert thy deep chagrin some time hence at least it may if not now  what wretched creatures are there in the world what strangely mixed characters  so sensible and so foolish at the same time what a various what a foolish creature is man    three oclock the lady has just finished her letter and has entertained mrs lovick mrs smith and me with a noble discourse on the vanity and brevity of life which i cannot do justice to in the repetition and indeed i am so grieved for her that ill as she is my intellects are not half so clear as hers  a few things which made the strongest impression upon me as well from the sentiments themselves as from her manner of uttering them i remember she introduced them thus  i am thinking said she what a gradual and happy death god almighty blessed be his name affords me who would have thought that suffering what i have suffered and abandoned as i have been with such a tender education as i have had i should be so long a dying  but see how by little and little it has come to this i was first taken off from the power of walking then i took a coach  a coach grew too violent an exercise then i took a chair  the prison was a large deathstride upon me  i should have suffered longer else  next i was unable to go to church then to go up or down stairs now hardly can move from one room to another and a less room will soon hold me  my eyes begin to fail me so that at times i cannot see to read distinctly and now i can hardly write or hold a pen  next i presume i shall know nobody nor be able to thank any of you i therefore now once more thank you mrs lovick and you mrs smith and you mr belford while i can thank you for all your kindness to me and thus by little and little in such a gradual sensible death as i am blessed with god dies away in us as i may say all human satisfactions in order to subdue his poor creatures to himself  thou may guess how affected we all were at this moving account of her progressive weakness we heard it with wet eyes for what with the womens example and what with her moving eloquence i could no more help it than they but we were silent nevertheless and she went on applying herself to me  o mr belford this is a poor transitory life in its best enjoyments we flutter about here and there with all our vanities about us like painted butterflies for a gay but a very short season till at last we lay ourselves down in a quiescent state and turn into vile worms and who knows in what form or to what condition we shall rise again  i wish you would permit me a young creature just turned of nineteen years of age blooming and healthy as i was a few months ago now nipt by the cold hand of death to influence you in these my last hours to a life of regularity and repentance for any past evils you may have been guilty of for believe me sir that now in this last stage very few things will bear the test or be passed as laudable if pardonable at our own ear much less at a more tremendous one in all we have done or delighted in even in a life not very offensive neither as we may think  ought we not then to study in our full day before the dark hours approach so to live as may afford reflections that will soften the agony of the last moments when they come and let in upon the departing soul a ray of divine mercy to illuminate its passage into an awful eternity  she was ready to faint and choosing to lie down i withdrew i need not say with a melancholy heart and when i was got to my newtaken apartment my heart was still more affected by the sight of the solemn letter the admirable lady had so lately finished it was communicated to me by mrs lovick who had it to copy for me but it was not to be delivered to me till after her departure however i trespassed so far as to prevail upon the widow to let me take a copy of it which i did directly in character  i send it enclosed if thou can read it and thy heart not bleed at thy eyes thy remorse can hardly be so deep as thou have inclined me to think it is   letter xlvi miss clarissa harlowe to mrs norton in answer to letter xl p     begun on monday sept   and by piecemeal finished on tuesday but not sent till the thursday following   my dearest mrs norton i am afraid i shall not be able to write all that is upon my mind to say to you upon the subject of your last yet i will try  as to my friends and as to the sad breakfasting i cannot help being afflicted for them what alas has not my mother in particular suffered by my rashness  yet to allow so much for a son  so little for a daughter  but all now will soon be over as to me i hope they will bury all their resentments in my grave  as to your advice in relation to mr belford let me only say that the unhappy reprobation i have met with and my short time must be my apology now  i wish i could have written to my mother and my uncles as you advise and yet favors come so slowly from them   the granting of one request only now remains as a desirable from them which nevertheless when granted i shall not be sensible of it is that they will be pleased to permit my remains to be laid with those of my ancestors  placed at the feet of my dear grandfather as i have mentioned in my will this however as they please for after all this vile body ought not so much to engage my cares it is a weakness  but let it be called a natural weakness and i shall be excused especially when a reverential gratitude shall be known to be the foundation of it you know my dear woman how my grandfather loved me and you know how much i honored him and that from my very infancy to the hour of his death how often since have i wished that he had not loved me so well  i wish not now at the writing of this to see even my cousin morden o my blessed woman my dear maternal friend i am entering upon a better tour than to france or italy either  or even than to settle at my once beloved dairyhouse  all these prospects and pleasures which used to be so agreeable to me in health how poor seem they to me now   indeed indeed my dear mamma norton i shall be happy i know i shall  i have charming forebodings of happiness already  tell all my dear friends for their comfort that i shall  who would not bear the punishments i have borne to have the prospects and assurances i rejoice in  assurances i might not have had were all my own wishes to have been granted me  neither do i want to see even you my dear mrs norton nevertheless i must in justice to my own gratitude declare that there was a time that your presence and comfortings would have been balm to my wounded mind could you have been permitted to come without incurring displeasure from those whose esteem it is necessary for you to cultivate and preserve but were you now even by consent and with reconciliatory tidings to come it would but add to your grief and the sight of one i so dearly love so happily fraught with good news might but draw me back to wishes i have had great struggles to get above and let me tell you for your comfort that i have not left undone anything that ought to be done either respecting mind or person no not to the minutest preparation so that nothing is left for you to do for me every one has her direction as to the last offices  and my desk that i now write upon  o my dearest mrs norton all is provided  all is ready and all will be as decent as it should be  and pray let my miss how know that by the time you will receive this and she your signification of the contents of it it will in all probability be too late for her to do me the inestimable favor as i should once have thought it to see me god will have no rivals in the hearts of those he sanctifies by various methods he deadens all other sensations or rather absorbs them all in the love of him  i shall nevertheless love you my mamma norton and my miss how whose love to me has passed the love of women to my latest hour  but yet i am now above the quick sense of those pleasures which once most delighted me and once more i say that i do not wish to see objects so dear to me which might bring me back again into sense and rival my supreme love  twice have i been forced to leave off i wished that my last writing might be to you or to miss how if it might not be to my dearest ma   mamma i would have wrote  is the word distinct  my eyes are so misty  if when i apply to you i break off in halfwords do you supply them  the kindest are your due  be sure take the kindest to fill up chasms with if any chasms there be   another breaking off  but the new day seems to rise upon me with healing in its wings i have gotten i think a recruit of strength spirits i bless god i have not of late wanted  let my dearest miss how purchase her wedding garments  and may all temporal blessings attend the charming preparation  blessings will i make no question notwithstanding the little cloudinesses that mr hickman encounters with nowandthen which are but prognostics of a future golden day to him for her heart is good and her head not wrong  but great merit is coy and that coyness has not always its foundation in pride but if it should seem to be pride take off the skindeep covering and in her it is noble diffidence and a love that wants but to be assured  tell mr hickman i write this and write it as i believe with my last pen and bid him bear a little at first and forbear and all the future will be crowning gratitude and rewarding love for miss how has great sense fine judgment and exalted generosity and can such a one be ungrateful or easy under those obligations which his assiduity and obligingness when he shall be so happy as to call her his will lay her under to him  as for me never bride was so ready as i am my wedding garments are bought  and though not fine or gaudy to the sight though not adorned with jewels and set off with gold and silver for i have no beholders eyes to wish to glitter in yet will they be the easiest the happiest suit that ever bridal maiden wore  for they are such as carry with them a security against all those anxieties pains and perturbations which sometimes succeed to the most promising outsettings  and now my dear mrs norton do i wish for no other  o hasten good god if it be thy blessed will the happy moment that i am to be decked out in this allquieting garb and sustain comfort bless and protect with the allshadowing wing of thy mercy my dear parents my uncles my brother my sister my cousin morden my everdear and everkind miss how my good mrs norton and every deserving person to whom they wish well is the ardent prayer first and last of every beginning hour as the clock tells it me hours now are days nay years of  your now not sorrowing or afflicted but happy clarissa harlowe  letter xlvii mr lovelace to john belford esquire wedn morn sept   half an hour after three i am not the savage which you and my worst enemies think me my soul is too much penetrated by the contents of the letter which you enclosed in your last to say one word more to it than that my heart has bled over it from every vein  i will fly from the subject  but what other can i choose that will not be as grievous and lead into the same  i could quarrel with all the world with thee as well as the rest obliging as thou supposest thyself for writing to me hourly how daredst thou though unknown to her to presume to take an apartment under the same roof with her  i cannot bear to think that thou should be seen at all hours passing to and repassing from her apartments while i who have so much reason to call her mine and once was preferred by her to all the world am forced to keep aloof and hardly dare to enter the city where she is  if there be anything in brands letter that will divert me hasten it to me but nothing now will ever divert me will ever again give me joy or pleasure i can neither eat drink nor sleep i am sick of all the world  surely it will be better when all is over  when i know the worst the fates can do against me  yet how shall i bear that worst  o belford belford write it not to me but if it must happen get somebody else to write for i shall curse the pen the hand the head and the heart employed in communicating to me the fatal tidings but what is this saying when already i curse the whole world except her  myself most  in fine i am a most miserable being life is a burden to me i would not bear it upon these terms for one week more let what would be my lot for already is there a hell begun in my own mind never more mention to me let her or who will say it the prison  i cannot bear it  may damnation seize quick the accursed woman who could set death upon taking that large stride as the dear creature calls it  i had no hand in it but her relations her implacable relations have done the business all else would have been got over never persuade me but it would the fire of youth and the violence of passion would have pleaded for me to good purpose with an individual of a sex which loves to be addressed with passionate ardor even to tumult had it not been for that cruelty and unforgivingness which the object and the penitence considered have no example and have aggravated the heinousness of my faults  unable to rest though i went not to bed till two i dispatch this ere the day dawn  who knows what this night this dismal night may have produced  i must after my messenger i have told the varlet i will meet him perhaps at knightsbridge perhaps in piccadilly and i trust not myself with pistols not only on his account but my own for pistols are too ready a mischief  i hope thou have a letter ready for him he goes to thy lodgings first for surely thou will not presume to take thy rest in an apartment near hers if he miss thee there he flies to smiths and brings me word whether in being or not  i shall look for him through the air as i ride as well as on horseback for if the prince of it serve me as well as i have served him he will bring the dog by his ears like another habakkuk to my saddlebow with the tidings that my heart pants after  nothing but the excruciating pangs the condemned soul feels at its entrance into the eternity of the torments we are taught to fear can exceed what i now feel and have felt for almost this week past and may thou have a spice of those if thou have not a letter ready written for  thy lovelace  letter xlviii mr belford in continuation tuesday sept   six oclock the lady remains exceedingly weak and ill her intellects nevertheless continue clear and strong and her piety and patience are without example every one thinks this night will be her last what a shocking thing is that to say of such an excellence she will not however send away her letter to her norton as yet she endeavored in vain to superscribe it so desired me to do it her fingers will not hold her pen with the requisite steadiness she has i fear written and read her last   eight oclock she is somewhat better than she was the doctor has been here and thinks she will hold out yet a day or two he has ordered her as for some time past only some little cordials to take when ready to faint she seemed disappointed when he told her she might yet live two or three days and said she longed for dismission  life was not so easily extinguished she saw as some imagine  death from grief was she believed the slowest of deaths but gods will must be done  her only prayer was now for submission to it for she doubted not but by the divine goodness she should be an happy creature as soon as she could be divested of these rags of mortality  of her own accord she mentioned you which till then she had avoided to do she asked with great serenity where you were  i told her where and your motives of being so near and read to her a few lines of yours of this morning in which you mention your wishes to see her your sincere affliction and your resolution not to approach her without her consent  i would have read more but she said enough mr belford enough  poor man does his conscience begin to find him  then need not anybody to wish him a greater punishment  may it work upon him to a happy purpose  i took the liberty to say that as she was in such a frame that nothing now seemed capable of discomposing her i could wish that you might have the benefit of her exhortations which i dared to say while you were so seriously affected would have a greater force upon you than a thousand sermons and how happy you would think yourself if you could but receive her forgiveness on your knees  how can you think of such a thing mr belford said she with some emotion my composure is owing next to the divine goodness blessing my earnest supplications for it to the not seeing him yet let him know that i now again repeat that i forgive him  and may god almighty clasping her fingers and lifting up her eyes forgive him too and perfect his repentance and sanctify it to him  tell him i say so and tell him that if i could not say so with my whole heart i should be very uneasy and think that my hopes of mercy to myself were but weakly founded and that i had still in any harbored resentments some hankerings after a life which he has been the cause of shortening  the divine creature then turning aside her head  poor man said she i once could have loved him this is saying more than ever i could say of any other man out of my own family would he have permitted me to have been an humble instrument to have made him good i think i could have made him happy  but tell him not this if he be really penitent  it may too much affect him  there she paused  admirable creature  heavenly forgiver  then resuming  but pray tell him that if i could know that my death might be a means to reclaim and save him it would be an inexpressible satisfaction to me  but let me not however be made uneasy with the apprehension of seeing him i cannot bear to see him  just as she had done speaking the minister who had so often attended her sent up his name and was admitted  being apprehensive that it would be with difficulty that you could prevail upon that impetuous spirit of yours not to invade her dying hours and of the agonies into which a surprise of this nature would throw her i thought this gentlemans visit afforded a proper opportunity to renew the subject and having asked her leave acquainted him with the topic we had been upon  the good man urged that some condescensions were usually expected on these solemn occasions from pious souls like hers however satisfied with themselves for the sake of showing the world and for examplesake that all resentments against those who had most injured them were subdued and if she would vouchsafe to a heart so truly penitent as i had represented mr lovelaces to be that personal pardon which i had been pleading for there would be no room to suppose the least lurking resentment remained and it might have very happy effects upon the gentleman  i have no lurking resentment sir said she  this is not a time for resentment and you will be the readier to believe me when i can assure you looking at me that even what i have most rejoiced in the truly friendly love that has so long subsisted between my miss how and her clarissa although to my last gasp it will be the dearest to me of all that is dear in this life has already abated of its fervor has already given place to supremer fervors and shall the remembrance of mr lovelaces personal insults which i bless god never corrupted that mind which her friendship so much delighted be stronger in these hours with me than the remembrance of a love as pure as the human heart ever boasted tell therefore the world if you please and if you think what i said to you before mr belford not strong enough tell the poor man that i not only forgive him but have such earnest wishes for the good of his soul and that from considerations of its immortality that could my penitence avail for more sins than my own my last tear should fall for him by whom i die  our eyes and hands expressed for us both what our lips could not utter  say not then proceeded she nor let it be said that my resentments are unsubdued  and yet these eyes lifted up to heaven as witness to the truth of what i have said shall never if i can help it behold him more  for do ye not consider sirs how short my time is what much more important subjects i have to employ it upon and how unable i should be so weak as i am to contend even with the avowed penitence of a person in strong health governed by passions unabated and always violent  and now i hope you will never urge me more on this subject  the minister said it were pity ever to urge this plea again  you see lovelace that i did not forget the office of a friend in endeavoring to prevail upon her to give you her last forgiveness personally and i hope as she is so near her end you will not invade her in her last hours since she must be extremely discomposed at such an interview and it might make her leave the world the sooner for it  this reminds me of an expression which she used on your barbarous hunting her at smiths on her return to her lodgings and that with a serenity unexampled as mrs lovick told me considering the occasion and the trouble given her by it and her indisposition at the time he will not let me die decently said the angelic sufferer  he will not let me enter into my makers presence with the composure that is required in entering into the drawing room of an earthly prince  i cannot however forbear to wish that the heavenly creature could have prevailed upon herself in these her last hours to see you and that for my sake as well as yours for although i am determined never to be guilty of the crimes which have till within these few past weeks blackened my former life and for which at present i most heartily hate myself yet should i be less apprehensive of a relapse if wrought upon by the solemnity which such an interview must have been attended with you had become a reformed man for no devil do i fear but one in your shape  it is now eleven oclock at night the lady who retired to rest an hour ago is in a sweet slumber as mrs lovick tells me  i will close here i hope i shall find her the better for it in the morning yet alas how frail is hope how frail is life when we are apt to build so much on every shadowy relief although in such a desperate case as this sitting down to reflect we must know that it is but shadowy  i will enclose brands horrid pedantry and for once am aforehand with thy ravenous impatience  mr brands recantationletters one directed to his friend mr       the other to his patron mr john harlowe are thought to be originals in their way but as they are long and as the reader has already been let into his singular character  see vol vi p     and p     and his letter p  0  of this volume and as this collection is run into an undesirable length they are omitted     letter xlix mr lovelace to john belford esquire wedn morn sept   and is she somewhat better  blessings upon thee without number or measure let her still be better and better tell me so at least if it be not so for thou know not what a joy that poor temporary reprieve that she will hold out yet a day or two gave me  but who told this hardhearted and deathpronouncing doctor that she will hold it no longer by what warrant says he this what presumption in these parading solemn fellows of a college which will be my contempt to the latest hour of my life if this brother of it eminent as he is deemed to be cannot work an ordinary miracle in her favor or rather in mine  let me tell thee belford that already he deserves the utmost contempt for suffering this charming clock to run down so low what must be his art if it could not wind it up in a quarter of the time he has attended her when at his first visits the springs and wheels of life and motion were so good that they seemed only to want common care and oiling  i am obliged to you for endeavoring to engage her to see me twas like a friend if she had vouchsafed me that favor she should have seen at her feet the most abject adorer that ever kneeled to justly offended beauty  what she bid you and what she forbid you to tell me the latter for tender considerations that she forgives me and that could she have made me a good man she could have made me a happy one that she even loved me at such a moment to own that she once loved me never before loved any man that she prays for me that her last tear should be shed for me could she by it save a soul without her doomed to perdition  o belford belford i cannot bear it  what a dog what a devil have i been to so superlative a goodness  why does she not inveigh against me  why does she not execrate me  o the triumphant subduer ever above me  and now to leave me so infinitely below her  marry and repair at any time this wretch that i was was my plea to myself to give her a lowering sensibility to bring her down from among the stars which her beamy head was surrounded by that my wife so greatly above me might not too much despise me  this was part of my reptile envy owing to my more reptile apprehension of inferiority  yet from step to step from distress to distress to maintain her superiority and like the sun to break out upon me with the greater refulgence for the clouds that i had contrived to cast about her  and now to escape me thus  no power left me to repair her wrongs  no alleviation to my selfreproach  no dividing of blame with her   tell her o tell her belford that her prayers and wishes her superlatively generous prayers and wishes shall not be vain that i can and do repent  and long have repented  tell her of my frequent deep remorses  it was impossible that such remorse should not at last produce effectual remorses  yet she must not leave me  she must live if she would wish to have my contrition perfect  for what can despair produce   i will do everything you would have me do in the return of your letters you have infinitely obliged me by this last and by pressing for an admission for me though it succeeded not  once more how could i be such a villain to so divine a creature yet love her all the time as never man loved woman  curse upon my contriving genius curse upon my intriguing head and upon my seconding heart  to sport with the same with the honor with the life of such an angel of a woman  o my damned incredulity  that believing her to be a woman i must hope to find her a woman  on my incredulity that there could be such virtue virtue for virtues sake in the sex founded i my hope of succeeding with her  but say not jack that she must leave us yet  if she recover  and if i can but reobtain her favor then indeed will life be life to me  the world never saw such an husband as i will make i will have no will but hers she shall conduct me in all my steps she shall open and direct my prospects and turn every motion of my heart as she pleases  you tell me in your letter that at eleven oclock she had sweet rest and my servant acquaints me from mrs smith that she has had a good night what hopes does this fill me with i have given the fellow five guineas for his good news to be divided between him and his fellow servants  dear dear jack confirm this to me in thy next  for heavens sake do  tell the doctor i will make him a present of a thousand guineas if he recover her  ask if a consultation be necessary  adieu dear belford  confirm i beseech thee the hopes that now with sovereign gladness have taken possession of a heart that next to hers is  thine  letter l mr belford to robert lovelace esquire wedn morn eight oclock   sept your servant arrived here before i was stirring i sent him to smiths to inquire how the lady was and ordered him to call upon me when he came back i was pleased to hear she had had tolerable rest and as soon as i had dispatched him with the letter i had written overnight i went to attend her  i found her up and dressed in a white satin nightgown ever elegant but now more so than i had seen her for a week past her aspect serenely cheerful  she mentioned the increased dimness of her eyes and the tremor which had invaded her limbs if this be dying said she there is nothing at all shocking in it my body hardly sensible of pain my mind at ease my intellects clear and perfect as ever what a good and gracious god have i  for this is what i always prayed for  i told her it was not so serene with you  there is not the same reason for it replied she it is a choice comfort mr belford at the windingup of our short story to be able to say i have rather suffered injuries myself than offered them to others i bless god though i have been unhappy as the world deems it and once i thought more so than at present i do yet have i not wilfully made any one creature so i have no reason to grieve for anything but for the sorrow i have given my friends  but pray mr belford remember me in the best manner to my cousin morden and desire him to comfort them and to tell them that all would have been the same had they accepted of my true penitence as i wish as and i trust the almighty has done  i was called down it was to harry who was just returned from miss howes to whom he carried the ladys letter the stupid fellow being bid to make haste with it and return as soon as possible staid not till miss how had it she being at the distance of five miles although mrs how would have had him stay and sent a man and horse purposely with it to her daughter   wednesday morning  0 oclock the poor lady is just recovered from a fainting fit which has left her at deaths door her late tranquillity and freedom from pain seemed but a lightening as mrs lovick and mrs smith call it  by my faith lovelace i had rather part with all the friends i have in the world than with this lady i never knew what a virtuous a holy friendship as i may call mine to her was before but to be so new to it and to be obliged to forego it so soon what an affliction yet thank heaven i lose her not by my own fault  but twould be barbarous not to spare thee now  she has sent for the divine who visited her before in order to pray with her   letter li mr lovelace to j belford esquire kensington wednesday noon like aesops traveller thou blowest hot and cold life and death in the same breath with a view no doubt to distract me how familiarly do thou use the words dying dimness tremor never did any mortal ring so many changes on so few bells thy true father i dare swear was a butcher or an undertaker by the delight thou seem to take in scenes of horror and death thy barbarous reflection that thou losest her not by thy own fault is never to be forgiven thou have but one way to atone for the torments thou give me and that is by sending me word that she is better and will recover whether it be true or not let me be told so and i will go abroad rejoicing and believing it and my wishes and imagination shall make out all the rest  if she live but one year that i may acquit myself to myself no matter for the world that her death is not owing to me i will compound for the rest  will neither vows nor prayers save her i never prayed in my life put all the years of it together as i have done for this fortnight past and i have most sincerely repented of all my baseness to her  and will nothing do  but after all if she recover not this reflection must be my comfort and it is truth that her departure will be owing rather to wilfulness to downright female wilfulness than to any other cause  it is difficult for people who pursue the dictates of a violent resentment to stop where first they designed to stop  i have the charity to believe that even james and arabella harlowe at first intended no more by the confederacy they formed against this their angel sister than to disgrace and keep her down lest sordid wretches their uncles should follow the example her grandfather had set to their detriment  many a man who at first intended only to try if a girl would resent a petty freedom finding himself unchecked or only lightly and laughingly put by has been encouraged to attempt the last point and has triumphed where once he presumed not to make the most distant approach but with fear and trembling and previous study how to come off in case of a high resentment  to bring these illustrations home this lady i suppose in her resentment intended only at first to vex and plague me and finding she could do it to purpose her desire of revenge became stronger in her than the desire of life and now she is willing to die as an event which she supposes will cut my heart strings asunder and still the more to be revenged puts on the christian and forgives me  but i will have none of her forgiveness my own heart tells me i do not deserve it and i cannot bear it  and what is it but a mere verbal forgiveness as ostentatiously as cruelly given with a view to magnify herself and wound me deeper a little dear specious  but let me stop  lest i blaspheme  reading over the above i am ashamed of my ramblings but what would have me do  see thou not that i am but seeking to run out of myself in hope to lose myself yet that i am unable to do either  if ever thou lovedst but half so fervently as i love  but of that thy heavy soul is not capable  send me word by thy next i conjure thee in the names of all her kindred saints and angels that she is living and likely to live  if thou sendest ill news thou will be answerable for the consequence whether it be fatal to the messenger or to  thy lovelace  letter lii mr belford to robert lovelace esquire wednesday    oclock dr h has just been here he tarried with me till the minister had done praying by the lady and then we were both admitted mr goddard who came while the doctor and the clergyman were with her went away with them when they went they took a solemn and everlasting leave of her as i have no scruple to say blessing her and being blessed by her and wishing when it came to be their lot for an exit as happy as hers is likely to be  she had again earnestly requested of the doctor his opinion how long it was now probable that she could continue and he told her that he apprehended she would hardly see tomorrow night she said she should number the hours with greater pleasure than ever she numbered any in her life on the most joyful occasion  how unlike poor beltons last hours hers see the infinite difference in the effects on the same awful and affecting occasion between a good and a bad conscience  this moment a man is come from miss how with a letter perhaps i shall be able to send you the contents  she endeavored several times with earnestness but in vain to read the letter of her dear friend  the writing she said was too fine for her grosser sight and the lines staggered under her eye and indeed she trembled so she could not hold the paper and at last desired mrs lovick to read it to her the messenger waiting for an answer  thou will see in miss howes letter how different the expression of the same impatiency and passionate love is when dictated by the gentler mind of a woman from that which results from a mind so boisterous and knotty as thine for mrs lovick will transcribe it and i shall send it  to be read in this place if thou will  miss how to miss clarissa harlowe tuesday sept   o my dearest friend what will become of your poor anna how i see by your writing as well as read by your own account which were you not very very ill you would have touched more tenderly how it is with you  why have i thus long delayed to attend you  could i think that the comfortings of a faithful friend were as nothing to a gentle mind in distress that i could be prevailed upon to forbear visiting you so much as once in all this time  i as well as everybody else to desert and abandon my dear creature to strangers  what will become of me if you be as bad as my apprehensions make you  i will set out this moment little as the encouragement is that you give me to do so  my mother is willing i should  why o why was she not before willing  yet she persuades me too lest i should be fatally affected were i to find my fears too well justified to wait the return of this messenger who rides our swiftest horse  god speed him with good news to me  else  but oh my dearest dearest friend what else  one line from your hand by him  send me but one line to bid me attend you  i will set out the moment the very moment i receive it  i am now actually ready to do so  and if you love me as i love you the sight of me will revive you to my hopes but why why when i can think this did i not go up sooner  blessed heaven deny not to my prayers my friend my monitress my adviser at a time so critical to myself  but methinks your style and sentiments are too well connected too full of life and vigor to give cause for so much despair as the staggering pen seems to threaten  i am sorry i was not at home i must add thus much though the servant is ready mounted at the door when mr belfords servant came with your affecting letter i was at miss lloyds my mamma sent it to me and i came home that instant but he was gone he would not stay it seems yet i wanted to ask him an hundred thousand questions but why delay i thus my messenger i have a multitude of things to say to you to advise with you about you shall direct me in every thing i will obey the holding up of your finger but if you leave me  what is the world or any thing in it to  your anna how   the effect this letter had on the lady who is so near the end which the fair writer so much apprehends and deplores obliged mrs lovick to make many breaks in reading it and many changes of voice  this is a friend said the divine lady taking the letter in her hand and kissing it worth wishing to live for  o my dear anna how how uninterruptedly sweet and noble has been our friendship  but we shall one day i hope and that must comfort us both meet never to part again then divested of the shades of body shall we be all light and all mind  then how unalloyed how perfect will be our friendship our love then will have one and the same adorable object and we shall enjoy it and each other to all eternity  she said her dear friend was so earnest for a line or two that she would fain write if she could and she tried but to no purpose she could dictate however she believed and desired mrs lovick would take pen and paper which she did and then she dictated to her i would have withdrawn but at her desire staid  she wandered a good deal at first  she took notice that she did  and when she got into a little train not pleasing herself she apologized to mrs lovick for making her begin again and again and said that third time should go let it be as it would  she dictated the farewell part without hesitation and when she came to the blessing and subscription she took the pen and dropping on her knees supported by mrs lovick wrote the conclusion but mrs lovick was forced to guide her hand  you will find the sense surprizingly entire her weakness considered  i made the messenger wait while i transcribed it i have endeavored to imitate the subscriptive part  wedn near   oclock my dearest miss how you must not be surprised  nor grieved  that mrs lovick writes for me although i cannot obey you and write with my pen yet my heart writes by hers  accept it so  it is the nearest to obedience i can  and now what ought i to say what can i say  but why should you not know the truth since soon you must  very soon  know then and let your tears be those if of pity of joyful pity for i permit you to shed a few to imbalm as i may say a fallen blossom  know then that the good doctor and the pious clergyman and the worthy apothecary have just now with joint benedictions taken their last leave of me and the former bids me hope  do my dearest let me say ope  for my enlargement before tomorrow sunset  adieu therefore my dearest friend be this your consolation as it is mine that in gods good time we shall meet in a blessed eternity never more to part  once more then adieu and be happy  which a generous nature cannot be unless to its power it makes others so too  god for ever bless you prays dropped on my bended knees although supported upon them your grateful obliged affectionate clar harlowe   when i had transcribed and sealed this letter by her direction i gave it to the messenger myself who told me that miss how waited for nothing but his return to set out for london  thy servant is just come so i will close here thou art a merciless master the two fellows are battered to death by thee to usea female word and all female words though we are not sure of their derivation have very significant meanings i believe in their hearts they wish the angel in the heaven that is ready to receive her and thee at thy proper place that there might be an end of their flurries another word of the same gender  what a letter have thou sent me  poor lovelace  is all the answer i will return  five of clock colonel morden is this moment arrived  letter liii mr belford to robert lovelace esquire eight in the evening i had but just time in my former to tell you that colonel morden was arrived he was on horseback attended by two servants and alit at the door just as the clock struck five mrs smith was then below in her backshop weeping her husband with her who was as much affected as she mrs lovick having left them a little before in tears likewise for they had been bemoaning one another joining in opinion that the admirable lady would not live the night over she had told them it was her opinion too from some numbnesses which she called the forerunners of death and from an increased inclination to doze  the colonel as mrs smith told me afterward asked with great impatience the moment he alit how miss harlowe was she answered alive but she feared drawing on apace good god said he with his hands and eyes lifted up can i see her my name is morden i have the honor to be nearly related to her step up pray and let her know she is sensible i hope that i am here who is with her  nobody but her nurse and mrs lovick a widow gentlewoman who is as careful of her as if she were her mother  and more careful too interrupted he or she is not careful at all   except a gentleman be with her one mr belford continued mrs smith who has been the best friend she has had  if mr belford be with her surely i may  but pray step up and let mr belford know that i shall take it for a favor to speak with him first  mrs smith came up to me in my new apartment i had but just dispatched your servant and was asking her nurse if i might be again admitted who answered that she was dozing in the elbowchair having refused to lie down saying she should soon she hoped lie down for good  the colonel who is really a fine gentleman received me with great politeness after the first compliments my kinswoman sir said he is more obliged to you than to any of her own family for my part i have been endeavoring to move so many rocks in her favor and little thinking the dear creature so very bad have neglected to attend her as i ought to have done the moment i arrived and would had i known how ill she was and what a task i should have had with the family but sir your friend has been excessively to blame and you being so intimately his friend has made her fare the worse for your civilities to her but is there no hope of her recovery  the doctors have left her with the melancholy declaration that there is none  has she had good attendance sir a skilful physician i hear these good folks have been very civil and obliging to her   who could be otherwise said mrs smith weeping she is the sweetest lady in the world  the character said the colonel lifting up his eyes and one hand that she has from every living creature  good god how could your accursed friend   and how could her cruel parents interrupted i  we may as easily account for him as for them  too true returned he the vileness of the profligates of our sex considered whenever they can get any of the other into their power  i satisfied him about the care that had been taken of her and told him of the friendly and even paternal attendance she had had from dr h and mr goddard  he was impatient to attend her having not seen her as he said since she was twelve years old and that then she gave promises of being one of the finest women in england  she was so replied i a very few months ago and though emaciated she will appear to you to have confirmed those promises for her features are so regular and exact her proportion so fine and her manner so inimitably graceful that were she only skin and bone she must be a beauty  mrs smith at his request stepped up and brought us down word that mrs lovick and her nurse were with her and that she was in so sound a sleep leaning upon the former in her elbowchair that she neither heard her enter the room nor go out the colonel begged if not improper that he might see her though sleeping he said that his impatience would not let him stay till she awaked yet he would not have her disturbed and should be glad to contemplate her sweet features when she saw not him and asked if she thought he could not go in and come out without disturbing her  she believed he might she answered for her chairs back was toward the door  he said he would take care to withdraw if she awoke that his sudden appearance might not surprise her  mrs smith stepping up before us bid mrs lovick and the nurse not stir when we entered and then we went up softly together  we beheld the lady in a charming attitude dressed as i told you before in her virgin white she was sitting in her elbowchair mrs lovick close by her in another chair with her left arm round her neck supporting it as it were for it seems the lady had bid her do so saying she had been a mother to her and she would delight herself in thinking she was in her mammas arms for she found herself drowsy perhaps she said for the last time she should ever be so  one faded cheek rested upon the good womans bosom the kindly warmth of which had overspread it with a faint but charming flush the other paler and hollow as if already iced over by death her hands white as the lily with her meandring veins more transparently blue than ever i had seen even hers veins so soon alas to be choked up by the congealment of that purple stream which already so languidly creeps rather than flows through them her hands hanging lifelesly one before her the other grasped by the right hand of the kind widow whose tears bedewed the sweet face which her motherly bosom supported though unfelt by the fair sleeper and either insensibly to the good woman or what she would not disturb her to wipe off or to change her posture her aspect was sweetly calm and serene and though she started nowandthen yet her sleep seemed easy her breath indeed short and quick but tolerably free and not like that of a dying person  in this heartmoving attitude she appeared to us when we approached her and came to have her lovely face before us  the colonel sighing often gazed upon her with his arms folded and with the most profound and affectionate attention till at last on her starting and fetching her breath with greater difficulty than before he retired to a screen that was drawn before her house as she calls it which as i have heretofore observed stands under one of the windows this screen was placed there at the time she found herself obliged to take to her chamber and in the depth of our concern and the fullness of other discourse at our first interview i had forgotten to apprise the colonel of what he would probably see  retiring thither he drew out his handkerchief and drowned in grief seemed unable to speak but on casting his eye behind the screen he soon broke silence for struck with the shape of the coffin he lifted up a purplishcoloured cloth that was spread over it and starting back good god said he what is here  mrs smith standing next him why said he with great emotion is my cousin suffered to indulge her sad reflections with such an object before her  alas sir replied the good woman who should control her we are all strangers about her in a manner and yet we have expostulated with her upon this sad occasion  i ought said i stepping softly up to him the lady again falling into a doze to have apprised you of this i was here when it was brought in and never was so shocked in my life but she had none of her friends about her and no reason to hope for any of them to come near her and assured she should not recover she was resolved to leave as little as possible especially as to what related to her person to her executor but it is not a shocking object to her though it be to every body else  curse upon the hardheartedness of those said he who occasioned her to make so sad a provision for herself what must her reflections have been all the time she was thinking of it and giving orders about it and what must they be every time she turns her head toward it these uncommon geniuss  but indeed she should have been controuled in it had i been here  the lady fetched a profound sigh and starting it broke off our talk and the colonel then withdrew further behind the screen that his sudden appearance might not surprise her  where am i said she how drowsy i am how long have i dozed dont go sir for i was retiring i am very stupid and shall be more and more so i suppose  she then offered to raise herself but being ready to faint through weakness was forced to sit down again reclining her head on her chairback and after a few moments i believe now my good friends said she all your kind trouble will soon be over i have slept but am not refreshed and my fingers ends seem numbed  have no feeling holding them up  it is time to send the letter to my good mrs norton  shall i madam send my servant post with it  o no sir i thank you it will reach the dear woman too soon as she will think by the post  i told her this was not postday  is it wednesday still said she bless me i know not how the time goes but very tediously it is plain and now i think i must soon take to my bed all will be most conveniently and with least trouble over there  will it not mrs lovick  i think sir turning to me i have left nothing to these last incapacitating hours nothing either to say or to do i bless god i have not if i had how unhappy should i be can you sir remind me of any thing necessary to be done or said to make your office easy  if madam your cousin morden should come you would be glad to see him i presume  i am too weak to wish to see my cousin now it would but discompose me and him too yet if he come while i can see i will see him were it but to thank him for former favors and for his present kind intentions to me has any body been here from him  he has called and will be here madam in half an hour but he feared to surprise you  nothing can surprise me now except my mamma were to favor me with her last blessing in person that would be a welcome surprise to me even yet but did my cousin come purposely to town to see me  yes madam i took the liberty to let him know by a line last monday how ill you were  you are very kind sir i am and have been greatly obliged to you but i think i shall be pained to see him now because he will be concerned to see me and yet as i am not so ill as i shall presently be  the sooner he comes the better but if he come what shall i do about that screen he will chide me very probably and i cannot bear chiding now perhaps leaning upon mrs lovick and mrs smith i can walk into the next apartment to receive him  she motiond to rise but was ready to faint again and forced to sit still  the colonel was in a perfect agitation behind the screen to hear this discourse and twice unseen by his cousin was coming from it toward her but retreated for fear of surprising her too much  i stepped to him and favored his retreat she only saying are you going mr belford are you sent for down is my cousin come for she heard somebody step softly cross the room and thought it me her hearing being more perfect than her sight  i told her i believed he was and she said we must make the best of it mrs lovick and mrs smith i shall otherwise most grievously shock my poor cousin for he loved me dearly once pray give me a few of the doctors last drops in water to keep up my spirits for this one interview and that is all i believe that can concern me now  the colonel who heard all this sent in his name and i pretending to go down to him introduced the afflicted gentleman she having first ordered the screen to be put as close to the window as possible that he might not see what was behind it while he having heard what she had said about it was determined to take no notice of it  he folded the angel in his arms as she sat dropping down on one knee for supporting herself upon the two elbows of the chair she attempted to rise but could not excuse my dear cousin said she excuse me that i cannot stand up  i did not expect this favor now but i am glad of this opportunity to thank you for all your generous goodness to me  i never my best beloved and dearest cousin said he with eyes running over shall forgive myself that i did not attend you sooner little did i think you were so ill nor do any of your friends believe it if they did   if they did repeated she interrupting him i should have had more compassion from them i am sure i should but pray sir how did you leave them are you reconciled to them if you are not i beg if you love your poor clarissa that you will for every widend difference augments but my fault since that is the foundation of all  i had been expecting to hear from them in your favor my dear cousin said he for some hours when this gentlemans letter arrived which hastened me up but i have the account of your grandfathers estate to make up with you and have bills and draughts upon their banker for the sums due to you which they desire you may receive lest you should have occasion for money and this is such an earnest of an approaching reconciliation that i dare to answer for all the rest being according to your wishes if   ah sir interrupted she with frequent breaks and pauses i wish i wish this does not rather show that were i to live they would have nothing more to say to me i never had any pride in being independent of them all my actions when i might have made myself more independent show this  but what avail these reflections now  i only beg sir that you and this gentleman  to whom i am exceedingly obliged  will adjust those matters  according to the will i have written mr belford will excuse me but it was in truth more necessity than choice that made me think of giving him the trouble he so kindly accepts had i had the happiness to see you my cousin sooner  or to know that you still honored me with your regard  i should not have had the assurance to ask this favor of him  but  though the friend of mr lovelace he is a man of honor and he will make peace rather than break it and my dear cousin let me beg of you  to contribute your part to it  and remember that while i have nearer relations than my cousin morden dear as you are and always were to me you have no title to avenge my wrongs upon him who has been the occasion of them but i wrote to you my mind on this subject and my reasons and hope i need not further urge them  i must do mr lovelace so much justice answered he wiping his eyes as to witness how sincerely he repents him of his ungrateful baseness to you and how ready he is to make you all the amends in his power he owns his wickedness and your merit if he did not i could not pass it over though you have nearer relations for my dear cousin did not your grandfather leave me in trust for you and should i think myself concerned for your fortune and not for your honor  but since he is so desirous to do you justice i have the less to say and you may make yourself entirely easy on that account  i thank you thank you sir said she all is now as i wished but i am very faint very low i am sorry i cannot hold up that i cannot better deserve the honor of this visit but it will not be  and saying this she sunk down in her chair and was silent  hereupon we both withdrew leaving word that we would be at the bedfordhead if any thing extraordinary happened  we bespoke a little repast having neither of us dined and while it was getting ready you may guess at the subject of our discourse both joined in lamentation for the ladys desperate state admired her manifold excellencies severely condemned you and her friends yet to bring him into better opinion of you i read to him some passages from your last letters which showed your concern for the wrongs you had done her and your deep remorse and he said it was a dreadful thing to labor under the sense of a guilt so irremediable  we procured mr goddard dr h being not at home once more to visit her and to call upon us in his return he was so good as to do so but he tarried with her not five minutes and told us that she was drawing on apace that he feared she would not live till morning and that she wished to see colonel morden directly  the colonel made excuses where none were needed and though our little refection was just brought in he went away immediately  i could not touch a morsel and took pen and ink to amuse myself and oblige you knowing how impatient you would be for a few lines for from what i have recited you will see it was impossible i could withdraw to write when your servant came at half an hour after five or have an opportunity for it till now and this is accidental and yet your poor fellow was afraid to go away with the verbal message i sent importing as no doubt he told you that the colonel was with us the lady excessively ill and that i could not stir to write a line  ten oclock the colonel sent to me afterward that the lady having been in convulsions he was so much disordered that he could not possibly attend me  i have sent every half hour to know how she does and just now i have the pleasure to hear that her convulsions have left her and that she is gone to rest in a much quieter way than could be expected  her poor cousin is very much indisposed yet will not stir out of the house while she is in such a way but intends to lie down on a couch having refused any other accommodation   letter live mr belford in continuation soho six oclock sept   the lady is still alive the colonel having just sent his servant to let me know that she inquired after me about an hour ago i am dressing to attend her joel begs of me to dispatch him back though but with one line to gratify your present impatience he expects he says to find you at knightsbridge let him make what haste he can back and if he has not a line or two to pacify you he is afraid you will pistol him for he apprehends that you are hardly yourself i therefore dispatch this and will have another ready as soon as i can with particulars but you must have a little patience for how can i withdraw every half hour to write if i am admitted to the ladys presence or if i am with the colonel   smiths   oclock in the morning the lady is in a slumber mrs lovick who sat up with her says she had a better night than was expected for although she slept little she seemed easy and the easier for the pious frame she was in all her waking moments being taken up in devotion or in an ejaculatory silence her hands and eyes often lifted up and her lips moving with a fervor worthy of these her last hours   ten oclock the colonel being earnest to see his cousin as soon as she awaked we were both admitted we observed in her as soon as we entered strong symptoms of her approaching dissolution notwithstanding what the women had flattered us with from her last nights tranquillity the colonel and i each loath to say what we thought looked upon one another with melancholy countenances  the colonel told her he should send a servant to her uncle antonys for some papers he had left there and asked if she had any commands that way  she thought not she said speaking more inwardly than she did the day before she had indeed a letter ready to be sent to her good mrs norton and there was a request intimated in it but it was time enough if it were signified to those whom it concerned when all was over however it might be sent then by the servant who was going that way and she caused it to be given to the colonel for that purpose  her breath being very short she desired another pillow and having two before this made her in a manner sit up in her bed and she spoke then with more distinctness and seeing us greatly concerned forgot her own sufferings to comfort us and a charming lecture she gave us though a brief one upon the happiness of a timely prepatation and upon the hazards of a late repentance when the mind as she observed was so much weakened as well as the body as to render a poor soul unable to contend with its own infirmities  i beseech ye my good friends proceeded she mourn not for one who mourns not nor has cause to mourn for herself on the contrary rejoice with me that all my worldly troubles are so near their end believe me sirs that i would not if i might choose to live although the pleasantest part of my life were to come over again and yet eighteen years of it out of nineteen have been very pleasant to be so much exposed to temptation and to be so liable to fail in the trial who would not rejoice that all her dangers are over  all i wished was pardon and blessing from my dear parents easy as my departure seems to promise to be it would have been still easier had i had that pleasure but god almighty would not let me depend for comfort upon any but himself  she then repeated her request in the most earnest manner to her cousin that he would not heighten her fault by seeking to avenge her death to me that i would endeavor to make up all breaches and use the power i had with my friend to prevent all future mischiefs from him as well as that which this trust might give me to prevent any to him  she made some excuses to her cousin for having not been able to alter her will to join him in the executorship with me and to me for the trouble she had given and yet should give me  she had fatigued herself so much growing sensibly weaker that she sunk her head upon her pillows ready to faint and we withdrew to the window looking upon one another but could not tell what to say and yet both seemed inclinable to speak but the motion passed over in silence our eyes only spoke and that in a manner neithers were used to mine at least not till i knew this admirable creature  the colonel withdrew to dismiss his messenger and send away the letter to mrs norton i took the opportunity to retire likewise and to write thus far and joel returning to take it i now close here  eleven of clock   letter lv mr belford in continuation the colonel tells me that he has written to mr john harlowe by his servant that they might spare themselves the trouble of debating about a reconciliation for that his dear cousin would probably be no more before they could resolve  he asked me after his cousins means of subsisting and whether she had accepted of any favor from me he was sure he said she would not from you  i acquainted him with the truth of her parting with some of her apparel this wrung his heart and bitterly did he exclaim as well against you as against her implacable relations  he wished he had not come to england at all or had come time enough and hoped i would apprize him of the whole mournful story at a proper season he added that he had thoughts when he came over of fixing here for the remainder of his days but now as it was impossible his cousin could recover he would go abroad again and resettle himself at florence or leghorn  the lady has been giving orders with great presence of mind about her body directing her nurse and the maid of the house to put her into her coffin as soon as she was cold mr belford she said would know the rest by her will  she has just now given from her bosom where she always wore it a miniature picture set in gold of miss how she gave it to mrs lovick desiring her to fold it up in white paper and direct it to charles hickman esquire and to give it to me when she was departed for that gentleman  she looked upon the picture before she gave it her  sweet and everamiable friend  companion  sister  lover said she  and kissed it four several times once at each tender appellation  your other servant is come  well may you be impatient  well may you  but do you think i can leave off in the middle of a conversation to run and set down what offers and send it away piecemeal as i write  if i could must i not lose one half while i put down the other  this event is nearly as interesting to me as it is to you if you are more grieved than i there can be but one reason for it and that is at your heart i had rather lose all the friends i have in the world yourself included than this divine lady and shall be unhappy when ever i think of her sufferings and her merit though i have nothing to reproach myself upon the former  i say not this just now so much to reflect upon you as to express my own grief though your conscience i suppose will make you think otherwise  your poor fellow who says that he begs for his life in desiring to be dispatched back with a letter tears this from me else perhaps for i am just sent for down a quarter of an hour would make you  not easy indeed  but certain  and that in a state like yours to a mind like yours is a relief  thursday afternoon   oclock  letter lvi mr belford to richard mowbray esquire thursday afternoon dear mowbray i am glad to hear you are in town throw yourself the moment this comes to your hand if possible with tourville in the way of the man who least of all men deserves the love of the worthy heart but most that of thine and his else the news i shall most probably send him within an hour or two will make annihilation the greatest blessing he has to wish for  you will find him between piccadilly and kensington most probably on horseback riding backwards and forwards in a crazy way or put up perhaps at some inn or tavern in the way a waiter possibly if so watching for his servants return to him from me  his man will is just come to me he will carry this to you in his way back and be your director hie away in a coach or any how your being with him may save either his or a servants life see the blessed effects of triumphant libertinism sooner or later it comes home to us and all concludes in gall and bitterness adieu  j belford  letter lvii mr lovelace to john belford esquire curse upon the colonel and curse upon the writer of the last letter i received and upon all the world thou to pretend to be as much interested in my clarissas fate as myself it is well for one of us that this was not said to me instead of written  living or dying she is mine  and only mine have i not earned her dearly  is not damnation likely to be the purchase to me though a happy eternity will be hers  an eternal separation o god o god  how can i bear that thought  but yet there is life  yet therefore hope  enlarge my hope and thou shall be my good genius and i will forgive thee every thing  for this last time  but it must not shall not be the last  let me hear the moment thou receivest this  what i am to be  for at present i am  the most miserable of men rose at knightsbridge   oclock my fellow tells me that thou art sending mowbray and tourville to me i want them not my souls sick of them and of all the world but most of myself  yet as they send me word they will come to me immediately i will wait for them and for thy next o belford let it not be  but hasten it hasten it be it what it may    letter lviii mr belford to robert lovelace esquire seven oclock thursday even sept   i have only to say at present  thou will do well to take a tour to paris or wherever else thy destiny shall lead thee   john belford  letter lix mr mowbray to john belford esquire uxbridge sept   between    and    at night dear jack i send by poor lovelaces desire for particulars of the fatal breviate thou sentest him this night he cannot bear to set pen to paper yet wants to know every minute passage of miss harlowes departure yet why he should i cannot see for if she is gone she is gone and who can help it  i never heard of such a woman in my life what great matters has she suffered that grief should kill her thus  i wish the poor fellow had never known her from first to last what trouble has she cost him the charming fellow has been half lost to us ever since he pursued her and what is there in one woman more than another for matter of that  it was well we were with him when your note came you showed your true friendship in your foresight why jack the poor fellow was quite beside himself  mad as any man ever was in bedlam  will brought him the letter just after we had joined him at the bohemiahead where he had left word at the rose at knightsbridge he should be for he had been sauntering up and down backwards and forwards expecting us and his fellow will as soon as he delivered it got out of his way and when he opened it never was such a piece of scenery he trembled like a devil at receiving it fumbled at the seal his fingers in a palsy like tom dolemans his hand shake shake shake that he tore the letter in two before he could come at the contents and when he had read them off went his hat to one corner of the room his wig to the other  damnation seize the world and a whole volley of suchlike execratious wishes running up and down the room and throwing up the sash and pulling it down and smiting his forehead with his double fist with such force as would have felled an ox and stamping and tearing that the landlord ran in and faster out again and this was the distractionscene for some time  in vain was all jemmy or i could say to him i offered once to take hold of his hands because he was going to do himself a mischief as i believed looking about for his pistols which he had laid upon the table but which will unseen had taken out with him a faithful honest dog that will i shall for ever love the fellow for it and he hit me a damned dowse of the chops as made my nose bleed twas well twas he for i hardly knew how to take it  jemmy raved at him and told him how wicked it was in him to be so brutish to abuse a friend and run mad for a woman and then he said he was sorry for it and then will ventured in with water and a towel and the dog rejoiced as i could see by his looks that i had it rather than he  and so by degrees we brought him a little to his reason and he promised to behave more like a man and so i forgave him and we rode on in the dark to here at dolemans and we all tried to shame him out of his mad ungovernable foolishness for we told him as how she was but a woman and an obstinate perverse woman too and how could he help it  and you know jack as we told him moreover that it was a shame to manhood for a man who had served twenty and twenty women as bad or worse let him have served miss harlowe never so bad should give himself such obstropulous airs because she would die and we advised him never to attempt a woman proud of her character and virtue as they call it any more for why the conquest did not pay trouble and what was there in one woman more than another hay you know jack  and thus we comforted him and advised him  but yet his damned addled pate runs upon this lady as much now she is dead as it did when she was living for i suppose jack it is no joke she is certainly and bona fide dead int she if not thou deservest to be doubly damned for thy fooling i tell thee that so he will have me write for particulars of her departure  he will not bear the word dead on any account a squeamish puppy how love unmans and softens and enervates and such a noble fellow as this too rot him for an idiot and an oaf i have no patience with the foolish duncical dog  upon my soul i have not  so send the account and let him howl over it as i suppose he will  but he must and shall go abroad and in a month or two jemmy and you and i will join him and he will soon get the better of this chickenhearted folly never fear and will then be ashamed of himself and then well not spare him though now poor fellow it were pity to lay him on so thick as he deserves and do thou till then spare all reflections upon him for it seems thou have worked him unmercifully  i was willing to give thee some account of the hand we have had with the tearing fellow who had certainly been a lost man had we not been with him or he would have killed somebody or other  i have no doubt of it and now he is but very middling sits grinning like a man in straw curses and swears and is confounded gloomy and creeps into holes and corners like an old hedghog hunted for his grease and so adieu jack tourville and all of us wish for thee for no one has the influence upon him that thou have  r mowbray as i promised him that i would write for the particulars abovesaid i write this after all are gone to bed and the fellow is to set out with it by daybreak    letter lx mr belford to robert lovelace esquire thursdaynight i may as well try to write since were i to go to bed i shall not sleep i never had such a weight of grief upon my mind in my life as upon the demise of this admirable woman whose soul is now rejoicing in the regions of light  you may be glad to know the particulars of her happy exit i will try to proceed for all is hush and still the family retired but not one of them and least of all her poor cousin i dare say to rest  at four oclock as i mentioned in my last i was sent for down and as thou usedst to like my descriptions i will give thee the woeful scene that presented itself to me as i approached the bed  the colonel was the first that took my attention kneeling on the side of the bed the ladys right hand in both his which his face covered bathing it with his tears although she had been comforting him as the women since told him in elevated strains but broken accents  on the other side of the bed sat the good widow her face overwhelmed with tears leaning her head against the beds head in a most disconsolate manner and turning her face to me as soon as she saw me o mr belford cried she with folded hands  the dear lady  a heavy sob not permitting her to say more  mrs smith with clasped fingers and uplifted eyes as if imploring help from the only power which could give it was kneeling down at the beds feet tears in large drops trickling down her cheeks  her nurse was kneeling between the widow and mrs smith her arms extended in one hand she held an ineffectual cordial which she had just been offering to her dying mistress her face was swollen with weeping though used to such scenes as this and she turned her eyes toward me as if she called upon me by them to join in the helpless sorrow a fresh stream bursting from them as i approached the bed  the maid of the house with her face upon her folded arms as she stood leaning against the wainscot more audibly expressed her grief than any of the others  the lady had been silent a few minutes and speechless as they thought moving her lips without uttering a word one hand as i said in her cousins but when mrs lovick on my approach pronounced my name oh mr belford said she in broken periods and with a faint inward voice but very distinct nevertheless  now  now  i bless god for his mercies to his poor creature will all soon be over  a few  a very few moments  will end this strife  and i shall be happy  comfort here sir  turning her head to the colonel  comfort my cousin  see  the blameable kindness  he would not wish me to be happy  so soon  here she stopped for two or three minutes earnestly looking upon him then resuming my dearest cousin said she be comforted  what is dying but the common lot  the mortal frame may seem to labor  but that is all  it is not so hard to die as i believed it to be  the preparation is the difficulty  i bless god i have had time for that  the rest is worse to beholders than to me  i am all blessed hope  hope itself  she looked what she said a sweet smile beaming over her countenance  after a short silence once more my dear cousin said she but still in broken accents commend me most dutifully to my father and mother  there she stopped and then proceeding  to my sister to my brother to my uncles  and tell them i bless them with my parting breath  for all their goodness to me  even for their displeasure i bless them  most happy has been to me my punishment here  happy indeed  she was silent for a few moments lifting up her eyes and the hand her cousin held not between his then o death said she where is thy sting the words i remember to have heard in the burialservice read over my uncle and poor belton and after a pause  it is good for me that i was afflicted  words of scripture i suppose  then turning toward us who were lost in speechless sorrow  o dear dear gentlemen said she you know not what foretastes  what assurances and there she again stopped and looked up as if in a thankful rapture sweetly smiling  then turning her head toward me  do you sir tell your friend that i forgive him and i pray to god to forgive him  again pausing and lifting up her eyes as if praying that he would  let him know how happily i die  and that such as my own i wish to be his last hour  she was again silent for a few moments and then resuming  my sight fails me  your voices only  for we both applauded her christian her divine frame though in accents as broken as her own and the voice of grief is alike in all is not this mr mordens hand pressing one of his with that he had just let go which is mr belfords holding out the other i gave her mine god almighty bless you both said she and make you both  in your last hour  for you must come to this  happy as i am  she paused again her breath growing shorter and after a few minutes and now my dearest cousin give me your hand  nearer  still nearer  drawing it toward her and she pressed it with her dying lips  god protect you dear dear sir  and once more receive my best and most grateful thanks  and tell my dear miss how  and vouchsafe to see and to tell my worthy mrs norton  she will be one day i fear not though now lowly in her fortunes a saint in heaven  tell them both that i remember them with thankful blessings in my last moments  and pray god to give them happiness here for many many years for the sake of their friends and lovers and an heavenly crown hereafter and such assurances of it as i have through the allsatisfying merits of my blessed redeemer  her sweet voice and broken periods methinks still fill my ears and never will be out of my memory  after a short silence in a more broken and faint accent  and you mr belford pressing my hand may god preserve you and make you sensible of all your errors  you see in me how all ends  may you be  and down sunk her head upon her pillow she fainting away and drawing from us her hands  we thought she was then gone and each gave way to a violent burst of grief  but soon showing signs of returning life our attention was again engaged and i besought her when a little recovered to complete in my favor her halfpronounced blessing she waved her hand to us both and bowed her head six several times as we have since recollected as if distinguishing every person present not forgetting the nurse and the maidservant the latter having approached the bed weeping as if crowding in for the divine ladys last blessing and she spoke faltering and inwardly  bless  bless  bless  you all  and now  and now  holding up her almost lifeless hands for the last time come  o come  blessed lord  jesus  and with these words the last but halfpronounced expired such a smile such a charming serenity overspreading her sweet face at the instant as seemed to manifest her eternal happiness already begun  o lovelace  but i can write no more  i resume my pen to add a few lines  while warm though pulseless we pressed each her hand with our lips and then retired into the next room  we looked at each other with intent to speak but as if one motion governed as one cause affected both we turned away silent  the colonel sighed as if his heart would burst at last his face and hands uplifted his back toward me good heaven said he to himself support me  and is it thus o flower of nature  then pausing  and must we no more  never more  my blessed blessed cousin uttering some other words which his sighs made inarticulate  and then as if recollecting himself  forgive me sir  excuse me mr belford and sliding by me anon i hope to see you sir  and down stairs he went and out of the house leaving me a statue  when i recovered myself it was almost to repine at what i then called an unequal dispensation forgetting her happy preparation and still happier departure and that she had but drawn a common lot triumphing in it and leaving behind her every one less assured of happiness though equally certain that it would one day be their own lot  she departed exactly at  0 minutes after   oclock as by her watch on the table  and thus died miss clarissa harlowe in the blossom of her youth and beauty and who her tender years considered has not left behind her her superior in extensive knowledge and watchful prudence nor hardly her equal for unblemished virtue exemplary piety sweetness of manners discreet generosity and true christian charity and these all set off by the most graceful modesty and humility yet on all proper occasions manifesting a noble presence of mind and true magnanimity so that she may be said to have been not only an ornament to her sex but to human nature  a better pen than mine may do her fuller justice  thine i mean o lovelace for well do thou know how much she excelled in the graces both of mind and person natural and acquired all that is woman and thou also can best account for the causes of her immature death through those calamities which in so short a space of time from the highest pitch of felicity every one in a manner adoring her brought her to an exit so happy for herself but that it was so early so much to be deplored by all who had the honor of her acquaintance  this task then i leave to thee but now i can write no more only that i am a sympathizer in every part of thy distress except and yet it is cruel to say it in that which arises from thy guilt  one of clock friday morning  letter lxi mr belford to robert lovelace esquire nine friday morn i have no opportunity to write at length having necessary orders to give on the melancholy occasion joel who got to me by six in the morning and whom i dispatched instantly back with the letter i had ready from last night gives me but an indifferent account of the state of your mind i wonder not at it but time and nothing else can will make it easier to you if that is to say you have compounded with your conscience else it may be heavier every day than other  tourville tells me what a way you are in i hope you will not think of coming hither the lady in her will desires you may not see her four copies are making of it it is a long one for she gives her reasons for all she wills i will write to you more particularly as soon as possibly i can  three letters are just brought by a servant in livery directed to miss clarissa harlowe i will send copies of them to you the contents are enough to make one mad how would this poor lady have rejoiced to receive them  and yet if she had she would not have been enabled to say as she nobly did page  0   that god would not let her depend for comfort upon any but himself  and indeed for some days past she had seemed to have got above all worldly considerations  her fervent love even for her miss how as she acknowleged having given way to supremer fervors page       letter lxii mrs norton to miss clarissa harlowe wednesday sept   at length my best beloved miss clary every thing is in the wished train  for all your relations are unanimous in your favor  even your brother and sister are with the foremost to be reconciled to you  i knew it must end thus  by patience and persevering sweetness what a triumph have you gained  this happy change is owing to letters received from your physician from your cousin morden and from mr brand  colonel morden will be with you no doubt before this can reach you with his pocketbook filled with moneybills that nothing may be wanting to make you easy  and now all our hopes all our prayers are that this good news may restore you to spirits and health and that so long

will write to you and send her letter with this by a particular hand  i must not let them see what i write because of my wish about the chariot  your uncle harlowe will also write and i doubt not in

gentleman had written sooner and yet he writes that you know not he has now written but it is all our confidence and our consolation that he would not have written at all had he thought it too late

dear clary i am  your loving sister and true friend arabella harlowe  letter lxiv to his dear niece miss clarissa harlowe wedn sept   we were greatly grieved my beloved miss clary at your fault but we are still more if possible to hear you are so very ill and we are sorry things have been carried so far  we know your talents my dear and how movingly you could write whenever you pleased so that nobody could ever deny you any thing and believing you depended on your pen and little thinking you were so ill and that you had lived so regular a life and were so truly penitent are much troubled every one of us your brother and all for being so severe forgive my part in it my dearest clary i am your secondpapa you know and you used to love me  i hope you will soon be able to come down and

joins with me in the tenderest assurance that all shall be well and if possible better than ever for we now have been so long without you that we know the miss of you and even hunger and thirst as i may say to see you and to take you once more to our hearts whence indeed you was never banished so far as our concern for the unhappy step made us think and you believe you were your sister and brother both talk of seeing you in town so does my dear sister your indulgent mother  god restore your health if it be his will else i know not what will become of  your truly loving uncle and second papa john harlowe  letter lxv mr belford to robert lovelace esquire friday night sept   past ten i will now take up the account of our proceedings from my letter of last night which contained the dying words of this incomparable lady  as soon as we had seen the last scene closed so blessedly  we left the body to the care of the good women who according to the orders she had given them that very night removed her into that last house which she had displayed so much fortitude in providing  in the morning between   and   oclock according to appointment the colonel came to me here he was very much out of order we went together accompanied by mrs lovick and mrs smith into the deceaseds chamber we could not help taking a view of the lovely corpse and admiring the charming serenity of her noble aspect the women declared they never saw death so lovely before and that she looked as if in an easy slumber the color having not quite left her cheeks and lips  i unlocked the drawer in which as i mentioned in a page     former she had deposited her papers i told you in mine of monday last that she had the night before sealed up with three black seals a parcel inscribed as soon as i am certainly dead this to be broken open by mr belford i accused myself for having not done it over night but really i was then incapable of any thing  i broke it open accordingly and found in it no less than eleven letters each sealed with her own seal and black wax one of which was directed to me  i will enclose a copy of it  to john belford esquire sunday evening sept   sir i take this last and solemn occasion to repeat to you my thanks for all your kindness to me at a time when i most needed countenance and protection  a few considerations i beg leave as now at your perusal of this from the dead to press upon you with all the warmth of a sincere friendship  by the time you will see this you will have had an instance i humbly trust of the comfortable importance of a pacified conscience in the last hours of one who to the last hour will wish your eternal welfare  the great duke of luxemburgh as i have heard on his deathbed declared that he would then much rather have had it to reflect upon that he had administered a cup of cold water to a worthy poor creature in distress than that he had won so many battles as he had triumphed for  and as one well observes all the sentiments of worldly grandeur vanish at that unavoidable moment which decides the destiny of all men  if then sir at the tremendous hour it be thus with the conquerors of armies and the subduers of nations let me in very few words many are not needed ask what at that period must be the reflections of those if capable of reflection who have lived a life of sense and offense whose study and whose pride most ingloriously has been to seduce the innocent and to ruin the weak the unguarded and the friendless made still more friendless by their base seductions  oh mr belford weigh ponder and reflect upon it now that in health and in vigor of mind and body the reflections will most avail you  what an ungrateful what an unmanly what a meaner than reptile pride is this  in the next place sir let me beg of you for my sake who am or as now you will best read it have been driven to the necessity of applying to you to be the executor of my will that you will bear according to that generosity which i think to be in you with all my friends and particularly with my brother who is really a worthy young man but perhaps a little too headstrong in his first resentments and conceptions of things if any thing by reason of this trust should fall out disagreeably and that you will study to make peace and to reconcile all parties and more especially that you who seem to have a great influence upon your still more headstrong friend will interpose if occasion be to prevent further mischief  for surely sir that violent spirit may sit down satisfied with the evils he has already wrought and particularly with the wrongs the heinous and ignoble wrongs he has in me done to my family wounded in the tenderest part of its honor  to this request i have already your repeated promise i claim the observance of it therefore as a debt from you and though i hope i need not doubt it yet was i willing on this solemn this last occasion thus earnestly to reinforce it  i have another request to make to you it is only that you will be pleased by a particular messenger to forward the enclosed letters as directed  and now sir having the presumption to think that an useful member is lost to society by means of the unhappy step which has brought my life so soon to its period let me hope that i may be an humble instrument in the hands of providence to reform a man of your parts and abilities and then i shall think that loss will be more abundantly repaired to the world while it will be by gods goodness my gain and i shall have this further hope that once more i shall have an opportunity in a blessed eternity to thank you as i now repeatedly do for the good you have done to and the trouble you will have taken for  sir your obliged servant clarissa harlowe   the other letters are directed to her father to her mother one to her two uncles to her brother to her sister to her aunt hervey to her cousin morden to miss how to mrs norton and lastly one to you in performance of her promise that a letter should be sent you when she arrived at her fathers house  i will withhold this last till i can be assured that you will be fitter o receive it than tourville tells me you are at present  copies of all these are sealed up and entitled copies of my ten posthumous letters for j belford esquire and put in among the bundle of papers left to my direction which i have not yet had leisure to open  no wonder while able that she was always writing since thus only of late could she employ that time which heretofore from the long days she made caused so many beautiful works to spring from her fingers it is my opinion that there never was a lady so young who wrote so much and with such celerity her thoughts keeping pace as i have seen with her pen she hardly ever stopped or hesitated and very seldom blotted out or altered it was a natural talent she was mistress of among many other extraordinary ones  i gave the colonel his letter and ordered harry instantly to get ready to carry the others  mean time retiring into the next apartment we opened the will we were both so much affected in perusing it that at one time the colonel breaking off gave it to me to read on at another i gave it back to him to proceed with neither of us being able to read it through without such tokens of sensibility as affected the voices of each  mrs lovick mrs smith and her nurse were still more touched when we read those articles in which they are respectively remembered but i will avoid mentioning the particulars except in what relates to the thread of my narration as i shall send you a copy of it in proper time  the colonel told me he was ready to account with me for the moneys he had brought up from her friends which would enable me as he said directly to execute the legacyparts of it and he would needs at that instant force into my hands a paper relating to that subject i put it in my pocketbook without looking into it telling him that as i hoped he would do all in his power to promote a literal performance of the will i must beg his advice and assistance in the execution of it  her request to be buried with her ancestors made a letter of the following import necessary which i prevailed upon the colonel to write being unwilling myself so early at least to appear offcious in the eye of a family which probably wishes not any communication with me  to james harlowe jun esquire sir the letter which the bearer of this brings with him will i presume make it unnecessary to acquaint you and my cousins with the death of the most excellent of women but i am requested by her executor who will soon send you a copy of her last will to acquaint her father which i choose to do by your means that in it she earnestly desires to be laid in the familyvault at the feet of her grandfather  if her father will not admit of it she has directed her body to be buried in the churchyard of the parish where she died  i need not tell you that a speedy answer to this is necessary  her beatification commenced yesterday afternoon exactly at  0 minutes after six  i can write no more than that i am  yours etc wm morden friday morn sept    by the time this was written and by the colonels leave transcribed harry came booted and spurred his horse at the door and i delivered him the letters to the family with those to mrs norton and miss how eight in all together with the above of the colonel to mr james harlowe and gave him orders to make the utmost dispatch with them  the colonel and i have bespoke mourning for our selves and servants  letter lxvi mr belford to robert lovelace esquire sat ten of clock poor mrs norton is come she was set down at the door and would have gone up stairs directly but mrs smith and mrs lovick being together and in tears and the former hinting too suddenly to the truly venerable woman the fatal news she sunk down at her feet in fits so that they were forced to breathe a vein to bring her to herself and to a capacity of exclamation and then she run on to mrs lovick and to me who entered just as she recovered in praise of the lady in lamentations for her and invectives against you but yet so circumscribed were her invectives that i could observe in them the woman welleducated and in her lamentations the passion christianized as i may say  she was impatient to see the corpse the women went up with her but they owned that they were too much affected themselves on this occasion to describe her extremely affecting behavior  with trembling impatience she pushed aside the coffinlid she bathed the face with her tears and kissed her cheeks and forehead as if she were living it was her indeed she said her sweet young lady her very self nor had death which changed all things a power to alter her lovely features she admired the serenity of her aspect she no doubt was happy she said as she had written to her she should be but how many miserable creatures had she left behind her  the good woman lamenting that she herself had lived to be one of them  it was with difficulty they prevailed upon her to quit the corpse and when they went into the next apartment i joined them and acquainted her with the kind legacy her beloved young lady had left her but this rather augmented than diminished her concern she ought she said to have attended her in person what was the world to her wringing her hands now the child of her bosom and of her heart was no more her principal consolation however was that she should not long survive her she hoped she said that she did not sin in wishing she might not  it was easy to observe by the similitude of sentiments shown in this and other particulars that the divine lady owed to this excellent woman many of her good notions  i thought it would divert the poor gentlewoman and not altogether unsuitably if i were to put her upon furnishing mourning for herself as it would rouse her by a seasonable and necessary employment from that dismal lethargy of grief which generally succeeds the too violent anguish with which a gentle nature is accustomed to be torn upon the first communication of the unexpected loss of a dear friend i gave her therefore the thirty guineas bequeathed to her and to her son for mourning the only mourning which the fair testatrix has mentioned and desired her to lose no time in preparing her own as i doubted not that she would accompany the corpse if it were permitted to be carried down  the colonel proposes to attend the hearse if his kindred give him not fresh cause of displeasure and will take with him a copy of the will and being intent to give the family some favorable impressions of me he will also at his own desire take with him the copy of the posthumous letter to me  he is so kind as to promise me a minute account of all that shall pass on the melancholy occasion and we have begun a friendship and settled a correspondence which but one incident can possibly happen to interrupt to the end of our lives and that i hope will not happen  but what must be the grief the remorse that will seize upon the hearts of this hitherto inexorable family on the receiving of the posthumous letters and that of the colonel apprizing them of what has happened  i have given orders to an undertaker on the supposition that the body will be permitted to be carried down and the women intend to fill the coffin with aromatic herbs  the colonel has obliged me to take the bills and draughts which he brought up with him for the considerable sums accrued since the grandfathers death from the ladys estate  i could have shown to mrs norton the copies of the two letters which she missed by coming up but her grief wants not the heightenings which the reading of them would have given her  i have been dipping into the copies of the posthumous letters to the family which harry has carried down well may i call this admirable lady divine they are all calculated to give comfort rather than reproach though their cruelty to her merited nothing but reproach but were i in any of their places how much rather had i that she had quitted scores with me by the most severe recriminations than that she should thus nobly triumph over me by a generosity that has no example  i will enclose some of them which i desire you to return as soon as you can  letter lxvii to the everhonoured james harlowe sen esquire most dear sir with exulting confidence now does your emboldened daughter come into your awful presence by thse lines who dared not but upon this occasion to look up to you with hopes of favor and forgiveness since when this comes to your hands it will be out of her power ever to offend you more  and now let me bless you my honored papa and bless you as i write upon my knees for all the benefits i have received from your indulgence for your fond love to me in the days of my prattling innocence for the virtuous education you gave me and for the crown of all the happy end which through divine grace by means of that virtuous education i hope by the time you will receive this i shall have made and let me beg of you dear venerable sir to blot from your remembrance if possible the last unhappy eight months and then i shall hope to be remembered with advantage for the pleasure you had the goodness to take in your clarissa  still on her knees let your poor penitent implore your forgiveness of all her faults and follies more especially of that fatal error which threw her out of your protection  when you know sir that i have never been faulty in my will that ever since my calamity became irretrievable i have been in a state of preparation that i have the strongest assurances that the almighty has accepted my unfeigned repentance and that by this time you will as i humbly presume to hope have been the means of adding one to the number of the blessed you will have reason for joy rather than sorrow since had i escaped the snares by which i was entangled i might have wanted those exercises which i look upon now as so many mercies dispensed to wean me betimes from a world that presented itself to me with prospects too alluring and in that case too easily satisfied with worldly felicity i might not have attained to that blessedness which now on your reading of this i humbly presume through the divine goodness i am rejoicing in  that the almighty in his own good time will bring you sir and my everhonoured mother after a series of earthly felicities of which may my unhappy fault be the only interruption and very grievous i know that must have been to rejoice in the same blessed state is the repeated prayer of sir  your now happy daughter clarissa harlowe  letter lxviii to the everhonoured mrs harlowe honored madam the last time i had the boldness to write to you it was with all the consciousness of a selfconvicted minal supplicating her offended judge for mercy and pardon i now by these lines approach you with more assurance but nevertheless with the highest degree of reverence gratitude and duty the reason of my assurance my letter to my papa will give and as i humbly on my knees implored his pardon so now in the same dutiful manner do i supplicate yours for the grief and trouble i have given you  every vein of my heart has bled for an unhappy rashness which although involuntary as to the act from the moment it was committed carried with it its own punishment and was accompanied with a true and sincere penitence  god who has been a witness of my distresses knows that great as they have been the greatest of all was the distress that i knew i must have given to you madam and to my father by a step that had so very ugly an appearance in your eyes and his and indeed in all my familys a step so unworthy of your daughter and of the education you had given her  but he i presume to hope has forgiven me and at the instant this will reach your hands i humbly trust i shall be rejoicing in the blessed fruits of his forgiveness and be this your comfort my everhonoured mamma that the principal end of your pious care for me is attained though not in the way so much hoped for  may the grief which my fatal error has given to you both be the only grief that shall ever annoy you in this world  may you madam long live to sweeten the cares and heighten the comforts of my papa  may my sisters continued and if possible augmented duty happily make up to you the loss you have sustained in me and whenever my brother and she change their single state may it be with such satisfaction to you both as may make you forget my offense and remember me only in those days in which you took pleasure in me and at last may a happy meeting with your forgiven penitent in the eternal mansions augment the bliss of her who purified by sufferings already when this salutes your hands presumes she shall be  the forever happy clarissa harlowe  letter lxix to james harlowe jun esquire sir there was but one time but one occasion after the rash step i was precipitated upon that i could hope to be excused looking up to you in the character of a brother and a friend and now is that time and this the occasion now at reading this will you pity your late unhappy sister now will you forgive her faults both supposed and real and now will you afford to her memory that kind concern which you refused to her before  i write my brother in the first place to beg your pardon for the offense my unhappy step gave to you and to the rest of a family so dear to me  virgin purity should not so behave as to be suspected yet when you come to know all my story you will find further room for pity if not for more than pity for your late unhappy sister  o that passion had not been deaf that misconception would have given way to enquiry that your rigorous heart if it could not itself be softened moderating the power you had obtained over every one had permitted other hearts more indulgently to expand  but i write not to give pain i had rather you should think me faulty still than take to yourself the consequence that will follow from acquitting me  abandoning therefore a subject which i had not intended to touch upon for i hope at the writing of this i am above the spirit of recrimination let me tell you sir that my next motive for writing to you in this last and most solemn manner is to beg of you to forego any active resentments which may endanger a life so precious to all your friends against the man to whose elaborate baseness i owe my worldly ruin  for ought an innocent man to run an equal risque with a guilty one  a more than equal risque as the guilty one has been long inured to acts of violence and is skilled in the arts of offense  you would not arrogate to yourself gods province who has said vengeance is mine and i will repay it if you would i tremble for the consequence for will it not be suitable to the divine justice to punish the presumptuous innocent as you would be in this case in the very error and that by the hand of the selfdefending guilty  reserving him for a future day of vengeance for his accumulated crimes  leave then the poor wretch to the divine justice let your sisters fault die with her at least let it not be revived in blood life is a short stage where longest a little time hence the now green head will be gray if it lives this little time and if heaven will afford him time for repentance why should not you  then think my brother what will be the consequence to your dear parents if the guilty wretch who has occasioned to them the loss of a daughter should likewise deprive them of their best hope an only son more worth in the familyaccount than several daughters  would you add my brother to those distresses which you hold your sister so inexcusable for having although from involuntary and undesigned causes given  seek not then i beseech you to extend the evil consequences of your sisters error his conscience when it shall please god to touch it will be sharper than your sword  i have still another motive for writing to you in this solemn manner it is to entreat you to watch over your passions the principal fault i know you to be guilty of is the violence of your temper when you think yourself in the right which you would oftener be but for that very violence  you have several times brought your life into danger by it  is not the man guilty of a high degree of selfpartiality who is less able to bear contradiction than apt to give it  how often with you has impetuosity brought on abasement  a consequence too natural  let me then caution you dear sir against a warmth of temper an impetuosity when moved and you so ready to be moved that may hurry you into unforeseen difficulties and which it is in some measure a sin not to endeavor to restrain god enable you to do it for the sake of your own peace and safety as well present as future and for the sake of your family and friends who all see your fault but are tender of speaking to you of it  as for me my brother my punishment has been seasonable god gave me grace to make a right use of my sufferings i early repented i never loved the man half so much as i hated his actions when i saw what he was capable of i gave up my whole heart to a better hope god blessed my penitence and my reliance upon him and now i presume to say i am happy  may heaven preserve you in safety health and honor and long continue your life for a comfort and stay to your honored parents and may you in the change of your single state meet with a wife as agreeable to every one else as to yourself and be happy in a hopeful race and not have one clarissa among them to imbitter your comforts when she should give you most comfort but may my example be of use to warn the dear creatures whom once i hoped to live to see and to cherish of the evils with which this deceitful world abounds are the prayers of  your affectionate sister clarissa harlowe  letter lxx to miss harlowe now may you my dear arabella unrestrained by the severity of your virtue let fall a pitying tear on the past faults and sufferings of your late unhappy sister since now she can never offend you more the divine mercy which first inspired her with repentance an early repentance it was since it preceded her sufferings for an error which she offers not to extenuate although perhaps it were capable of some extenuation has now at the instant that you are reading this as i humbly hope blessed her with the fruits of it  thus already even while she writes in imagination purified and exalted she the more fearlesly writes to her sister and now is assured of pardon for all those little occasions of displeasure which her frowarder youth might give you and for the disgrace which her fall has fixed upon you and upon her family  may you my sister continue to bless those dear and honored relations whose indulgence so well deserves your utmost gratitude with those cheerful instances of duty and obedience which have hitherto been so acceptable to them and praiseworthy in you and may you when a suitable proposal shall offer fill up more worthily that chasm which the loss they have sustained in me has made in their family  thus my arabella my only sister and for many happy years my friend most fervently prays that sister whose affection for you no acts of unkindness no misconstruction of her conduct could cancel and who now made perfect as she hopes through sufferings styles herself  the happy clarissa harlowe  letter lxxi to john and antony harlowe esqrs honored sirs when these lines reach your hands your late unhappy niece will have known the end of all her troubles and as she humbly hopes will be rejoicing in the mercies of a gracious god who has declared that he will forgive the truly penitent of heart  i write therefore my dear uncles and to you both in one letter since your fraternal love has made you both but as one person to give you comfort and not distress for however sharp my afflictions have been they have been but of short duration and i am betimes happily as i hope arrived at the end of a painful journey  at the same time i write to thank you both for all your kind indulgence to me and to beg your forgiveness of my last my only great fault to you and to my family  the ways of providence are unsearchable various are the means made use of by it to bring poor sinners to a sense of their duty some are drawn by love others are driven by terrors to their divine refuge i had for eighteen years out of nineteen rejoiced in the favor and affection of every one no trouble came near my heart i seemed to be one of those designed to be drawn by the silken cords of love  but perhaps i was too apt to value myself upon the love and favor of every one the merit of the good i delighted to do and of the inclinations which were given me and which i could not help having i was perhaps too ready to attribute to myself and now being led to account for the cause of my temporary calamities find i had a secret pride to be punished for which i had not fathomed and it was necessary perhaps that some sore and terrible misfortunes should befall me in order to mortify my pride and my vanity  temptations were accordingly sent i shrunk in the day of trial my discretion which had been so cried up was found wanting when it came to be weighed in an equal balance i was betrayed fell and became the byword of my companions and a disgrace to my family which had prided itself in me perhaps too much but as my fault was not that of a culpable will when my pride was sufficiently mortified although i was surrounded by dangers and entangled in snares i was not suffered to be totally lost but purified by sufferings i was fitted for the change i have now at the time you will receive this so newly and as i humbly hope so happily experienced  rejoice with me then dear sirs that i have weathered so great a storm nor let it be matter of concern that i am cut off in the bloom of youth there is no inquisition in the grave whether we lived ten or an hundred years and the day of death is better than the day of our birth  once more dear sirs accept my grateful thanks for all your goodness to me from my early childhood to the day the unhappy day of my error forgive that error  and god give us a happy meeting in a blessed eternity prays  your most dutiful and obliged kinswoman clarissa harlowe   mr belford gives the ladys posthumous letters to mrs hervey miss how and mrs norton at length likewise but although every letter varies in style as well as matter from the others yet as they are written on the same subject and are pretty long it is thought proper to abstract them  that to her aunt hervey is written in the same pious and generous strain with the others preceding seeking to give comfort rather than distress the almighty i hope says she has received and blessed my penitence and i am happy could i have been more than so at the end of what is called a happy life of  0 or  0 or  0 years to come and what are  0 or  0 or  0 years to look back upon when passed  in half of either of these periods what friends might i not have mourned for what temptations from worldly prosperity might i not have encountered with and in such a case immersed in earthly pleasures how little likelihood that in my last stage i should have been blessed with such a preparation and resignation as i have now been blessed with  she proceeds as follows thus much madam of comfort to you and myself from this dispensation as to my dear parents i hope they will console themselves that they have still many blessings left which ought to balance the troubles my error has given them that unhappy as i have been to be the interrupter of their felicities they never till this my fault knew any heavy evil that afflictions patiently borne may be turned into blessings that uninterrupted happiness is not to be expected in this life that after all they have not as i humbly presume to hope the probability of the everlasting perdition of their child to deplore and that in short when my story comes to be fully known they will have the comfort to know that my sufferings will redound more to my honor than to my disgrace  these considerations will i hope make their temporary loss of but one child out of three unhappily circumstanced too as she was matter of greater consolation than affliction and the rather as we may hope for a happy meeting once more never to be separated either by time or offenses  she concludes this letter with an address to her cousin dolly hervey whom she calls her amiable cousin and thankfully remembers for the part she took in her afflictions  o my dear cousin let your worthy heart be guarded against those delusions which have been fatal to my worldly happiness  that pity which you bestowed upon me demonstrates a gentleness of nature which may possibly subject you to misfortunes if your eye be permitted to mislead your judgment  but a strict observance of your filial duty my dearest cousin and the precepts of so prudent a mother as you have the happiness to have enforced by so sad an example in your own family as i have set will i make no doubt with the divine assistance be your guard and security  the posthumous letter to miss how is extremely tender and affectionate she pathetically calls upon her to rejoice that all her clarissas troubles are now at an end that the state of temptation and trial of doubt and uncertainty is now over with her and that she has happily escaped the snares that were laid for her soul the rather to rejoice as that her misfortunes were of such a nature that it was impossible she could be tolerably happy in this life  she thankfully acknowleges the favors she had received from mrs how and mr hickman and expresses her concern for the trouble she has occasioned to the former as well as to her and prays that all the earthly blessings they used to wish to each other may singly devolve upon her  she beseeches her that she will not suspend the day which shall supply to herself the friend she will have lost in her and give to herself a still nearer and dearer relation  she tells her that her choice a choice made with the approbation of all her friends has fallen upon a sincere an honest a virtuous and what is more than all a pious man a man who although he admires her person is still more in love with the graces of her mind and as those graces are improveable with every added year of life which will impair the transitory ones of person what a firm basis infers she has mr hickman chosen to build his love upon  she prays that god will bless them together and that the remembrance of her and of what she has suffered may not interrupt their mutual happiness she desires them to think of nothing but what she now is and that a time will come when they shall meet again never to be divided  to the divine protection mean time she commits her and charges her by the love that has always subsisted between them that she will not mourn too heavily for her and again calls upon her after  gentle tear which she will allow her to let fall in memory of their uninterrupted friendship to rejoice that she is so early released and that she is purified by her sufferings and is made as she assuredly trusts by gods goodness eternally happy  the posthumous letters to mr lovelace and mr morden will be occasionally inserted hereafter as will also the substance of that written to mrs norton    letter lxxii mr belford to robert lovelace esquire sat afternoon sept   i understand that thou breathest nothing but revenge against me for treating thee with so much freedom and against the accursed woman and her infernal crew i am not at all concerned for thy menaces against myself it is my design to make thee feel it gives me pleasure to find my intention answered and i congratulate thee that thou have not lost that sense  as to the cursed crew well do they deserve the fire here that thou threatenest them with and the fire here after that seems to await them but i have this moment received news which will in all likelihood save thee the guilt of punishing the old wretch for her share of wickedness as thy agent but if that happens to her which is likely to happen will thou not tremble for what may befall the principal  not to keep thee longer in suspense last night it seems the infamous woman got so heartily intoxicated with her beloved liquor arrack punch at the expense of colonel salter that mistaking her way she fell down a pair of stairs and broke her leg and now after a dreadful night she lies foaming raving roaring in a burning fever that wants not any other fire to scorch her into a feeling more exquisite and durable than any thy vengeance could make her suffer  the wretch has requested me to come to her and lest i should refuse a common messenger sent her vile associate sally martin who not finding me at soho came hither another part of her business being to procure the divine ladys pardon for the old creatures wickedness to her  this devil incarnate sally was never so shocked in her life as when i told her the lady was dead  she took out her salts to keep her from fainting and when a little recovered she accused herself for her part of the injuries the lady had sustained as she said polly horton would do for hers and shedding tears declared that the world never produced such another woman she called her the ornament and glory of her sex acknowleged that her rin was owing more to their instigations than even savage as thou art to thy own vileness since thou were inclined to have done her justice more than once had they not kept up thy profligate spirit to its height  this wretch would fain have been admitted to a sight of the corpse but i refused her request with execrations  she could forgive herself she said for every thing but her insults upon the admirable lady at rowlands since all the rest was but in pursuit of a livelihood to which she had been reduced as she boasted from better expectations and which hundreds follow as well as she i did not ask her by whom reduced  at going away she told me that the old monsters bruises are of more dangerous consequence than the fracture that a mortification is apprehended and that the vile wretch has so much compunction of heart on recollecting her treatment of miss harlowe and is so much set upon procuring her forgiveness that she is sure the news she has to carry her will hasten her end  letter lxxiii mr belford to robert lovelace esquire sat night thy servant gives me a dreadful account of thy raving unmanageableness i wonder not at it but as nothing violent is lasting i dare say that thy habitual gaiety of heart will quickly get the better of thy frenzy and the rather do i judge so as thy fits are of the raving kind suitable to thy natural impetuosity and not of that melancholy species which seizes slower souls  for this reason i will proceed in writing to thee that my narrative may not be broken by thy discomposure and that the contents of it may find thee and help thee to reflection when thou shall be restored  harry is returned from carrying the posthumous letters to the family and to miss how and that of the colonel which acquaints james harlowe with his sisters death and with her desire to be interred near her grandfather  harry was not admitted into the presence of any of the family they were all assembled together it seems at harloweplace on occasion of the colonels letter which informed them of the ladys dangerous way see p   0  and were comforting themselves as harry was told with hopes that mr morden had made the worst of her state in order to quicken their resolutions  it is easy then to judge what must be their grief and surprise on receiving the fatal news which the letters harry sent in to them communicated  he staid there long enough to find the whole house in confusion the servants running different ways lamenting and wringing their hands as they run the female servants particularly as if some body poor mrs harlowe no doubt and perhaps mrs hervey too were in fits  all were in such disorder that he could get no commands nor obtain any notice of himself the servants seemed more inclined to execrate than welcome him  o master o young man cried three or four together what dismal tidings have you brought  they helped him to his horse which with great civility they had put up on his arrival at the very first word and he went to an inn and pursued on foot his way to mrs nortons and finding her come to town left the letter he carried down for her with her son a fine youth who when he heard the fatal news burst out into a flood of tears  first lamenting the ladys death and then crying out what what would become of his poor mother  how would she support herself when she should find on her arrival in town that the dear lady who was so deservedly the darling of her heart was no more  he proceeded to miss howes with the letter for her that lady he was told had just given orders for a young man a tenants son to post to london to bring her news of her dear friends condition and whether she should herself be encouraged by an account of her being still alive to make her a visit every thing being ordered to be in readiness for her going up on his return with the news she wished and prayed for with the utmost impatience and harry was just in time to prevent the mans setting out  he had the precaution to desire to speak with miss howes woman or maid and communicated to her the fatal tidings that she might break them to her young lady the maid was herself so affected that her old lady who harry said seemed to be every where at once came to see what ailed her and was herself so struck with the communication that she was forced to sit down in a chair o the sweet creature said she  and is it come to this  o my poor nancy  how shall i be able to break the matter to my nancy  mr hickman was in the house he hastened in to comfort the old lady  but he could not restrain his own tears he feared he said when he was last in town that this sad event would soon happen but little thought it would be so very soon  but she is happy i am sure said he  mrs how when a little recovered went up in order to break the news to her daughter she took the letter and her salts in her hand and harry could perceive that they had occasion for them for the housekeeper soon came hurrying down into the kitchen her face overspread with tears  her young mistress had fainted away she said  nor did she wonder at it  never did there live a lady more deserving of general admiration and lamentation than miss clarissa harlowe and never was there a stronger friendship dissolved by death than between her young lady and her she hurried with a lighted waxcandle and with feathers to burn under the nose of her young mistress which showed that she continued in fits  mr hickman afterward with his usual humanity directed that harry should be taken care of all night it being then the close of day he asked him after my health he expressed himself excessively afflicted as well for the deprivation as for the just grief of the lady whom he so passionately loves but he called the departed lady an angel of light we dreaded said he tell your master to read the letter sent  but we needed not  it is a blessed letter written by a blessed hand  but the consolation she aims to give will for the present heighten the sense we all shall have of the loss of so excellent a creature tell mr belford that i thank god i am not the man who had the unmerited honor to call himself her brother  i know how terribly this great catastrophe as i may call it since so many persons are interested in it affects thee i should have been glad to have had particulars of the distress which the first communication of it must have given to the harlowes yet who but must pity the unhappy mother  the answer which james harlowe returned to colonel mordens letter of notification of his sisters death and to her request as to interrment will give a faint idea of what their concern must be here follows a copy of it  to william morden esquire saturday sept   dear cousin i cannot find words to express what we all suffer on the mournfullest news that ever was communicated to us  my sister arabella but alas i have now no other sister was preparing to follow mrs norton up and i had resolved to escorte her and to have looked in upon the dear creature  god be merciful to us all to what purpose did the doctor write if she was so near her end  why as everybody sas did he not send sooner  or why at all  the most admirable young creature that ever swerved  not one friend to be with her  alas sir i fear my mother will never get over this shock  she has been in hourly sits ever since she received the fatal news my poor father has the got thrown into his stomach and heaven knows  o coin o sir  i meant nothing but the honor of the family yet have i all the weight thrown upon me  o this cursed lovelace may i perish if he escape the deserved vengeance the words thus enclosed  were omitted in the transcript to mr lovelace   we had begun to please ourselves that we should soon see her here  good heaven that her next entrance into this house after she abandoned us so precipitately should be in a coffin  we can have nothing to do with her executor another strange step of the dear creatures he cannot expect we will  nor if he be a gentleman will he think of acting do you therefore be pleased sir to order an undertaker to convey the body down to us  my mother says she shall be for ever unhappy if she may not in death see the dear creature whom she could not see in life be so kind therefore as to direct the lid to be only halfscrewed down  that if my poor mother cannot be prevailed upon to dispense with so shocking a spectacle she may be obliged  she was the darling of her heart  if we know her will in relation to the funeral it shall be punctually complied with as shall every thing in it that is fit or reasonable to be performed and this without the intervention of strangers  will you not dear sir favor us with your presence at this melancholy time pray do  and pity and excuse what passed at our last meeting with that generosity which is natural to the brave and the wise every ones respects attend you and i am sir  your inexpressibly afflicted cousin and servant ja harlowe jun   every thing that is fit or reasonable to be performed repeated i to the colonel from the above letter on his reading it to me that is every thing which she has directed that can be performed i hope colonel that i shall have no contention with them i wish no more for their acquaintance than they do for mine but you sir must be the mediator between them and me for i shall insist upon a literal performance in every article  the colonel was so kind as to declare that he would join to support me in my resolution  letter lxxiv mr belford to robert lovelace esquire sunday morn   oclock sept  0 i staid at smiths till i saw the last of all that was mortal of the divine lady  as she has directed rings by her will to several persons with her hair to be set in crystal the afflicted mrs norton cut off before the coffin was closed four charming ringlets one of which the colonel took for a locket which he says he will cause to be made and wear next his heart in memory of his beloved cousin  between four and five in the morning the corpse was put into the hearse the coffin before being filled as intended with flowers and aromatic herbs and proper care taken to prevent the corpse suffering to the eye from the jolting of the horse  poor mrs norton is extremely ill i gave particular directions to mrs smiths maid whom i have ordered to attend the good woman in a mourning chariot to take care of her the colonel who rides with his servants within view of the hearse says that he will see my orders in relation to her enforced  when the hearse moved off and was out of sight i locked up the ladys chamber into which all that had belonged to her was removed  i expect to hear from the colonel as soon as he is got down by a servant of his own  letter lxxv mr mowbray to john belford esquire uxbridge sunday morn   oclock dear jack i send you enclosed a letter from mr lovelace which though written in the cursed algebra i know to be such a one as will show what a queer way he is in for he read it to us with the air of a tragedian you will see by it what the mad fellow had intended to do if we had not all of us interposed he was actually setting out with a surgeon of this place to have the lady opened and embalmed  rot me if it be not my full persuasion that if he had her heart would have been found to be either iron or marble  we have got lord m to him his lordship is also much afflicted at the ladys death his sisters and nieces he says will be ready to break their hearts what a routs here about a woman for after all she was no more  we have taken a pailful of black bulls blood from him and this has lowered him a little but he threatens colonel morden he threatens you for your cursed reflections cursed reflections indeed jack and curses all the world and himself still  last night his mourning which is full as deep as for a wife was brought home and his fellows mourning too and though   oclock he would put it on and make them attend him in theirs  everybody blames him on this ladys account but i see not for why she was a vixen in her virtue and her relations are ten times more to blame than he i will prove this to the teeth of them all if they could use her ill why should they expect him to use her well  you or i or tourville in his shoes would have done as he has done are not all the girls forewarned  has he done by her as that caitiffe miles did to the farmers daughter whom he triked up to town s pretty girl also just such another as bbs rosebud under a notion of waiting on a lady  drilled her on pretending the lady was abroad drank her lighthearted then carried her to a play then it was too late you know to see the pretended lady then to a bagnio ruined her as they call it and all the same day kept her on an ugly dog too a fortnight or three weeks then left her to the mercy of the people of the bagnio never paying for any thing who stripped her of all her clothes and because she would not take on threw her into prison where she died in want and in despair  a true story thou know jack  this fellow deserved to be damned but has our bob been such a villain as this  and would he not have married this flintyhearted lady  so he is justified very evidently  why then should such cursed quawms take him  who would have thought he had been such poor blood now rot the puppy to see him sit silent in a corner when he has tired himself with his mockmajesty and with his argumentation who so fond of arguefying as he and teaching his shadow to make mouths against the wainscot  lordszounter if i have patience with him  but he has had no rest for these ten days that is the thing  you must write to him and prythee coax him jack and send him what he writes for and give him all his way there will be no bearing him else and get the lady buried as fast as you can and dont let him know where  this letter should have gone yesterday we told him it did but were in hopes he would not have inquired after it again but he raves as he has not any answer  what he vouchsafed to read of other of your letters has given my lord such a curiosity as makes him desire you to continue your accounts pray do but not in your hellish araback and we will let the poor fellow only into what we think fitting for his present way  i live a cursed dull poking life here with what i so lately saw of poor belton and what i now see of this charming fellow i shall be as crazy as he soon or as dull as thou jack so must seek for better company in town than either of you i have been forced to read sometimes to divert me and you know i hate reading it presently sets me into a fit of drowsiness and then i yawn and stretch like a devil  yet in drydens palemon and arcite have i just now met with a passage that has in it much of our bobs case these are some of the lines  mr mowbray then recites some lines from that poem describing a distracted men and runs the parallel and then priding himself in his performance says    let me tell you that had i begun to write as early as you and lovelace i might have cut as good a figure as either of you why not but boy or man i ever hated a book it is a folly to lie i loved action my boy i hated droning and have led in former days more boys from their book than ever my master made to profit by it kicking and cuffing and orchardrobbing were my early glory  but i am tired of writing i never wrote such a long letter in my life my wrists and my fingers and thumb ache damnably the pen is an hundred weight at the least and my eyes are ready to drop out of my head upon the paper  the cramp but this minute in my fingers rot the goose and the goosequill i will write no more long letters for a twelvemonth to come yet one word we think the mad fellow

what can they mean by it  yet that crippled monkey doleman joins with them and as i hear them whisper they have sent for lord m  to control me i suppose  what can they mean by this usage of me sure

beloved clarissa lovelace  no more harlowe  curse upon that name and every one called by it  what i write to you for is    to forbid you intermeddling with any thing relating to her to forbid morden

unworthy parents she had  all shall be set forth in words at length no mincing of the matter names undisguised as well as facts for as i shall make the worst figure in it myself and have a right to treat myself as nobody else shall who will control me who dare call me to account  let me know if the damned mother be yet the subject of the devils own vengeance  if the old wretch be dead or alive some exemplary mischief i must yet do my revenge shall sweep away that devil and all my opposers of the cruel harlowe family from the fac of the earth whole heombs ought to be offered up to the manes of my clarissa lovelace  although her will may in some respects cross mine yet i expect to be observed i will be the interpreter of hers  next to mine hers shall be observed for she is my wife and shall be to all eternity i will never have another  adieu jack i am preparing to be with you i charge you as you value my life or your own do not oppose me in any thing relating to my clarissa lovelace  my temper is entirely altered i know not what it is to laugh or smile or be pleasant i am grown choleric and impatient and will not be controuled  i write this in characters as i used to do that nobody but you should know what i write for never was any man plagued with impertinents as i am  r lovelace  in a separate paper enclosed in the above  let me tell thee in characters still that i am in a dreadful way just now my brain is all boiling like a caldron over a fiery furnace what a devil is the matter with me i wonder i never was so strange in my life  in truth jack i have been a most execrable villain and when i consider all my actions by this angel of a woman and in her the piety the charity the wit the beauty i have helped to destroy and the good to the world i have thereby been a means of frustrating i can pronounce damnation upon myself how then can i expect mercy any where else  i believe i shall have no patience with you when i see you your damned stings and reflections have almost turned my brain  but here lord m they tell me is come d  n him and those who sent for him  i know not what i have written but her dear heart and a lock of her hair i will have let who will be the gainsayers for is she not mine whose else can she be she has no father nor mother no sister no brother no relations but me and my beloved is mine and i am hers and that is enough  but oh  she is out the damp of death has quenched her quite those spicy doors her lips are shut close looked which never gale of life shall open more and is it so is it indeed so  good god good god  but they will no let me write on i must go down to this officious peer  who the devil sent for him  letter lxxvii mr belford to richard mowbray esquire sunday sept  0   in the afternoon i have yours with our unhappy friends enclosed i am glad my lord is with him as i presume that his frenzy will be but of short continuance i most earnestly wish that on his recovery he could be prevailed upon to go abroad mr morden who is inconsolable has seen by the will that the case was more than a common seduction and has dropped hints already that he looks upon himself on that account to be freed from his promises made to the dying lady which were that he would not seek to avenge her death you must make the recovery of his health the motive for urging him on this head for if you hint at his own safety he will not stir but rather seek the colonel  as to the lock of hair you may easily pacify him as you once saw the angel with hair near the color if he be intent upon it  at my lords desire i will write on and in my common hand that you may judge what is and what is not fit to read to mr lovelace at present but as i shall not forbear reflections as i go along in hopes to reach his heart on his recovery i think it best to direct myself to him still and that as if he were not disordered  as i shall not have leisure to take copies and yet am willing to have the whole subject before me for my own future contemplation i must insist upon a return of my letters some time hence mr lovelace knows that this is one of my conditions and has hitherto complied with it  thy letter mowbray is an inimitable performance thou art a strange impenetrable creature but let me most earnestly njure thee and the idle flutterer tourville from what ye have seen of poor beltons exit from our friend lovelaces frenzy and the occasion of i and from the terrible condition in which the wretched clair lies to set about an immediate change of life and manners for my own part i am determined be your resolutions what they may to take the advice i give  as witness j belford  letter lxxviii mr belford to robert lovelace esquire o lovelace i have a scene to paint in relation to the wretched sinclair that if i do it justice will make thee seriously ponder and reflect or nothing can i will lead to it in order and that in my usual hand that thy compeers may be able to read it as well as thyself  when i had written the preceding letter not knowing what to do with myself recollecting and in vain wishing for that delightful and improving conversation which i had now for ever lost i thought i had as good begin the task which i had for some time past resolved to begin that is to say to go to church and see if i could not reap some benefit from what i should hear there accordingly i determined to go to hear the celebrated preacher at st jamess church but as if the devil for so i was then ready to conclude thought himself concerned to prevent my intention a visit was made me just as i was dressed which took me off from my purpose  whom should this be from but sally martin accompanied by mrs carter the sister of the infamous sinclair the same i suppose i need not tell you who keeps the bagnio near bloomsbury  these told me that the surgeon apothecary and physician had all given the wretched woman over but that she said she could not die nor be at rest till she saw me and they besought me to accompany them in the coach they came in if i had one spark of charity of christian charity as they called it left  i was very loath to be diverted from my purpose by a request so unwelcome and from people so hated but at last went and we got thither by ten where a scene so shocking presented itself to me that the death of poor desponding belton is not i think to be compared with it  the old wretch had once put her leg out by her rage and violence and had been crying scolding cursing ever since the preceding evening that the surgeon had told her it was impossible to  her and that a mortification had begun to show itself insomuch that purely in compassion to their own ears they had been forced to send for another surgeon purposely to tell her though against his judgment and being a friend of the other to seem to convince him that he mistook her case and that if she would be patient she might recover but nevertheless her apprehensions of death and her antipathy to the thoughts of dying were so strong that their imposture had not the intended effect and she was raving crying cursing and even howling more like a wolf than a human creature when i came so that as i went up stairs i said surely this noise this howling cannot be from the unhappy woman sally said it was and assured me that it was nothing to the noise she had made all night and stepping into her room before me dear madam sinclair said she forbear this noise it is more like that of a bull than a woman  here comes mr belford and you will fright him away if you bellow at this rate  there were no less than eight of her cursed daughters surrounding her bed when i entered one of her partners polly horton at their head and now sally her other partner and madam carter as they called her for they are all madams with one another made the number ten all in shocking dishabille and without stays except sally carter and polly who not daring to leave her had not been in bed all night  the other seven seemed to have been but just up risen perhaps from their customers in the forehouse and their nocturnal orgies with faces three or four of them that had run the paint lying in streaky seams not half blowzd off discovering coarse wrinkled skins the hair of some of them of diverse colors obliged to the blacklead comb where black was affected the artificial jet however yielding apace to the natural brindle that of others plaistered with oil and powder the oil predominating but every ones hanging about her ears and neck in broken curls or ragged ends and each at my entrance taken with one motion stroaking their matted locks with both hands under their coifs mobs or pinners every one of which was awry they were all slipshoed stockenless some only underpetticoated all their gowns made to cover straddling hoops hanging trolloppy and tangling about their heels but hasily wrapped round them as soon as i came up stairs and half of them unpadded shoulderbent pallidlippd seeblejointed wretches appearing from a blooming nineteen or twenty perhaps overnight haggard wellworn strumpets of thirtyeight or forty  i am the more particular in describing to thee the appearance these creatures made in my eyes when i came into the room because i believe thou never saw any of them much less a group of them thus unprepared for being seen whoever has seen dean swifts ladys dressing room will think this description of mr belford not only more natural but more decent painting as well as better justified by the design and by the use that may be made of it  i for my part never did before nor had i now but upon this occasion been thus favored if thou had i believe thou would hate a profligate woman as one of swifts yahoos or virgils obscene harpyes squirting their ordure upon the trojan trenchers since the persons of such in their retirements are as filthy as their minds  hate them as much as i do and as much as i admire and next to adore a truly virtuous and elegant woman for to me it is evident that as a neat and clean woman must be an angel of a creature so a sluttish one is the impurest animal in nature  but these were the veterans the chosen band for nowandthen flitted in to the number of half a dozen or more by turns subordinate sinners undergraduates younger than some of the chosen phalanx but not less obscene in their appearance though indeed not so much beholden to the plaistering fucus yet unpropt by stays squalid loose in attire fluggishhaired underpetticoated only as the former eyes half opened winking and pinking mispatched yawning stretching as if from the unwornoff effects of the midnight revel all armed in succession with supplies of cordials of which every one present was either taster or partaker under the direction of the praetorian dorcas who nowandthen poppd in to see her slops duly given and taken  but when i approached the old wretch what a spectacle presented itself to my eyes  her misfortune has not at all sunk but rather as i thought increased her flesh rage and violence perhaps swelling her musly features behold her then spreading the whole tumbled bed with her huge quaggy carcass her millpost arms held up her broad hands clenched with violence her big eyes goggling and flamingred as we may suppose those of a salamander her matted griesly hair made irreverend by her wickedness her clouted headdress being half off spread about her fat ears and brawny neck her livid lips parched and working violently her broad chin in convulsive motion her wide mouth by reason of the contraction of her forehead which seemed to be halflost in its own frightful furrows splitting her face as it were into two parts and her huge tongue hideously rolling in it heaving puffing as if for breath her bellowsshaped and variouscoloured breasts ascending by turns to her chin and descending out of sight with the violence of her gaspings  this was the spectacle as recollection has enabled me to describe it that this wretch made to my eye when i approached her bedside surrounded as i said by her sffragans and daughters who surveyed her with scouling frighted attention which one might easily see had more in it of horror and selfconcern and selfcondemnation too than of love or pity as who should say see what we ourselves must one day be  as soon as she saw me her naturally big voice more hoarsened by her ravings broke upon me o mr belford o sir see what i am come to  see what i am brought to  to have such a cursed crew about me and not one of them to take care of me  but to let me tumble down stairs so distant from the room i went from so distant from the room i meant to go to o cursed be every careless devil  may this or worse be their fate every one of them  and then she cursed and swore more vehemently and the more as two or three of them were excusing themselves on the score of their being at that time as unable to help themselves as she  as soon as she had cleared the passage of her throat by the oaths and curses which her wild impatience made her utter she began in a more hollow and whining strain to bemoan herself and here said she  heaven grant me patience clenching and unclenching her hands am i to die thus miserably  of a broken leg in my old age  snatched away by means of my own intemperance selfdo selfundone  no time for my affairs no time to repent  and in a few hours oh  oh  with another long howling o  h  u  gh  o a kind of screaming key terminating it who knows who can tell where i shall be  oh that indeed i never never had had a being  what could one say to such a wretch as this whose whole life has been spent in the most diffusive wickedness and who has more souls to answer for of both sexes than the best divine in england ever saved  yet i told her she must be patient that her violence made her worse and that if she would compose herself she might get into a frame more proper for her present circumstances  who i interrupted she i get into a better frame i who can neither cry nor pray yet already feel the torments of the damned what mercy can i expect what hope is left for me  then that sweet creature that incomparable miss harlowe  she it seems is dead and gone  o that cursed man had it not been for him i had never had this the most crying of all my sins to answer for and then she set up another howl  and is she dead  indeed dead proceeded she when her howl was over  o what an angel have i been the means of destroying  for though it was that wicked mans fault that ever she was in my house yet it was mine and yours and yours and yours devils as we all were turning to sally to polly and to one or two more that he did not do her justice and that that is my curse and will one day be yours and then again she howled  i still advised patience i said that if her time was so short as she apprehended it to be the more ought she to endeavor to compose herself and then she would at least die with more ease to herself  and satisfaction to her friends i was going to say  but the word die put her into a violent raving and thus she broke in upon me  die did you say sir  die  i will not i cannot die  i know not how to die  die sir  and must i then die  leave this world  i cannot bear it  and who brought you hither sir her eyes striking fire at me who brought you hither to tell me i must die sir  i cannot i will not leave this world let others die who wish for another who expect a better  i have had my plagues in this but would compound for all future hopes so as i may be nothing after this and then she howled and bellowed by turns  by my faith lovelace i trembled in every joint and looking upon her who spoke this and roared thus and upon the company round me i more than once thought myself to be in one of the infernal mansions  yet will i proceed and try for thy good if i can shock thee but half as much with my descriptions as i was shocked by what i saw and heard  sally  polly  sister carter said she did you not tell me i might recover did not the surgeon tell me i might  and so you may cried sally mr garon says you may if you will be patient but as i have often told you this blessed morning you are readier to take despair from your own fears than comfort from all the hope we can give you  yet cried the wretch interrupting does not mr belford and to him you have told the truth though you will not to me does not he tell me i shall die  i cannot bear it i cannot bear the thoughts of dying   and then but that half a dozen at once endeavored to keep down her violent hands would she have beaten herself as it seems she had often attempted to do from the time the surgeon popt out the word mortification to her  well but to what purpose said i turning aside to her sister and to sally and polly are these hopes given her if the gentlemen of the faculty give her over you should let her know the worst and then she must submit for there is no running away from death if she has any matters to settle put her upon settling them and do not by telling her she will live when there is no room to expect it take from her the opportunity of doing needful things do the surgeons actually give her over  they do whispered they her gross habit they say gives no hopes we have sent for both surgeons whom we expect every minute  both the surgeons who are french for mrs sinclair has heard tourville launch out in the praise of french surgeons came in while we were thus talking i retired to the further end of the room and threw up a window for a little air being half poisoned by the effluvia arising from so many contaminated carcasses which gave me no imperfect idea of the stench of gaols which corrupting the ambient air give what is called the prisondistemper  i came back to the bedside when the surgeons had inspected the fracture and asked them if there were any expectation of her life  one of them whispered me there was none that she had a strong fever upon her which alone in such a habit would probably do the business and that the mortification had visibly gained upon her since they were there six hours ago  will amputation save her her affairs and her mind want settling a few days added to her life may be of service to her in both respects  they told me the fracture was high in her leg that the knee was greatly bruised that the mortification in all probability had spread halfway of the femur and then getting me between them three or four of the women joining us and listening with their mouths open and all the signs of ignorant wonder in their faces as there appeared of selfsufficiency in those of the artists did they by turns fill my ears with an anatomical description of the leg and thigh running over with terms of art of the tarsus the metatarsus the tibia the fibula the patella the os tali the os tibiae the tibialis posticus and tibialis anticus up to the os femoris to the acetabulum of the os ischion the great trochnter glutes triceps levidus and little rotators in short of all the muscles cartilages and bones that constitute the leg and thigh from the great toe to the hip as if they would show me that all their science had penetrated their heads no farther than their mouths while sally lifted up her hands with a laud bless me are all surgeons so learned  but at last both the gentlemen declared that if she and her friends would consent to amputation they would whip off her leg in a moment  mrs carter asked to what purpose if the operation would not save her  very true they said but it might be a satisfaction to the patients friends that all was done that could be done  and so e poor wretch was to be lanced and quartered as i may say for an experiment only and without any hope of benefit from the operation was to pay the surgeons for tormenting her  i cannot but say i have a mean opinion of both these gentlemen who though they make a figure it seems in their way of living and boast not only a french extraction but a paris education never will make any in their practice  how unlike my honest english friend tomkins a plain serious intelligent man whose art lies deeper than in words who always avoids parade and jargon and endeavors to make every one as much a judge of what he is about as himself  all the time the surgeons run on with their anatomical process the wretched woman most frightfully roared and bellowed which the gentlemen who showed themselves to be of the class of those who are not affected with the evils they do not feel took no other notice of than by raising their voices to be heard as she raised hers  being evidently more sollicitous to increase their acquaintance and to propagate the notion of their skill than to attend to the clamours of the poor wretch whom they were called in to relieve though by this very means like the dog and the shadow in the fable they lost both aims with me for i never was deceived in one rule which i made early to wit that the stillest water is the deepest while the bubbling stream only betrays shallowness and that stones and pebbles lie there so near the surface to point out the best place to ford a river dryshod  as no body cared to tell the unhappy wretch what every one apprehended must follow and what the surgeons convinced me soon would i undertook to be the denouncer of her doom accordingly the operators being withdrawn i sat down by the bedside and said come mrs sinclair let me advise you to forbear these ravings at the carelssnes of those who i find at the time could take no care of themselves and since the accident has happened and cannot be remedied to resolve to make the best of the matter for all this violence but enrages the malady and you will probably fall into a delirium if you give way to it which will deprive you of that reason which you ought to make the best of for the time it may be lent you  she turned her head toward me and hearing me speak with a determined voice and seeing me assume as determined an air became more calm and attentive  i went on telling her that i was glad from the hints she had given to find her concerned for her past misspent life and particularly for the part she had had in the ruin of the most excellent woman on earth that if she would compose herself and patiently submit to the consequence of an evil she had brought upon herself it might possibly be happy for her yet mean time continued i tell me with temper and calmness why you was so desirous to see me  she seemed to be in great confusion of thought and turned her head this way and that and at last after much hesitation said alas for me i hardly know what i wanted with you when i awoke from my intemperate trance and found what a cursed way i was in my conscience smote me and i was for catching like a drowning wretch at every straw i wanted to see everybody and anybody but those i did see everybody whom i thought could give me comfort yet could i expect none from you neither for you had declared yourself my enemy although i had never done you harm for what jackey in her old tone whining through her nose was miss harlowe to you  but she is happy  but oh what will become of me  yet tell me for the surgeons have told you the truth no doubt tell me shall i do well again may i recover if i may i will begin a new course of life as i hope to be saved i will i will renounce you all  every one of you looking round her and scrape all i can together and live a life of penitence and when i die leave it all to charitable uses  i will by my soul  every doit of it to charity  but this once lifting up her rolling eyes and folded hands with a wrymouthed earnestness in which every muscle and feature of her face bore its part this one time  good god of heaven and earth but this once this once repeating those words five or six times spare thy poor creature and every hour of my life shall be penitence and atonement upon my soul it shall  less vehement a little less vehement said i  it is not for me who have led so free a life as you but too well know to talk to you in a reproaching strain and to set before you the iniquity you have lived in and the many souls you have helped to destroy but as you are in so penitent a way if i might advise it should be to send for a good clergyman the purity of whose lise and manners may make all these things come from him with a better grace than they can from me  how sir what sir interrupting me send for a parson  then you indeed think i shall die then you think there is no room for hope  a parson sir  who sends for a parson while there is any hope left the sight of a parson would be death immediate to me  i cannot cannot die  never tell me of it  what die  what cut off in the midst of my sins  and then she began to rave again  i cannot bear said i rising from my seat with a stern air to see a reasonable creature behave so outrageously  will this vehemence think you mend the matter will it avail you any thing will it not rather shorten the life you are so desirous to have lengthened and deprive you of the only opportunity you can ever have to settle your affairs for both worlds  this is but the common lot and if it will be yours soon looking at her it will be also yours and yours and yours speaking with a raised voice and turning to every trembling devil round her for they all shook at my forcible application and mine also and you have reason to be thankful that you did not perish in that act of intemperance which brought you to this for it might have been your neck as well as your leg and then you had not had the opportunity you now have for repentance  and the lord have mercy upon you into what a state might you have awaked  then did the poor wretch set up an inarticulate frightful howl such a one as i never before heard uttered as if already pangs infernal had taken hold of her and seeing every one halffrighted and me motioning to withdraw o pity me pity me mr belford cried she her words interrupted by groans i find you think i shall die and what i may be and where in a very few hours  who can tell  i told her it was in vain to flatter her it was my opinion she would not recover  i was going to readvise her to calm her spirits and endeavor to resign herself and to make the best of the opportunity yet left her but this declaration set her into a most outrageous raving she would have torn her hair and beaten her breast had not some of the wretches held her hands by force while others kept her as steady as they could lest she should again put out her newset leg so that seeing her thus incapable of advice and in a perfect phrensy i told sally martin that there was no bearing the room and that their best way was to send for a minister to pray by her and to reason with her as soon as she should be capable of it  and so i left them and never was so sensible of the benefit of fresh air as i was the moment i entered the street  nor is it to be wondered at when it is considered that to the various ill smells that will be always found in a close sickbed room since generally when the physician comes the air is shut out this of mrs sinclair was the more particularly offensive as to the scent of plasters embrocations and ointments were added the stenches of spirituous liquors burnt and unburnt of all denominations for one or other of the creatures under pretense of colics gripes qualms or insurrections were continually calling for supplies of these all the time i was there and yet this is thought to be a genteel house of the sort and all the prostitutes in it are prostitutes of price and their visiters people of note  o lovelace what lives do most of us rakes and libertines lead what company do we keep and for such company what society renounce or endeavor to make like these  what woman nice in her person and of purity in her mind and manners did she know what miry wallowers the generality of men of our class are in themselves and constantly trough and sty with but would detest the thoughts of associating with such filthy sensualists whose favorite taste carries them to mingle with the dregs of stews brothels and commonsewers  yet to such a choice are many worthy women betrayed by that false and inconsiderate notion raised and propagated no doubt by the author of all delusion that a reformed rake makes the best husband we rakes indeed are bold enough to suppose that women in general are as much rakes in their hearts as the libertines some of them suffer themselves to be taken with are in their practice a supposition therefore which it behooves persons of true honor of that sex to discountenance by rejecting the address of every man whose character will not stand the test of that virtue which is the glory of a woman and indeed i may say of a man too why should it not  how indeed can it be if this point be duly weighed that a man who thinks alike of all the sex and knows it to be in the power of a wife to do him the greatest dishonor man can receive and doubts not her will to do it if opportunity offer and importunity be not wanting that such a one from principle should be a good husband to any woman and indeed little do innocents think what a total revolution of manners what a change of fixed habits nay what a conquest of a bad nature is required to make a man a good husband a worthy father and true friend from principle especially when it is considered that it is not in a mans own power to reform when he will this to say nothing of my own experience thou have found in the progress of thy attempts upon the divine miss harlowe for whose remorses could be either deeper or more frequent and whose more transient  dont be disgusted that i mingle such grave reflections as these with my narratives it becomes me in my present way of thinking to do so when i see in miss harlowe how all human excellence and in poor belton how all inhuman libertinism and am near seeing in this abandoned woman how all diabolical profligateness end and glad should i be for your own sake for your splendid familys sake and for the sake of all your intimates and acquaintance that you were laboring under the same impressions that so we who have been companions in and promoters of one anothers wickedness might join in a general atonement to the utmost of our power  i came home reflecting upon all these things more edifying to me than any sermon i could have heard preached and i shall conclude this long letter with observing that although i left the wretched howler in a high phrensyfit which was excessively shocking to the bystanders yet her phrensy is the happiest part of her dreadful condition for when she is herself as it is called what must be her reflections upon her past profligate life throughout which it has been her constant delight and business devillike to make others as wicked as herself what must her terrors be a hell already begun in her mind on looking forward to the dreadful state she is now upon the verge of  but i drop my trembling pen  to have done with so shocking a subject at once we shall take notice that mr belford in a future letter writes that the miserable woman to the surprise of the operators themselves through hourly increasing tortures of body and mind held out so long as till thursday sept    and then died in such agonies as terrified into a transitory penitence all the wretches about her    letter lxxix colonel morden to john belford esquire sunday night sept  0 dear sir according to my promise i send you an account of matters here poor mrs norton was so very ill upon the road that slowly as the hearse moved and the chariot followed i was afraid we should not have got her to st albans we put up there as i had intended i was in hopes that she would have been better for the stop but i was forced to leave her behind me i ordered the servantmaid you was so considerately kind as to send down with her to be very careful of her and left the chariot to attend her she deserves all the regard that can be paid her not only upon my cousins account but on her own she is an excellent woman  when we were within five miles of harloweplace i put on a handgallop i ordered the hearse to proceed more slowly still the crossroad we were in being rough and having more time before us than i wanted for i wished not the hearse to be in till near dusk  i got to my cousins about   oclock you may believe i found a mournful house you desire me to be very minute  at my entrance into the court they were all in motion every servant whom i saw had swelled eyes and looked with so much concern that at first i apprehended some new disaster had happened in the family  mr john and mr antony harlowe and mrs hervey were there they all helped on one anothers grief as they had before each others hardness of heart  my cousin james met me at the entrance of the hall his countenance expressed a fixed concern and he desired me to excuse his behavior the last time i was there  my cousin arabella came to me full of tears and grief o cousin said she hanging upon my arm i dare not ask you any questions  about the approach of the hearse i suppose she meant  i myself was full of grief and without going farther or speaking sat down in the hall in the first chair  the brother sat down on one hand of me the sister on the other both were silent the latter in tears  mr antony harlowe came to me soon after his face was overspread with all the appearance of woe he requested me to walk into the parlour where as he said were all his fellowmourners  i attended him in my cousins james and arabella followed me  a perfect concert of grief as i may say broke out the moment i entered the parlour  my cousin harlowe the dear creatures father as soon as he saw me said o cousin cousin of all our family you are the only one who have nothing to reproach yourself with  you are a happy man  the poor mother bowing her head to me in speechless grief sat with her handkerchief held to her eyes with one hand the other hand was held by her sister hervey between both hers mrs hervey weeping upon it  near the window sat mr john harlowe his face and his body were turned from the sorrowing company his eyes were red and swelled  my cousin antony at his reentering the parlour went toward mrs harlowe  dont  dear sister said he  then toward my cousin harlowe  dont  dear brother  dont thus give way  and without being able to say another word went to a corner of the parlour and wanting himself the comfort he would fain have given sunk into a chair and audibly sobbed  miss arabella followed her uncle antony as he walked in before me and seemed as if she would have spoken to the pierced mother some words of comfort but she was unable to utter them and got behind her mothers chair and inclining her face over it on the unhappy ladys shoulder seemed to claim the consolation that indulgent parent used but then was unable to afford her  young mr harlowe with all his vehemence of spirit was now subdued his selfreproaching conscience no doubt was the cause of it  and what sir must their thoughts be which at that moment in a manner deprived them all of motion and turned their speech into sighs and groans  how to be pitied how greatly to be pitied all of them but how much to be cursed that abhorred lovelace who as it seems by arts uncommon and a villainy without example has been the sole author of a woe so complicated and extensive  god judge me as  but i stop  the man is your friend  he already suffers you tell me in his intellect  restore him heaven to that  if i find the matter come out as i apprehend it will  indeed her own hints of his usage of her as in her will and in her first letter to me are enough  nor think my beloved cousin thou darling of my heart that thy gentle spirit breathing charity and forgiveness to the vilest of men shall avail him  but once more i stop  forgive me sir  who could behold such a scene who could recollect it in order to describe it as minutely as you wished me to relate how this unhappy family were affected on this sad occasion every one of the mourners nearly related to himself and not be exasperated against the author of all  as i was the only person grieved as i was myself from whom any of them at that instant could derive comfort let us not said i my dear cousin approaching the inconsolable mother give way to a grief which however just can now avail us nothing we hurt ourselves and cannot recall the dear creature for whom we mourn nor would you wish it if you knew with what assurances of eternal happiness she left the world  she is happy madam  depend upon it she is happy and comfort yourselves with that assurance  o cousin cousin cried the unhappy mother withdrawing her hand from her sister hervey and pressing mine with it you know not what a child i have lost  then in a lower voice and how lost  that it is that makes the loss insupportable  they all joined in a kind of melancholy chorus and each accused him and herself and some of them one another but the eyes of all in turn were cast upon my cousin james as the person who had kept up the general resentment against so sweet a creature while he was hardly able to bear his own remorse nor miss harlowe hers she breaking out into words how tauntingly did i write to her how barbarously did i insult her yet how patiently did she take it  who would have thought she had been so near her end  o brother brother  but for you  but for you   double not upon me said he my own woes  i have every thing before me that has passed  i thought only to reclaim a dear creature that had erred i intended not to break her tender heart  but it was the villainous lovelace who did that  not any of us  yet cousin did she not attribute all to me  i fear she did  tell me only did she name me did she speak of me in her last hours i hope she who could forgive the greatest villain on earth and plead that he may be safe from our vengeance i hope she could forgive me  she died blessing you all and justified rather than condemned your severity to her  then they set up another general lamentation we see said her father enough we see in her heartpiercing letters to us what a happy frame she was in a few days before her death but did it hold to the last had she no repinings had the dear child no heartburnings  none at all  i never saw and never shall see so blessed a departure and no wonder for i never heard of such a preparation every hour for weeks together was taken up in it let this be our comfort  we need only to wish for so happy an end for ourselves and for those who are nearest to our hearts we may any of us be grieved for acts of unkindness to her but had all happened that once she wished for she could not have made a happier perhaps not so happy an end  dear soul and dear sweet soul the father uncles sister my cousin hervey cried out all at once in accents of anguish inexpressibly affecting  we must for ever be disturbed for those acts of unkindness to so sweet a child cried the unhappy mother  indeed indeed softly to her sister hervey i have been too passive much too passive in this case  the temporary quiet i have been so studious all my life to preserve has cost me everlasting disquiet   there she stopped  dear sister was all mrs hervey could say  i have done but half my duty to the dearest and most meritorious of children resumed the sorrowing mother  nay not half  how have we hardened our hearts against her   again her tears choked up the passage of her words  my dearest dearest sister again was all mrs hervey could say  would to heaven proceeded exclaiming the poor mother i had but once seen her then turning to my cousin james and his sister  o my son o my arabella if we were to receive as little mercy   and there again she stopped her tears interrupting her further speech every one all the time remaining silent their countenances showing a grief in their hearts too big for expression  now you see mr belford that my dearest cousin could be allowed all her merit  what a dreadful thing is afterreflection upon a conduct so perverse and unnatural  o this cursed friend of yours mr belford this detested lovelace  to him to him is owing   pardon me sir i will lay down my pen till i have recovered my temper  one in the morning in vain sir have i endeavored to compose myself to rest you wished me to be very particular and i cannot help it this melancholy subject fills my whole mind i will proceed though it be midnight  about six oclock the hearse came to the outward gate the parish church is at some distance but the wind sitting fair the afflicted family were struck just before it came into a fresh fit of grief on hearing the funeral bell tolled in a very solemn manner a respect as it proved and as they all guessed paid to the memory of the dear deceased out of officious love as the hearse passed near the church  judge when their grief was so great in expectation of it what it must be when it arrived  a servant came in to acquaint us with what its lumbering heavy noise up the paved inner courtyard apprized us of before  he spoke not he could not speak he looked bowed and withdrew  i stepped out no one else could then stir her brother however soon followed me  when i came to the door i beheld a sight very affecting  you have heard sir how universally my dear cousin was beloved by the poor and middling sort especially no young lady was ever so much beloved and with reason she was the common patroness of all the honest poor in her neighborhood  it is natural for us in every deep and sincere grief to interest all we know in what is so concerning to ourselves the servants of the family it seems had told their friends and those theirs that though living their dear young lady could not be received nor looked upon her body was permitted to be brought home the space of time was so confined that those who knew when she died must easily guess near the time the hearse was to come a hearse passing through country villages and from london however slenderly attended for the chariot as i have said waited upon poor mrs norton takes every ones attention nor was it hard to guess whose this must be though not adorned by escutcheons when the crossroads to harloweplace were taken as soon as it came within six miles of it so that the hearse and the solemn tolling of the bell had drawn together at least fifty of the neighboring men women and children and some of good appearance not a soul of them it seems with a dry eye and each lamenting the death of this admired lady who as i am told never stirred out but somebody was the better for her  these when the coffin was taken out of the hearse crouding about it hindered for a few moments its being carried in the young people struggling who should bear it and yet with respectful whisperings rather than clamorous contention a mark of veneration i had never before seen paid upon any occasion in all my travels from the underbred many from whom noise is generally inseparable in all their emulations at last six maidens were permitted to carry it in by the six handles  the corpse was thus borne with the most solemn respect into the hall and placed for the present upon two stools there the plates and emblems and inscription set every one gazing upon the lid and admiring the more when they were told that all was of her own ordering they wished to be permitted a sight of the corpse but rather mentioned this as their wish than their hope when they had all satisfied their curiosity and remarked upon the emblems they dispersed with blessings upon her memory and with tears and lamentations pronouncing her to be happy and inferring that were she not so what would become of them while others ran over with repetitions of the good she delighted to do nor were there wanting those among them who heaped curses upon the man who was the author of her fall  the servants of the family then got about the coffin they could not before and that afforded a new scene of sorrow but a silent one for they spoke only by their eyes and by sighs looking upon the lid and upon one another by turns with hands lifted up the presence of their young master possibly might awe them and cause their grief to be expressed only in dumb show  as for mr james harlowe who had accompanied me but withdrew when he saw the crowd he stood looking upon the lid when the people had left it with a fixed attention yet i dare say knew not a symbol or letter upon it at that moment had the question been asked him in a profound reverie he stood his arms folded his head on one side and marks of stupefaction imprinted upon every feature  but when the corpse was carried into the lesser parlour adjoining to the hall which she used to call her parlour and put on a table in the middle of the room and the father and mother the two uncles her aunt hervey and her sister came in joining her brother and me with trembling feet and eager woe the scene was still more affecting their sorrow was heightened no doubt by the remembrance of their unforgiving severity and now seeing before them the receptacle that contained the glory of their family who so lately was driven thence by their indiscreet violence never never more to be restored to them no wonder that their grief was more than common grief  they would have withheld the mother it seems from coming in but when they could not though undetermined before they all bore her company led on by an impulse they could not resist the poor lady but just cast her eye upon the coffin and then snatched it away retiring with passionate grief toward the window yet addressing herself with clasped hands as if to her beloved daughter o my child my child cried she thou pride of my hope why was i not permitted to speak pardon and peace to thee  o forgive thy cruel mother  her son his heart then softened as his eyes showed besought her to withdraw and her woman looking in at that moment he called her to assist him in conducting her lady into the middle parlour and then returning met his father going out at the door who also had but just cast his eye on the coffin and yielded to my entreaties to withdraw  his grief was too deep for utterance till he saw his son coming in and then fetching a heavy groan never said he was sorrow like my sorrow  o son son  in a reproaching accent his face turned from him  i attended him through the middle parlour endeavoring to console him his lady was there in agonies she took his eye he made a motion toward her o my dear said he  but turning short his eyes as full as his heart he hastened through to the great parlour and when there he desired me to leave him to himself  her uncles and her sister looked and turned away looked and turned away very often upon the emblems in silent sorrow mrs hervey would have read to them the inscription  these words she did read here the wicked cease from troubling but could read no further her tears fell in large drops upon the plate she was contemplating and yet she was desirous of gratifying a curiosity that mingled impatience with her grief because she could not gratify it although she often wiped her eyes as they flowed  judge you mr belford for you have great humanity how i must be affected yet was i forced to try to comfort them all  but here i will close this letter in order to send it to you in the morning early nevertheless i will begin another upon supposition that my doleful prolixity will not be disagreeable to you indeed i am altogether indisposed for rest as i mentioned before so can do nothing but write i have also more melancholy scenes to paint my pen if i may so say is untired these scenes are fresh in my memory and i myself perhaps may owe to you the favor of a reviewal of them with such other papers as you shall think proper to oblige me with when heavy grief has given way to milder melancholy  my servant in his way to you with this letter shall call at st albans upon the good woman that he may inform you how she does miss arabella asked me after her when i withdrew to my chamber to which she complaisantly accompanied me she was much concerned at the bad way we left her in and said her mother would be more so  no wonder that the dear departed who foresaw the remorse that would fall to the lot of this unhappy family when they came to have the news of her death confirmed to them was so grieved for their apprehended grief and endeavored to comfort them by her posthumous letters but it was still a greater generosity in her to try to excuse them to me as she did when we were alone together a few hours before she died and to aggravate more than as far as i can find she ought to have done the only error she was ever guilty of the more freely however perhaps exalted creature that i might think the better of her friends although at her own expense i am dear sir  your faithful and obedient servant wm morden   letter lxxx colonel morden in continuation when the unhappy mourners were all retired i directed the lid of the coffin to be unscrewed and caused some fresh aromatics and flowers to be put into it  the corpse was very little altered notwithstanding the journey the sweet smile remained  the maids who brought the flowers were ambitious of strewing them about it they poured forth fresh lamentations over her each wishing she had been so happy as to have been allowed to attend her in london one of them particularly who is it seems my cousin arabellas personal servant was more clamorous in her grief than the rest and the moment she turned her back all the others allowed she had reason for it i enquired afterward about her and found that this creature was set over my dear cousin when she was confined to her chamber by their indiscreet severity  good heaven that they should treat and suffer thus to be treated a young lady who was qualified to give laws to all her family  when my cousins were told that the lid was unscrewd they pressed in again all but the mournful father and mother as if by consent mrs hervey kissed her pale lips flower of the world was all she could say and gave place to miss arabella who kissing the forehead of her whom she had so cruelly treated could only say to my cousin james looking upon the corpse and upon him o brother  while he taking the fair lifeless hand kissed it and retreated with precipitation  her two uncles were speechless they seemed to wait each others example whether to look upon the corpse or not i ordered the lid to be replaced and then they pressed forward as the others again did to take a last farewell of the casket which so lately contained so rich a jewel  then it was that the grief of each found fluenter expression and the fair corpse was addressed to with all the tenderness that the sincerest love and warmest admiration could inspire by each according to their different degrees of relationship as if none of them had before looked upon her she was their very niece both uncles said the injured saint her uncle harlowe the same smiling sister arabella  the dear creature all of them  the same benignity of countenance the same sweet composure the same natural dignity  she was questionless happy that sweet smile betokened her being so themselves most unhappy  and then once more the brother took the lifeless hand and vowed revenge upon it on the cursed author of all this distress  the unhappy parents proposed to take one last view and farewell of their once darling daughter the father was got to the parlourdoor after the inconsolable mother but neither of them were able to enter it the mother said he must once more see the child of her heart or she should never enjoy herself but they both agreed to refer their melancholy curiosity till the next day and hand in hand retired inconsolable and speechless both their faces overspread with woe and turned from each other as unable each to behold the distress of the other  when all were withdrawn i retired and sent for my cousin james and acquainted him with his sisters request in relation to the discourse to be pronounced at her interrment telling him how necessary it was that the minister whoever he were to be should have the earliest notice given him that the case would admit  he lamented the death of the reverend dr lewen who as he said was a great admirer of his sister as she was of him and would have been the fittest of all men for that office  he spoke with great asperity of mr brand upon whose light enquiry after his sisters character in town he was willing to lay some of the blame due to himself  mr melvill dr lewens assistant must he said be the man and he praised him for his abilities his elocution and unexceptionable manners and promised to engage him early in the morning  he called out his sister and she was of his opinion so i left this upon them  they both with no little warmth hinted their disapprobation of you sir for their sisters executor on the score of your intimate friendship with the author of her ruin  you must not resent any thing i shall communicate to you of what they say on this occasion depending that you will not i shall write with the greater freedom  i told them how much my dear cousin was obliged to your friendship and humanity the injunctions she had laid you under and your own inclination to observe them i said that you were a man of honor that you were desirous of consulting me because you would not willingly give offense to any of them and that i was very fond of cultivating your favor and correspondence  they said there was no need of an executor out of their family and they hoped that you sir would relinquish so unnecessary a trust as they called it my cousin james declared that he would write to you as soon as the funeral was over to desire that you would do so upon proper assurances that all that the will prescribed should be performed  i said you were a man of resolution that i thought he would hardly succeed for that you made a point of honor of it  i then showed them their sisters posthumous letter to you in which she confesses her obligations to you and regard for you and for your future welfare see page      you may believe sir they were extremely affected with the perusal of it  they were surprised that i had given up to you the proceed of her grandfathers estate since his death i told them plainly that they must thank themselves if any thing disagreeable to them occurred from their sisters devise deserted and thrown into the hands of strangers as she had been  they said they would report all i had said to their father and mother adding that great as their trouble was they found they had more still to come but if mr belford were to be the executor of her will contrary to their hopes they besought me to take the trouble of transacting every thing with you that a friend of the man to whom they owed all their calamity might not appear to them  they were extremely moved at the text their sister had chosen for the subject of the funeral discourse see the will page  0   i had extracted from the will that article supposing it probable that i might not so soon have an opportunity to show them the will itself as would otherwise have been necessary on account of the interrment which cannot be delayed  monday morning between eight and nine the unhappy family are preparing for a mournful meeting at breakfast mr james harlowe who has had as little rest as i has written to mr melvill who has promised to draw up a brief eulogium on the deceased miss how is expected here byandby to see for the last time her beloved friend  miss how by her messenger desires she may not be taken any notice of she shall not tarry six minutes was the word her desire will be easily granted her  her servant who brought the request if it were denied was to return and meet her for she was ready to set out in her chariot when he got on horseback  if he met her not with the refusal he was to stay here till she came i am sir  your faithful humble servant william morden   letter lxxxi colonel morden in continuation monday afternoon sept    sir we are such bad company here to one another that it is some relief to retire and write  i was summoned to breakfast about half an hour after nine slowly did the mournful congress meet each liftless and spiritless took our place with swollen eyes inquiring without expecting any tolerable account how each had rested  the sorrowing mother gave for answer that she should never more know what rest was  by the time we were well seated the bell ringing the outward gate opening a chariot rattling over the pavement of the courtyard put them into emotion  i left them and was just time enough to give miss how my hand as she alighted her maid in tears remaining in the chariot  i think you told me sir you never saw miss how she is a fine graceful young lady a fixed melancholy on her whole aspect overclouded a vivacity and fire which nevertheless darted nowandthen through the awful gloom i shall ever respect her for her love to my dear cousin  never did i think said she as she gave me her hand to enter more these doors but living or dead my clarissa brings me after her anywhither  she entered with me the little parlour the moment she saw the coffin she withdrew her hand from mine and with impatience pushed aside the lid as impatiently she removed the facecloth in a wild air she clasped her uplifted hands together and now looked upon the corpse now up to heaven as if appealing her woes to that her bosom heaved and fluttered discernible through her handkerchief and at last she broke silence  o sir  see you not here  see you not here  the glory of her sex  thus by the most villainous of yours  thus  laid low  o my blessed friend said she  my sweet companion  my lovely monitress  kissing her lips at every tender invocation and is this all  is it all of my clarissas story  then after a short pause and a profound sigh she turned to me and then to her breathless friend  but is she can she be really dead  o no no  she only sleeps  awake my beloved friend my sweet claycold friend awake let thy anna how revive thee my dear creature  by her warm breath revive thee and kissing her again let my warm lips animate thy cold ones  then sighing again as from the bottom of her heart and with an air as if disappointed that she answered not and can such perfection end thus  and art thou really and indeed flown from thy anna how  o my unkind clarissa  she was silent a few moments and then seeming to recover herself she turned to me  forgive forgive mr morden this wild frensy  i am not myself  i never shall be  you know not the excellence no not half the excellence that is thus laid low  repeating this cannot surely be all of my clarissas story  again pausing one tear my beloved friend did thou allow me  but this dumb sorrow  o for a tear to ease my fullswoln heart that is just bursting   but why sir why mr morden was she sent hither why not to me  she has no father no mother no relations no not one  they had all renounced her i was her sympathizing friend  and had not i the best right to my dear creatures remains  and must names without nature be preferred to such a love as mine  again she kissed her lips each cheek her forehead  and sighed as if her heart would break   but why why said she was i withheld from seeing my dearest dear friend before she commenced angel  delaying still and too easily persuaded to delay the friendly visit that my heart panted after what pain will this reflection give me  o my blessed friend who knows who knows had i come in time what my cordial comfortings might have done for thee  but  looking round her as if she apprehended seeing some of the family  one more kiss my angel my friend my evertoberegretted lost companion and let me fly this hated house which i never loved but for thy sake  adieu then my dearest clarissa  thou art happy i doubt not as thou assuredst me in thy last letter  o may we meet and rejoice together where no villainous lovelaces no hardhearted relations will ever shock our innocence or ruffle our felicity  again she was silent unable to go though seeming to intend it struggling as it were with her grief and heaving with anguish at last happily a flood of tears gushed from her eyes  now  now  said she shall i  shall i  be easier but for this kindly relief my heart would have burst asunder  more many more tears than these are due to my clarissa whose counsel has done for me what mine could not do for her  but why looking earnestly upon her her hands clasped and lifted up  but why do i thus lament the happy and that thou art so is my comfort it is it is my dear creature kissing her again  excuse me sir turning to me who was as much moved as herself i loved the dear creature as never woman loved another excuse my frantic grief how has the glory of her sex fallen a victim to villainy and to hardheartedness  madam said i they all have it  now indeed they have it   and let them have it  i should belly my love for the friend of my heart were i to pity them  but how unhappy am i looking upon the corpse that i saw her not before these eyes were shut before these lips were for ever closed  oh sir you know not the wisdom that continually flowed from these lips when she spoke  nor what a friend i have lost  then surveying the lid she seemed to take in at once the meaning of the emblems and this gave her so much fresh grief that though she several times wiped her eyes she was unable to read the inscription and texts turning therefore to me favor me sir i pray you by a line with the description of these emblems and with these texts and if i might be allowed a lock of the dear creatures hair   i told her that her executor would order both and would also send her a copy of her will in which she would find the most grateful remembrances of her love for her whom she calls the sister of her heart  justly said she does she call me so for we had but one heart but one soul between us and now my better half is torn from me  what shall i do  but looking round her on a servants stepping by the door as if again she had apprehended it was some of the family  once more said she a solemn an everlasting adieu  alas for me a solemn an everlasting adieu  then again embracing her face with both her hands and kissing it and afterward the hands of the dear deceased first one then the other she gave me her hand and quitting the room with precipitation rushed into her chariot and when there with profound sighs and a fresh burst of tears unable to speak she bowed her head to me and was driven away  the inconsolable company saw how much i had been moved on my return to them mr james harlowe had been telling them what had passed between him and me and finding myself unfit for company and observing that they broke off talk at my comingin i thought it proper to leave them to their consultations  and here i will put an end to this letter for indeed sir the very recollection of this affecting scene has left me nearly as unable to proceed as i was just after it to converse with my cousins i am sir with great truth  your most obedient humble servant william morden  letter lxxxii colonel morden in continuation tuesday morning sept    the good mrs norton is arrived a little amended in her spirits owing to the very posthumous letters as i may call them which you mr belford as well as i apprehended would have had fatal effects upon her  i cannot but attribute this to the right turn of her mind it seems she has been inured to afflictions and has lived in a constant hope of a better life and having no acts of unkindness to the dear deceased to reproach herself with is most considerately resolved to exert her utmost fortitude in order to comfort the sorrowing mother  o mr belford how does the character of my dear departed cousin rise upon me from every mouth  had she been my own child or my sister  but do you think that the man who occasioned this great this extended ruin  but i forbear  the will is not to be looked into till the funeral rites are performed preparations are making for the solemnity and the servants as well as principals of all the branches of the family are put into deep mourning  i have seen mr melvill he is a serious and sensible man i have given him particulars to go upon in the discourse he is to pronounce at the funeral but had the less need to do this as i find he is extremely well acquainted with the whole unhappy story and was a personal admirer of my dear cousin and a sincere lamenter of her misfortunes and death the reverend dr lewen who is but very lately dead was his particular friend and had once intended to recommend him to her favor  i am just returned from attending the afflicted parents in an effort they made to see the corpse of their beloved child they had requested my company and that of the good mrs norton a last leave the mother said she must take  an effort however it was and no more the moment they came in sight of the coffin before the lid could be put aside o my dear said the father retreating i cannot i find i cannot bear it  had i  had i  had i never been hardhearted  then turning round to his lady he had but just time to catch her in his arms and prevent her sinking on the floor o my dearest life said he this is too much  too much indeed  let us let us retire mrs norton who attracted by the awful receptacle had but just left the good lady hastened to her  dear dear woman cried the unhappy parent flinging her arms about her neck bear me bear me hence  o my child my child my own clarissa harlowe thou pride of my life so lately  never never more must i behold thee  i supported the unhappy father mrs norton the sinking mother into the next parlour she threw herself on a settee there he into an elbowchair by her the good woman at her feet her arms clasped round her waist the two mothers as i may call them of my beloved cousin thus tenderly engaged  what a variety of distress in these woeful scenes  the unhappy father in endeavoring to comfort his lady loaded himself would to god my dear said he would to god i had no more to charge myself with than you have  you relented  you would have prevailed upon me to relent  the greater my fault said she when i knew that displeasure was carried too high to acquiesce as i did what a barbarous parent was i to let two angry children make me forget that i was mother to a third  to such a third   mrs norton used arguments and prayers to comfort her  o my dear norton answered the unhappy lady you was the dear creatures more natural mother  would to heaven i had no more to answer for than you have  thus the unhappy pair unavailingly recriminated till my cousin hervey entered and with mrs norton conducted up to her own chamber the inconsolable mother the two uncles and mr hervey came in at the same time and prevailed upon the afflicted father to retire with them to his  both giving up all thoughts of ever seeing more the child whose death was so deservedly regretted by them  time only mr belford can combat with advantage such a heavy deprivation as this advice will not do while the loss is recent nature will have way given to it and so it ought till sorrow has in a manner exhausted itself and then reason and religion will come in seasonably with their powerful aids to raise the drooping heart  i see here no face that is the same i saw at my first arrival proud and haughty every countenance then unyielding to entreaty now how greatly are they humbled  the utmost distress is apparent in every protracted feature and in every bursting muscle of each disconsolate mourner their eyes which so lately flashed anger and resentment now are turned to every one that approaches them as if imploring pity  could ever wilful hardheartedness be more severely punished  the following lines of juvenal are upon the whole applicable to this house and family i have revolved them many times since sunday evening humani generis mores tibi nosse volenti sufficit una domus paucos consume dies and dicere te miserum postquam illin veneris aude   let me add that mrs norton has communicated to the family the posthumous letter sent her this letter affords a foundation for future consolation to them but at present it has newpointed their grief by making them reflect on their cruelty to so excellent a daughter niece and sister this letter contains in substance her thanks to the good woman for her care of her in her infancy for her good instructions and the excellent example she had set her with selfaccusations of a vanity and presumption which lay lurking in her heart unknown to herself till her calamities obliging her to look into herself brought them to light  she expatiates upon the benefit of afflictions to a mind modest fearful and diffident  she comforts her on her early death having finished as she says her probatory course at so early a time of life when many are not ripened by the sunshine of divine grace for a better till they are  0  0 or  0 years of age  i hope says she that my father will grant the request i have made to him in my last will to let you pass the remainder of your days at my dairyhouse as it used to be called where once i promised myself to be happy in you your discretion prudence and economy my dear good woman will make your presiding over the concerns of that house as beneficial to them as it can be convenient to you for your sake my dear mrs norton i hope they will make you this offer and if they do i hope you will accept of it for theirs  she remembers herself to her fosterbrother in a very kind manner and charges her for his sake that she will not take too much to heart what has befallen her  she concludes as follows  remember me in the last place to all my kind wellwishers of your acquaintance and to those whom i used to call my poor they will be gods poor if they trust in him i have taken such care that i hope they will not be losers by my death bid them therefore rejoice and do you also my reverend comforter and sustainer as well in my darker as in my fairer days likewise rejoice that i am so soon delivered from the evils that were before me and that i am now when this comes to your hand as i humbly trust exulting in the mercies of a gracious god who has conducted me through the greatest trials in safety and put so happy an end to all my temptations and distresses and who i most humbly trust will in his own good time give us a joyful meeting in the regions of eternal blessedness    i am dear sir  your faithful humble servant wm morden  letter lxxxiii colonel morden in continuation thursday night sept    we are just returned from the solemnization of the last mournful rite my cousin james and his sister mr and mrs hervey and their daughter a young lady whose affection for my departed cousin shall ever bind me to her my cousins john and antony harlowe myself and some other more distant relations of the names of fuller and allinson who to testify their respect to the memory of the dear deceased had put themselves in mourning selfinvited attended it  the father and mother would have joined in these last honors had they been able but they were both very much indisposed and continue to be so  the inconsolable mother told mrs norton that the two mothers of the sweetest child in the world ought not on this occasion to be separated she therefore desired her to stay with her  the whole solemnity was performed with great decency and order the distance from harloweplace to the church is about half a mile all the way the corpse was attended by great numbers of people of all conditions  it was nine when it entered the church every corner of which was croded such a profound such a silent respect did i never see paid at the funeral of princes an attentive sadness overspread the face of all  the eulogy pronounced by mr melvill was a very pathetic one he wiped his own eyes often and made every body present still oftener wipe theirs  the auditors were most particularly affected when he told them that the solemn text was her own choice  he enumerated her fine qualities naming with honor their late worthy pastor for his authority  every enumerated excellence was witnessed to in different parts of the church in respectful whispers by different persons as of their own knowledge as i have been since informed  when he pointed to the pew where doing credit to religion by her example she used to sit or kneel the whole auditory as one person turned to the pw with the most respectful solemnity as if she had been herself there  when the gentleman attributed condescension and mingled dignity to her a buzzing approbation was given to the attribute throughout the church and a poor neat woman under my pew added that she was indeed all graciousness and would speak to any body  many eyes ran over when he mentioned her charities her welljudged charities and her reward was decreed from every mouth with interjections from some and these words from others the poor will dearly miss her  the cheerful giver whom god is said to love was allowed to be her and a young lady i am told said it was miss clarissa harlowes care to find out the unhappy upon a sudden distress before the sighing heart was overwhelmed by it  she had a set of poor people chosen for their remarkable honesty and ineffectual industry these voluntarily paid their last attendance on their benefactress and mingling in the church as they could crowd near the eyle where the corpse was on stands it was the less wonder that her praises from the preacher met with such general and such grateful whispers of approbation  some it seems there were who knowing her unhappy story remarked upon the dejected looks of the brother and the drowned eyes of the sister o what would they now give they would warrant had they not been so hardhearted  others pursued as i may say the severe father and unhappy mother into their chambers at home  they answered for their relenting now that it was too late  what must be their grief  no wonder they could not be present  several expressed their astonishment as people do every hour that a man could live whom such perfections could not engage to be just to her to be humane i may say  and who her rank and fortune considered could be so disregardful of his own interest had he had no other motive to be just   the good divine led by his text just touched upon the unhappy step that was the cause of her untimely fate he attributed it to the state of things below in which there could not be absolute perfection he very politely touched upon the noble disdain she showed though earnestly solicited by a whole splendid family to join interests with a man whom she found unworthy of her esteem and confidence and who courted her with the utmost earnestness to accept of him  what he most insisted upon was the happy end she made and thence drew consolation to her relations and instruction to the auditory  in a word his performance was such as heightened the reputation which he had before in a very eminent degree obtained  when the corpse was to be carried down into the vault a very spacious one within the church there was great crouding to see the coffinlid and the devices upon it particularly two gentlemen muffled up in cloaks pressed forward these it seems were mr mullins and mr wyerley both of them prosessed admirers of my dear cousin  when they came near the coffin and cast their eyes upon the lid in that little space said mr mullins is included all human excellence  and then mr wyerley unable to contain himself was forced to quit the church and we hear is very ill  it is said that mr solmes was in a remote part of the church wrapped round in a horsemans coat and that he shed tears several times but i saw him not  another gentleman was there incognito in a pew near the entrance of the vault who had not been taken notice of but for his great emotion when he looked over his pew at the time the coffin was carried down to its last place this was miss howes worthy mr hickman  my cousins john and antony and their nephew james chose not to descend into the vault among their departed ancestors  miss harlowe was extremely affected her conscience as well as her love was concerned on the occasion she would go down with the corpse of her dear her only sister she said but her brother would not permit it and her overwhelmed eye pursued the coffin till she could see no more of it and then she threw herself on the eat and was near fainting away  i accompanied it down that i might not only satisfy myself but you sir her executor that it was deposited as she had directed at the feet of her grandfather  mr melvill came down contemplated the lid and shed a few tears over it i was o well satisfied with his discourse and behavior that i presented him on the solemn spot with a ring of some value and thanked him for his performance  and here i left the remains of my beloved cosin having bespoken my own place by the side of her coffin  on my return to harloweplace i connted myself with sending my compliments to the sorrowing parents and retired to my chamber nor am i ashamed to own that i could not help giving way to a repeated fit of humanity as soon as i entered it  i am sir your most faithful and obedient servant wm morden p s you will have a letter from my cousin james who hopes to prevail upon you to relinquish the executorship it has not my encouragement    letter lxxxiv mr belford to william morden esquire saturday sept    dear sir i once had thoughts to go down privately in order disguised to see the last solemnity performed but there was no need to give myself this melancholy trouble since your last letter so naturally describes all that passed that i have every scene before my eyes  you crowd me sir methinks into the silent slow procession  now with the sacred bier do i enter the awfl porch now mease i with solemn paces the venrable eyle now emulaive of a relationship to her placed in a near pew to the eyeattracting coffin do i listen to the moving eulogy now through the buz of gaping eyeswoln crowds do i descend into the clammy vault as a true executor to see that part of her will performed with my own eyes there with a soul filled with musing do i number the surrounding monuments of mortality and contemplate the present stillness of so many once busy vanities crowded all into one poor vaulted nook as if the living grudged room for the corpse of those which when animated the earth the air and the waters could hardly find room for then seeing her placed at the feet of him whose earthly delight she was and who as i find ascribes to the pleasure she gave him the prolongation of his own life see vol i p     sighing and with averted face i quit the solemn mansion the symbolic coffin and for ever the glory of her sex and ascend with those who in a few years after a very short blaze of life will fill up other spaces of the same vault which now while they mourn only for her whom they jointly persecuted they press with their feet  nor do your affecting descriptions permit me here to stop but ascended i mingle my tears and my praises with those of the numerous spectators i accompany the afflicted mourners back to their uncomfortable mansion and make one in the general concert of unavailing woe till retiring as i imagine as they retire like them in reality i give up to new scenes of solitary and sleepless grief reflecting upon the perfections i have seen the end of and having no relief but from an indignation which makes me approve of the resentments of others against the unhappy man and those equally unhappy relations of hers to whom the irreparable loss is owing  forgive me sir these reflections and permit me with this to send you what you declined receiving till the funeral was over   he gives him then an account of the money and effects which he sends him down by this opportunity for the legatees at harloweplace and in its neighborhood which he desires him to dispose of according to the will  he also sends him an account of other steps he has taken in pursuance of the will and desires to know if mr harlowe expects the discharge of the funeral expenses from the effects in his hands and the reinbursement of the sums advanced to the testatrix since her grandfathers death    these expeditious proceedings says he will convince mr james harlowe that i am resolved to see the will completely executed and yet by my manner of doing it that i desire not to give unnecessary mortifications to the family since every thing that relates to them shall pass through your hands  letter lxxxv mr james harlowe to john belford esquire harloweplace friday night sept    sir i hope from the character my worthy cousin morden gives you that you will excuse the application i make to you to oblige a whole family in an affair that much concerns their peace and cannot equally concern any body else you will immediately judge sir that this is the executorship which my sister has given you the trouble of by her last will  we shall all think ourselves extremely obliged to you if you please to relinquish this trust to our own family these reasons pleading for our expectation of this favor from you  first because she never would have had the thought of troubling you sir if she had believed any of her near relations would have taken it upon themselves  secondly i understand that she recommends to you in the will to trust to the honor of any of our family for the performance of such of the articles as are of a domestic nature we are any of us and all of us if you request it willing to stake our honors upon this occasion and all you can wish for as a man of honor is that the trust be executed  we are the more concerned sir to wish you to decline this office because of your short and accidental knowledge of the dear testatrix and long and intimate acquaintance with the man to whom she owed her ruin and we the greatest loss and disappointment her manifold excellencies considered that ever befell a family  you will allow due weight i dare say to this plea if you make our case your own and so much the readier when i assure you that your interfering in this matter so much against our inclinations excuse sir my plaindealing will very probably occasion an opposition in some points where otherwise there might be none  what therefore i propose is not that my father should assume this trust he is too much afflicted to undertake it  nor yet myself  i might be thought too much concerned in interest but that it may be allowed to devolve upon my two uncles whose known honor and whose affection to the dear deceased nobody ever doubted and they will treat with you sir through my cousin morden as to the points they will undertake to perform  the trouble you have already had will well entitle you to the legacy she bequeaths you together with the reimbursement of all the charges you have been at and allowance of the legacies you have discharged although you should not have qualified yourself to act as an executor as i presume you have not yet done nor will now do  your compliance sir will oblige a family who have already distress enough upon them in the circumstance that occasions this application to you and more particularly sir  your most humble servant james harlowe jun i send this by one of my servants who will attend your dispatch    letter lxxxvi mr belford to james harlowe jun esquire saturday sept    sir you will excuse my plaindealing in turn for i must observe that if i had not the just opinion i have o the sacred nature of the office i have undertaken some passages in the letter you have favored me with would convince me that i ought not to excuse myself from acting in it  i need name only one of them you are pleased to say that your uncles if the trust be relinquished to them will treat with me through colonel morden as to the points they will undertake to perform  permit me sir to say that it is the duty of an executor to see every point performed that can be performed nor will i leave the performance of mine to any other persons especially where a qualifying is so directly intimated and where all the branches of your family have shown themselves with respect to the incomparable lady to have bt one mind  you are pleased to urge that she recommends to me the leaving to the honor of any of your family such of the articles as are of a domestic nature but admitting this to be so does it not imply that the other articles are ll to obtain my care  but even these you will find by the will she give not up and to thee i refer you  i am sorry for the hints you give of a opposition where a you say there might be none if i did not interfere i  not sir why your animosty against a man who cannot be defended should be carried to such a height against one who never gave you offense and this only because he is acquainted with thee man i will not say all i might say on his occasion  as to the legacy to myself i assure you sir that neither my circumstances nor my temper will put me upon being a gainer by the executorship i shall take pleasure to tread in the steps of the admirable testatrix in all i may and rather will increase than diminish her poors fund  with regard to the trouble that may attend the execution of the trust i shall not in honor to her memory value ten times more than this can give me i have indeed two other executorships on my hands but they sit light upon me and survivors cannot better or more charitably bestow their time  i conceive that every article but that relating to the poors fund may be performed in two months time at furthest  occasions of litigation or offense shall not proceed from me you need only apply to col morden who shall command me in every thing that the will allows me to oblige your family in i do assure you that i am as unwilling to obtrude myself upon it as any of it can wish  i own that i have not yet proved the will nor shall i do it till next week at soonest that you may have time for amicable objections if such you think fit to make through the colonels mediation but let me observe to you sir that an executors power in such instances as i have exercised it is the same before the probate as after it he can even without taking that out commence an action although he cannot declare upon it and these acts of administration make him liable to actions himself i am therefore very proper in the steps i have taken in part of the execution of this sacred trust and want not allowance on the occasion  permit me to add that when you have perused the will and coolly considered every thing it is my hope that you will yourself be of opinion that there can be no room for dispute or opposition and that if your family will join to expedite the execution it will be the most natural and easy way of shutting up the whole affair and to have done with a man so causelessly as to his own particular the object of your dislike as is sir  your very humble servant notwithstanding john belford   the will to which the following preamble written on a separate paper was stitched with black silk to my executor i hope i may be excused for expatiating in diverse parts of this solemn last act upon subjects of importance for i have heard of so many instances of confusion and disagreement in families and so much doubt and difficulty for want of absolute clearness in the testaments of departed persons that i have often concluded were there to be no other reasons but those which respect the peace of surviving friends that this last act as to its designation and operation ought not to be the last in its composition or making but should be the result of cool deliberation and as is more frequently than justly said of a sound mind and memory which too seldom are to be met with but in sound health all pretenses of insanity of mind are likewise prevented when a testator gives reasons for what he wills all cavils about words are obviated the obliged are assured and they enjoy the benefit for whom the benefit was intended hence have i for some time past employed myself in penning down heads of such a disposition which as reasons offered i have altered and added to so that i never was absolutely destitute of a will had i been taken off ever so suddenly these minutes and imperfect sketches enabled me as god has graciously given me time and sedateness to digest them into the form in which they appear  i clarissa harlowe now by strange melancholy accidents lodging in the parish of st paul covent garden being of sound and perfect mind and memory as i hope these presents drawn up by myself and written with my own hand will testify do this second day of september a blank at the writing was left for this date and filled up on this day see p      in the year of our lord  the date of the year is left blank for particular reasons make and publish this my last will and testament in manner and form following  in the first place i desire that my body may lie unburied three days after my decease or till the pleasure of my father be known concening it but the occasion of my death not admitting of doubt i will not on any account that it be opened and it is my desire that it shall not be touched but by those of my own sex  i have always earnestly requested that my body might be deposited in the family vault with those of my ancestors if it might be granted i could now wish that it may be placed at the feet of my dear and honored grandfather but as i have by one very unhappy step been thought to disgrace my whole lineage and therefore this last honor may be refused to my corpse in this case my desire is that it may be interred in the churchyard belonging to he parish in which i shall die and that in the most private manner between the hours of eleven and twelve at night attended only by mrs lovick and mr and mrs smith and their maidservant  but it is my desire that the same sees and dues may be paid which are usually paid for those who are laid in the best ground as it is called or even in the chancel  and i bequeath five pounds to be given at the direction of the churchwardens to twenty poor people the sunday after my interrment and this whether i shall be buried here or elsewhere  i have already given verbal directions that after i am dead and laid out in the manner i have ordered i may be put into my coffin as soon as possible it is my desire that i may not be unnecessarily exposed to the view of any body except any of my relations should vouchsafe for the last time to look upon me  and i could wish if it might be avoided without making ill will between mr lovelace and my executor that the former might not be permitted to see my corpse but if as he is a man very uncontrollable and as i am nobodys he insist upon viewing her dad whom he once before saw in a manner dead let his gay curiosity be gratified let him behold and triumph over the wretched remains of one who has been made a victim to his barbarous perfidy but let some good person as by my desire give him a paper whilst he is viewing the ghastly spectacle containing these few words only  gay cruel heart behold here the remains of the once ruined yet now happy clarissa harlowe  see what thou thyself must quickly be  and repent    yet to show that i die in perfect charity with all the world i do most sincerely forgive mr lovelace the wrongs he has done me  if my father can pardon the error of his unworthy child so far as to suffer her corpse to be eposited at the feet of her grandfather as above requested i could wish my misfortunes being so notorious that a short discourse might be pronounced over my remains before they be interred the subject of the discourse i shall determine before i conclude this writing  so much written about what deserves not the least consideration and about what will be nothing when this wriing comes to be opened and read will be excused when my present unhappy circumstances and absence from all my natural friends are considered and now with regard to the worldly matters which i shall die possessed of as well as to those which of right appertain to me either by the will of my said grandfather or otherwise thus do i dispe of them  in the first place i give and bequeath all the real estates in or to which i have any claim or title by the said will to my overhonoured father james harlowe esquire and that rather than to my brother and sister to whom i had once thoughts of devising them because if they survive my father those estates will assuredly vest in them or one of them by virtue of his favor and indulgence as the circumstances of things with regard to marriagesettlements or otherwise may require or as they may respectively mei by the continuance of their duty  the house late my grandfathers called the grove and by him in honor of me and of some of my voluntary employments my dairyhouse and the furniture thereof as it now stands the pictures and large iron cest of old plate excepted i also bequeath to my said father only begging it as a favor that he will be pleased to permit my dear mrs norton to pass the remainder of her days in that house and to have and enjoy the apartments in it known by the name of the housekeepers apartments with the furnture in them and which plain and neat was bought for me by my grandfather who delighted to call me his housekeeper and which therefore in his lifetime i used as such the office to go with the apartments and i am the more earnest in this recommendation as i had once thought to have been very happy there with the good woman and because i think her prudent management will be as beneficial to my father as his favor can be convenient to her  but with regard to what has accrued from that estate since my grandfathers death and to the sum of nine hundred and seventy pounds which proved to be the moiety of the money that my said grandfather had by him at his death and which moiety he bequathed to me for my sole and separate use as he did the other moiety in like manner to my sister see vol i p     and which sum that i might convince my brother and sister that i wished not for an independence upon my fathers pleasure i gave into my fathers hands together with the management and produce of the whole estate devised to me  these sums however considerable when put together i hope i may be allowed to dispose of absolutely as my love and my gratitude not confined wholly to my own family which is very wealthy in all its branches may warrant and which therefore i shall dispose of in the manner hereafter mentioned but it is my will and express direction that my fathers account of the abovementioned produce may be taken and established absolutely and without contravention or question as he shall be pleased to give it to my cousin morden or to whom else he shall choose to give it so as that the said account be not subject to litigation or to the control of my executor or any other person  my father of his love and bounty was pleased to allow me the same quarterly sums that he allowed my sister for apparel and other requisites and pleased with me then used to say that those sums should not he deducted from the estate and effects bequeathed o me by my grandfather but having mortally offended him as i fear it may be said by one unhappy step it may be expected that he will reimburse himself those sums  it is therefore my will and direction that he shall be allowed to pay and satisfy himself for all such quarterly or other sums which he was so good as to advance me from the time of my grandfathers death and that his account of such sums shall likewise be taken without questioning the money however which i left behind me in my escritoire being to be taken in part of those disbursements  my grandfather who in his goodness and favor to me knew no bounds was pleased to bequeath to me all the family pictures at his late house some of which are very masterly performances with command that if i died unmarried or if married and had no descndents they should then go to that son of his if more than one should be then living whom i should think would set most value by them now as i know that my honored uncle john harlowe esquire was pleased to express some concern that they were not left to him as eldest son and as he has a gallery where they may be placed to advantage and as i have reason to believe that he will bequeath them to my father if he survive him who no doubt will leave them to my brother i therefore bequeath all the said family pictures to my said uncle john harlowe in these pictures however i include not one of my own drawn when i was about fourteen years of age which i shall hereafter in another article bequeath  my said honored grandfather having a great fondness for the old family plate which he would never permit to be changed having lived as he used to say to see a great deal of it come into request again in the revolution of fashions and having left the same to me with a command to keep it entire and with power at my death to bequeath it to whomsoever i pleased that i thought would forward his desire which was as he expresses it that it should be kept to the end of time this family plate which is deposited in a large iron chest in the strong room at his late dwelling house i bequeath entire to my honored uncle antony harlowe esquire with the same injunctions which were laid on me not doubting but he will confirm and strengthen them by his own last will  i bequeath to my evervalued friend mrs judith norton to whose piety and care seconding the piety and care of my everhonoured and excellent mother i owe morally speaking the qualifications which for eighteen years of my life made me beloved and respected the full sum of six hundred pounds to be paid her within three months after my death  i bequeath also to the same good woman thirty guineas for mourning for her and for her son my fosterbrother  to mrs dorothy hervey the only sister of my honored mother i bequeath the sum of fifty guineas for a ring and i beg of her to accept of my thankful acknowlegements for all her goodness to me from my infancy and particularly for her patience with me in the several altrcations that happened between my brother and sister and me before my unhappy departure from harloweplace  to my kind and muchvalued cousin miss dolly hervey daughter of my aunt hervey i bequeath my watch and equipage and my best mechlin and brussels headdresses and ruffles also my gown and petticoat of flowered silver of my own work which having been made up but a few days before i was confined to my chamber i never wore  to the same young lady i bequeath likewise my harpsichord my chamberorgan and all my musicbooks  as my sister has a very pretty library and as my beloved miss how has also her late fathers as well as her own i bequeath all my books in general with the cases they are in to my said cousin dolly hervey as they are not illchosen for a womans library i know that she will take the greater pleasure in them when her friendly grief is mellowed by time into a remembrance more sweet than painful because they were mine and because there are observations in many of them of my own wriing and some very judicious ones written by the truly reverend dr lewen  i also bequeath to the same young lady twentyfive guineas for a ring to be worn in remembrance of her true friend  if i live not to see my worthy cousin william morden esquire i desire my humble and grateful thanks may be given to him for his favors and goodness to me and particularly for his endeavors to reconcile my other friends to me at a time when i was doubtful whether he would forgive me himself as he is in great circumstances i will only beg of him to accept of two or three trifles in remembrance of a kinswoman who always honored him as much as he loved her particularly of that piece of flowers which my uncle robert his father was very earnest to obtain in order to carry it abroad with him  i desire him likewise to accept of the little miniature picture set in gold which his worthy father made me sit for to the famous italian master whom he brought over with him and which he presented to me that i might bestow it as he was pleased to say upon the man whom one day i should be most inclined to favor  to the same gentleman i also bequeath my rose diamond ring which was a present from his good father to me and will be the more valuable to him on that account  i humbly request mrs annabella how the mother of my dear miss how to accept of my respectful thanks for all her favors and goodness to me when i was so frequently a visiter to her beloved daughter and of a ring of twentyfive guineas price  my picture at whole length which is in my late grandfathers closet excepted in an article above from the family pictures drawn when i was near fourteen years of age about which time my dear miss how and i began to know to distinguish and to love one another  so dearly  i cannot express how dearly  i bequeath to that sister of my heart of whose friendship as well in adversity as prosperity when i was deprived of all other comfort and comforters i have had such instances as that our love can only be exceeded in that state of perfection in which i hope to rejoice with her hereafter to all eternity  i bequeath also to the same dear friend my best diamond ring which is in the private drawer of my escritoire with other jewels as also all my finished and framed pieces of needlework the flowerpiece excepted which i have already bequeathed to my cousin morden  these pieces have all been taken down as i have heard vol iii p      and my relations will have no heart to put them up again but if my good mother chooses to keep back any one piece the above capital piece as it is called exceped not knowing but some time hence she may bear the sight of it i except that also from this general bequest and direct it to be presented to her  my wholelength picture in the vandyke taste vol iii p      that used to hang in my own parlour as i was permitted to call it i bequeah to my aunt hervey except my mother shall think fit to keep it herself  i bequeath to the worthy charles hickman esquire the locket with the minature picture which i have constantly worn and shall continue to wear near my heart till the approach of my last hour see p   0 of this volume  of the lady whom he best loves it must be the most acceptable present that can be made him next to the hand of the dear original and o my dear miss how let it not be long before you permit his claim to the latter  for indeed you know not the vlue of a virtuous mind in that sex and how preferable such a mind is to one distinguished by the more dazzling flights of unruly wit although the latter were to be joined by that specious outward appeaance which is tootoo often permitted to attract the hasty eye and susceptible heart  i make it my earnest request to my dear miss how that she will not put herself into mourning for me but i desire her acceptance of a ring with my hair and that mr hickman will also accept of the like each of the value of fifteen guines  i bequeath to lady betty lawrance and to her sister lady sarah sadlir and to the right honorable lord m and to their worthy nieces miss charlotte and miss martha monague each an enamelled rng with a cipher cl h with my hair in crystal and round the inside of each the day month and year o my death each ring with brilliants to cost twenty guineas and this as a small token of the grateful sense i have of the honor of their good opinions and kind wishes in my favor and of their truly noble offer to me of a very considerable annual provision when they apprehended me to be entirely dstitute of any  to the reverend and learned doctor arthur lewen by whose instructions i have been equally delighted and benefited i bequeath twenty guineas for a ring if it should please god to cll him to himself before he can receive this small bequest it is my will that his worthy daughter may have the benefit of it  in token of the grateful sense i have of the civilities paid me by mrs and miss howes domestics from time to time in my visits there i bequeath thirty guineas to be divided among them as their dear young mistress shall think proper  to each of my worthy companions and friends miss biddy lloyd miss fanny alston miss rachel biddulph and miss cartwright campbell i bequeath five guineas for a ring  to my late maidservant hannah burton an honest faithful creature who loved me reverenced my mother and respected my sister and never sought to do any thing unbecoming of her character i bequeath the sum of fifty pounds to be paid within one month after my decease she laboring under ill health and if that ill health continue i commend her for farther assistance to my good mrs norton to be put upon my poors fund hereafter to be mentioned  to the coachman groom and two footmen and five maids at harloweplace i bequeath ten pounds each to the helper five pounds  to my sisters maid betty barnes i bequeath ten pounds to show that i resent not former disobligations which i believe were owing more to the insolence of office and to natural pertness than to personal ill will  all my wearing apparel of whatever sort that i have not been obliged to part with or which is not already bequeathed my linen excepted i desire mrs norton will accept of  the trunks and boxes in which my clothes are sealed up i desire may not be opened but in presence of mrs norton or of some one deputed by her and of mrs lovick  to the worthy mrs lovick abovementioned from whom i have received great civilities and even maternal kindnesses and to mrs smith with whom i lodge from whom also i have received great kindnesses i bequeath all my linen and all my unsold laces to be divided equally between them as they shall agree or in case of disagreement the same to be sold and the money arising to be equally shared by them  and i bequeath to the same two good women as a further token of my thankful acknowlegements of their kind love and compassionate concern for me the sum of twenty guineas each  to mr smith the husband of mrs smith abovenamed i bequeath the sum of ten guineas in acknowlegement of his civilities to me  to sarah the honest maidservant of mrs smith to whom having no servant of my own i have been troublesome i bequeath five guineas and ten guineas more in lieu of a suit of my wearingapparel which once with some linen i thought of leaving to her with this she may purchase what may be more suitable to her liking and degree  to the honest and careful wiow ann shelburne my nurse over and above her wages and the little customary perquisites that may belong to her i bequeath the sum of ten guineas hers is a careful and to persons of such humanity and tenderness a melancholy employment attended in the latter part of life with great watching and fatigue which is hardly ever enough considered  the few books i have at my present lodgings i desire mrs lovick to accept of and that she be permitted if she please to take a copy of my book of meditations as i used to call it being extracts from the best of books which she seemed to approve of although suited particularly to my own case as for the book itself perhaps my good mrs norton will be glad to have it as it is written all with my own hand  in the middle drawer of my escritoire at harloweplace are many letters and copies of letters put up according to their dates which i have written or received in a course of years ever since i learned to write from and to my grandfather my father and mother my uncles my brother and sister on occasional little absences my late uncle morden my cousin morden mrs norton and miss how and other of my companions and friends before my confinement at my fathers as also from the three reverend gentlemen dr blome mr arnold and mr tompkins now with god and the very reverend dr lewen on serious subjects as these letters exhibit a correspondence that no young person of my sex need to be ashamed of allowing for the time of life when mine were written and as many excellent things are contained in those written to me and as miss how to whom most of them have been communicated wished formerly to have them if she survived me for these reasons i bequeath them to my said dear friend miss anna how and the rather as she had for some years past a very considerable share in the correspondence  i do hereby make constitute and ordain john belford of edgworth in the county of middlesex esquire the sole executor of this my last will and testament having previously obtained his leave so to do i have given the reasons which induced me to ask this gentleman to take upon him this trouble to miss how i therefore refer to her on this subject  but i do most earnestly beg of him the said mr belford that in the execution of this trust he will as he has repeatedly promised studiously endeavor to promote peace with and suppress resentments in every one so as that all farther mischiefs may be prevented as well from as to his friend and in order to this i beseech him to cultivate the friendship of my worthy cousin morden who as i presume to hope when he understands it to be my dying request will give him his advice and assistance in every article where it may be necessary and who will perhaps be so good as to interpose with my relaions if any difficulty should arise about carrying any of the articles of this my last will into execution and o soften them ino the wishedfor condescension  for it is my earnest request to mr blford that he will not seek by law or by any sort of violence either by word or deed to extort the performance from them if thee b any articles of a merely domestic nature that my relations sha ink unfit to be carried into execution such articles i leave rely to my said cousin morden and mr belford to vary or totally dispense with as they shall agree upon the matter or if they two diffr in opinion they will be pleased to be determined by a third person to be chosen by them both  having been pressed by miss how and her mother to collect the particulars of my sad story and given expectation that i would in order to do my character justice with all my friends and companions but not having time before me for the painful task it has been a pleasure to me to find by extracts kindly communicated to me by my said executor that i may safely trust my fame to the justice done me by mr lovelace in his letters to him my said executor and as mr belford has engaged to contribute what is in his power toward a compilement to be made of all that relates to my story and knows my whole mind in this respect it is my desire that he will cause two copies to be made of this collection one to remain with miss how the other with himself and that he will show or lend his copy if required to my aunt hervey for the satisfaction of any of my family but under such restrictions as the said mr belford shall think fit to impose that neither any other persons safety may be endangered nor his own honor suffer by the communication  i bequeath to my said executor the sum of one hundred guineas as a grateful though insufficient acknowlegement of the trouble he will be at in the execution of the trust he has so kindly undertaken i desire him likewise to accept of twenty guineas for a ring and that he will reimburse himself for all the charges and expenses which he shall be at in the execution of this trust  in the worthy dr h i have found a physician a father and a friend i beg of him as a testimony of my gratitude to accept of twenty guineas for a ring  i have the same obligations to the kind and skilful mr coddard who attended me as my apothecary his very moderate till i have discharged down to yesterday i have always thought it incumbent upon testators to shorten all they can the trouble of their executors i know i uderrate the value of mr goddards attendances when over and above what may accrue from yesterday to the hour that will finish all i desire fifteen guineas for a ring may be presented to him  to the reverend mr  who frequently attended me and prayed by me in my last stages i also bequeath fifteen guineas for a ring  there are a set of honest indigent people whom i used to call my poor and to whom mrs norton conveys relief each month or at shorter periods in proportion to their necessities from a sum i deposited in her hands and from time to time recruited as means accrued to me but now nearly if not wholly expended now that my fault may be as little aggravated as possible by the sufferings of the worthy people whom heaven gave me a heart to relieve and as the produce of my grandfathers estate including the moiety of the sums he had by him and was pleased to give me at his death as abovementioned together with what i shall further appropriate to the same use in the subsequent articles will as i hope more than answer all my legacies and bequests it is my will and desire that the remainder be it little or much shall become a fund to be appropriated and i hereby direct that it be appropriated to the like purposes with the sums which i put into mrs nortons hands as aforesaid  and this under the direction and management of the said mrs norton who knows my whole mind in this particular and in case of her death or of her desire to be acquitted of the management thereof it is my earnest request to my dear miss how that she will take it upon herself and at her own death that she will transfer what shall remain undisposed of at the time to such persons and with such limitations restrictions and provisoes as she shall think will best answer my intention for as to the management and distribution of all or any part of it while in mrs nortons hands or her own i will that it be entirely discretional and without account either to my executor or any other person  although mrs norton as i have hinted knows my whole mind in this respect yet it may be proper to mention in this last solemn act that my intention is that this fund be entirely set apart and appropriated to relieve temporarily from the interest thereof as i dare say it will be put out to the best advantage or even from the principal if need be the honest industrious laboring poor only when sickness lameness unforeseen losses or other accidents disable them from following their lawful callings or to assist such honest people of large families as shall have a child of good inclinations to put out to service trade or husbandry  it has always been a rule with me in my little donations to endeavor to aid and set forward the sober and industrious poor small helps if seasonably afforded will do for such and so the fund may be of more extensive benefit an ocean of wealth will not be sufficient for the idle and dissolute whom therefore since they will be always in want it will be no charity to relieve if worthier creatures shall by that means be deprived of such assistance as may set the wheels of their industry going and put them in a sphere of useful action  but it is my express will and direction that let this fund come out to be ever so considerable it shall be applied only in support of the temporary exigencies of the persons i have described and that no one family or person receive from it at one time or in one year more than the sum of twenty pounds  it is my will and desire that the set of jewels which was my grandmothers and presented to me soon after her death by my grandfather be valued and the worth of them paid to my executor if any of my family choose to have them or otherwise that they be sold and go to the augmentation of my poors fund  but if they may be deemed an equivalent for the sums my father was pleased to advance to me since the death of my grandfather i desire that they may be given up to him  i presume that the diamond necklace solitaire and buckles which were properly my own presented by my mothers uncle sir josias brookland will not be purchased by any one of my family for a too obvious reason in this case i desire that they may be sent to my executor and that he will dispose of them to the best advantage and apply the money to the uses of my will  in the beginning of this tedious writing i referred to the latter part of it the naming of the subject of the discourse which i wished might be delivered at my funeral if permitted to be interred with my ancestors i think the following will be suitable to my case i hope the alteration of the words her and she for him and her may be allowable  let not her that is deceived trust in vanity for vanity shall be her recompense she shall be accomplished before her time and her branch shall not be green she shall shake off her unripe grape as the vine and shall cast off her flower as the blighted olive job xv           but if i am to be interred in town let only the usual burialservice be read over my corpse  if my body be permitted to be carried down i bequeath ten pounds to be given to the poor of the parish at the discretion of the churchwardens within a fortnight after my interrment  if any necessary matter be omitted in this my will or if any thing appear doubtful or contradictory as possibly may be the case since besides my inexperience in these matters i am now at this time very weak and ill having put off the finishing hand a little too long in hopes of obtaining the last forgiveness of my honored friends in which case i should have acknowleged the favor with a suitable warmth of duty and filled up some blanks which i left to the very last p     of this volume  in a more agreeable manner to myself than now i have been enabled to do  in case of such omissions and imperfections i desire that my cousin morden will be so good as to join with mr belford in considering them and in comparing them with what i have more explicitly written and if after that any doubt remain that they will be pleased to apply to miss how who knows my whole heart and i desire that their construction may be established and i hereby establish it provided it be unanimous and direct it to be put in force as if i had so written and determined myself  and now o my blessed redeemer do i with a lively faith humbly lay hold of thy meritorious death and sufferings hoping to be washed clean in thy precious blood from all my sins in the bare hope of the happy consequences of which how light do those sufferings seem grievous as they were at the time which i confidently trust will be a means by thy grace to work out for me a more exceding and eternal weight of glory clarissa harlowe signed sealed published and declared the day and year abovewritten by the said clarissa harlowe as her last will and testament contained in seven sheets of paper all written with her own hand and every sheet signed and sealed by herself in the presence of us  john williams arthur bedall elizabeth swanton     letter lxxxvii colonel morden to john belford esquire sat sept    i have been employed in a most melancholy task in reading the will of the dear deceased  the unhappy mother and mrs norton chose to be absent on the affecting occasion but mrs harlowe made it her earnest request that every article of it should be fulfilled  they were all extremely touched with the preamble  the first words of the will  i clarissa harlowe now by strange melancholy accidents lodging etc drew tears from some sighs from all  the directions for her funeral in case she were or were not permitted to be carried down the mention of her orders having been given for the manner of her being laid out and the presence of mind so visible throughout the whole obtained their admiration expressed by hands and eyes lifted up and by falling tears  when i read the direction that her body was not to be viewed except any of her relations should vouchsafe for the last time to look upon her they turned away and turned to me three or four times alternately mrs hervey and miss arabella sobbed the uncles wiped their eyes the brother looked down the father wrung his hands  i was obliged to stop at the words that she was nobodys  but when i came to the address to be made to the accursed man if he were not to be diverted from seeing her dead whom once before he had seen in a manner dead  execration and either vows or wishes of revenge filled every mouth  these were still more fervently renewed when they came to hear read her forgiveness of even this man  you remember sir on our first reading of the will i town the observations i made on the foul play which it is evident the excellent creature met with from this abandoned man and what i said upon the occasion i am not used to repeat things of that nature  the dear creatures noble contempt of the nothing as she as nobly calls it about which she had been giving such particular directions to wit her body and her apologizing for the particularity of those directions from the circumstances she was in  had the same and as strong an effect upon me as when i first read the animated paragraph and pointed by my eye by turns cast upon them all affected them all  when the article was read which bequeathed to the father the grandfathers estate and the reason assigned for it so generous and so dutiful the father could sit no longer but withdrew wiping his eyes and lifting up his hands at mr james harlowe who arose to attend him to the door as arabella likewise did  all he could say  o son son  o girl girl  as if he reproached them for the parts they had acted and put him upon acting  but yet on some occasions this brother and sister showed themselves to be true willdisputants  let tongue and eyes express what they will mr belford the reading of a will where a person dies worth anything considerable generally affords a true test of love to the deceased  the clothes the thirty guineas for mourning to mrs norton with the recommendation of the good woman for housekeeper at the grove were thought sufficient had the article of  00 l which was called monstrous been omitted some other passages in the will were called flights and such whimsies as distinguish people of imagination from those of judgment  my cousin dolly hervey was grudged the library miss harlowe said that as she and her sister never bought the same books she would take that to herself and would make it up to her cousin dolly one way or other  i intend mr belford to save you the trouble of interposing  the library shall be my cousin dollys  mrs hervey could hardly keep her seat on this occasion however she only said that her late dear and ever dear niece was too good to her and hers but at another m she declared with tears that she could not forgive erself for a letter she wrote see vol iii p     looking at miss arabella whom it seems unknown to anybody she had consulted before she wrote it and which she said must have wounded a spirit that now she saw had been too deeply wounded before  o my aunt said arabella no more of that  who would have thought that the dear creature had been such a penitent  mr john and mr antony harlowe were so much affected with the articles in their favor bequeathed to them without a word or hint of reproach or recrimination that they broke out into self accusations and lamented that their sweet niece as they called her was now got above all grateful acknowlegement and returns  indeed the mutual upbraidings and grief of all present upon those articles in which every one was remembered for good so often interrupted me that the reading took up above six hours but curses upon the accursed man were a refuge to which they often resorted to exonerate themselves  how wounding a thing mr belford is a generous and welldistinguished forgiveness what revenge can be more effectual and more noble were revenge intended and were it wished to strike remorse into a guilty or ungrateful heart but my dear cousins motives were all duty and love she seems indeed to have been as much as mortal could be love itself love sublimed by a purity by a true delicacy that hardly any woman before her could boast of o mr belford what an example would she have given in every station of life as wife mother mistress friend had her lot fallen upon a man blessed with a mind like her own  the  00 l bequeathed to mrs norton the library to miss hervey and the remembrances to miss how were not the only articles grudged yet to what purpose did they regret the pecuniary bequests when the poors fund and not themselves would have had the benefit had not those legacies been bequeathed  but enough passed to convince me that my cousin was absolutely right in her choice of an executor out of the family had she chosen one in it i dare say that her will would have been no more regarded than if it had been the will of a dead king than that of louis xiv in particular so flagrantly broken through by his nephew the duke of orleans before he was cold the only will of that monarch perhaps which was ever disputed  but little does mr james harlowe think that while he is grasping at hundreds he will most probably lose thousands if he be my survivor a man of a spirit so selfish and narrow shall not be my heir  you will better conceive mr belford than i can express how much they were touched at the hint that the dear creature had been obliged to part with some of her clothes  silent reproach seized every one of them when i came to the passage where she mentions that she deferred filling up some blanks in hopes of receiving their last blessing and forgiveness  i will only add that they could not bear to hear read the concluding part so solemnly addressed to her redeemer they all arose from their seats and crowded out of the apartment we were in and then as i afterward found separated in order to seek that consolation in solitary retirement which though they could not hope for from their own reflections yet at the time they had less reason to expect in each others company i am sir  your faithful and obedient servant wm morden  letter lxxxv mr belford to the right honorable lord m london sept    my lord i am very apprehensive that the affair between mr lovelace and the late excellent miss clarissa harlowe will be attended with further bad consequences notwithstanding her dying injunctions to the contrary i would therefore humbly propose that your lordship and his other relations will forward the purpose your kinsman lately had to go abroad where i hope he will stay till all is blown over but as he will not stir if he know the true motives of your wishes the avowed inducement as i hinted once to mr mowbray may be such as respects his own health both of person and mind to mr mowbray and mr tourville all countries are alike and they perhaps will accompany him  i am glad to hear that he is in a way of recovery but this the rather induces me to press the matter and i think no time should be lost  your lordship has heard that i have the honor to be the executor of this admirable ladys last will i transcribe from it the following paragraph  he then transcribes the article which so gratefully mentions this nobleman and the ladies of his family in relation to the rings she bequeaths them about which he desires their commands    letter lxxxvi miss montague to john belford esquire m hall friday sept    sir my lord having the gout in his right hand his lordship and lady sarah and lady betty have commanded me to inform you that before your letter came mr lovelace was preparing for a foreign tour we shall endeavor to hasten him away on the motives you suggest  we are all extremely affected with the dear ladys death lady betty and lady sarah have been indisposed ever since they heard of it they had pleased themselves as had my sister and self with the hopes of cultivating her acquaintance and friendship after he was gone abroad upon her own terms her kind remembrance of each of us has renewed though it could not heighten our regrets for so irreparable a loss we shall order mr finch our goldsmith to wait on you he has our directions about the rings they will be long long worn in memory of the dear testatrix  everybody is assured that you will do all in your power to prevent farther ill consequences from this melancholy affair my lord desires his compliments to you i am sir  your humble servant chapter montague   this collection having run into a much greater length than was wished it is thought proper to omit several letters that passed between colonel morden miss how mr belford and mr hickman in relation to the execution of the ladys will etc  it is however necessary to observe on this subject that the unhappy mother being supported by the two uncles influenced the afflicted father to overruled all his sons objections and to direct a literal observation of the will and at the same time to give up all the sums which he was empowered by it to reimburse himself as also to take upon himself to defray the funeral expenses  mr belford so much obliged miss how by his steadiness equity and dispatch and by his readines to contribute to the directed collection that she voluntarily entered into a correspondence with him as the representative of her beloved friend in the course of which he communicated to her in confidence the letters which passed between him and mr lovelace and by colonel mordens consent those which passed between that gentleman and himself  he sent with the first parcel of letters which he had transcribed out of shorthand for miss how a letter to mr hickman dated the   th of september in which he expresses himself as follows  but i ought sir in this parcel to have kept out one letter it is that which relates to the interview between yourself and mr lovelace at mr dormers see vol vi letter   in which mr lovelace treats you with an air of levity which neither your person your character nor your commission deserved but which was his usual way of treating every one whose business he was not pleased with i hope sir you have too much greatness of mind to be disturbed at this letter should miss how communicate it to you and the rather as it is impossible that you should suffer with her on that account he then excuses mr lovelace as a goodnatured man with all his faults and gives instances of his still greater freedoms with himself  to this mr hickman answers in his letter of the   th  as to mr lovelaces treatment of me in the letter you are pleased to mention i shall not be concerned at it whatever it be i went to him prepared to expect odd behavior from him and was not disappointed i argue to myself in all such cases as this as miss how from her everdear friend argues that if the reflections thrown upon me are just i ought not only to forgive them but to endeavor to profit by them if unjust that i ought to despise them and the reflecter too since it would be inexcusable to strengthen by anger an enemy whose malice might be disarmed by contempt and moreover i should be almost sorry to find myself spoken well of by a man who could treat as he treated a lady who was an ornament to her sex and to human nature  i thank you however sir adds he for your consideration for me in this particular and for your whole letter which gives me so desirable an instance of that friendship which you honored me with the assurances of when i was last in town and which i as cordially embrace as wish to cultivate  miss how in hers of the  0th acknowleging the receipt of the letters and papers and legacies sent with mr belfords letter to mr hickman assures him that no use shall be made of his communications but what he shall approve of  he had mentioned with compassion the distresses of the harlowe family  persons of a pitiful nature says she may pity them i am not one of those you i think pity the infernal man likewise while i from my heart grudge him his phrensy because it deprives him of that remorse which i hope on his recovery will never leave him at times sir let me tell you that i hate your whole sex for his sake even men of unblameable characters whom at those times i cannot but look upon as persons i have not yet found out  if my dear creatures personal jewels proceeds she be sent up to you for sale i desire that i may be the purchaser of them at the highest price  of the necklace and solitaire particularly  o what tears did the perusal of my beloveds will cost me  but i must not touch upon the heartpiercing subject i can neither take it up nor quit it but with execration of the villain whom all the world must execrate  mr belford in his answer promises that she shall be the purchaser of the jewels if they come into his hands  he acquaints her that the family had given col morden the keys of all that belonged to the dear departed that the unhappy mother had as the will allows ordered a piece of needlework to be set aside for her and had desired mrs norton to get the little book of meditations transcribed and to let her have the original as it was all of her dear daughters handwriting and as it might when she could bear to look into it administer consolation to herself and that she had likewise reserved for herself her picture in the vandyke taste  mr belford sends with this letter to miss how the ladys memorandumbook and promises to send her copies of the several posthumous letters he tells her that mr lovelace being upon the recovery he had enclosed the posthumous letter directed for him to lord m that his lordship might give it to him or not as he should find he could bear it the following is a copy of that letter  to mr lovelace thursday aug    i told you in the letter i wrote to you on tuesday last see p    of this volume  the reader may observe by the date of this letter that it was written within two days of the allegorical one to which it refers and while the lady was laboring under the increased illness occasioned by the burries and terrors which mr lovelace had put her into to avoid the visit he was so earnest to make her at smiths  so early written perhaps that she might not be surprised by death into a seeming breach of her word  high as her christian spirit soars in this letter the reader has seen in letter xlviii and in other places that that exalted spirit carried her to still more divine elevations as she drew nearer to her end    that you should have another sent you when i had got to my fathers house  i presume to say that i am now at your receiving of this arrived there and i invite you to follow me as soon as you can be prepared for so great a journey  not to allegorize further  my fate is now at your perusal of this accomplished my doom is unalterably fixed and i am either a miserable or a happy being to all eternity if happy i owe it solely to the divine mercy if miserable to your undeserved cruelty  and consider now for your own sake gay cruel fluttering unhappy man consider whether the barbarous and perfidious treatment i have mt with from you was worthy of the hazard of your immortal soul since your wicked views were not to be effected but by the wilful breach of the most solemn vows that ever were made by man and those aided by a violence and baseness unworthy of a human creature  in time then once more i wish you to consider your ways your golden dream cannot long last your present course can yield you pleasure no longer than you can keep off thought or reflection a hardened insensibility is the only foundation on which your inward tranquillity is built when once a dangerous sickness seizes you when once effectual remorse breaks in upon you how dreadful will be your condition how poor a triumph will you then find it to have been able by a series of black perjuries and studied baseness under the name of gallantry or intrigue to betray poor unexperienced young creatures who perhaps knew nothing but their duty till they knew you  not one good action in the hour of languishing to recollect not one worthy intention to revolve it will be all conscience and horror and you will wish to have it in your power to compound for annihilation  reflect sir that i can have no other motive in what i write than your good and the safety of other innocent creatures who may be drawn in by your wicked arts and perjuries you have not in my wishes for your future welfare the wishes of a suppliant wife endeavoring for her own sake as well as for yours to induce you to reform those ways they are wholly disinterested as undeserved but i should mistrust my own penitence were i capable of wishing to recompense evil for evil  if black as your offenses have been against me i could not forgive as i wish to be forgiven  i repeat therefore that i do forgive you and may the almighty forgive you too nor have i at the writing of this any other essential regrets than what are occasioned by the grief i have given to parents who till i knew you were the most indulgent of parents by the scandal given to the other branches of my family by the disreputation brought upon my sex and by the offense given to virtue in my fall  as to myself you have only robbed me of what once were my favorite expectations in the transient life i shall have quitted when you receive this you have only been the cause that i have been cut off in the bloom of youth and of curtailing a life that might have been agreeable to myself or otherwise as had suited the designs and ends of providence i have reason to be thankful for being taken away from the evil of supporting my part of a yoke with a man so unhappy i will only say that in all prbability every hour i had lived with him might have brought with it some new trouble and i am indeed through sharp afflictions and distresses indebted to you secondarily as i humbly presume to hope for so many years of glory as might have proved years of danger temptation and anguish had they been added to my mortal life  so sir though no thanks to your intention you have done me real service and in return i wish you happy but such has been your life hitherto that you can have no time to lose in setting about your repentance repentance to such as have lived only carelessly and in the omission of their regular duties and who never aimed to draw any poor creatures into evil is not so easy a task nor so much in our own power as some imagine how difficult a grace then to be obtained where the guilt is premeditated wilful and complicated  to say i once respected you with a preference is what i ought to blush to own since at the very time i was far from thinking you even a mral man though i little thought that you or indeed that any man breathing could be what you have proved yourself to be but indeed sir i have long been greatly above you for from my heart i have despised you and all your ways ever since i saw what manner of man you were  nor is it to be wondered that i should be able so to do when that preference was not grounded on ignoble motives for i was weak enough and presumptuous enough to hope to be a means in the hand of providence to reclaim a man whom i thought worthy of the attempt  nor have i yet as you will see by the pains i take o this solemn occasion to awaken you out of your sensual dream given over all hopes of this nature  hear me therefore o lovelace as one speaking from the dead  lose no time  set about your repentance instantly  be no longer the instrument of satan to draw poor souls into those subtle snares which at last shall entangle your own feet seek not to multiply your offenses till they become beyond the power as i may say of the divine mercy to forgive since justice no less than mercy is an attribute of the almighty  tremble and reform when you read what is the portion of the wicked man from god thus it is written  the triumphing of the wicked is short and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment he is cast into a net by his own feet  he walks upon a snare terrors shall make him afraid on every side and shall drive him to his feet his strength shall be hungerbitten and destruction shall be ready at his side the firstborn of death shall devour his strength his remembrance shall perish from the earth and he shall have no name in the streets he shall be chased out of the world he shall neither have son nor nephew among his people they that have seen him shall say where is he he shall sy away as a dream he shall be chased away as a vision of the night his meat is the gall of asps within him he shall flee from the iron weapon and the bow of steel shall strike him through a fire not blown shall consume him the heaven shall reveal his iniquity and the earth shall rise up against him the worm shall feed sweetly on him he shall be no more remembered  this is the fate of him that knows not god   whenever you shall be inclined to consult the sacred oracles from whence the above threatenings are extracted you will find doctrines and texts which a truly penitent and contrite heart may lay hold of for its consolation  may yours mr lovelace become such and may you be enabled to escape the fate denounced against the abandoned man and be entitled to the mercies of a longsuffering and gracious god is the sincere prayer of  clarissa harlowe   letter lxxxvii mr lovelace to john belford esquire m hall thursday sept    ever since the fatal seventh of this month i have been lost to myself and to all the joys of life i might have gone farther back than that fatal seventh which for the future i will never see anniversarily revolve but in fables only till that cursed day i had some gleams of hope now and then darting in upon me  they tell me of an odd letter i wrote to you see his delirious letter p      i remember i did write but very little of the contents of what i wrote do i remember  i have been in a cursed way methinks something has been working strangely retributive i never was such a fool as to disbelieve a providence yet am i not for resolving into judgments everything that temporarily chances to wear an avenging face yet if we must be punished either here or hereafter for our misdeeds better here say i than hereafter have i not then an interest to think my punishment already not only begun but completed since what i have suffered and do suffer passes all description  to give but one instance of the retributive  here i who was the barbarous cause of the loss of senses for a week together to the most inimitable of women have been punished with the loss of my own  preparative to  who knows what  when o when shall i know a joyful hour  i am kept excessively low and excessively low i am this sweet creatures posthumous letter sticks close to me all her excellencies rise up hourly to my remembrance  yet dare i not to indulge in these melancholy reflections i find my head strangely working again  pen begone  friday sept    i resume in a sprightly vein i hope  mowbray and tourville have just now   but what of mowbray and tourville  what is the world  what is anybody in it   yet are they highly exasperated against thee for the last letter thou wrotest to them this letter appears not  such an unfriendly such a merciless   but it will not do  i must again lay down my pen  o belford belford i am still i am still most miserably absent from myself shall never never more be what i was   saturday sunday nothing done incapable of anything   monday sept    heavy damnably heavy and sick at soul by jupiter  i must come into their expedient i must see what change of climate will do  you tell these fellows and you tell me of repenting and reforming  but i can do neither he who can must not have the extinction of a clarissa harlowe to answer for  harlowe  curse upon the name  and curse upon myself for not changing it as i might have done  yet have i no need of urging a curse upon myself  i have it effectually  to say i once respected you with a preference see p       in what stiff language does maidenly modesty on these nice occasions express itself  to say i once loved you is the english and there is truth and ease in the expression  to say i once loved you then let it be is what i ought to blush to own  and do thou own it  excellent creature and do thou then own it  what music in these words from such an angel  what would i give that she were in being and could and would own that she loved me  but indeed sir i have long been greatly above you  long my blessed charmer  long indeed  for you have been ever greatly above me and above your sex and above all the world  that preference was not grounded on ignoble motives  what a wretch was i to be so distinguished by her and yet to be so unworthy of her hope to reclaim me  then how generous her motives not for her own sake merely not altogether for mine did she hope to reclaim me but equally for the sake of innocents who might otherwise be ruined by me  and now why did she write this letter and why direct it to be given me when an event the most deplorable had taken place but for my good and with a view to the safety of innocents she knew not  and when was this letter written was it not at the time at the very time that i had been pursuing her as i may say from place to place when her soul was bowed down by calamity and persecution and herself was denied all forgiveness from relations the most implacable  exalted creature  and could thou at such a time and so early and in such circumstances have so far subdued thy own just resentments as to wish happiness to the principal author of all thy distresses wish happiness to him who had robbed thee of all thy favorite expectations in this life to him who had been the cause that thou were cut off in the bloom of youth  heavenly aspirer  what a frame must thou be in to be able to use the word only in mentioning these important deprivations  and as this was before thou puttedst off mortality may i not presume that thou now  with pitying eye not derogating from thy perfect bliss surveyst all heaven around and wishest for me   consider my ways  dear life of my life of what avail is consideration now when i have lost the dear creature for whose sake alone it was worth while to have consideration  lost her beyond retrieve  swallowed up by the greedy grave  for ever lost her  that that is the sting  matchless woman  how does this reflection wound me  your golden dream cannot long last  divine prophetess my golden dream is already over thought and reflection are no longer to be kept off  no longer continues that hardened insensibility thou chargest upon me  remorse has broken in upon me  dreadful is my condition  it is all conscience and horror with me  a thousand vulturs in turn are prying upon my heart  but no more of these fruitless reflections  since i am incapable of writing anything else since my pen will slide into this gloomy subject whether i will or not i will once more quit it nor will i again resume it till i can be more its master and my own  all i took pen to write for is however unwritten it was in few words to wish you to proceed with your communications as usual and why should you not  since in her evertobelamented death i know everything shocking and grievous  acquaint me then with all thou know which i do not know how her relations her cruel relations take it and whether now the barbed dart of afterreflection sticks not in their hearts as in mine up to the very feathers   i will soon quit this kingdom for now my clarissa is no more what is there in it in the world indeed worth living for  but should i not first by some masterly mischief avenge her and myself upon her cursed family  the accused woman they tell me has broken her leg why was it not her neck  all all but what is owing to her relations is the fault of that woman and of her hellborn nymphs the greater the virtue the nobler the triumph was a sentence for ever in their mouths  i have had it several times in my head to set fire to the execrable house and to watch at the doors and windows that not a devil in it escape the consuming flames had the house stood by itself i had certainly done it  but it seems the old wretch is in the way to be rewarded without my help a shocking letter is received of somebodys in relation to her  yours i suppose  too shocking for me they say to see at present see p      they govern me as a child in strings yet did i suffer so much in my fever that i am willing to bear with them till i can get tolerably well  at present i can neither eat drink nor sleep yet are my disorders nothing to what they were for jack my brain was on fire day and night and had it not been of the asbestos kind it had all been consumed  i had no distinct ideas but of dark and confused misery it was all conscience and horror indeed thoughts of hanging drowning shooting then rage violence mischief and despair took their turns with me my lucid intervals still worse giving me to reflect upon what i was the hour before and what i was likely to be the next and perhaps for life  the sport of enemies the laughter of fools and the hangingsleevd gocarted property of hired slaves who were perhaps to find their account in manacling and abhorred thought in personally abusing me by blows and stripes  who can bear such reflections as these to be made to fear only to such a one as me and to fear such wretches too  what a thing was this but remotely to apprehend and yet for a man to be in such a state as to render it necessary for his dearest friends to suffer this to be done for his own sake and in order to prevent further mischief  there is no thinking of these things  i will not think of them therefore but will either get a train of cheerful ideas or hang myself by tomorrow morning   to be a dog and dead were paradise to such a life as mine letter lxxxviii mr lovelace to john belford esquire wedn sept  0 i write to demand back again my last letter i own it was my mind at the different times i wrote it and whatever ailed me i could not help writing it such a gloomy impulse came upon me and increased as i wrote that for my soul i could not forbear running into the miserable  it is strange very strange that a mans conscience should be able to force his fingers to write whether he will or not and to run him into a subject he more than once at the very time resolved not to think of  nor is it less strange that no new reason occurring he should in a day or two more so totally change his mind have his mind i should rather say so wholly illuminated by gay hopes and rising prospects as to be ashamed of what he had written  for on reperusal of a copy of my letter which fell into my hands by accident in the handwriting of my cousin charlotte who unknown to me had transcribed it i find it to be such a letter as an enemy would rejoice to see  this i know that were i to have continued but one week more in the way i was in when i wrote the latter part of it i should have been confined and in straw the next for i now recollect that all my distemper was returning upon me with irresistible violence  and that in spite of water gruel and soupe maigre  i own that i am still excessively grieved at the disappointment this admirable woman made it so much her whimsical choice to give me but since it has thus fallen out since she was determined to leave the world and since she actually ceases to be ought i who have such a share of life and health in hand to indulge gloomy reflections upon an event that is passed and being passed cannot be recalled  have i not had a specimen of what will be my case if i do  for belford it is a folly to deny it i have been to use an old word quite bestraught  why why did my mother bring me up to bear no control why was i so educated as that to my very tutors it was a request that i should not know what contradiction or disappointment was  ought she not to have known what cruelty there was in her kindness  what a punishment to have my first very great disappointment touch my intellect  and intellects once touched  but that i cannot bear to think of  only thus far the very repentance and amendment wished me so heartily by my kind and cross dear have been invalidated and postponed who knows for how long the amendment at least  can a madman be capable of either  once touched therefore i must endeavor to banish those gloomy reflections which might otherwise have brought on the right turn of mind and this to express myself in lord ms style that my wits may not be sent a woollgathering  for let me moreover own to thee that dr hale who was my good astolfo you read ariosto jack and has brought me back my witjar had much ado by starving diet by profuse phlebotomy by flaying blisters eyletholecupping a dark room a midnight solitude in a midday sun to effect my recovery and now for my comfort he tells me that i may still have returns upon full moons  horrible most horrible  and must be as careful of myself at both equinoctials as caesar was warned to be of the ides of march  how my heart sickens at looking back upon what i was denied the sun and all comfort all my visiters lowborn tiptoe attendants even those tiptoe slaves never approaching me but periodically armed with gallipots boluss and cephalic draughts delivering their orders to me in hated whispers and answering other curtainholding impertinents inquiring how i was and how i took their execrable potions whisperingly too what a cursed stilllife this  nothing active in me or about me but the worm that never dies  again i hasten from the recollection of scenes which will at times obtrude themselves upon me  adieu belford  but return me my last letter  and build nothing upon its contents i must i will i have already overcome these fruitless gloominesses every hour my constitution rises stronger and stronger to befriend me and except a tributary sigh now and then to the memory of my hearts beloved it gives me hope that i shall quickly be what i was  life spirit gaiety and once more the plague of a sex that has been my plague and will be every mans plague at one time or other of his life  i repeat my desire however that you will write to me as usual i hope you have good store of particulars by you to communicate when i can better bear to hear of the dispositions that were made for all that was mortal of my beloved clarissa  but it will be the joy of my heart to be told that her implacable friends are plagued with remorse such things as those you may now send me for company in misery is some relief especially when a man can think those he hates as miserable as himself  once more adieu jack  letter lxxxix mr lovelace to john belford esquire i am preparing to leave this kingdom mowbray and tourville promise to give me their company in a month or two  i will give thee my route  i shall first to paris and for amusement and diversion sake try to renew some of my old friendships thence to some of the german courts thence perhaps to vienna thence descend through bavaria and the tyrol to venice where i shall keep the carnival thence to florence and turin thence again over mount cenis to france and when i return again to paris shall expect to see my friend belford who by that time i doubt not will be all crusted and bearded over with penitence selfdenial and mortification a very anchorite only an itinerant one journeying over in hope to cover a multitude of his own sins by proselyting his old companion  but let me tell thee jack if stock rises on as it has done since i wrote my last letter i am afraid thou will find a difficult task in succeeding should such be thy purpose  nor i verily think can thy own penitence and reformation hold strong habits are not so easily rooted out old satan has had too much benefit from thy faithful services for a series of years to let thee so easily get out of his clutches he knows what will do with thee a fine strapping bona roba in the chartrestaste but welllimbd clearcomplexiond and turkisheyd thou the first man with her or made to believe so which is the same thing how will thy frosty face shine upon such an object how will thy tristful visage be illumined by it a composition will be made between thee and the grand tempter thou will promise to do him suit and service till old age and inability come and then will he in all probability be sure of thee for ever for were thou to outlive thy present reigning appetites he will trump up some other darling sin or make a now secondary one darling in order to keep thee firmly attached to his infernal interests thou will continue resolving to amend but never amending till grown old before thou art aware  a dozen years after thou art old with everybody else thy fortimebuilt tenement having lasted its allotted period he claps down upon thy grizzled head the universal trapdoor and then all will be over with thee in his own way  thou will think these hints uncharacteristic from me but yet i cannot help warning thee of the danger thou art actually in which is the greater as thou seem not to know it a few words more therefore on this subject  thou have made good resolutions if thou keep them not thou will never be able to keep any but nevertheless the devil and thy time of life are against thee and six to one thou failest were it only that thou have resolved six to one thou failest and if thou do thou will become the scoff of men and the triumph of devils  then how will i laugh at thee for this warning is not from principle perhaps i wish it were but i never lied to man and hardly ever said truth to woman the first is what all free livers cannot say the second what every one can  i am mad again by jupiter  but thank my stars not gloomily so  farewell farewell farewell for the third or fourth time concludes  thy lovelace i believe charlotte and you are in private league together letters i find have passed between her and you and lord m i have been kept strangely in the dark of late but will soon break upon you all as the sun upon a midnight thief remember that you never sent me the copy of my beloveds will    letter xc mr belford to robert lovelace esquire friday sept    just as i was sitting down to answer yours of the   th to the   th in order to give you all the consolation in my power came your revoking letter of wednesday  i am really concerned and disappointed that your first was so soon followed by one so contrary to it  the shocking letter you mention which your friends withold from you is indeed from me they may now i see show you anything ask them then for that letter if you think it worth while to read aught about the true mother of your mind  i will suppose that thou have just read the letter thou call shocking and which i intended to be so and let me ask what thou think of it do thou not tremble at the horrors the vilest of women labors with on the apprehensions of death and future judgment  how sit the reflections that must have been raised by the perusal of this letter upon thy yet unclosed eyletholes will not some serious thoughts mingle with thy melilot and tear off the callus of thy mind as that may flay the leather from thy back and as thy epispastics may strip the parchment from thy plotting head if not then indeed is thy conscience feared and no hopes will lie for thee  mr belford then gives an account of the wretched sinclairs terrible exit which he had just then received    if this move thee not i have news to acquaint thee with of another dismal catastrophe that is but within this hour come to my ear of another of thy blessed agents thy tomlinson  dying and in all probability before this can reach thee dead in maidstone gaol as thou say in thy first letter something strangely retributive seems to be working  this his case he was at the head of a gang of smugglers endeavoring to carry off run goods landed last tuesday when a party of dragoons came up with them in the evening some of his comrades fled mcdonald being surrounded attempted to fight his way through and wounded his man but having received a shot in his neck and being cut deeply in the head by a broadsword he fell from his horse was taken and carried to maidstonegaol and there my informant left him just dying and assured of hanging if he recover  absolutely destitute he got a kinsman of his to apply to me and if in town to the rest of the confraternity for something not to support him was the word for he expected not to live till the fellow returned but to bury him  i never employed him but once and then he ruined my project i now thank heaven that he did but i sent him three guineas and promised him more as from you and mowbray and tourville if he live a few days or to take his trial and i put it upon you to make further inquiry of him and to give him what you think fit  his messenger tells me that he is very penitent that he weeps continually he cries out that he has been the vilest of men yet palliates that his necessities made him worse than he should otherwise have been an excuse which none of us can plead but that what touched him most of all was a vile imposture he was put upon to serve a certain gentleman of fortune to the ruin of the most excellent woman that ever lived and who he had heard was dead of grief  let me consider lovelace  whose turn can be next  i wish it may not be thine but since thou give me one piece of advice which i should indeed have thought out of character had thou not taken pains to convince me that it proceeds not from principle i will give thee another and that is prosecute as fast as thou can thy intended tour change of scene and of climate may establish thy health while this gross air and the approach of winter may thicken thy blood and with the help of a conscience that is upon the struggle with thee and like a cunning wrestler watches its opportunity to give thee another fall may make thee miserable for thy life  i return your revoked letter dont destroy it however the same dialect may one day come in fashion with you again  as to the family at harloweplace i have most affecting letters from colonel morden relating to their grief and distress you to whom the occasion is owing do well to rejoice in their compunction but as one well observes averse as they were to you they must and they would have been reconciled in time had you done her justice  i should be sorry if i could not say that what you have warned me of in sport makes me tremble in earnest i hope for this is a serious subject with me though nothing can be so with you that i never shall deserve by my apostasy to be the scoff of men and the triumph of devils  all that you say of the difficulty of conquering rooted habits is but too true those and time of life are indeed too much against me but when i reflect upon the ends some untimely of those of our companions whom we have formerly lost upon beltons miserable exit upon the howls and screams of sinclair which are still in my ears and now upon your miserable tomlinson and compare their ends with the happy and desirable end of the inimitable miss harlowe i hope i have reason to think my footing morally secure your caution nevertheless will be of use however you might design it and since i know my weak side i will endeavor to fortify myself in that quarter by marriage as soon as i can make myself worthy of the confidence and esteem of some virtuous woman and by this means become the subject of your envy rather than of your scoffs  i have already begun my retributory purposes as i may call them i have settled an annual sum for life upon poor john loftus whom i disabled while he was endeavoring to protect his young mistress from my lawless attempts i rejoice that i succeeded not in that as i do in recollecting many others of the like sort in which i miscarried  poor farley who had become a bankrupt i have set up again but have declared that the annual allowance i make her shall cease if i hear she returns to her former courses and i have made her accountable for her conduct to the good widow lovick whom i have taken at a handsome salary for my housekeeper at edgeware for i have let the house at watford and she is to dispense the quarterly allotment to her as she merits  this good woman shall have other matters of the like nature under her care as we grow better acquainted and i make no doubt that she will answer my expectations and that i shall be both confirmed and improved by her conversation for she shall generally sit at my own table  the undeserved sufferings of miss clarissa harlowe her exalted merit her exemplary preparation and her happy end will be standing subjects with us  she shall read to me when i have no company write for me out of books passages she shall recommend her years turned of fifty and her good character will secure me from scandal and i have great pleasure in reflecting that i shall be better myself for making her happy  then whenever i am in danger i will read some of the admirable ladys papers whenever i would abhor my former ways i will read some of thine and copies of my own  the consequence of all this will be that i shall be the delight of my own relations of both sexes who were wont to look upon me as a lost man i shall have good order in my own family because i shall give the example myself i shall be visited and respected not perhaps by lovelace by mowbray and by tourville because they cannot see me upon the old terms and will not perhaps see me upon the new but by the best and worthiest gentlemen clergy as well as laity all around me i shall look upon my past follies with contempt upon my old companions with pity oaths and curses shall be for ever banished from my mouth in their place shall succeed conversation becoming a rational being and a gentleman and instead of acts of offense subjecting me perpetually to acts of defense will i endeavor to atone for my past evils by doing all the good in my power and by becoming an universal benefactor to the extent of that power  now tell me lovelace upon this faint sketch of what i hope to do and to be if this be not a scheme infinitely preferable to the wild the pernicious the dangerous ones both to body and soul which we have pursued  i wish i could make my sketch as amiable to you as it appears to me i wish it with all my soul for i always loved you it has been my misfortune that i did for this led me into infinite riots and follies which otherwise i verily think i should not have been guilty of  you have a great deal more to answer for than i have were it only in the temporal ruin of this admirable woman let me now while yet you have youth and health and intellect prevail upon you for i am afraid very much afraid that such is the enormity of this single wickedness in depriving the world of such a shining light that if you do not quickly reform it will be out of your power to reform at all and that providence which has already given you the fates of your agents sinclair and tomlinson to take warning by will not let the principal offender escape if he slight the warning  you will perhaps laugh at me for these serious reflections do if you will i had rather you should laugh at me for continuing in this way of thinking and acting than triumph over me as you threaten on my swerving from purposes i have determined upon with such good reason and from such good examples  and so much for this subject at present  i should be glad to know when you intend to set out i have too much concern for your welfare not to wish you in a thinner air and more certain climate  what have tourville and mowbray to do that they cannot set out with you they will not cove my company i dare say and i shall not be able to endure theirs when you are gone take them therefore with you  i will not however forswear making you a visit at paris at your return from germany and italy but hardly with the hope of reclaiming you if due reflection upon what i have set before you and upon what you have written in your two last will not by that time have done it  i suppose i shall see you before you go once more i wish you were gone this heavy islandair cannot do for you what that of the continent will  i do not think i ought to communicate with you as i used to do on this side the channel let me then hear from you on the opposite shore and you shall command the pen as you please and honestly the power of  j belford  letter xci mr lovelace to john belford esquire tuesday sept    fate i believe in my conscience spins threads for tragedies on purpose for thee to weave with  thy watford uncle poor belon the fair inimitable exalted creature and is she to be found in such a list the accursed woman and tomlinson seem to have been all doomed to give thee a theme for the dismal and the horrible  and by my soul as lord m would phrase it thou do work it going  that is the horrid thing a man cannot begin to think but causes for thought crowd in upon him the gloomy takes place and mirth and gaiety abandon his heart for ever  poor mcdonald  i am really sorry for the fellow  he was an useful faithful solemn varlet who could act incomparably any part given him and knew not what a blush was  he really took honest pains for me in the last affair which has cost him and me so dearly in reflection often gravelled as we both were yet was he never daunted  poor mcdonald i must once more say  for carrying on a solemn piece of roguery he had no equal  i was so solicitous to know if he were really as bad as thou have a knack of painting everybody whom thou singlest out to exercise thy murdering pen upon that i dispatched a man and horse to maidstone as soon as i had thine and had word brought me that he died in two hours after he had received thy three guineas and all thou wrotest of his concern in relation to the everdear miss harlowe it seems was true  i cannot help it belford  i have only to add that it is happy that the poor fellow lived not to be hanged as it seems he would have been for who knows as he had got into such a penitential strain what might have been in his dying speech  when a man has not great good to comfort himself with it is right to make the best of the little that may offer there never was any discomfort happened to mortal man but some little ray of consolation would dart in if the wretch was not so much a wretch as to draw instead of undraw the curtain to keep it out  and so much at this time and for ever for poor capt tomlinson as i called him  your solicitude to get me out of this heavy changeable climate exactly tallies with everybodys here they all believe that traveling will establish me yet i think i am quite well only these plaguey news and fulls and the equinoctials fright me a little when i think of them and that is always for the whole family are continually ringing these changes in my ears and are more sedulously intent than i can well account for to get me out of the kingdom  but will thou write often when i am gone will thou then piece the thread where thou brokest it off will thou give me the particulars of their distress who were my auxiliaries in bringing on the event that affects me  nay principals rather since say what thou will what did i do worth a womans breaking her heart for  faith and troth jack i have had very hard usage as i have often said  to have such a plaguey ill name given me pointed at screamed out upon run away from as a mad dog would be all my own friends ready to renounce me   yet i think i deserve it all for have i not been as ready to give up myself as others are to condemn me  what madness what folly this  who will take the part of a man that condemns himself  who can he that pleads guilty to an indictment leaves no room for ought but the sentence out upon me for an impolitic wretch i have not the art of the least artful of any of our christian princes who every day are guilty of ten times worse breaches of faith and yet issuing out a manifesto they wipe their mouths and go on from infraction to infraction from robbery to robbery commit devastation upon devastation and destroy  for their glory and are rewarded with the names of conquerors and are dubbed le grand praised and even deified by orators and poets for their butcheries and depredations  while i a poor single harmless prowler at least comparatively harmless in order to satisfy my hunger steal but one poor lamb and every mouth is opened every hand is lifted up against me  nay as i have just now heard i am to be manifestod against though no prince for miss how threatens to have the case published to the whole world  i have a good mind not to oppose it and to write an answer to it as soon as it comes forth and exculpate myself by throwing all the fault upon the old ones and this i have to plead supposing all that my worst enemies can allege against me were true  that i am not answerable for all the extravagant and unforeseen consequences that this affair has been attended with  and this i will prove demonstrably by a case which but a few hours ago i put to lord m and to the two misses montague this it is suppose a a miser had hid a parcel of gold in a secret place in order to keep it there till he could lend it out at extravagant interest  suppose b in such great want of this treasure as to be unable to live without it  and suppose a the miser has such an opinion of b the wanter that he would rather lend it to him than to any mortal living but yet though he has no other use in the world for it insists upon very unconscionable terms  b would gladly pay common interest for it but would be undone in his own opinion at least and that is everything to him if he complied with the misers terms since he would be sure to be soon thrown into gaol for the debt and made a prisoner for life wherefore guessing being an arch penetrating fellow where the sweet hoard lies he searches for it when the miser is in a profound sleep finds it and runs away with it  b in this case can be only a thief that is plain jack    here miss montague put in very smartly  a thief sir said she that steals what is and ought to be dearer to me than my life deserves less to be forgiven than he who murders me  but what is this cousin charlotte said i that is dearer to you than your life your honor you will say  i will not talk to a lady i never did in a way she cannot answer me  but in the instance for which i put my case allowing all you attribute to the phantom what honor is lost where the will is not violated and the person cannot help it but with respect to the case put how knew we till the theft was committed that the miser did actually set so romantic a value upon the treasure  both my cousins were silent and my lord cursed me because he could not answer me and i proceeded  well then the result is that b can only be a thief that is plain  to pursue therefore my case  suppose this same miserly a on awaking and searching for and finding his treasure gone takes it so much to heart that he starves himself  who but himself is to blame for that  would either equity law or conscience hang b for a murder    and now to apply said i   none of your applications cried my cousins both in a breath  none of your applications and be d  nd to you the passionate peer  well then returned i i am to conclude it to be a case so plain that it needs none looking at the two girls who tried for a blush apiece and i hold myself of consequence acquitted of the death  not so cried my lord peers are judges thou know jack in the last resort for if by committing an unlawful act a capital crime is the consequence you are answerable for both  say you so my good lord  but will you take upon you to say supposing as in the present case a rape saving your presence cousin charlotte saving your presence cousin patty is death the natural consequence of a rape  did you ever hear my lord or did you ladies that it was  and if not the natural consequence and a lady will destroy herself whether by a lingering death as of grief or by the dagger as lucretia did is there more than one fault the mans  is not the other here is  were it not so let me tell you my dears chucking each of my blushing cousins under the chin we either have had no men so wicked as young tarquin was or no women so virtuous as lucretia in the space of  how many thousand years my lord  and so lucretia is recorded as a single wonder  you may believe i was cried out upon people who cannot answer will rave and this they all did but i insisted upon it to them and so i do to you jack that i ought to be acquitted of everything but a common theft a private larceny as the lawyers call it in this point and were my life to be a forfeit to the law it would not be for murder  besides as i told them there was a circumstance strongly in my favor in this case for i would have been glad with all my soul to have purchased my forgiveness by a compliance with the terms i first boggled at and this i offered and my lord and lady betty and lady sarah and my two cousins and all my cousins cousins to the fourteenth generation would have been bound for me  but it would not do the sweet miser would break her heart and die and how could i help it  upon the whole jack had not the lady died would there have been half so much said of it as there is was i the cause of her death or could i help it and have there not been in a million of cases like this nine hundred and ninetynine thousand that have not ended as this has ended  how hard then is my fate  upon my soul i will not bear it as i have done but instead of taking guilt to myself claim pity and this since yesterday cannot be recalled is the only course i can pursue to make myself easy proceed anon  letter xcii mr lovelace to john belford esquire but what a pretty scheme of life have thou drawn out for thyself and thy old widow by my soul jack i am mightily taken with it there is but one thing wanting in it and that will come of course only to be in the commission and one of the quorum thou art already provided with a clerk as good as thou wilt want for thou understandest law and she conscience a good lord chancellor between ye  i should take prodigious pleasure to hear thee decide in a bastard case upon thy new notions and old remembrances  but raillery apart all gloom at heart by jupiter although the pen and the countenance assume airs of levity if after all thou can so easily repent and reform as thou think thou can if thou can thus shake off thy old sins and thy old habits and if thy old master will so readily dismiss so tried and so faithful a servant and permit thee thus calmly to enjoy thy new system no room for scandal all temptation ceasing and if at last thy reformation warranted and approved by time thou marriest and live honest  why belford i cannot but say that if all these ifs come to pass thou stand a good chance to be a happy man  all i think as i told thee in my last is that the devil knows his own interest too well to let thee off so easily thou thyself tellest me that we cannot repent when we will and indeed i found it so for in my lucid intervals i made good resolutions but as health turned its blyth side to me and opened my prospects of recovery all my old inclinations and appetites returned and this letter perhaps will be a thorough conviction to thee that i am as wild a fellow as ever or in the way to be so  thou ask me very seriously if upon the faint sketch thou have drawn thy new scheme be not infinitely preferable to any of those which we have so long pursued  why jack  let me reflect  why belford  i cannot say but it is it is really as biddy in the play says a good comfortable scheme  but when thou tellest me that it was thy misfortune to love me because thy value for me made thee a wickeder man than otherwise thou would have been i desire thee to revolve this assertion and i am persuaded that thou will not find thyself in so right a train as thou imaginest  no false colorings no glosses does a true penitent aim at debasement diffidence mortification contrition are all near of kin jack and inseparable from a repentant spirit  if thou know not this thou art not got three steps out of threescore toward repentance and amendment and let me remind thee before the grand accuser comes to do it that thou were ever above being a passive follower in iniquity though thou had not so good an invention as he to whom thou writest thou had as active an heart for mischief as ever i met with in man  then for improving an hint thou were always a true englishman i never started a roguery that did not come out of thy forge in a manner ready anvilled and hammered for execution when i have sometimes been at a loss to make anything of it myself  what indeed made me appear to be more wicked than thee was that i being a handsome fellow and thou an ugly one when we had started a game and hunted it down the poor frighted puss generally chose to throw herself into my paws rather than into thine and then disappointed have thou wiped thy blubberlips and marched off to start a new game calling me a wicked fellow all the while  in short belford thou were an excellent starter and setter the old women were not afraid for their daughters when they saw such a face as thine but when i came whip was the key turned upon their girls and yet all signified nothing for love upon occasion will draw an elephant through a keyhole but for thy heart belford who ever doubted that  nor even in this affair that sticks most upon me and which my conscience makes such a handle of against me art thou so innocent as thou fansiest thyself thou will stare at this but it is true and i will convince thee of it in an instant  thou say thou would have saved the lady from the ruin she met with thou art a pretty fellow for this for how would thou have saved her what methods did thou take to save her  thou knew my designs all along had thou a mind to make thyself a good title to the merit to which thou now pretendest to lay claim thou should like a true knight errant have sought to set the lady free from her enchanted castle thou should have apprised her of her danger have stolen in when the giant was out of the way or had thou the true spirit of chivalry upon thee and nothing else would have done have killed the giant and then something would thou have had to brag of  o but the giant was my friend he reposed a confidence in me and i should have betrayed my friend and his confidence this thou would have pleaded no doubt but try this plea upon thy present principles and thou will see what a caitiff thou were to let it have weight with thee upon an occasion where a breach of confidence is more excuseable than to keep the secret  thou can not pretend and i know thou will not that thou were afraid of thy life by taking such a measure for a braver fellow lives not nor a more fearless than jack belford i remember several instances and thou can not forget them where thou have ventured thy bones thy neck thy life against numbers in a cause of roguery and had thou had a spark of that virtue which now thou art willing to flatter thyself thou have thou would surely have run a risk to save an innocence and a virtue that it became every man to protect and espouse this is the truth of the case greatly as it makes against myself but i hate an hypocrite from my soul  i believe i should have killed thee at the time if i could had thou betrayed me thus but i am sure now that i would have thanked thee for it with all my heart and thought thee more a father and a friend than my real father and my best friend  and it was natural for thee to think with so exalted a merit as this lady had that this would have been the case when consideration took place of passion or rather when that damned fondness for intrigue ceased which never was my pride so much as it is now upon reflection my curse  set about defending thyself and i will probe thee still deeper and convict thee still more effectually that thou have more guilt than merit even in this affair and as to all the others in which we have hunted in couples thou were always the forwardest whelp and more ready by far to run away with me than i with thee yet can thou now compose thy horsemuscles and cry out how much more have thou lovelace to answer for than i have  saying nothing neither when thou say this were it true  for thou will not be tried when the time comes by comparison  in short thou may at this rate so miserably deceive thyself that notwithstanding all thy selfdenial and mortification when thou closest thy eyes thou may perhaps open them in a place where thou thoughtest least to be  however consult thy old woman on this subject i shall be thought to be out of character if i go on in this strain but really as to a title to merit in this affair i do assure thee jack that thou less deservest praise than an horsepond and i wish i had the sousing of thee  i am actually now employed in taking leave of my friends in the country i had once thoughts of taking tomlinson as i called him with me but his destiny has frustrated that intention  next monday i think to see you in town and then you and i and mowbray and tourville will laugh off that evening together they will both accompany me as i expect you will to dover if not cross the water i must leave you and them good friends they take extremely amiss the treatment you have given them in your last letters they say you strike at their understandings i laugh at them and tell them that those people who have least are the most apt to be angry when it is called in question  make up all the papers and narratives you can spare me against the time the will particularly i expect to take with me who knows but that those things which will help to secure you in the way you are got into may convert me  thou talkest of a wife jack what think thou of our charlotte her family and fortune i doubt according to thy scheme are a little too high will those be an objection charlotte is a smart girl for piety thy present turn i cannot say much yet she is as serious as most of her sex at her time of life  would flaunt it a little i believe too like the rest of them were her reputation under covert  but it will not do neither now i think of it  thou art so homely and so awkward a creature have such a boatswain like air  people would think she had picked thee up in wapping or rotherhith or in going to see some new ship launched or to view the docks at chatham or portsmouth so gaudy and so clumsy thy tawdriness will not do with charlotte  so sit thee down contented belford  yet would i fain secure thy morals too if matrimony will do it  let me see  now i have it  has not the widow lovick a daughter or a niece it is not every girl of fortune and family that will go to prayers with thee once or twice a day but since thou art for taking a wife to mortify with what if thou marriest the widow herself  she will then have a double concern in thy conversion you and she may tete a tete pass many a comfortable winters evening together comparing experiences as the good folks call them  i am serious jack faith i am and i would have thee take it into thy wise consideration  letter xciii mr belford to colonel morden thursday sept    give me leave dear sir to address myself to you in a very serious and solemn manner on a subject that i must not cannot dispense with as i promised the divine lady that i would do everything in my power to prevent that further mischief which she was so very apprehensive of  i will not content myself with distant hints it is with very great concern that i have just now heard of a declaration which you are said to have made to your relations at harloweplace that you will not rest till you have avenged your cousins wrongs upon mr lovelace  far be it from me to offer to defend the unhappy man or even unduly to extenuate his crime but yet i must say that the family by their persecutions of the dear lady at first and by their implacableness afterward ought at least to share the blame with him there is even great reason to believe that a lady of such a religious turn her virtue neither to be surprised nor corrupted her will inviolate would have got over a mere personal injury especially as he would have done all that was in his power to repair it and as from the application of all his family in his favor and other circumstances attending his sincere and voluntary offer the lady might have condescended with greater glory to herself than if he had never offended  when i have the pleasure of seeing you next i will acquaint you sir with all the circumstances of this melancholy story from which you will see that mr lovelace was extremely illtreated at first by the whole family this admirable lady excepted this exception i know heightens his crime but as his principal intention was but to try her virtue and that he became so earnest a suppliant to her for marriage and as he has suffered so deplorably in the loss of his reason for not having it in his power to repair her wrongs i presume to hope that much is to be pleaded against such a resolution as you are said to have made  i will read to you at the same time some passages from letters of his two of which one but this moment received will convince you that the unhappy man who is but now recovering his intellects needs no greater punishment than what he has from his own reflections  i have just now read over the copies of the dear ladys posthumous letters i send them all to you except that directed for mr lovelace which i reserve till i have the pleasure of seeing you let me entreat you to read once more that to yourself and that to her brother see p      which latter i now send you as they are in point to the present subject  i think sir they are unanswerable such at least is the effect they have upon me that i hope i shall never be provoked to draw my sword again in a private quarrel  to the weight these must needs have upon you let me add that the unhappy man has given no new occasion of offense since your visit to him at lord ms when you were so well satisfied of his intention to repair his crimes that you yourself urged to your dear cousin her forgiveness of him  let me also though i presume to hope there is no need when you coolly consider everything remind you of your own promise to your departing cousin relying upon which her last moments were the easier  my dear colonel morden the highest injury was to her her family all have a share in the cause she forgives it why should we not endeavor to imitate what we admire  you asked me sir when in town if a brave man could be a premeditatedly base one  generally speaking i believe bravery and baseness are incompatible but mr lovelaces character in the instance before us affords a proof of the truth of the common observation that there is no general rule but has its exceptions for england i believe as gallant a nation as it is deemed to be has not in it a braver spirit than his nor a man who has greater skill at his weapons nor more calmness with his skill  i mention not this with a thought that it can affect col morden who if he be not withheld by superior motives as well as influenced by those i have reminded him of will tell me that this skill and this bravery will make him the more worthy of being called upon by him  to these superior motives then i refer myself and with the greater confidence as a pursuit ending in blood would not at this time have the plea lie for it with anybody which sudden passion might have with some but would be construed by all to be a cool and deliberate act of revenge for an evil absolutely irretrievable an act which a brave and noble spirit such as the gentlemans to whom i now write is not capable of  excuse me sir for the sake of my executorial duty and promise keeping in eye the dear ladys personal injunctions as well as written will enforced by letters posthumous every article of which solicitous as we both are to see it duly performed she would have dispensed with rather than farther mischief should happen on her account i am  dear sir your affectionate and faithful servant john belford   the following is the posthumous letter to col morden referred to in the above  letter xciv superscribed to my beloved cousin william morden esquire to be delivered after my death my dearest cousin as it is uncertain from my present weak state whether if living i may be in a condition to receive as i ought the favor you intend me of a visit when you come to london i take this opportunity to return you while able the humble acknowlegements of a grateful heart for all your goodness to me from childhood till now and more particularly for your present kind interposition in my favor  god almighty for ever bless you dear sir for the kindness you endeavored to procure for me  one principal end of my writing to you in this solemn manner is to beg of you which i do with the utmost earnestness that when you come to hear the particulars of my story you will not suffer active resentment to take place in your generous breast on my account  remember my dear cousin that vengeance is gods province and he has undertaken to repay it nor will you i hope invade that province  especially as there is no necessity for you to attempt to vindicate my fame since the offender himself before he is called upon has stood forth and offered to do me all the justice that you could have extorted from him had i lived and when your own person may be endangered by running an equal risque with a guilty man  duelling sir i need not tell you who have adorned a public character is not only an usurpation of the divine prerogative but it is an insult upon magistracy and good government it is an impious act it is an attempt to take away a life that ought not to depend upon a private sword an act the consequence of which is to hurry a soul all its sins upon its head into perdition endangering that of the poor triumpher  since neither intend to give to the other that chance as i may call it for the divine mercy in an opportunity for repentance which each presumes to hope for himself  seek not then i beseech you sir to aggravate my fault by a pursuit of blood which must necessarily be deemed a consequence of it give not the unhappy man the merit were you assuredly to be the victor of falling by your hand at present he is the perfidious the ungrateful deceiver but will not the forfeiture of his life and the probable loss of his soul be a dreadful expiation for having made me miserable for a few months only and through that misery by the divine favor happy to all eternity  in such a case my cousin where shall the evil stop and who shall avenge on you  and who on your avenger  let the poor mans conscience then dear sir avenge me he will one day find punishment more than enough from that leave him to the chance of repentance if the almighty will give him time for it why should you deny it him  let him still be the guilty aggressor and let no one say clarissa harlowe is now amply revenged in his fall or in the case of yours which heaven avert that her fault instead of being buried in her grave is perpetuated and aggravated by a loss far greater than that of herself  often sir has the more guilty been the vanquisher of the less an earl of shrewsbury in the reign of charles ii as i have read endeavoring to revenge the greatest injury that man can do to man met with his death at barnelms from the hand of the ignoble duke who had vilely dishonored him nor can it be thought an unequal dispensation were it generally to happen that the usurper of the divine prerogative should be punished for his presumption by the man whom he sought to destroy and who however previously criminal is put in this case upon a necessary act of selfdefence  may heaven protect you sir in all your ways and once more i pray reward you for all your kindness to me a kindness so worthy of your heart and so exceedingly grateful to mine that of seeking to make peace and to reconcile parents to a once beloved child uncles to a niece late their favorite and a brother and sister to a sister whom once they thought not unworthy of that tender relation a kindness so greatly preferable to the vengeance of the murdering sword  be a comforter dear sir to my honored parents as you have been to me and may we through the divine goodness to us both meet in that blessed eternity into which as i humbly trust i shall have entered when you read this  so prays and to her latest hour will pray my dear cousin morden my friend my guardian but not my avenger  dear sir remember that   your everaffectionate and obliged clarissa harlowe  letter xcv colonel morden to john belford esquire sat sept    dear sir i am very sorry that anything you have heard i have said should give you uneasiness  i am obliged to you for the letters you have communicated to me and still further for your promise to favor me with others occasionally  all that relates to my dear cousin i shall be glad to see be it from whom it will  i leave to your own discretion what may or may not be proper for miss how to see from so free a pen as mine  i admire her spirit were she a man do you think sir she would at this time have your advice to take upon such a subject as that you write upon  fear not however that your communications shall put me upon any measures that otherwise i should not have taken the wickedness sir is of such a nature as admits not of aggravation  yet i do assure you that i have not made any resolutions that will be a tie upon me  i have indeed expressed myself with vehemence upon the occasion who could forbear to do so but it is not my way to resolve in matters of moment till opportunity brings the execution of my purposes within my reach we shall see what manner of spirit this young man will be acted by on his recovery if he continue to brave and defy a family which he has so irreparably injured  if  but resolutions depending upon future contingencies are best left to future determination as i just now hinted  mean time i will own that i think my cousins arguments unanswerable no good man but must be concluded by them  but alas sir who is good  as to your arguments i hope you will believe me when i assure you as i now do that your opinion and your reasonings have and will always have great and deserved weight with me and that i respect you still more than i did if possible for your expostulations in favor of the end of my cousins pious injunctions to me they come from you sir with the greatest propriety as her executor and representative and likewise as you are a man of humanity and a wellwisher to both parties  i am not exempt from violent passions sir any more than your friend but then i hope they are only capable of being raised by other peoples insolence and not by my own arrogance if ever i am stimulated by my imperfections and my resentments to act against my judgment and my cousins injunctions some such reflections as these that follow will run away with my reason indeed they are always present with me  in the first place my own disappointment who came over with the hope of passing the remainder of my days in the conversation of a kinswoman so beloved and to whom i had a double relation as her cousin and trustee then i reflect tootoo often perhaps for my engagements to her in her last hours that the dear creature could only forgive for herself she no doubt is happy but who shall forgive for a whole family in all its branches made miserable for their lives that the more faulty her friends were as to her the more enormous his ingratitude and the more inexcusable  what sir was it not enough that she suffered what she did for him but the barbarian must make her suffer for her sufferings for his sake  passion makes me express this weakly passion refuses strength sometimes where the propriety of a resentment prima facie declares expression to be needless i leave it to you sir to give this reflection its due force that the author of this diffusive mischief perpetrated it premeditatedly wantonly in the gaiety of his heart to try my cousin say you sir to try the virtue of a clarissa sir  had she then given him any cause to doubt her virtue  it could not be  if he averrs that she did  i am indeed called upon  but i will have patience that he carried her as now it appears to a vile brothel purposely to put her out of all human resource himself out of the reach of all humane remorse and that finding her proof against all the common arts of delusion base and unmanly arts were there used to effect his wicked purposes once dead the injured saint in her will says he has seen her that i could not know this when i saw him at m hall that the object of his attempts considered i could not suppose there was such a monster breathing as he that it was natural for me to impute her refusal of him rather to transitory resentment to consciousness of human frailty and mingled doubts of the sincerity of his offers than to villainies which had given the irreversible blow and had at that instant brought her down to the gates of death which in a very few days enclosed her that he is a man of defiance a man who thinks to awe everyone by his insolent darings and by his pretensions to superior courage and skill that disgrace as he is to his name and to the character of a gentleman the man would not want his merit who in vindication of the dishonored distinction should expunge and blot him out of the worthy list that the injured family has a son who however unworthy of such a sister is of a temper vehement unbridled fierce unequal therefore as he has once indeed been found to a contention with this man the loss of which son by a violent death on such an occasion by a hand so justly hated would complete the misery of the whole family and who nevertheless resolves to call him to account if i do not his very misbehaviour perhaps to such a sister stimulating his perverse heart to do her memory the more signal justice though the attempt might be fatal to him then sir to be a witness as i am every hour to the calamity and distress of a family to which i am related everyone of whom however averse to an alliance with him while it had not taken place would no doubt have been soon reconciled to the admirable creature had the man to whom for his family and fortunes it was not a disgrace to be allied done her but common justice to see them hang their pensive heads mope about shunning one another though formerly never used to meet but to rejoice in each other afflicting themselves with reflections that the last time they respectively saw the dear creature it was here or there at such a place in such an attitude and could they have thought that it would have been the last everyone of them reviving instances of her excellencies that will for a long time make their very blessings a curse to them her closet her chamber her cabinet given up to me to disfurnish in order to answer now too late obliging the legacies bequeathed unable themselves to enter them and even making use of less convenient backstairs that they may avoid passing by the doors of her apartment her parlour locked up the walks the retirements the summer house in which she delighted and used to pursue her charming works that in particular from which she went to the fatal interview shunned or hurried by or over her perfections nevertheless called up to remembrance and enumerated incidents and graces unheeded before or passed ver in the groupe of her numberless perfections now brought into notice and dwelt upon the very servants allowed to expatiate upon these praiseful topics to their principals even eloquent in their praises  the distressed principals listening and weeping then to see them break in upon the zealous applauders by their impatience and remorse and throw abroad their helpless hands and exclaim then again to see them listen to hear more of her praises and weep again  they even encouraging the servants to repeat how they used to be stopped by strangers to ask after her and by those who knew her to be told of some new instances to her honor  how aggravating all this in dreams they see her and desire to see her always an angel and accompanied by angels always clad in robes of light always endeavoring to comfort them who declare that they shall never more know comfort what an example she set how she indicted how she drew how she wrought how she talked how she sung how she played her voice music her accent harmony her conversation how instructive how sought after the delight of persons of all ages of both sexes of all ranks yet how humble how condescending never were dignity and humility so illustriously mingled at other times how generous how noble how charitable how judicious in her charities in every action laudable in every attitude attractive in every appearance whether fulldressed or in the housewifes more humble garb equally elegant and equally lovely like or resembling miss clarissa harlowe they now remember to be a praise denoting the highest degree of approveable excellence with everyone whatever person action or rank spoken of the desirable daughter the obliging kinswoman the affectionate sister all envy now subsided the faithful the warm friend the affable the kind the benevolent mistress  not one fault remembered all their severities called cruelties mutually accuseing each other each him and herself and all to raise her character and torment themselves such sir is the angel of whom the vilest of men has deprived the world you sir who know more of the barbarous machinations and practices of this strange man can help me to still more inflaming reasons were they needed why a man not perfect may stand excused to the generality of the world if he should pursue his vengeance  but i will force myself from the subject after i have repeated that i have not yet made any resolutions that can bind me whenever i do i shall be glad they may be such as may merit the honor of your approbation  i send you back the copies of the posthumous letters i see the humanity of your purpose in the transmission of them to me and i thank you most heartily for it i presume that it is owing to the same laudable consideration that you kept back the copy of that to the wicked man himself  i intend to wait upon miss how in person with the diamond ring and such other of the effects bequeathed to her as are here i am sir  your most faithful and obliged servant wm morden   mr belford in his answer to this letter farther inforces the ladys dying injunctions and rejoices that the colonel has made no vindictive resolutions and hopes everything from his prudence and consideration and from his promise given to the dying lady  he refers to the seeing him in town an account of the dreadful ends of two of the greatest criminals in his cousins affair this says he together with mr lovelaces disorder of mind looks as if providence had already taken the punishment of these unhappy wretches into its own hands  he desires a days notice of his coming to town lest otherwise he may be absent at the time  this he does though he tells him not the reason with a view to prevent a meeting between him and mr lovelace who may be in town as he apprehends about the same time in his way to go abroad  letter xcvi colonel morden to john belford esquire tuesday sept    dear sir i cannot help congratulating myself as well as you that we have already got through with the family every article of the will where they have any concern  you left me a discretional power in many instances and in pursuance of it i have had my dear cousins personal jewels valued and will account to you for them at the highest price when i come to town as well as for other matters that you were pleased to entrust to my management  these jewels i have presented to my cousin dolly hervey in acknowlegement of her love to the dear departed i have told miss how of this and she is as well pleased with what i have done as if she had been the purchaser of them herself as that young lady has jewels of her own she could only have wished to purchase these for her beloved friends sake  the grandmothers jewels are also valued and the money will be paid me for you to be carried to the uses of the will  mrs norton is preparing by general consent to enter upon her office as housekeeper at the grove but it is my opinion that she will not be long on this side heaven  i waited upon miss how myself as i told you i would with what was bequeathed to her and her mother if i make a few observations with regard to that young lady so dear to my beloved cousin you will not be displeased perhaps as you have not a personal acquaintance with her  there never was a firmer and nobler friendship in women than that which the wretched man has put an end to between my dear cousin and miss how  friendship generally speaking mr belford is too fervent a flame for female minds to manage a light that but in few of their hands burns steady and often hurries the sex into flight and absurdity like other extremes it is hardly ever durable marriage which is the highest state of friendship generally absorbs the most vehement friendships of female to female and that whether the wedlock be happy or not  what female mind is capable of two fervent friendships at the same time  this i mention as a general observation but the friendship that subsisted between these two ladies affords a remarkable exception to it which i account for from those qualities and seize in both which were they more common would furnish more exceptions still in favor of the sex both had an enlarged and even a liberal education both had minds thirsting after virtuous knowledge great readers both great writers  and early familiar writing i take to be one of the greatest openers and improvers of the mind that man or woman can be employed in both generous high in fortune therefore above that dependence each on the other that frequently destroys the familiarity which is the cement of friendship both excelling in different ways in which neither sought to emulate the other both blessed with clear and distinguishing faculties with solid sense and from their first intimacy i have many of my lights sir from mrs norton each seeing something in the other to fear as well as love yet making it an indispensable condition of their friendship each to tell the other of her failings and to be thankful for the freedom taken one by nature gentle the other made so by her love and admiration of her exalted friend  impossible that there could be a friendship better calculated for duration  i must however take the liberty to blame miss how for her behavior to mr hickman and i infer from it that even women of sense are not to be trusted with power  by the way i am sure i need not desire you not to communicate to this fervent young lady the liberties i take with her character  i dare say my cousin could not approve of miss howes behavior to this gentleman a behavior which is talked of by as many as know mr hickman and her can a wise young lady be easy under such censure  she must know it  mr hickman is really a very worthy man everybody speaks well of him but he is gentledispositioned and he adores miss how and love admits not of an air of even due dignity to the object of it yet will he hardly ever get back the reins he has yielded up unless she by carrying too far the power she seems at present too sensible of should when she has no favors to confer which he has not a right to demand provoke him to throw off the too heavy yoke and should he do so and then treat her with negligence miss how of all the women i know will be the least able to support herself under it she will then be more unhappy than she ever made him for a man who is uneasy at home can divert himself abroad which a woman cannot so easily do without scandal  permit me to take further notice as to miss how that it is very obvious to me that she has by her haughty behavior to this worthy man involved herself in one difficulty from which she knows not how to extricate herself with that grace which accompanies all her actions she intends to have mr hickman i believe she does not dislike him and it will cost her no small pains to descend from the elevation she has climbed to  another inconveniency she will suffer from her having taught everybody for she is above disguise to think by her treatment of mr hickman much more meanly of him than he deserves to be thought of and must she not suffer dishonor in his dishonor  mrs how is much disturbed at her daughters behavior to the gentleman he is very deservedly a favourite of hers but  another failing in miss how her mother has not all the authority with her that her daughters good sense ought to permit her to have it is very difficult mr belford for people of different or contrary dispositions though no bad people neither to mingle reverence with their love for each other even where nature has called for love in the relationship  miss how is open generous noble the mother has not any of these fine qualities parents in order to preserve their childrens veneration for them should take great care not to let them see anything in their conduct or behavior or principles which they themselves would not approve of in others  but after all i see that there is something so charmingly brilliant and frank in miss howes disposition although at present visibly overclouded by grief that it is impossible not to love her even for her failings she may and i hope she will make mr hickman an obliging wife and if she do she will have an additional merit with me since she cannot be apprehensive of check or control and may therefore by her generosity and prudence lay an obligation upon her husband by the performance of what is no more than her duty  her mother both loves and fears her yet is mrs how a woman of vivacity and ready enough i dare say to cry out when she is pained but alas she has as i hinted above weakened her authority by the narrowness of her mind  yet once she praised her daughter to me for the generosity of her spirit with so much warmth that had i not known the old ladys character i should have thought her generous herself and yet i have always observed that people even of narrow tempers are ready to praise generous ones  and thus have i accounted for it that such persons generally find it to their purpose that all the world should be openminded but themselves  the old lady applied herself to me to urge to the young one the contents of the will in order to hasten her to fix a day for her marriage but desired that i would not let miss how know that she did  i took the liberty upon it to tell the young lady that i hoped that her part of a will so soon and so punctually in almost all its other articles fulfilled would not be the only one that would be slighted  her answer was she would consider of it and made me a courtesy with such an air as showed me that she thought me more out of my sphere than i could allow her to think me had i been permitted to argue the point with her  i found both miss how and her own servantmaid in deep mourning this it seems had occasioned a great debate at first between her mother and her her mother had the words of the will on her side and mr hickmans interest in her view as her daughter had said that she would wear it for six months at least but the young lady carried her point  strange said she if i who shall mourn the heavy the irreparable loss to the last hour of my life should not show my concern to the world for a few months  mr hickman for his part was so far from uttering an opposing word on this occasion that on the very day that miss how put on hers he waited on her in a new suit of mourning as for a near relation his servants and equipage made the same respectful appearance  whether the mother was consulted by him in it i cannot say but the daughter knew nothing of it till she saw him in it she looked at him with surprise and asked him for whom he mourned  the dear and everdear miss harlowe he said  she was at a loss it seems  at last  all the world ought to mourn for my clarissa said she but who man that was her address to him think thou to oblige by this appearance  it is more than appearance madam i love not my own sister worthy as she is better than i loved miss clarissa harlowe i oblige myself by it and if i disoblige not you that is all i have to wish  she surveyed him i am told from head to foot she knew not at first whether to be angry or pleased  at length i thought at first said she that you might have a bolder and freer motive  but as my mamma says you may be a wellmeaning man though generally a little wrongheaded  however as the world is censorious and may think us nearer of kin than i would have it supposed i must take care honest friend that i am not seen abroad in your company  but let me add mr belford that if this compliment of mr hickman or this more than compliment as i may well call it since the worthy man speaks not of my dear cousin without emotion does not produce a short day i shall think miss how has less generosity in her temper than i am willing to allow her  you will excuse me mr belford i dare say for the particularities which you have invited and encouraged  having now seen everything that relates to the will of my dear cousin brought to a desirable issue i will set about making my own i shall follow the dear creatures example and give my reasons for every article that there may be no room for aftercontention  what but a fear of death a fear unworthy of a creature who knows that he must one day as surely die as he was born can hinder any one from making such a disposition  i hope soon to pay my respects to you in town mean time i am with great respect dear sir  your faithful and affectionate humble servant wm morden  letter xcvii mr belford to miss how thursday sept    madam i do myself the honor to send you with this according to my promise see p      copies of the posthumous letters written by your exalted friend  these will be accompanied with other letters particularly a copy of one from mr lovelace begun to be written on the   th and continued down to the   th see p      you will judge by it madam of the dreadful anguish that his spirits labor with and of his deep remorse  mr lovelace sent for this letter back i complied but i first took a copy of it as i have not told him that i have done so you will be pleased to forbear communicating of it to anybody but mr hickman that gentlemans perusal of it will be the same as if nobody but yourself saw it  one of the letters of colonel mordens which i enclose you will observe madam is only a copy viz the preceding  the true reason for which as i will ingenuously acknowledge is some free but respectful observations which the colonel has made upon you madam for declining to carry into execution your part of your dear friends last requests i have therefore in respect to that worthy gentleman having a caution from him on that head omitted those parts  will you allow me madam however to tell you that i myself could not have believed that my inimitable testatrixs own miss how would have been the most backward in performing such a part of her dear friends last will as is entirely in her own power to perform  especially when that performance would make one of the most deserving men in england happy and whom i presume she proposes to honor with her hand  excuse me madam i have a most sincere veneration for you and would not disoblige you for the world  i will not presume to make remarks on the letters i send you nor upon the informations i have to give you of the dreadful end of two unhappy wretches who were the greatest criminals in the affair of your adorable friend these are the infamous sinclair and a person whom you have read of no doubt in the letters of the charming innocent by the name of captain tomlinson  the wretched woman died in the extremest tortures and despondency the man from wounds got in defending himself in carrying on a contraband trade both accusing themselves in their last hours for the parts they had acted against the most excellent of women as of the crime they had most remorse for  give me leave to say madam that if your compassion be not excited for the poor man who suffers from his own anguish of mind as you will see by his letter and for the unhappy family whose remorse as you will see by col mordens is so deep  your terror must and yet i shall not wonder if the just sense of the irreparable loss you have sustained hardens a heart against pity which on a less extraordinary occasion would want its principal grace if it were not compassionate  i am madam with the greatest respect and gratitude  your most obliged and faithful humble servant j belford  letter xcviii miss how to john belford esquire sat sept  0 sir i little thought i ever could have owed so much obligation to any man as you have laid me under and yet what you have sent me has almost broken my heart and ruined my eyes  i am surprised though agreeably that you have so soon and so well got over that part of the trust you have engaged in which relates to the family  it may be presumed from the exits you mention of two of the infernal mans accomplices that the thunderbolt will not stop short of the principal indeed i have some pleasure to think it seems rolling along toward the devoted head that has plotted all the mischief but let me however say that although i think mr morden not altogether in the wrong in his reasons for resenting as he is the dear creatures kinsman and trustee yet i think you very much in the right in endeavoring to dissuade him from it as you are her executor and act in pursuance of her earnest request  but what a letter is that of the infernal man i cannot observe upon it neither can i for very different reasons upon my dear creatures posthumous letters particularly on that to him oh mr belford what numberless perfections died when my clarissa drew her last breath  if decency be observed in his letters for i have not yet had patience to read above two or three of them besides this horrid one which i return you enclosed i may some time hence be curious to look by their means into the hearts of wretches which though they must be the abhorrence of virtuous minds will when laid open as i presume they are in them afford a proper warning to those who read them and teach them to detest men of such profiigate characters  if your reformation be sincere you will not be offended that i except you not on this occasion  and thus have i helped you to a criterion to try yourself by  by this letter of the wicked man it is apparent that there are still wickeder women but see what a guilty commerce with the devils of your sex will bring those to whose morals ye have ruined  for these women were once innocent it was man that made them otherwise the first bad man perhaps threw them upon worse men those upon still worse till they commenced devils incarnate  the height of wickedness or of shame is not arrived at all at once as i have somewhere heard observed  but this man this monster rather for him to curse these women and to curse the dear creatures family implacable as the latter were in order to lighten a burden he voluntarily took up and groans under is meanness added to wickedness and in vain will he one day find his low plea of sharing with her friends and with those common wretches a guilt which will be adjudged him as all his own though they too may meet with their punishment as it is evidently begun in the first in their ineffectual reproaches of one another in the second as you have told me  this letter of the abandoned wretch i have not shown to anybody not even to mr hickman for sir i must tell you i do not as yet think it the same thing as only seeing it myself  mr hickman like the rest of his sex would grow upon indulgence one distinction from me would make him pay two to himself insolent creepers or incroachers all of you to show any of you a favor today you would expect it as a right tomorrow  i am as you see very open and sincere with you and design in another letter to be still more so in answer to your call and colonel mordens call upon me in a point that concerns me to explain myself upon to my beloved creatures executor and to her only tender and only worthy relation  i cannot but highly applaud colonel morden for his generosity to miss dolly hervey  o that he had arrived time enough to save my inimitable friend from the machinations of the vilest of men and from the envy and malice of the most selfish and implacable of brothers and sisters  anna how  letter xcix miss how to john belford esquire monday oct   when you question me sir as you do and on a subject so affecting to me in the character of the representative of my bestbeloved friend and have in every particular hitherto acted up to that character you are entitled to my regard especially as in your questioning of me you are joined by a gentleman whom i look upon as the dearest and nearest because worthiest relation of my dear friend and who it seems has been so severe a censurer of my conduct that your politeness will not permit you to send me his letter with others of his but a copy only in which the passages reflecting upon me are omitted  i presume however that what is meant by this alarming freedom of the colonels is no more than what you both have already hinted to me as if you thought i were not inclined to pay so much regard to my beloved creatures last will in my own case as i would have others pay to it a charge that i ought not to be quite silent under  you have observed no doubt that i have seemed to value myself upon the freedom i take in declaring my sentiments without reserve upon every subject that i pretend to touch upon and i can hardly question that i have or shall in your opinion by my unceremonious treatment of you upon so short an acquaintance run into the error of those who wanting to be thought above hypocrisy and flattery fall into rusticity if not illmanners a common fault with such who not caring to correct constitutional failings seek to gloss them over by some nominal virtue when all the time perhaps it is native arrogance or at least a contracted rust that they will not because it would give them pain submit to have filed off  you see sir that i can however be as free with myself as with you and by what i am going to write you will find me still more free and yet i am aware that such of my sex as will not assume some little dignity and exact respect from yours will render themselves cheap and perhaps for their modesty and diffidence be repaid with scorn and insult  but the scorn i will endeavor not to deserve and the insult i will not bear  in some of the dear creatures papers which you have had in your possession and must again have for transcription you will find several friendly but severe reprehensions of me on account of a natural or at least an habitual warmth of temper which she was pleased to impute to me  i was thinking to give you her charge against me in her own words from one of her letters delivered to me with her own hands on taking leave of me on the last visit she honored me with but i will supply that charge by confession of more than it imports to wit that i am haughty uncontrollable and violent in my temper this i say impatient of contradiction was my beloveds charge from anybody but her dear self she should have said and aim not at that affability that gentleness next to meekness which in the letter i was going to communicate she tells me are the peculiar and indispensable characteristics of a real fine lady who she is pleased to say should appear to be gallless as a dove and never should know what warmth or high spirit is but in the cause of religion or virtue or in cases where her own honor the honor of a friend or that of an innocent person is concerned  now sir as i must needs plead guilty to this indictment do you think i ought not to resolve upon a single life  i who have such an opinion of your sex that i think there is not one man in an hundred whom a woman of sense and spirit can either honor or obey though you make us promise both in that solemn form of words which unites or rather binds us to you in marriage  when i look round upon all the married people of my acquaintance and see how they live and what they bear who live best i am confirmed in my dislike to the state  well do your sex contrive to bring us up fools and idiots in order to make us bear the yoke you lay upon our shoulders and that we may not despise you from our hearts as we certainly should if we were brought up as you are for your ignorance as much as you often make us do as it is for your insolence  these sir are some of my notions and with these notions let me repeat my question do you think i ought to marry at all  if i marry either a sordid or an imperious wretch can i do you think live with him and ought a man of a contrary character for the sake of either of our reputations to be plagued with me  long did i stand out against all the offers made me and against all the persuasions of my mother and to tell you the truth the longer and with the more obstinacy as the person my choice would have at first fallen upon was neither approved by my mother nor by my dear friend this riveted me to my pride and to my opposition for although i was convinced after a while that my choice would neither have been prudent nor happy and that the specious wretch was not what he had made me believe he was yet could i not easily think of any other man and indeed from the detection of him took a settled aversion to the whole sex  at last mr hickman offered himself a man worthy of a better choice he had the good fortune he thinks it so to be agreeable and to make his proposals agreeable to my mother  as to myself i own that were i to have chosen a brother mr hickman should have been the man virtuous sober sincere friendly as he is but i wished not to marry nor knew i the man in the world whom i could think deserving of my beloved friend but neither of our parents would let us live single  the accursed lovelace was proposed warmly to her at one time and while she was yet but indifferent to him they by ungenerous usage of him for then sir he was not known to be beelzebub himself and by endeavoring to force her inclinations in favor first of one worthless man then of another in antipathy to him through her foolish brothers caprice turned that indifference from the natural generosity of her soul into a regard which she never otherwise would have had for a man of his character  mr hickman was proposed to me i refused him again and again he persisted my mother his advocate my mother made my beloved friend his advocate too i told him my aversion to all men to him to matrimony  still he persisted i used him with tyranny led indeed partly by my temper partly by design hoping thereby to get rid of him till the poor man his character unexceptionably uniform still persisting made himself a merit with me by his patience this brought down my pride i never sir was accounted very ungenerous nor quite ingrateful and gave me at one time an inferiority in my own opinion to him which lasted just long enough for my friends to prevail upon me to promise him encouragement and to receive his addresses  having so done when the weatherglass of my pride got up again i found i had gone too far to recede my mother and my friend both held me to it yet i tried him i vexed him an hundred ways and not so much neither with design to vex him as to make him hate me and decline his suit  he bore this however and got nothing but my pity yet still my mother and my friend having obtained my promise made however not to him but to them and being well assured that i valued no man more than mr hickman who never once disobliged me in word or deed or look except by his foolish perseverance insisted upon the performance  while my dear friend was in her unhappy uncertainty i could not think of marriage and now what encouragement have i  she my monitress my guide my counsel gone for ever gone  by whose advice and instructions i hoped to acquit myself tolerably in the state into which i could not avoid entering for sir my mother is so partially mr hickmans friend that i am sure should any difference arise she would always censure me and acquit him even were he ungenerous enough to remember me in his day  this sir being my situation consider how difficult it is for me to think of marriage whenever we approve we can find an hundred good reasons to justify our approbation whenever we dislike we can find a thousand to justify our dislike everything in the latter case is an impediment every shadow a bugbear  thus can i enumerate and swell perhaps only imaginary grievances i must go whither he would have me to go visit whom he would have me to visit well as i love to write though now alas my grand inducement to write is over it must be to whom he pleases and mrs hickman who as miss how cannot do wrong would hardly ever be able to do right thus the tables turned upon me i am reminded of my brokenvowed obedience madamd up perhaps to matrimonial perfection and all the wedded warfare practiced comfortably over between us for i shall not be passive under insolent treatment till we become curses to each other a byeword to our neighbors and the jest of our own servants  but there must be hear and forbear methinks some wise body will tell me but why must i be teazed into a state where that must be necessarily the case when now i can do as i please and wish only to be let alone to do as best pleases me and what in effect does my mother say anna how you now do everything that pleases you you now have nobody to control you you go and you come you dress and you undress you rise and you go to rest just as you think best but you must be happier still child    as how madam  why you must marry my dear and have none of these options but in everything do as your husband commands you  this is very hard you will own sir for such a one as me to think of and yet engaged to enter into that state as i am how can i help myself my mother presses me my friend my beloved friend writing as from the dead presses me and you and mr morden as executors of her will remind me the man is not afraid of me i am sure were i the man i should not have half his courage and i think i ought to conclude to punish him the only effectual way i have to do it for his perverse adherence and persecution as many other persons are punished with the grant of his own wishes  let me then assure you sir that when i can find in the words of my charming friend in her will writing of her cousin hervey that my grief for her is mellowed by time into a remembrance more sweet than painful that i may not be utterly unworthy of the passion a man of some merit has for me i will answer the request of my dear friend so often repeated and so earnestly pressed and mr hickman shall find if he continue to deserve my gratitude that my endeavors shall not be wanting to make him amends for the patience he has had and must still for a little while longer have with me and then will it be his own fault i hope not mine if our marriage answer not those happy prognostics which filled her generous presaging mind upon this view as she once for my encouragement and to induce me to encourage him told me  thus sir have i in a very free manner accounted to you as to the executor of my beloved friend for all that relates to you as such to know and even for more than i needed to do against myself only that you will find as much against me in some of her letters and so losing nothing i gain the character of ingenuity with you  and thus much for the double reprimand on my delaying my part of the performance of my dear friends will  and now let me remind you of one great article relateing to yourself while you are admonishing me on this subject it is furnished me by her posthumous letter to you  i hope you will not forget that the most benevolent of her sex expresses herself as earnestly concerned for your thorough reformation as she does for my marrying you will see to it then that her wishes are as completely answered in that particular as you are desirous they should be in all others  i have i own disobeyed the dear creature in one article and that is where she desires that i will not put myself into mourning i could not help it  i send this and mine of saturday last together and will not add another word after i have told you that i think myself  your obliged servant a how  letter c mr belford to miss how thursday night oct   i return you madam my most respectful thanks for your condescending hint in relation to the pious wishes of your exalted friend for my thorough reformation  i will only say that it shall be my earnest and unwearied endeavor to make those generous wishes effectual and i hope for the divine blessing upon such my endeavors or else i know they will be in vain  i cannot madam express how much i think myself obliged to you for your further condescension in writing to me so frankly the state of your past and present mind in relation to the single and matrimonial life if the lady by whom as the executor of her inimitable friend i am thus honored has sailings never were failings so lovely in woman  how much more lovely indeed than the virtues of many of her sex  i might have ventured into the hands of such a lady the colonels letter without transcription or omission that worthy gentleman exceedingly admires you and his caution was the effect of his politeness only and of his regard for you  i send you madam a letter from lord m to myself and the copies of three others written in consequence of that these will acquaint you with mr lovelaces departure from england and with other particulars which you will be curious to know  be pleased to keep to yourself such of the contents as your own prudence will suggest to you ought not to be seen by anybody else  i am madam with the profoundest and most grateful respect  your faithful and obliged humble servant john belford  letter ci lord m to john belford esquire m hall friday sept    dear sir my kinsman lovelace is now setting out for london proposing to see you and then to go to dover and so embark god send him well out of the kingdom  on monday he will be with you i believe pray let me be favored with an account of all your conversations for mr mowbray and mr tourville are to be there too and whether you think he is grown quite his own man again what i mostly write for is to wish you to keep colonel morden and him asunder and so to give you notice of his going to town i should be very loath thee should be any mischief between them as you gave me notice that the colonel threatened my nephew but my kinsman would not bear that so nobody let him know that he did but i hope there is no fear for the colonel does not as i hear threaten now for his own sake i am glad of that for there is not such a man in the world as my kinsman is said to be at all the weapons  as well he was not he would not be so daring  we shall all here miss the wild fellow to be sure there is no man better company when he pleases  pray do you never travel thirty or forty mile i should be glad to see you here at m hall it will be charity when my kinsman is gone for we suppose you will be his chief correspondent although he has promised to write to my nieces often but he is very apt to forget his promises to us his relations particularly god preserve us all amen prays  your very humble servant m  letter cii mr belford to lord m london tuesday night oct   my lord i obey your lordships commands with great pleasure  yesterday in the afternoon mr lovelace made me a visit at my lodgings as i was in expectation of one from colonel morden about the same time i thought proper to carry him to a tavern which neither of us frequented on pretense of an halfappointment ordering notice to be sent me thither if the colonel came and mr lovelace sent to mowbray and tourville and mr doleman of uxbrige who came to town to take leave of him to let them know where to find us  mr lovelace is too well recovered i was going to say i never saw him more gay lively and handsome we had a good deal of bluster about some parts of the trust i have engaged in and upon freedoms i had treated him with in which he would have it that i had exceeded our agreed on limits but on the arrival of our three old companions and a nephew of mr dolemans who had a good while been desirous to pass an hour with mr lovelace it blew off for the present  mr mowbray and mr tourville had also taken some exceptions at the freedoms of my pen and mr lovelace after his way took upon him to reconcile us and did it at the expense of all three and with such an infinite run of humor and raillery that we had nothing to do but laugh at what he said and at one another i can deal tolerably with him at my pen but in conversation he has no equal in short it was his day he was glad he said to find himself alive and his two friends clapping and rubbing their hands twenty times in an hour declared that now once more he was all himself the charmingst fellow in the world and they would follow him to the furthest part of the globe  i threw a bur upon his coat nowand then but none would stick  your lordship knows that there are many things which occasion a roar of applause in conversation when the heart is open and men are resolved to be merry which will neither bear repeating nor thinking of afterward common things in the mouth of a man we admire and whose wit has passed upon us for sterling become in a gay hour uncommon we watch every turn of such a ones countenance and are resolved to laugh when he smiles even before he utters what we are expecting to flow from his lips  mr doleman and his nephew took leave of us by twelve mowbray and tourville grew very noisy by one and were carried off by two wine never moves mr lovelace notwithstanding a vivacity which generally helps on overgay spirits as to myself the little part i had taken in their gaiety kept me unconcerned  the clock struck three before i could get him into any serious or attentive way  so natural to him is gaiety of heart and such strong hold had the liveliness of the evening taken of him his conversation you know my lord when his heart is free runs off to the bottom without any dregs  but after that hour and when we thought of parting he became a little more serious and then he told me his designs and gave me a plan of his intended tour wishing heartily that i could have accompanied him  we parted about four he not a little dissatisfied with me for we had some talk about subjects which he said he loved not to think of to wit miss harlowes will my executorship papers i had in confidence communicated to that admirable lady with no unfriendly design i assure your lordship and he insisting upon and i refusing the return of the letters he had written to me from the time that he had made his first addresses to her  he would see me once again he said and it would be upon very ill terms if i complied not with his request which i bid him not expect but that i might not deny him everything i told him that i would give him a copy of the will though i was sure i said when he read it he would wish he had never seen it  i had a message from him about eleven this morning desiring me to name a place at which to dine with him and mowbray and tourville for the last time and soon after another from colonel morden inviting me to pass the evening with him at the bedfordhead in covent garden and that i might keep them at distance from one another i appointed mr lovelace at the eagle in suffolkstreet  there i met him and the two others we began where we left off at our last parting and were very high with each other but at last all was made up and he offered to forget and forgive everything on condition that i would correspond with him while abroad and continue the series which had been broken through by his illness and particularly give him as i had offered a copy of the ladys will  i promised him and he then fell to raillying me on my gravity and on my reformationschemes as he called them as we walked about the room expecting dinner to be brought in he laid his hand upon my shoulder then pushed me from him with a curse walking round me and surveying me from head to foot then calling for the observation of the others he turned round upon his heel and with one of his peculiar wild airs ha ha ha ha burst he out that these sourfaced proselytes should take it into their heads that they cannot be pious without forfeiting both their goodnature and good manners  why jack turning me about pry thee look up man  do thou not know that religion if it has taken proper hold of the heart is the most cheerful countenancemaker in the world  i have heard my beloved miss harlowe say so and she knew or nobody did and was not her aspect a benign proof of the observation but by these wamblings in thy cursed gizzard and thy awkward grimaces i see you are but a novice in it yet  ah belford belford thou have a confounded parcel of briars and thorns to trample over barefoot before religion will illumine these gloomy features  i give your lordship this account in answer to your desire to know if i think him the man he was  in our conversation at dinner he was balancing whether he should set out the next morning or the morning after but finding he had nothing to do and colonel morden being in town which however i told him not of i turned the scale and he agreed upon setting out tomorrow morning they to see him imbark and i promised to accompany them for a mornings ride as they proposed their horses but said that i must return in the afternoon  with much reluctance they let me go to my evenings appointment they little thought with whom for mr lovelace had put it as a case of honor to all of us whether as he had been told that mr morden and mr james harlowe had thrown out menaces against him he ought to leave the kingdom till he had thrown himself in their way  mowbray gave his opinion that he ought to leave it like a man of honor as he was and if he did not take those gentlemen to task for their opprobrious speeches that at least he should be seen by them in public before he went away else they might give themselves airs as if he had left the kingdom in fear of them  to this he himself so much inclined that it was with difficulty i persuaded him that as they had neither of them proceeded to a direct and formal challenge as they knew he had not made himself difficult of access and as he had already done the family injury enough and it was miss harlowes earnest desire that be would be content with that he had no reason from any point of honor to delay his journey especially as he had so just a motive for his going as the establishing of his health and as he might return the sooner if he saw occasion for it  i found the colonel in a very solemn way we had a good deal of discourse upon the subject of letters which had passed between us in relation to miss harlowes will and to her family  he has some accounts to settle with his banker which he says will be adjusted tomorrow and on thursday he proposes to go down again to take leave of his friends and then intends to set out directly for italy  i wish mr lovelace could have been prevailed upon to take any other tour than that of france and italy i did propose madrid to him but he laughed at me and told me that the proposal was in character from a mule and from one who was become as grave as a spaniard of the old cut at ninety  i expressed to the colonel my apprehensions that his cousins dying injunctions would not have the force upon him that were to be wished  they have great force upon me mr belford said he or one world would not have held mr lovelace and me thus long but my intention is to go to florence not to lay my bones there as upon my cousins death i told you i thought to do but to settle all my affairs in those parts and then to come over and reside upon a little paternal estate in kent which is strangely gone to ruin in my absence indeed were i to meet mr lovelace either here or abroad i might not be answerable for the consequence  he would have engaged me for tomorrow but having promised to attend mr lovelace on his journey as i have mentioned i said i was obliged to go out of town and was uncertain as to the time of my return in the evening and so i am to see him on thursday morning at my own lodgings  i will do myself the honor to write again to your lordship tomorrow night mean time i am my lord  your lordships etc  letter ciii mr belford to lord m wedn night oct   my lord i am just returned from attending mr lovelace as far as gadshill near rochester he was exceeding gay all the way mowbray and tourville are gone on with him they will see him embark and under sail and promise to follow him in a month or two for they say there is no living without him now he is once more himself  he and i parted with great and even solemn tokens of affection but yet not without gay intermixtures as i will acquaint your lordship  taking me aside and clasping his arms about me adieu dear belford said he may you proceed in the course you have entered upon  whatever airs i give myself this charming creature has fast hold of me here  clapping his hand upon his heart and i must either appear what you see me or be what i so lately was  o the divine creature lifting up his eyes   but if i live to come to england and you remain fixed in your present way and can give me encouragement i hope rather to follow your example than to ridicule you for it this will for i had given him a copy of it i will make the companion of my solitary hours you have told me part of its melancholy contents and that and her posthumous letter shall be my study and they will prepare me for being your disciple if you hold on   you jack may marry continued he and i have a wife in my eye for you  only you are such an awkward mortal he saw me affected and thought to make me smile but we dont make ourselves except it be worse by our dress thou art in mourning now as well as i but if ever thy ridiculous turn lead thee again to be beaubrocade i will bedizen thee as the girls say on my return to my own fancy and according to thy own natural appearance  thou shall doctor my soul and i will doctor thy body thou shall see what a clever fellow i will make of thee  as for me i never will i never can marry  that i will not take a few liberties and that i will not try to start some of my former game i will not promise  habits are not easily shaken off  but they shall be by way of weaning so return and reform shall go together  and now thou sorrowful monkey what aileth thee i do love him my lord  adieu  and once more adieu  embracing me  and when thou think thou have made thyself an interest out yonder looking up then put in a word for thy lovelace  joining company he recommended to me to write often and promised to let me quickly hear from him and that he would write to your lordship and to all his family round for he said that you had all been more kind to him than he had deserved  and so we parted  i hope my lord for all your noble familys sake that we shall see him soon return and reform as he promises  i return your lordship my humble thanks for the honor of your invitation to m hall the first letter i receive from mr lovelace shall give me the opportunity of embracing it i am my lord  your most faithful and obedient servant j belford  letter civ mr belford to lord m thursday morning oct   it may be some satisfaction to your lordship to have a brief account of what has just now passed between colonel morden and me  we had a good deal of discourse about the harlowefamily and those parts of the ladys will which still remain unexecuted after which the colonel addressed himself to me in a manner which gave me some surprise  he flattered himself he said from my present happy turn and from my good constitution that i should live a great many years it was therefore his request that i would consent to be his executor since it was impossible for him to make a better choice or pursue a better example than his cousin had set  his heart he said was in it there were some things in his cousins will and his analogous and he had named one person with me with whom he was sure i would not refuse to be joined and to whom he intended to apply for his consent when he had obtained mine what is between cretchets thus  mr belford omitted in the transcription of this letter to miss how  intimating as far as i could gather that it was mr hickman son of sir charles hickman to whom i know your lordship is not a stranger for he said every one who was dear to his beloved cousin must be so to him and he knew that the gentleman whom he had thoughts of would have besides my advice and assistance the advice of one of the most sensible ladies in england  he took my hand seeing me under some surprise you must not hesitate much less deny me mr belford indeed you must not two things i will assure you of that i have as i hope made everything so clear that you cannot have any litigation and that i have done so justly and i hope it will be thought so generously by all my relations that a mind like yours will rather have pleasure than pain in the execution of this trust and this is what i think every honest man who hopes to find an honest man for his executor should do  i told him that i was greatly obliged to him for his good opinion of me that it was so much every mans duty to be an honest man that it could not be selfpraise to say that i had no doubt to be found so but if i accepted of this trust it must be on condition   i could name no condition he said interrupting me which he would refuse to comply with  this condition i told him was that as there was as great a probability of his being my survivor as i his he would permit me to name him for mine and in that case a week should not pass before i made my will  with all his heart he said and the readier as he had no apprehensions of suddenly dying for what he had done and requested was really the effect of the satisfaction he had taken in the part i had already acted as his cousins executor and in my ability he was pleased to add as well as in pursuance of his cousins advice in the preamble to her will to wit that this was a work which should be set about in full health both of body and mind  i told him that i was pleased to hear him say that he was not in any apprehension of suddenly dying as this gave me assurance that he had laid aside all thoughts of acting contrary to his beloved cousins dying request  does it argue said he smiling that if i were to pursue a vengeance so justifiable in my own opinion i must be in apprehension of falling by mr lovelaces hand  i will assure you that i have no fears of that sort  but i know this is an ungrateful subject to you mr lovelace is your friend and i will allow that a good man may have a friendship for a bad one so far as to wish him well without countenancing him in his evil  i will assure you added he that i have not yet made any resolutions either way i have told you what force my cousins repeated requests have with me hitherto they have withheld me  but let us quit this subject  this sir giving me a sealedup parcel is my will it is witnessed i made no doubt of prevailing upon you to do me the requested favor i have a duplicate to leave with the other gentleman and an attested copy which i shall deposit at my bankers at my return which will be in six or eight months at farthest i will allow you to make an exchange of yours if you will have it so i have only now to take leave of my relations in the country and so god protect you mr belford you will soon hear of me again  he then very solemnly embraced me as i did him and we parted  i heartily congratulate with your lordship on the narrow escape each gentleman has had from the other for i apprehend that they could not have met without fatal consequences  time i hope which subdues all things will subdue their resentments i am my lord  your lordships most faithful and obedient servant j belford   several other letters passed between miss how and mr belford relating to the disposition of the papers and letters to the poors fund and to other articles of the ladys will wherein the method of proceeding in each case was adjusted after which the papers were returned to mr belford that he might order the two directed copies of them to be taken  in one of these letters mr belford requests miss how to give the character of the friend she so dearly loved a task he imagines that will be as agreeable to herself as worthy of her pen  i am more especially curious to know says he what was that particular disposition of her time which i find mentioned in a letter which i have just dipped into where her sister is enviously reproaching her on that score see vol i p      this information may perhaps enable me says he to account for what has often surprised me how at so tender an age this admirable lady became mistress of such extraordinary and such various qualifications  this request produced the following letter    letter cv miss how to john belford esquire thursday october    sir i am incapable of doing justice to the character of my beloved friend and that not only from want of talents but from grief which i think rather increases than diminishes by time and which will not let me sit down to a task that requires so much thought and a greater degree of accuracy than i ever believed myself mistress of  and yet i so well approve of your motion that i will throw into your hands a few materials that may serve by way of supplement as i may say to those you will be able to collect from the papers themselves from col mordens letters to you particularly that of sept    see letter xcv  and from the letters of the detestable wretch himself who i find  done her justice although to his own condemnation all these together will enable you who seem to be so great an admirer of her virtues to perform the task and i think better than any person i know but i make it my request that if you do anything in this way you will let me see it  if i find it not to my mind i will add or diminish as justice shall require  she was a wonderful creature from her infancy but i suppose you intend to give a character of her at those years when she was qualified to be an example to other young ladies rather than a history of her life  perhaps nevertheless you will choose to give a description of her person and as you knew not the dear creature when her heart was easy i will tell you what yet in part you can confirm  that her shape was so fine her proportion so exact her features so regular her complexion so lovely and her whole person and manner was so distinguishedly charming that she could not move without being admired and followed by the eyes of every one though strangers who never saw her before col mordens letter above referred to will confirm this  in her dress she was elegant beyond imitation  her stature rather tall than middling in her whole aspect and air a dignity that bespoke the mind that animated all  this native dignity as i may call it induced some superficial persons who knew not how to account for the reverence which involuntarily filled their hearts on her appearance to impute pride to her but she knew not what pride in the bad sense of the word was  you may throw in these sentences of hers if you touch upon this subject  persons of accidental or shadowy merit may be proud but inborn worth must be always as much above conceit as arrogance  who can be better or more worthy than they should be and who shall be proud of talents they give not to themselves  the darkest and most contemptible ignorance is that of not knowing ones self and that all we have and all we excel in is the gift of god  all human excellence is but comparative  there are persons who excel us as much as we fancy we excel the meanest  in the general scale of beings the lowest is as useful and as much a link of the great chain as the highest  the excellence that makes every other excellence amiable is humility  there is but one pride pardonable that of being above doing a base or dishonorable action  such were the sentiments by which this admirable young lady endeavored to conduct herself and to regulate her conduct to others  and in truth never were affability and complacency graciousness some have called it more eminent in any person man or woman than in her to those who put it in her power to oblige them insomuch that the benefited has sometimes not known which to prefer the grace bestowed or the manner in which it was conferred  it has been observed that what was said of henry iv of france might be said of her manner of refusing a request that she generally sent from her presence the person refused nearly as well satisfied as if she had granted it  then she was so nobly sincere  you cannot sir expatiate too much upon her sincerity i dare say that in all her letters in all the wretchs letters her sincerity will not be found to be once impeachable although her calamities were so heavy the horrid wretchs wiles so subtle and her struggles to free herself from them so active  severe as she always was in her reprehensions of a wilful and studied vileness yet no one accused her judgment or thought her severe in a wrong place for her charity was so great that she always chose to defend or acquit where the fault was not so flagrant that it became a piece of justice to condemn it  you must everywhere insist upon it that had it not been for the stupid persecutions of her relations she never would have been in the power of this horrid profligate and yet she was frank enough to acknowledge that were person and address and alliance to be allowably the principal attractives it would not have been difficult for her eye to mislead her heart  when she was last with me three happy weeks together in every visit he made her he left her more dissatisfied with him than before  in obedience to her friends commands on her coming to me she never would see him out of my company and would often say when he was gone sec vol i p     o my nancy this is not the man  at other times gay giddy creature he has always something to be forgiven for at others this man will much sooner excite ones fears than attract ones love and then would she repeat this is not the man  all that the world says of him cannot be untrue  but what title have i to charge him who intend not to have him  in short had she been left to a judgment and discretion which nobody ever questioned who had either she would have discovered enough of him to make her discard him for ever  her ingenuity in acknowleging any error she was drawn into yon must also insist upon  next to not erring she used to say was the owning of an error and that the offering at an excuse in a blameable matter was the undoubted mark of a disingenuous or perverse mind  yet one of her expressions upon a like subject deserves to be remembered being upbraided by a severe censurer upon a persons proving base whom she had frequently defended you had more penetration madam than such a young creature as i can pretend to have but although human depravity may i doubt oftener justify the person who judges harshly than them who judge favorably yet will i not part with my charity although for the future i will endeavor to make it consistent with caution and prudence  if you mention the beauties and graces of her pen you may take notice that it was always matter of surprise to her that the sex are generally so averse as they are to writeing since the pen next to the needle of all employments is the most proper and best adapted to their geniuss and this as well for improvement as amusement who sees not would she say that those women who take delight in writing excel the men in all the graces of the familiar style the gentleness of their minds the delicacy of their sentiments improved by the manner of their education and the liveliness of their imaginations qualify them to a high degree of preference for this employment while men of learning as they are called of mere learning however aiming to get above that natural ease and freedom which distinguish this and indeed every other kind of writing when they think they have best succeeded are got above or rather beneath all natural beauty  and one hint you may give to the sex if you please who are generally too careless in their orthography a consciousness of a defect in which generally keeps them from writing  she used to say it was a proof that a woman understood the derivation and sense of the words she used and that she stopped not at sound when she spelt accurately  you may take notice of the admirable facility she had in learning languages that she read with great ease both italian and french and could hold a conversation in either though she was not fond of doing so and that she was not be pleased to call it a fault that she had begun to apply herself to latin  but that notwithstanding all her acquirements she was an excellent oeconomist and housewife and these qualifications you must take notice she was particularly fond of inculcating upon all her reading and writing companions of the sex for it was a maxim with her that a woman who neglects the useful and the elegant which distinguish her own sex for the sake of obtaining the learning which is supposed more peculiar to the other incurs more contempt by what she foregoes than she gains credit by what she acquires  let our sex therefore she used to say seek to make themselves mistresses of all that is excellent and not incongruous to their sex in the other but without losing anything commendable in their own  perhaps you will not think it amiss further to observe on this head as it will show that precept and example always went hand in hand with her that her dairy at her grandfathers was the delight of every one who saw it and she of all who saw her in it for in the same hour whenever she pleased she was the most elegant dairymaid that ever was seen or the finest lady that ever graced a circle  yet was this admirable creature mistress of all these domestic qualifications without the least intermixture of narrowness she used to say that to define true generosity it must be called the happy medium between parsimony and profusion  she was as much above reserve as disguise so communicative that no young lady could be in her company half an hour and not carry away instruction with her whatever was the topic yet all sweetly insinuated nothing given with the air of prescription so that while she seemed to ask a question for informationsake she dropped in the needful instruction and lest the instructed unable to decide whether the thought which being started she the instructed could improve came primarily from herself or from the sweet instructress  the goths and vandals in those branches of science which she aimed at acquiring she knew how to dete expose and all from nature  propriety another woid for nature was her law  is the foundation of all true judgment  her skill in needleworks you will find mentioned perhaps in some of the letters that piece which she bequeaths to her cousin morden is indeed a capital piece a performance so admirable that that gentlemans father who resided chiefly abroad was as is mentioned in her will very desirous to obtain it in order to carry it to italy with him to show the curious of other countries as he used to say for the honor of his own that the cloistered confinement was not necessary to make english women excel in any of those fine arts which nuns and recluses value themselves upon  her quickness at these sort of works was astonishing and a great encouragement to herself to prosecute them  mr mordens father would have been continually making her presents would she have permitted him and he used to call them and so did her grandfather tributes due to a merit so sovereign and not presents  i say nothing of her skill in music and of her charming voice when it accompanied her fingers though very extraordinary because she had her equals in both  if she could not avoid cards without incurring the censure of particularity she would play but then she always declared against playing high except for trifles she used to say she would not submit to chance what she was already sure of  at other times she should make her friends a very ill compliment if she supposed they would wish to be possessed of what of right belonged to her and she should be very unworthy if she desired to make herself a title to what was theirs  high gaming in short she used to say was a sordid vice an immorality the child of avarice and a direct breach of that commandment which forbids us to covet what is our neighbors  you will have occasion to mention her charities her will gives you hints of the peculiar nature of those indeed for the prudent distribution of them she had neither example nor equal  you may if you desire to be particular in the account of them consult mrs norton upon this subject and when i see what she will furnish i shall perhaps make an addition to it  in all her readings and in her conversations upon them she was fonder of finding beauties than blemishes yet she used to lament that certain writers of the first class who were capable of exalting virtue and of putting vice out of countenance too generally employed themselves in works of imagination only upon subjects merely speculative disinteresting and unedifying from which no good moral or example could be drawn  all she said and all she did was accompanied with a natural ease and dignity which set her above affectation or the suspicion of it for with all her excellencies she was forwarder to hear than speak and hence no doubt derived no small part of her improvement  you are curious to know the particular distribution of her time which you suppose will help you to account for what you own yourself surprised at to wit how so young a lady could make herself mistress of so many accomplishments  i will premise that she was from infancy inured to rise early in a morning by an excellent and as i may say a learned woman mrs norton to whose care wisdom and example she was beholden for the groundwork of her taste and acquirements which meeting with such a genius made it the less wonder that she surpassed most of her age and sex  she used to say it was incredible to think what might be done by early rising and by long days well filled up  it may be added that had she calculated according to the practice of too many she had actually lived more years at sixteen than they had at twentysix  she used to say that no one could spend their time properly who did not live by some rule who did not appropriate the hours as near as might be to particular purposes and employments  in conformity to this selfset lesson the usual distribution of the twentyfour hours when left to her own choice was as follows  for rest she allotted six hours only she thought herself not so well and so clear in her intellects so much alive she used to say if she exceeded this proportion if she slept not she chose to rise sooner and in winter had her fire laid and a taper ready burning to light it not loving to give trouble to servants whose harder work and later hours of going to bed she used to say required consideration  i have blamed her for her greater regard to them than to herself but this was her answer i have my choice who can wish for more why should i oppress others to gratify myself you see what free will enables one to do while imposition would make a light burden heavy  her first three morning hours were generally passed in her study and in her closetduties and were occasionally augmented by those she saved from rest and in these passed her epistolary amusements  two hours she generally allotted to domestic management these at different times of the day as occasions required all the housekeepers bills in ease of her mother passing through her hands for she was a perfect mistress of the four principal rules of arithmetic  five hours to her needle drawings music etc in these she included the assistance and inspection she gave to her own servants and to her sisters servants in the needleworks required for the family for her sister is a modern in these she also included dr lewens conversationvisits with whom likewise she held a correspondence by letters that reverend gentleman delighted himself and her twice or thrice a week if his health permitted with these visits and she always preferred his company to any other engagement  two hours she allotted to her two first meals but if conversation or the desire of friends or the falling in of company or guests required it to be otherwise she never scrupled to oblige and would borrow as she called it from other distributions and as she found it very hard not to exceed in this appropriation she put down  one hour mere to dinnertime conversation to be added or subtracted as occasions offered or the desire of her friends required and yet found it difficult as she often said to keep this account even especially if dr lewen obliged them with his company at their table which however he seldom did for being a valetudinarian and in a regimen he generally made his visits in the afternoon  one hour to visits to the neighboring poor to a select number of whom and to their children she used to give brief instructions and good books and as this happened not every day and seldom above twice a week she had two or three hours at a time to bestow in this benevolent employment  the remaining four hours were occasionally allotted to supper to conversation or to reading after supper to the family this allotment she called her fund upon which she use to draw to satisfy her other debits and in this she included visits received and returned shows spectacles etc which in a countrylife not occurring everyday she used to think a great allowance no less than two artificial days in six for amusements only and she was wont to say that it was hard if she could not steal time out of such a fund as this for an excursion of even two or three days in a month  if it be said that her relations or the young neighboring ladies had but little of her time it will be considered that besides these four hours in the twentyfour great part of the time she was employed in her needleworks she used to converse as she worked and it was a custom she had introduced among her acquaintance that the young ladies in their visits used frequently in a neighbourly way in the winter evenings especially to bring their work with them and one of half a dozen of her select acquaintance used by turns to read to the rest as they were at work  this was her usual method when at her own command for six days in the week  the seventh day she kept as it ought to be kept and as some part of it was frequently employed in works of mercy the hour she allotted to visiting the neighboring poor was occasionally supplied from this day and added to her fund  but i must observe that when in her grandfathers lifetime she was three or four weeks at a time his housekeeper and guest as also at either of her uncles her usual distribution of time was varied but still she had an eye to it as nearly as circumstances would admit  when i had the happiness of having her for my guest for a fortnight or so she likewise dispensed with her rules in her accountbook since her evertobelamented death i have found this memorandum  from such a day to such a day all holidays at my dear miss howes at er return  account resumed such a day naming it and then she proceeded regularly as before  once a week she used to reckon with herself when if within the     hours contained in the six days she had made her account even she noted it accordingly if otherwise she carried the debit to the next weeks account a thus debtor to the article of benevolent visits so many hours and so of the rest  but it was always an especial part of her care that whether visiting or visited she showed in all companies an entire ease satisfaction and cheerfulness as if she kept no such particular account and as if she did not make herself answerable to herself for her occasional exceedings    this method which to others will appear perplexing and unnecessary her early hours and custom had made easy and pleasant to her  and indeed as i used to tell her greatly as i admired her in all her methods i could not bring myself to this though i had to early hours and find the benefit of it might i have had the world for my reward  she used to answer i do not think all i do necessary for another to do nor even for myself but when it is more pleasant to me to keep such an account than to let it alone why may i not proceed in my supererogatories  there can be no harm in it it keeps up my attention to accounts which one day may be of use to me in more material instances those who will not keep a strict account seldom long keep any i neglect not more useful employments for it and it teaches me to be covetous of time the only thing of which we can be allowably covetous since we live but once in this world and when gone are gone from it for ever  o mr belford i can write no further on this subject for looking into the accountbook for other particulars i met with a most affecting memorandum which being written on the extreme edge of the paper with a fine pen and in the dear creatures smallest hand i saw not before  this it is written i suppose at some calamitous period after the day named in it  help me to a curse to blast the monster who gave occasion for it   april  0 the account concluded   and with it all my worldly hopes and prospects  i take up my pen but not to apologize for my execration  once more i pray to god to avenge me of him i  me i say  for mine is the loss  hers the gain  o sir you did not you could not know her as i knew her never was such an excellence  so warm yet so cool a friend  so much what i wish to be but never shall be  for alas my stay my adviser my monitress my directress is gone for ever gone  she honored me with the title of the sister of her heart but i was only so in the love i bore her a love beyond a sisters  infinitely beyond her sisters in the hatred i have to every mean and sordid action and in my love of virtue  for otherwise i am of a high and haughty temper as i have acknowleged before and very violent in my passions  in short she was the nearest perfection of any creature i ever knew she never preached to me lessons she practiced not she lived the life she taught all humility meekness selfaccusing othersacquitting though the shadow of the fault hardly hers the substance theirs whose only honor was their relation to her  to lose such a friend such a guide  if ever my violence was justifiable it is upon this recollection  for she only lived to make me sensible of my failings but not long enough to enable me to conquer them as i was resolved to endeavor to do  once more then let me execrate  but now violence and passion again predominate  and how can it be otherwise  but i force myself from the subject having lost the purpose for which i resumed my pen  a how  letter cvi mr lovelace to john belford esquire paris october       timor and minae scandunt eodem quo dominus neque decedit aerata triremi and post equitem sedet atra cura in a language so expressive as the english i hate the pedantry of tagging or prefacing what i write with latin scraps and ever was a censurer of the mottomongers among our weekly and daily scribblers but these verses of horace are so applicable to my case that whether on shipboard whether in my postchaise or in my inn at night i am not able to put them out of my head dryden once i thought said well in these bouncing lines man makes his fate according to his mind the weak low spirit fortune makes her slave but she is a drudge when hectored by the brave if fate weave common thread i will change the doom and with new purple weave a nobler loom and in these let fortune empty her whole quiver on me i have a soul that like an ample shield can take in all and verge enough for more fate was not mine nor am i fates  souls know no conquerors    but in the first quoted lines considering them closely there is nothing but blustering absurdity in the other the poet says not truth for conscience is the conqueror of souls at least it is the conqueror of mine and who ever thought it a narrow one  but this is occasioned partly by poring over the affecting will and posthumous letter what an army of texts has she drawn up in array against me in the latter  but yet jack do they not show me that two or three thousand years ago there were as wicked fellows as myself  they do  and that is some consolation  but the generosity of her mind displayed in both is what stings me most and the more still as it is now out of my power any way in the world to be even with her  i ought to have written to you sooner but i loiterd two days at calais for an answer to a letter i wrote to engage my former traveling valet de la tour an ingenious ready fellow as you have heard me say i have engaged him and he is now with me  i shall make no stay here but intend for some of the electoral courts that of bavaria i think will engage me longest perhaps i may step out of my way if i can be out of my way anywhere to those of dresden and berlin and it is not impossible that you may have one letter from me at vienna and then perhaps i may fall down into italy by the tirol and so taking turin in my way return to paris where i hope to see mowbray and tourville nor do i despair of you  this a good deal differs from the plan i gave you but you may expect to hear from me as i move and whether i shall pursue this route or the other  i have my former lodgings in the rue st antoine which i shall hold notwithstanding my tour so they will be ready to accommodate any two of you if you come hither before my return and for this i have conditioned  i write to charlotte and that is writing to all my relations at once  do thou jack inform me duly of everything that passes  particularly how thou proceedest in thy reformationscheme how mowbray and tourville go on in my absence whether thou have any chance for a wife i am the more solicitous on this head because thou seem to think that thy mortification will not be complete nor thy reformation secure till thou art shackled how the harlowes proceed in their penitentials if miss how be married or near being so how honest doleman goes on with his empiric now he has dismissed his regulars or they him and if any likelihood of his perfect recovery be sure be very minute for every trifling occurrence relating to those we value becomes interesting when we are at a distance from them finally prepare thou to piece thy broken thread if thou would oblige  thy lovelace  letter cvii mr belford to robert lovelace esquire london oct    i write to show you that i am incapable of slighting even the minutest requests of an absent and distant friend yet you may believe that there cannot be any great alterations in the little time that you have been out of england with respect to the subjects of your inquiry nevertheless i will answer to each for the reason above given and for the reason you mention that even trifles and chitchat are agreeable from friend to friend and of friends and even of those to whom we give the importance of deeming them our foes   then as to my reformationscheme as you call it i hope i go on very well i wish you had entered upon the like and could say so too you would then find infinitel more peace of mind than you are likely ever otherwise to be acquainted with when i look back upon the sweep that has been made among us in the two or three past years and forward upon what may still happen i hardly think myself secure though of late i have been guided by other lights than those of sense and appetite which have hurried so many of our confraternity into worldly ruin if not into eternal perdition  i am very earnest in my wishes to be admitted into the uptial state but i think i ought to pass some time as a probationary till by steadiness in my good resolutions i  convince some woman whom i could love and honor and whose worthy example might confirm my morals that there is one libertine who had the grace to reform before age or disease put it out of his power to sin on  the harlowes continue inconsoleable and i dare say will to the end of their lives  miss how is not yet married but i have reason to think will soon i have the honor of corresponding with her and the more i know of her the more i admire the nobleness of her mind she must be conscious that she is superior to half our sex and to most of her own which may make her give way to a temper naturally hasty and impatient but if she meet with condescension in her man and who would not veil to a superiority so visible if it be not exacted with arrogance i dare say she will make an excellent wife  as to doleman the poor man goes on trying and hoping with his empiric i cannot but say that as the latter is a sensible and judicious man and not rash opinionative or oversanguine i have great hopes little as i think of quacks and nostrummongers in general that he will do him good if his case will admit of it my reasons are that the man pays a regular and constant attendance upon him watches with his own eye every change and new symptom of his patients malady varies his applications as the indications vary fetters not himself to rules laid down by the fathers of the art who lived many hundred years ago when diseases and the causes of them were different as the modes of living were different from what they are now as well as climates and accidents that he is to have his reward not in daily fees but after the first five guineas for medicines in proportion as the patient himself shall find amendment  as to mowbray and tourville what novelties can be expected in so short a time from men who have not sense enough to strike ot or pursue new lights either good or bad now especially that thou art gone who were the soul of all enterprise and in particular their soul besides i see them but seldom i suppose they will be at paris before you can return from germany for they cannot live without you and you gave them such a specimen of your recovered volatility in the last evenings conversation as equally delighted them and concerned me  i wish with all my heart that thou would bend thy course toward the pyreneans i should then if thou writest to thy cousin montague an account of what is most observable in thy tour put in for a copy of thy letters i wonder thou will not since then thy subjects would be as new to thyself as to  thy belford  letter cviii mr lovelace to john belford esquire paris oct      i follow my last of the     th on occasion of a letter just now come to hand from joseph leman the fellow is conscienceridden jack and tells me that he cannot rest either day or night for the mischiefs which he fears he has been and may still further be the means of doing he wishes if it please god and if it please me that he had never seen my honors face  and what is the cause of his present concern as to his own peculiar what but the slights and contempts which he receives from every one of the harlowes from those particularly he says whom he has endeavored to serve as faithfully as his engagements to me would let him serve them and i always made him believe he tells me  poor weak soul as he was from his cradle that serving me was serving both in the longrun but this and the death of his dear young lady is a grief he declares that he shall never claw off were he to live to the age of matthewsalem althoff and howsomever he is sure that he shall not live a month to an end being strangely pined and his stomach nothing like what it was and mrs betty being also now she has got his love very cross and slighting but thank his god for punishing her she is in a poor way hersell  but the chief occasion of troubling my honor now is not his own griefs only altho they are very great but to prevent future mischiefs to me for he can assure me that colonel morden has set out from them all with a full resolution to have his will of me and he is well assured that he said and swore to it as how he was resolved that he would either have my honors hearts blood or i should have his or some suchlike sad threatenings and that all the family rejoice in it and hope i shall come short home  this is the substance of josephs letter and i have one from mowbray which has a hint to the same effect and i recollect now that thou were very importunate with me to go to madrid rather than to france and italy the last evening we passed together  what i desire of thee is by the first dispatch to let me faithfully know all that thou know on this head  i cannot bear to be threatened jack nor shall any man unquestioned give himself airs in my absence if i know it that shall make me look mean in anybodys eyes that shall give my friends pain for me that shall put them upon wishing me to change my intentions or my plan to avoid him upon such despicable terms as these think thou that i could bear to live  but why if such were his purpose did he not let me know it before i left england was he unable to work himself up to a resolution till he knew me to be out of the kingdom  as soon as i can inform myself where to direct to him i will write to know his purpose for i cannot bear suspense in such a case as this that solemn act were it even to be marriage or hanging which must be done tomorrow i had rather should be done today my mind tires and sickens with impatience on ruminating upon scenes that can afford neither variety nor certainty to dwell twenty days in expectation of an event that may be decided in a quarter of an hour is grievous  if he come to paris although i should be on my tour he will very easily find out my lodgings for i every day see some or other of my countrymen and diverse of them have i entertained here i go frequently to the opera and to the play and appear at court and at all public places and on my quitting this city will leave a direction whither my letter from england or elsewhere shall from time to time be forwarded were i sure that his intention is what joseph leman tells me it is i would stay here or shorten his course to me let him be where he would  i cannot get off my regrets on account of this dear lady for the blood of me if the colonel and i are to meet as he has done me no injury and loves the memory of his cousin we shall engage with the same sentiments as to the object of our dispute and that you know is no very common case  in short i am as much convinced that i have done wrong as he can be and regret it as much but i will not bear to be threatened by any man in the world however conscious of having deserved blame  adieu belford be sincere with me no palliation as thou valuest  thy lovelace  letter cix mr belford to robert lovelace esquire london october    i cannot think my dear lovelace that colonel morden has either threatened you in those gross terms mentioned by the vile hypocritical and ignorant joseph leman or intends to follow you they are the words of people of that fellows class and not of a gentleman not of colonel morden i am sure you will observe that joseph pretends not to say that he heard him speak them  i have been very solicitous to sound the colonel for your sake and for his own and for the sake of the injunctions of the excellent lady to me as well as to him on that subject he is and you will not wonder that he should be extremely affected and owns that he has expressed himself in terms of resentment on the occasion once he said to me that had his beloved cousins case been that of a common seduction and had she been drawn in by what bishop barnet calls the delicacy of intrigue her own infirmity or credulity contributing to her fall he could have forgiven you but in so many words he assured me that he had not taken any resolutions nor had he declared himself to the family in such a way as should bind him to resent on the contrary he has owned that his cousins injunctions have hitherto had the force upon him which i could wish they should have  he went abroad in a week after you when he took his leave of me he told me that his design was to go to florence and that he would settle his affairs there and then return to england and here pass the remainder of his days  i was indeed apprehensive that if you and he were to meet something unhappy might fall out and as i knew that you proposed to take italy and very likely florence in your return to france i was very solicitous to prevail upon you to take the court of spain into your plan i am still so and if you are not to be prevailed upon to do that let me entreat you to avoid florence or leghorn in your return as you have visited both heretofore at least let not the proposal of a meeting come from you  it would be matter of serious reflection to me if the very fellow this joseph leman who gave you such an opportunity to turn all the artillery of his masters against themselves and to play them upon one another to favor your plotting purposes should be the instrument in the devils hand unwittingly too to avenge them all upon you for should you even get the better of the colonel would the mischief end there  it would but add remorse to your present remorse since the interview must end in death for he would not i am confident take his life at your hand the harlowes would moreover prosecute you in a legal way you hate them and they would be gainers by his death rejoicers in yours  and have you not done mischief enough already  let me therefore and through me all your friends have the satisfaction to hear that you are resolved to avoid this gentleman time will subdue all things nobody doubts your bravery nor will it be known that your plan is changed through persuasion  young harlowe talks of calling you to account this is a plain evidence that mr morden has not taken the quarrel upon himself for their family  i am in no apprehension of anybody but colonel morden i know it will not be a means to prevail upon you to oblige me to say that i am well assured that this gentleman is a skilful swordsman and that he is as cool and sedate as skilful but yet i will add that if i had a value for my life he should be the last man except yourself with whom i would choose to have a contention  i have as you required been very candid and sincere with you i have not aimed at palliation if you seek not colonel morden it is my opinion he will not seek you for he is a man of principle but if you seek him i believe he will not shun you  let me reurge it is the effect of my love for you that you know your own guilt in this affair and should not be again an aggressor it would be pity that so brave a man as the colonel should drop were you and he to meet and on the other hand it would be dreadful that you should be sent to your account unprepared for it and pursuing a fresh violence moreover see thou not in the deaths of two of thy principal agents the handwriting upon the wall against thee  my zeal on this occasion may make me guilty of repetition indeed i know not how to quit the subject but if what i have written added to your own remorse and consciousness cannot prevail all that i might further urge will be ineffectual  adieu therefore may thou repent of the past and may no new violences add to thy heavy reflections and overwhelm thy future hopes is the wish of  thy true friend john belford  letter cx mr lovelace to john belford esquire munich nov        i received yours this moment just as i was setting out for vienna  as to going to madrid or one single step out of the way to avoid colonel morden let me perish if i do  you cannot think me so mean a wretch  and so you own that he has threatened me but not in gross and ungentlemanly terms you say if he has threatened me like a gentleman i will esent his threats like a gentleman but he has not done as a man of honor if he has threatened me at all behind my back i would scorn to threaten any man to whom i knew how to address myself either personally or by pen and ink  as to what you mention of my guilt of the handwriting on the wall of a legal prosecution if he meet his fate from my hand of his skill coolness courage and suchlike poltroon stuff what can you mean by it surely you cannot believe that such insinuations as those will weaken either my hands or my heart  no more of this sort of nonsense i beseech you in any of your future letters  he had not taken any resolutions you say when you saw him he must and will take resolutions one way or other very quickly for i wrote to him yesterday without waiting for this your answer to my last i could not avoid it i could not as i told you in that live in suspense i have directed my letter to florence nor could i suffer my friends to live in suspense as to my safety or otherwise but i have couched it in such moderate terms that he has fairly his option he will be the challenger if he take it in the sense in which he may so handsomely avoid taking it and if he does it will demonstrate that malice and revenge were the predominant passions with him and that he was determined but to settle his affairs and then take his resolutions as you phrase it  yet if we are to meet for i know what my ption would be in his case on such a letter compla as it is i wish he had a worse i a better cause it ld be sweet revenge to him were i to fall by his han but what should i be the better for killing him  i will enclose the copy of the letter i sent him  on reperusing yours in a cooler mo i cannot but thank you for your friendly love and  intentions my value for you from the first hour of  tance till now i have never found misplaced reng at least your intention thou must however own a good deal of blunder of the overdo and underdo kind with respect to the part thou actedst between me and the beloved of my heart but thou art really an honest fellow and a sincere and warm friend i could almost wish i had not written to florence till i had received thy letter now before me but it is gone let it go if he wish peace and to avoid violence he will have a fair opportunity to embrace the one and shun the other  if not  he must take his fate  but be this as it may you may contrive to let young harlowe know he is a menacer too that i shall be in england in march next at farthest  this of bavaria is a gallant and polite court nevertheless being uncertain whether my letter may meet with the colonel at florence i shall quit it and set out as i intended for vienna taking care to have any letter or message from him conveyed to me there which will soon bring me back hither or to any other place to which i shall be invited  as i write to charlotte i have nothing more to add after compliments to all friends than that i am  wholly yours lovelace   to william morden esquire inclosed in the above munich nov  0     sir i have heard with a great deal of surprise that you have thought fit to throw out some menacing expressions against me  i should have been very glad that you had thought i had punishment enough in my own mind for the wrongs i have done to the most excellent of women and that it had been possible for two persons so ardently joining in one love especially as i was desirous to the utmost of my power to repair those wrongs to have lived if not on amicable terms in such a way as not to put either to the pain of hearing of threatenings thrown out in absence which either ought to be despised for if he had not spirit to take notice of them  now sir if what i have heard be owing only to warmth of temper or to sudden passion while the loss of all other losses the most deplorable to me was recent i not only excuse but commend you for it but if you are really determined to meet me on any other account which i own to you is not however what i wish it would be very blameable and very unworthy of the character i desire to maintain as well with you as with every other gentleman to give you a difficulty in doing it  being uncertain when this letter may meet you i shall set out tomorrow for vienna where any letter directed to the post house in that city or to baron windisgratzs at the favorita to whom i have commendations will come to hand  mean time believing you to be a man too generous to make a wrong construction of what i am going to declare and knowing the value which the dearest of all creatures had for you and your relationship to her i will not scruple to assure you that the most acceptable return will be that colonel morden chooses to be upon an amicable rather than upon any other footing with  his sincere admirer and humble servant r lovelace   letter cxi mr lovelace to john belford esquire lintz nov    dec   i am now on my way to trent in order to meet colonel morden in pursuance of his answer to my letter enclosed in my last i had been at presburgh and had intended to visit some other cities of hungary but having obliged myself to return first to vienna i there met with his letter which follows  munich nov    dec   sir your letter was at florence four days before i arrived there  that i might not appear unworthy of your savor i set out for this city the very next morning i knew not but that the politeness of this court might have engaged beyond his intention a gentleman who has only his pleasures to pursue  but being disappointed in my hope of finding you here it becomes me to acquaint you that i have such a desire to stand well in the opinion of a man of your spirit that i cannot hesitate a moment upon the option which i am sure mr lovelace in my situation thus called upon would make  i own sir that i have on all occasions spoken of your treatment of my everdear cousin as it deserved it would have been very surprising if i had not and it behooves me now you have given me so noble an opportunity of explaining myself to convince you that no words fell from my lips of you merely because you were absent i acquaint you therefore that i will attend your appointment and would were it to the farthest part of the globe  i shall stay some days at this court and if you please to direct for me at m klienfurts in this city whether i remain here or not your commands will come safely and speedily to the hands of sir  your most humble servant wm morden   so you see belford that the colonel by his ready his even eagerly expressed acceptance of the offered interview was determined and is it not much better to bring such a point as this to an issue than to give pain to friends for my safety or continue in a suspense myself as i must do if i imagined that another had aught against me  this was my reply vienna nov    dec   sir i have this moment the favor of yours i will suspend a tour i was going to take into hungary and instantly set out for munich and if i find you not there will proceed to trent this city being on the confines of italy will be most convenient as i presume to you in your return to tuscany and i shall hope to meet you in it on the      of december  i shall bring with me only a french valet and an english footman other particulars may be adjusted when i have the honor to see you till when i am sir  your most obedient servant r lovelace     now jack i have no manner of apprehension of the event of this meeting and i think i may say he seeks me not i him and so let him take the consequence  what is infinitely nearer to my heart is my ingratitude to the most excellent of women  my premeditated ingratitude  yet all the while enabled to distinguish and to adore her excellencies in spite of the mean opinion of the sex which i had imbibed from early manhood  but this lady has asserted the worthiness of her sex and most gloriously has she exalted it with me now yet surely as i have said and written an hundred times there cannot be such another woman  but while my loss in her is the greatest of any mans and while she was nearer to me than to any other person in the world and once she herself wished to be so what an insolence in any man breathing to pretend to avenge her on me  happy happy thrice happy had i known how to value as i ought to have valued the glory of such a preference  i will aggravate to myself this aggravation of the colonels pretending to call me to account for my treatment of a lady so much my own lest in the approaching interview my heart should relent for one so nearly related to her and who means honor and justice to her memory and i should thereby give him advantages which otherwise he cannot have for i know that i shall be inclined to trust to my skill to save a man who was so much and so justly valued by her and shall be loath to give way to my resentment as a threatened man and in this respect only am i sorry for his skill and his courage lest i should be obliged in my own defense to add a chalk to a score that is already too long  indeed indeed belford i am and shall be to my latest hour the most miserable of beings such exalted generosity  why did thou put into my craving hands the copy of her will why sentest thou to me the posthumous letter  what though i was earnest to see the will thou knew what they both were  i did not and that it would be cruel to oblige me  the meeting of twenty colonel mordens were there twenty to meet in turn would be nothing to me would not give me a moments concern as to my own safety but my reflections upon my vile ingratitude to so superior an excellence will ever be my curse  had she been a miss how to me and treated me as if i were an hickman i had had a call for revenge and policy when i had intended to be an husband might have justified my attempts to humble her but a meek and gentle temper was hers though a true heroine whenever honor or virtue called for an exertion of spirit  nothing but my cursed devices stood in the way of my happiness remembrest thou not how repeatedly from the first i poured cold water upon her rising flame by meanly and ingratefully turning upon her the injunctions which virgin delicacy and filial duty induced her to lay me under before i got her into my power see vol iii p    see also letters xvixliiixliv of the same volume and many other places   did she not tell me and did i not know it if she had not told me that she could not be guilty of affectation or tyranny to the man whom she intended to marry see vol v p      it may be observed further that all clarissas occasional lectures to miss how on that young ladys treatment of mr hickman prove that she was herself above affectation and tyranny  see more particularly the advice she gives to that friend of her heart letter xvii p    of this volume  o my dear says she in this letter that it had been my lot as i was not permitted to live single to have met with a man by whom i could have acted generously and unreservedly etc etc  i knew as she once upbraided me that from the time i had got her from her fathers house i had a plain path before me vol v p         true did she say and i triumphed in the discovery that from that time i had held her soul in suspense an hundred times vol v p      my ipecacuanha trial alone was enough to convince an infidel that she had a mind in which love and tenderness would have presided had i permitted the charming buds to put forth and blow vol iv letters xxxvixxxvii   she would have had no reserves as once she told me had i not given her cause of doubt vol v p      and did she not own to thee that once she could have loved me and could she have made me good would have made me happy see p     of this volume  o belford here was love a love of the noblest kind  a love as she hints in her posthumous letter see p     of this volume  that extended to the soul and which she not only avowed in her dying hours but contrived to let me know it after death in that letter filled with warnings and exhortations which had for their sole end my eternal welfare  the cursed women indeed endeavored to excite my vengeance and my pride by preaching to me eternally her doubts her want of love and her contempt of me and my pride was at times too much excited by their vile insinuations but had it even been as they said well might she who had been used to be courted and admired by every desiring eye and worshipped by every respectful heart  well might such a woman be allowed to draw back when she found herself kept in suspense as to the great qustion of all by a designing and intriguing spirit pretending awe and distance as reasons for reiningin a fervor which if real cannot be reinedin  divine creature her very doubts her reserves so justly doubting would have been my assurance and my glory  and what other trial needed her virtue what other needed a purity so angelic blessed with such a command of her passions in the bloom of youth had i not been a villain  and a wanton a conceited a proud fool as well as a villain  these reflections sharpened rather than their edge by time rebated accompany me in whatever i do and wherever i go and mingle with all my diversions and amusements and yet i go into gay and splendid company i have made new acquaintance in the different courts i have visited i am both esteemed and sought after by persons of rank and merit i visit the colleges the churches the palaces i frequent the theater am present at every public exhibition and see all that is worth seeing that i had not seen before in the cabinets of the curious am sometimes admitted to the toilette of an eminent toast and make one with distinction at the assemblees of others  yet can think of nothing nor of anybody with delight but of my clarissa nor have i seen one woman with advantage to herself but as she resembles in stature air complexion voice or in some feature that charmer that only charmer of my soul  what greater punishment than to have these astonishing perfections which she was mistress of strike my remembrance with such force when i have nothing left me but the remorse of having deprived myself and the world of such a blessing nowandthen indeed am i capable of a gleam of comfort arising not ungenerously from the moral certainty which i have of her everlasting happiness in spite of all the machinations and devices which i set on foot to ensnare her virtue and to bring down so pure a mind to my own level  for can i be at worst avert that worst o thou supreme who only can avert it so much a wretch so very far abandoned but that i must even in the horridst gloom reap intervenient joy at least some respite from pain and anguish in her bliss  for why this very soul must suffer  not another it cannot be mine if it could envy her or at her happiness repine  if i find myself thus miserable abroad i will soon return to england and follow your example i think  turn hermit or some plaguey thing or other and see what a constant course of penitence and mortification will do for me there is no living at this rate  d  n me if there be  if any mishap should befall me you will have the particulars of it from de la tour he indeed knows not a word of english but every modern tongue is yours he is a trusty and ingenious fellow and if any thing happen will have some other papers which i shall have ready sealed up for you to transmit to lord m and since thou art so expert and so ready at executorships prythee belford accept of the office for me as well as for my clarissa  clarissa lovelace let me call her  by all that is good i am bewitched to her memory her very name with mine joined to it ravishes my soul and is more delightful to me than the sweetest music  had i carried her i must still recriminate to any other place than to that accursed womans  for the potion was her invention and mixture and all the persistedin violence was at her instigation and at that of her wretched daughters who have now amply revenged upon me their own ruin which they lay at my door  but this looks so like the confession of a thief at the gallows that possibly thou will be apt to think i am intimidated in prospect of the approaching interview but far otherwise on the contrary most cheerfully do i go to meet the colonel and i would tear my heart out of my breast with my own hands were it capable of fear or concern on that account  thus much only i know that if i should kill him which i will not do if i can help it i shall be far from being easy in my mind that shall i never be more but as the meeting is evidently of his own seeking against an option fairly given to the contrary and i cannot avoid it i will think of that hereafter it is but repenting and mortifying for all at once for i am as sure of victory as i am that i now live let him be as skilful a swordsman as he will since besides that i am no unfleshed novice this is a sport that when provoked to it i love as well as my food and moreover i shall be as calm and undisturbed as the bishop at his prayers while he as is evident by his letter must be actuated by revenge and passion  doubt not therefore jack that i shall give a good account of this affair mean time i remain  yours most affectionately etc lovelace  letter cxii mr lovelace to john belford esquire trent dec     tomorrow is to be the day that will in all probability send either one or two ghosts to attend the manes of my clarissa  i arrived here yesterday and inquiring for an english gentleman of the name of morden soon found out the colonels lodgings he had been in town two days and left his name at every probable place  he was gone to ride out and i left my name and where to be found and in the evening he made me a visit  he was plaguey gloomy that was not i but yet he told me that i had acted like a man of true spirit in my first letter and with honor in giving him so readily this meeting he wished i had in other respects and then we might have seen each other upon better terms than now we did  i said there was no recalling what was passed and that i wished some things had not been done as well as he  to recriminate now he said would be as exasperating as unavailable and as i had so cheerfully given him this opportunity words should give place to business  your choice mr lovelace of time of place of weapon shall be my choice  the two latter be yours mr morden the time tomorrow or next day as you please  next day then mr lovelace and well ride out tomorrow to fix the place  agreed sir  well now mr lovelace do you choose the weapon  i said i believed we might be upon an equal foot with the single rapier but if he thought otherwise i had no objection to a pistol  i will only say replied he that the chances may be more equal by the sword because we can neither of us be to seek in that and you would stand says he a worse chance as i apprehend with a pistol and yet i have brought two that you may take your choice of either for added he i never missed a mark at pistoldistance since i knew how to hold one  i told him that he spoke like himself that i was expert enough that way to embrace it if he chose it though not so sure of my mark as he pretended to be yet the devils in it colonel if i who have slit a bullet in two upon a knifesedge hit not my man so i have no objection to a pistol if it be your choice no man i will venture to say has a steadier hand or eye than i have  they may both be of use to you sir at the sword as well as at the pistol the sword therefore be the thing if you please  with all my heart  we parted with a solemn sort of ceremonious civility and this day i called upon him and we rode out together to fix upon the place and both being of one mind and hating to put off for the morrow what could be done today would have decided it then but de la tour and the colonels valet who attended us being unavoidably let into the secret joined to beg we would have with us a surgeon from brixen whom la tour had fallen in with there and who had told him he was to ride next morning to bleed a person in a fever at a lone cottage which by the surgeons description was not far from the place where we then were if it were not that very cottage within sight of us  they undertook so to manage it that the surgeon should know nothing of the matter till his assistance was called in and la tour being as i assured the colonel a readycontriving fellow whom i ordered to obey him as myself were the chance to be in his favor we both agreed to defer the decision till tomorrow and to leave the whole about the surgeon to the management of our two valets injoining them absolute secrecy and so rode back again by different ways  we fixed upon a little lone valley for the spot  ten tomorrow morning the time  and single rapier the word yet i repeatedly told him that i value myself so much upon my skill in that weapon that i would wish him to choose any other  he said it was a gentlemans weapon and he who understood it not wanted a qualification that he ought to suffer for not having but that as to him one weapon was as good as another throughout all the instruments of offense  so jack you see i take no advantage of him but my devil must deceive me if he take not his life or his death at my hands before eleven tomorrow morning  his valet and mine are to be present but both strictly injoined to be impartial and inactive and in return for my civility of the like nature he commanded his to be assisting to me if he fell  we are to ride thither and to dismount when at the place and his footman and mine are to wait at an appointed distance with a chaise to carry off to the borders of the venetian territories the survivor if one drop or to assist either or both as occasion may demand  and thus belford is the matter settled  a shower of rain has left me nothing else to do and therefore i write this letter though i might as well have deferred it till tomorrow twelve oclock when i doubt not to be able to write again to assure you how much i am  yours etc lovelace  letter cxiii translation of a letter from f j dela tour to john belford esquire near sohosquare london trent december    n s sir i have melancholy news to inform you of by order of the chevalier lovelace he showed me his letter to you before he sealed it signifying that he was to meet the chevalier morden on the   th wherefore as the occasion of the meeting is so well known to you i shall say nothing of it here  i had taken care to have ready within a little distance a surgeon and his assistant to whom under an oath of secrecy i had revealed the matter though i did not own it to the two gentlemen so that they were prepared with bandages and all things proper for well was i acquainted with the bravery and skill of my chevalier and had heard the character of the other and knew the animosity of both a postchaise was ready with each of their footmen at a little distance  the two chevaliers came exactly at their time they were attended by monsieur margate the colonels gentleman and myself they had given orders overnight and now repeated them in each others presence that we should observe a strict impartiality between them and that if one fell each of us should look upon himself as to any needful help or retreat as the servant of the survivor and take his commands accordingly  after a few compliments both the gentlemen with the greatest presence of mind that i ever beheld in men stripped to their shirts and drew  they parried with equal judgment several passes my chevalier drew the first blood making a desperate push which by a sudden turn of his antagonist missed going clear through him and wounded him on the fleshy part of the ribs of his right side which part the sword tore out being on the extremity of the body but before he could recover himself his adversary in return pushed him into the inside of the left arm near the shoulder and the sword by raking his breast as it passed being followed by a great effusion of blood the colonel said sir i believe you have enough  my chevalier swore by g  d he was not hurt twas a pins point and so made another pass at his antagonist which he with a surprising dexterity received under his arm and run my dear chevalier into the body who immediately fell saying the luck is yours sir  o my beloved clarissa  now art thou  inwardly he spoke three or four words more his sword dropped from his hand mr morden threw his down and ran to him saying in french  ah monsieur you are a dead man  call to god for mercy  we gave the signal agreed upon to the footmen and they to the surgeons who instantly came up  colonel morden i found was too well used to the bloody work for he was as cool as if nothing so extraordinary had happened assisting the surgeons though his own wound bled much but my dear chevalier fainted away two or three times running and vomited blood besides  however they stopped the bleeding for the present and we helped him into the voiture and then the colonel suffered his own wound to be dressed and appeared concerned that my chevalier was between whiles when he could speak and struggle extremely outrageous  poor gentleman he had made quite sure of victory  the colonel against the surgeons advice would mount on horseback to pass into the venetian territories and generously gave me a purse of gold to pay the surgeons desiring me to make a present to the footman and to accept of the remainder as a mark of his satisfaction in my conduct and in my care and tenderness of my master  the surgeons told him that my chevalier could not live over the day  when the colonel took leave of him mr lovelace said in french you have well revenged the dear creature  i have sir said mr morden in the same language and perhaps shall be sorry that you called upon me to this work while i was balancing whether to obey or disobey the dear angel  there is a fate in it replied my chevalier  a cursed fate  or this could not have been  but be ye all witnesses that i have provoked my destiny and acknowledge that i fall by a man of honor  sir said the colonel with the piety of a confessor wringing mr lovelaces hand snatch these few fleeting moments and commend yourself to god  and so he rode off  the voiture proceeded slowly with my chevalier yet the motion set both his wounds bleeding afresh and it was with difficulty they again stopped the blood  we brought him alive to the first cottage and he gave orders to me to dispatch to you the packet i herewith send sealed up and bid me write to you the particulars of this most unhappy affair and to give you thanks in his name for all your favors and friendship to him  contrary to all expectation he lived over the night but suffered much as well from his impatience and disappointment as from his wounds for he seemed very unwilling to die  he was delirious at times in the two last hours and then several times cried out take her away take her away but named nobody and sometimes praised some lady that clarissa i suppose whom he had called upon when he received his deaths wound calling her sweet excellence divine creature fair sufferer  and once he said look down blessed spirit look down  and there stopped  his lips however moving  at nine in the morning he was seized with convulsions and fainted away and it was a quarter of an hour before he came out of them  his few last words i must not omit as they show an ultimate composure which may administer some consolation to his honorable friends  blessed  said he addressing himself no doubt to heaven for his dying eyes were lifted up  a strong convulsion prevented him for a few moments saying more  but recovering he again with great fervor lifting up his eyes and his spread hands pronounced the word blessed  then in a seeming ejaculation he spoke inwardly so as not to be understood at last he distinctly pronounced these three words let this expiate and then his head sinking on his pillow he expired at about half an hour after ten  he little thought poor gentleman his end so near so had given no direction about his body i have caused it to be embowelled and deposited in a vault till i have orders from england  this is a favor that was procured with difficulty and would have been refused had he not been an englishman of rank a nation with reason respected in every austrian government  for he had refused ghostly attendance and the sacraments in the catholic way may his soul be happy i pray god  i have had some trouble also on account of the manner of his death from the magistracy here who have taken the requisite informations in the affair and it has cost me some money of which and of my dear chevaliers effects i will give you a faithful account in my next and so waiting at this place your commands i am sir  your most faithful and obedient servant f j de la tour  conclusion supposed to be written by mr belford what remains to be mentioned for the satisfaction of such of the readers as may be presumed to have interested themselves in the fortunes of those other principals in the story who survived mr lovelace will be found summarily related as follows  the news of mr lovelaces unhappy end was received with as much grief by his own relations as it was with exultation by the harlowefamily and by miss how his own family were most to be pitied because being sincere admirers of the inimitable lady they were greatly grieved for the injustice done her and now had the additional mortification of losing the only male of it by a violent death  that his fate was deserved was still a heightening of their calamity as they had for that very reason and his unpreparedness for it but too much grounds for apprehension with regard to his future happiness while the other family from their unforgiving spirit and even the noble young lady abovementioned from her lively resentments sound his death some little some temporary alleviation of the heavy loss they had sustained principally through his means  temporary alleviation we repeat as to the harlowe family for they were far from being happy or easy in their reflections upon their own conduct  mrs harlowe lived about two years and an half after the muchlamented death of her excellent daughter  mr harlowe survived his lady about half a year  both in their last hours comforted themselves that they should be restored to their blessed daughter as they always from the time that they were acquainted with her happy exit called her  they both lived however to see their son james and their daughter arabella married but not to take joy in either of their nuptials  mr james harlowe married a woman of family an orphan and is obliged at a very great expense to support her claim to estates which were his principal inducement to make his addresses to her but which to this day he has not recovered nor is likely to recover having very powerful adversaries to contend with and a title to assert which admits of litigation and he not blessed with so much patience as is necessary to persons embarrassed in law  what is further observable with regard to him is that the match was entirely of his own head against the advice of his father mother and uncles who warned him of marrying in this lady a lawsuit for life his ungenerous behavior to his wise for what she cannot help and for what is as much her misfortune as his has occasioned such estrangements between them she being a woman of spirit as were the lawsuits determined and even more favorably than probably they will be must make him unhappy to the end of his life he attributes all his misfortunes when he opens himself to the few friends he has to his vile and cruel treatment of his angelic sister he confesses these misfortunes to be just without having temper to acquiesce in the acknowleged justice one month in every year he puts on mourning and that month commences with him on the  th of september during which he shuts himself up from all company finally he is looked upon and often calls himself the most miserable of beings  arabellas fortune became a temptation to a man of quality to make his addresses to her his title an inducement with her to approve of him brothers and sisters when they are not friends are generally the sharpest enemies to each other he thought too much was done for her in the settlements she thought not enough and for some years past they have so heartily hated each other that if either know a joy it is in being told of some new misfortune or displeasure that happens to the other indeed before they came to an open rupture they were continually loading each other by way of exonerating themselves  to the additional disquiet of the whole family with the principal guilt of their implacable behavior and sordid cruelty to their admirable sister  may the reports that are spread of this ladys further unhappiness from her lords free life a fault she justly thought so odious in mr lovelace though that would not have been an insuperable objection with her to his addresses and of his public slights and contempt of her and even sometimes of his personal abuses which are said to be owing to her impatient spirit and violent passions be utterly groundless  for what a heart must that be which would wish she might be as great a torment to herself as she had aimed to be to her sister especially as she regrets to this hour and declares that she shall to the last of her life her cruel treatment of that sister and as well as her brother is but too ready to attribute to that her own unhappiness  mr antony and mr john harlowe are still at the writing of this living but often declare that with their beloved niece they lost all the joy of their lives and lament without reserve in all companies the unnatural part they were induced to take against her  mr solmes is also still living if a man of his cast may be said to live for his general behavior and sordid manners are such as justify the aversion the excellent lady had to him he has moreover found his addresses rejected by several women of far inferior fortunes great as his own are to those of the lady to whom he was encouraged to aspire  mr mowbray and mr tourville having lost the man in whose conversation they so much delighted shocked and awakened by the several unhappy catastrophes before their eyes and having always rather ductile than dictating hearts took their friend belfords advice converted the remainder of their fortunes into annuities for life and retired the one into yorkshire the other into nottinghamshire of which counties they are natives their friend belford managing their concerns for them and corresponding with them and having more and more hopes every time he sees them which is once or twice a year when they come to town that they will become more and more worthy of their names and families  it cannot be amiss to mention what became of the two sisters in iniquity sally martin and polly horton names so frequently occurring in the foregoing collection  after the death of the profligate sinclair they kept on the infamous trade with toomuch success till an accident happened in the house  a gentleman of family killed in it in a fray contending with another for a newvampd face sally was accused of holding the gentlemans arm while his more favored adversary run him through the heart and then made off and she being tried for her life narrowly escaped  this accident obliged them to break up housekeeping and not having been frugal enough of their illgotten gains lavishing upon one what they got by another they were compelled for subsistencesake to enter themselves as undermanagers at such another house as their own had been in which service soon after sally died of a fever and surfeit got by a debauch and the other about a month after by a violent cold occasioned through carelessness in a salivation two creatures who wanted not sense and had had what is deemed to be a good modern education their parents having lived reputably and once having much better hopes of them but who were in a great measure answerable for their miscarriages by indulging them in the fashionable follies and luxury of an age given up to those amusements and pleasures which are so apt to set people of but middle fortunes above all the useful employments of life and to make young women an easy prey to rakes and libertines  happier scenes open for the remaining characters for it might be descending too low to mention the untimely ends of dorcas and of william mr lovelaces wicked servant and the pining and consumptive ones of betty barnes and joseph leman unmarried both and in less than a year after the happy death of their excellent young lady  the good mrs norton passed the small remainder of her life as happily as she wished in her beloved fosterdaughters dairyhouse as it used to be called as she wished we repeat  for she had too strong aspirations after another life to be greatly attached to this  she laid out the greatest part of her time in doing good by her advice and by the prudent management of the fund committed to her direction having lived an exemplary life from her youth upwards and seen her son happily settled in the world she departed with ease and calmness without pang or agony like a tired traveller falling into a sweet slumber her last words expressing her hope of being restored to the child of her bosom and to her own excellent father and mother to whose care and pains she owed that good education to which she was indebted for all her other blessings  the poors fund which was committed to her care she resigned a week before her death into the hands of mrs hickman according to the direction of the will and all the accounts and disbursements with it which she had kept with such an exactness that that lady declares that she will follow her method and only wishes to do as well  miss how was not to be persuaded to quit her mourning for her dear friend until six months were fully expired and then she made mr hickman one of the happiest men in the world a woman of her fine sense and understanding married to a man of virtue and goodnature who had no past capital errors to reflect upon and to abate his joys and whose behavior to mrs hickman is as affectionate as it was respectful to miss how could not do otherwise they are already blessed with two fine children a daughter to whom by joint consent they have given the name of her beloved friend and a son who bears that of his father  she has allotted to mr hickman who takes delight in doing good and that as much for its own sake as to oblige her his part of the management of the poors fund to be accounable for it as she pleasantly says to her she has appropriated every thursday morning for her part of that management and takes so much delight in the task that she declares it is one of the most agreeable of her amusements and the more agreeable as she teaches every one whom she benefits to bless the memory of her departed friend to whom she attributes the merit of all her own charities as well as that of those which she dispenses in pursuance of her will  she has declared that this fund shall never fail while she lives she has even engaged her mother to contribute annually to it and mr hickman has appropriated twenty pounds a year to the same in consideration of which she allows him to recommend four objects yearly to partake of it  allows is her style for she assumes the whole prerogative of dispensing this charity the only prerogative she does or has occasion to assume in every other case there is but one will between them and that is generally his or hers as either speak first upon any subject be it what it will mrs hickman she sometimes as pleasantly as generously tells him must not quite forget that she was once miss how because if he had not loved her as such and with all her foibles she had never been mrs hickman nevertheless she seriously on all occasions and that to others as well as to himself confesses that she owes him unreturnable obligations for his patience with her in her day and for his generous behavior to her in his  and still the more highly does she esteem and love him as she reflects upon his past kindness to her beloved friend and on that dear friends good opinion of him nor is it less grateful to her that the worthy man joins most sincerely with her in all those respectful and affectionate recollections which make the memory of the departed precious to survivors  mr belford was not so destitute of humanity and affection as to be unconcerned at the unhappy sat of his most intimate friend but when he reflects upon the untimely ends of several of his companions but just mentioned in the preceding history see vol vi p      and p     and     of this volume  on the shocking despondency and death of his poor friend belton  on the signal justice which overtook the wicked tomlinson  on the dreadful exit of the infamous sinclair  on the deep remorses of his more valued friend  and on the other hand on the example set him by the most excellent of her sex  and on her blessed preparation and happy departure  and when he considers as he often does with awe and terror that his wicked habits were so rooted in his depraved heart that all these warnings and this lovely example seemed to be but necessary to enable him to subdue them and to reform and that such awakening calls are hardly ever afforded to men of his cast or if they are but seldom attended with such happy effects in the prime of youth and in the full vigor of constitution  when he reflects upon all these things he adores the mercy which through these calls has snatched him as a brand out of the fire and thinks himself obliged to make it his endeavor to find out and to reform any of those who may have been endangered by his means as well as to repair to the utmost of his power any damage or mischiefs which he may have occasioned to others  with regard to the trust with which he was honored by the inimitable lady he had the pleasure of acquitting himself of it in a very few months to everybodys satisfaction even to that of the unhappy family who sent him their thanks on the occasion nor was he at delivering up his accounts contented with resigning the legacy bequeathed to him to the uses of the will so that the poors fund as it is called is become a very considerable sum and will be a lasting bank for relief of objects who best deserve relief  there was but one earthly blessing which remained for mr belford to wish for in order morally speaking to secure to him all his other blessings and that was the greatest of all worldly ones a virtuous and prudent wife so free a liver as he had been he did not think that he could be worthy of such a one till upon an impartial examination of himself he found the pleasure he had in his new resolutions so great and his abhorrence of his former courses so sincere that he was the less apprehensive of a deviation  upon this presumption having also kept in his mind some encouraging hints from mr lovelace and having been so happy as to have it in his power to oblige lord m and that whole noble family by some services grateful to them the request for which from his unhappy friend was brought over among other papers with the dead body by de la tour he besought that noblemans leave to make his addresses to miss charlotte montague the eldest of his lordships two nieces and making at the same time such proposals of settlements as were not objected to his lordship was pleased to use his powerful interest in his favor and his worthy niece having no engagement she had the goodness to honor mr belford with her hand and thereby made him as completely happy as a man can be who has enormities to reflect upon which in a course of years the deaths of some of the injured parties and the irreclaimableness of others have put it out of his power to atone for  happy is the man who in time of health and strength sees and reforms the errors of his ways  but how much more happy he who has no capital and wilful errors to repent of  how unmixed and sincere must the joys of such a one come to him  lord m added bountifully in his lifetime as did also the two ladies his sisters to the fortune of their worthy niece and as mr belford has been blessed with a son by her his lordship at his death which happened just three years after the untimely one of his unhappy nephew was pleased to devise to that son and to his descendants for ever and in case of his death unmarried to any other children of his niece his hertfordshire estate  designed for mr lovelace which he made up to the value of a moiety of his real estates bequeathing also a moiety of his personal to the same lady  miss patty montague a fine young lady to whom her noble uncle at his death devised the other moiety of his real and personal estates including his seat in berkshire lives at present with her excellent sister mrs belford to whom she removed upon lord ms death but in all probability will soon be the lady of a worthy baronet of ancient family fine qualities and ample fortunes just returned from his travels with a character superior to the very good one he set out with a case that very seldom happens although the end of travel is improvement  colonel morden who with so many virtues and accomplishments cannot be unhappy in several letters to the executor with whom he corresponds from florence having since his unhappy affair with mr lovelace changed his purpose of coming so soon to reside in england as he had intended declares that although he thought himself obliged either to accept of what he took to be a challenge as such or tamely to acknowledge that he gave up all resentment of his cousins wrongs and in a manner to beg pardon for having spoken freely of mr lovelace behind his back and although at the time he owns he was not sorry to be called upon as he was to take either the one course or the other yet now coolly reflecting upon his beloved cousins reasonings against duelling and upon the price it had too probably cost the unhappy man he wishes he had more fully considered those words in his cousins posthumous letter  if god will allow him time for repentance why should you deny it him  to conclude  the worthy widow lovick continues to live with mr belford and by her prudent behavior piety and usefulness has endeared herself to her lady and to the whole family  postscript the author of the foregoing work has been favored in the course of its publication with many anonymous letters in which the writers have differently expressed their wishes as to what they apprehended of the catastrophe  most of those directed to him by the gentler sex turn in favor of what they call a fortunate ending and some of them enamoured as they declare with the principal character are warmly solicitous to have her happy  these letters having been written on the perusal of the first four volumes only before the complicated adjustment of the several parts to one another could be seen or fully known it may be thought superfluous now the whole work is before the public to enter upon this argument because it is presumed that the catastrophe necessarily follows the natural progress of the story but as the notion of poetical justice seems to have generally obtained among the fair sex and must be confessed to have the appearance of good nature and humanity it may not be amiss to give it a brief consideration  no can it be deemed impertinent to touch upon this subject at the conclusion of a work which is designed to inculcate upon the human mind under the guise of an amusement the great lessons of christianity in an age like the present which seems to expect from the poets and dramatic writers that is to say from the authors of works of invention that they should make it one of their principal rules to propagate another sort of dispensation under the name of poetical justice than that with which god by revelation teaches us he has thought fit to exercise mankind whom placing here only in a state of probation he has so intermingled good and evil as to necessitate them to look forward for a more equal distribution of both  the history or rather the dramatic narrative of clarissa is formed on this religious plan and is therefore well justified in deferring to extricate suffering virtue till it meets with the completion of its reward  but we have no need to shelter our conduct under the sanction of religion an authority perhaps not of the greatest weight with modern critics since we are justified in it by the greatest master of reason and the best judge of composition that ever was the learned reader knows we must mean aristotle whose sentiments in this matter we shall beg leave to deliver in the words of a very amiable writer of our own country  the english writers of tragedy says mr addison spectator vol i no xl  are possessed with a notion that when they represent a virtuous or innocent person in distress they ought not to leave him till they have delivered him out of his troubles or made him triumph over his enemies  this error they have been led into by a ridiculous doctrine in modern criticism that they are obliged to an equal distribution of rewards and punishments and an impartial execution of poetical justice  who were the first that established this rule i know not but i am sure it has no foundation in nature in reason or in the practice of the ancients  we find that  in the dispensations of providence good and evil happen alike to all men on this side the grave and as the principal design of tragedy is to raise commiseration and terror in the minds of the audience we shall defeat this great end if we always make virtue and innocence happy and successful  whatever crosses and disappointments a good man suffers in the body of the tragedy they will make but small impression on our minds when we know that in the last act he is to arrive at the end of his wishes and desires  when we see him engaged in the depth of his afflictions we are apt to comfort ourselves because we are sure he will find his way out of them and that his grief how great soever it may be at present will soon terminate in gladness  for this reason the ancient writers of tragedy treated men in their plays as they are dealt with in the world by making virtue sometimes happy and sometimes miserable as they found it in the fable which they made choice of or as it might affect their audience in the most agreeable manner  aristotle considers the tragedies that were written in either of those kinds and observes that those which ended unhappily had always pleased the people and carried away the prize in the public disputes of the stage from those that ended happily this was at a time when the entertainments of the stage were committed to the care of the magistrates when the prizes contended for were given by the state when of consequence the emulation among writers was ardent and when learning was at the highest pitch of glory in that renowned commonwealth  it cannot be supposed that the athenians in this their highest age of taste and politeness were less humane less tenderhearted than we of the present but they were not afraid of being moved nor ashamed of showing themselves to be so at the distresses they saw well painted and represented in short they were of the opinion with the wisest of men that it was better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of mirth and had fortitude enough to trust themselves with their own generous grief because they found their hearts mended by it  thus also horace and the politest romans in the augustan age wished to be affected ac ne forte putes me quae facere ipse recusm cum recte tractant alii laudare malign ille per extentum funem mibi posse videtur ire poeta meum qui pectus inaniter angit irritat mulcet falsis terroribus implet ut magus and modo me thebis modo ponit atheni thus englished by mr pope yet lest you think i railly more than teach or praise malignly arts i cannot reach let me for once presume tinstruct the times to know the poet from the man of rhymes it is he who gives my breast a thousand pains can make me feel each passion that he feigns enrage  compose  with more than magic art with pity and with terror tear my heart and snatch me over the earth or through the air to thebes to athens when he will and where      terror and commiseration leave a pleasing anguish in the mind and fix the audience in such a serious composure of thought as is much more lasting and delightful than any little transient starts of joy and satisfaction  accordingly we find that more of our english tragedies have succeeded in which the favorites of the audience sink under their calamities than those in which they recover themselves out of them  the best plays of this kind are the orphan venice preserved alexander the great theodosius all for love oedipus oroonoko othello etc  king lear is an admirable tragedy of the same kind as shakespeare wrote it but as it is reformed according to the chimerical notion of poetical  or as we may say antiprovidential justice in my humble opinion it has lost half its beauty yet so different seems to be the modern taste from that of the ancients that the altered king lear of mr tate is constantly acted on the english stage in preference to the original though written by shakespeare himself  whether this strange preference be owing to the false delicacy or affected tenderness of the players or to that of the audience has not for many years been tried and perhaps the former have not the courage to try the public taste upon it and yet if it were ever to be tried now seems to be the time when an actor and a manager in the same person is in being who deservedly engages the public savor in all he undertakes and who owes so much and is gratefully sensible that he does to that great master of the human passions   at the same time i must allow that there are very noble tragedies which have been framed upon the other plan and have ended happily as indeed most of the good tragedies which have been written since the starting of the abovementioned criticism have taken this turn as the mourning bride tamerlane yet in tamerlane two of the most amiable characters moneses and aspasia suffer death  ulysses phaedra and hippolytus with most of mr drydens i must also allow that many of shakespeares and several of the celebrated tragedies of antiquity are cast in the same form i do not therefore dispute against this way of writing tragedies but against the criticism that would establish this as the only method and by that means would very much cramp the english tragedy and perhaps give a wrong bent to the genius of our writers  thus far mr addison  our fair readers are also desired to attend to what a celebrated critic rpin on aristotles poetics of a neighboring nation says on the nature and design of tragedy from the rules laid down by the same great ancient  tragedy says he makes man modest by representing the great masters of the earth humbled and it makes him tender and merciful by showing him the strange accidents of life and the unforeseen disgraces to which the most important persons are subject  but because man is naturally timorous and compassionate he may fall into other extremes too much fear may shake his constancy of mind and too much compassion may enfeeble his equity it is the business of tragedy to regulate these two weaknesses it prepares and arms him against disgraces by showing them so frequent in the most considerable persons and he will cease to fear extraordinary accidents when he sees them happen to the highest and still more efficacious we may add the example will be when he sees them happen to the best part of mankind  but as the end of tragedy is to teach men nor to fear too weakly common misfortunes it proposes also to teach them to spare their compassion for objects that deserve it for there is an injustice in being moved at the afflictions of those who deserve to be miserable we may see without pity clytemnestra slain by her son orestes in aeschylus because she had murdered agamemnon her husband and we cannot see hippolytus die by the plot of his stepmother phaedra in euripides without compassion because he died not but for being chaste and virtuous  these are the great authorities so favorable to the stories that end unhappily yet the writer of the history of clarissa is humbly of opinion that he might have been excused referring to them for the vindication of his catastrophe even by those who are advocates for the contrary opinion since the notion of poetical justice founded on the modern rules has hardly ever been more strictly observed in works of this nature than in the present performance if any regard at all be to be paid to the christian system on which it is formed  for is not mr lovelace who could persevere in his villainous views against the strongest and most frequent convictions and remorses that ever were sent to awaken and reclaim a wicked man  is not this great this wilful transgressor condignly punished and his punishment brought on through the intelligence of the very joseph leman whom he had corrupted see vol vii p           and by means of the very women whom he had debauched idem p  0   is not mr belton who has an uncles hastened death to answer for idem p     are not the whole harlowe family  is not the vile tomlinson  are not the infamous sinclair and her wretched partners  and even the wicked servants who with their eyes open contributed their parts to the carrying on of the vile schemes of their respective principals  are they not all likewise exemplarily punished  on the other hand is not miss how for her noble friendship to the exalted lady in her calamities  is not mr hickman for his unexceptionable morals and integrity of life  is not the repentant and not ungenerous belford  is not the worthy norton  made signally happy  and who that are in earnest in their profession of christianity but will rather envy than regret the triumphant death of clarissa whose piety from her early childhood whose diffusive charity whose steady virtue whose christian humility whose forgiving spirit whose meekness whose resignation heaven only could reward it may not be amiss to remind the reader that so early in the work as vol ii p             the dispensations of providence in her distresses are justified by herself and thus she ends her reflections  i shall not live always  may my closing scene be happy  she had her wish it was happy     the length of the piece has been objected to by some who had seen only the first four volumes and who perhaps looked upon it as a mere novel or romance and yet of these there are not wanting works of equal length  they were of opinion that the story moved too slowly particuarly in the first and second volumes which are chiefly taken up with the altercations between clarissa and the several persons of her family  but is it not true that those altercations are the foundation of the whole and therefore a necessary part of the work the letters and conversations where the story makes the slowest progress are presumed to be characteristic they give occasion likewise to suggest many interesting personalities in which a good deal of the instruction essential to a work of this nature is conveyed and it will moreover be remembered that the author at his first setting out apprised the reader that the story was to be looked upon as the vehicle only to the instruction  to all which we may add that there was frequently a necessity to be very circumstantial and minute in order to preserve and mainain that air of probability which is necessary to be maintained in a story designed to represent real life and which is rendered extremely busy and active by the plots and contrivances formed and carried on by one of the principal characters  in a word if in the history before us it shall be found that the spirit is duly diffused throughout that the characters are various and natural well distinguished and uniformly supported and maintained if there be a variety of incidents sufficient to excite attention and those so conducted as to keep the reader always awake the length then must add proportionably to the pleasure that every person of taste receives from a welldrawn picture of nature but where the contrary of all these qualities shock the understanding the extravagant performance will be judged tedious though no longer than a fairytale
