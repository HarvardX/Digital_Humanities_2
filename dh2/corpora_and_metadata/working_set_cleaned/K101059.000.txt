night but i would teach him to sleep in two beds a pretty fashon truly i would tell him i was afraid of ghosts and so i married because i could not nor i would not lie alone so let him remember that   lady a why were you so long in bringing the message back   mrs sar why that is what i have to tell your ladyship if there is not bad doings say i am no witch   lady a what do you mean   mrs sar your ladyship must not be angry but you know i cannot help having a sharp eye and a quick ear of my own   lady a what have you been doing now   mrs sar so i saw my master go into the stewards room   lady a endeavoring to suppress her curiosity pshaw folly what of that   mrs sar so i had all my seven senses and my eyeteeth about me    lady a pray have done   mrs sar so i clapped my ear to the keyhole and then i heard a  whuz buz    lady a this was very improper   mrs sar so i could only catch up a word here and there and the first was summut about  of a child   lady a a child   mrs sar and a mother my lady though for the matter of that where there is a child ones own nataral penetrality will tell one there must be a mother   lady a of what weakness am i guilty   mrs sar and i thought i catched the sound of mr item of a fathering the child and i am posituve he said it wuz against his conscience   lady a who said so   mrs sar mr item my lady and so a little bit after my master called somebody a poor injurious girl and a prodigality of wit and beauty so then i heard somebodys foot on the stairs and i wuz fain to scamper   lady a i know not why i listen to this indecent prattle my overanxious curiosity betrays me and you are much too forward to profit by my weakness   mrs sar because you know my lady i love you in my heart and it is all for your own good   lady a a child an injured girl yet why do i feel agitation his infidelities have been too open for me to be ignorant of them and who has been to blame he or i oh doubtful and difficult question   mrs sar but i will come at the truth i will warrant me in all its particlers   lady a suffering perhaps under the consciousness of error which the sight of me might increase he flies from additional anguish oh that i had the power to sooth and reconcile him to himself why will he not receive consolation from me   mrs sar i will rummage about   lady a if i am unhappy how must i be certain that it is not my own fault where there is unhappiness neither party can be wholly blameless   mrs sar he ought to love and adore such a lady and clothe her in satin and gold   lady a shall i tyrannize over the affections that i cannot win if i want the power to please let me correct my own defects and not accuse my husband of insensibility oh nothing is so killing to a husbands love as a discontented irksome wiling wife let me be any thing but that   mrs sar he is a barbarian turk and so i as good as told him   lady a what is the test of an affectionate wife it is that being wronged her love remains undiminished having cause of complaint she scorns to complain convinced that any misery is more welcome than the possibility of becoming the torment of her bosoms lord oh let me rather suffer every possible evil than endure my husbands hate   mrs sar if any fellow was to use me so i know what i would do   lady a yet have i not lost his love dreadful doubt my family advise a separation and if this fatal loss be real how is it to be avoided yet i will not sightly yield let me hope my efforts will not all be ineffectual would this agonizing contest were ended   exit mrs sar she may say what she will but i know very well she is the most miserableest lady alive and i could tear his eyes out husband indeed and so because i listened to the fellows love and nonsensestuff and took pity on him when he was going to hang or

be overtaken breakfast on beef and sup on eggs and bacon in those strange days i cannot say what might happen virtue might then be thought the womans weapon but daughters now like me whatever we feign
