dodington esquire sir nothing can more strongly second the pleasure i feel from the universalapplause which crowns this orphan play than this other which i take in presuming to shelter it under your name i bear so dear an affection to the writings and memory of shakespeare that as it is my good fortune to retrieve this remnant of his pen from obscurity so it is my greatest ambition that this piece should be received into the protection of such a patron and i hope future times when they mean to pay shakespeare the best compliment will remember to say mr dodington was that friend to his remains which his own southampton was to his living merit  it is from the fine discernment of our patrons that we can generally best promise ourselves the good opinion of the public you are not only a distinguished friend of the muses but most intimately allied to them and from hence it is i flatter myself that if you shall think fit to pronounce this piece genuine it will silence the censures of those unbelievers who think it impossible a manuscript of shakespeare could so long have lain dormant and who are blindly paying me a greater compliment than either they design or i can merit while they cannot but confess themselves pleased yet would fain insinuate that they are imposed upon i should esteem it some sort of virtue were i able to commit so agreeable a cheat  but pardon me sir for a digression that perverts the very rule of dedications i own i have my reasons for it as sir your known integrity and honor engages the warmest wishes of all good men for your prosperity so your known distinction in polite letters and your generous encouragement of those who pretend to them obliges us to consider your advancement as our own personal interest and as a good omen at least if not as the surest means of the future flourishing condition of those humane arts amongst us which we profess and which you adorn but neither your modesty nor my inability will suffer me to enter upon that subject permit me therefore sir to convert panegyric into a most ardent wish that you would look with a tender eye on this dear relick and that you would believe me with the most unfeigned zeal and respect  sir your most devoted and obedient humble servant lew theobald great russellstree   st december      preface of the editor the success which this play has met with from the town in the representation to say nothing of the reception it found from those great judges to whom i have had the honor of communicating it in manuscript has almost made the purpose of a preface unnecessary and therefore what i have to say is designed rather to wipe out a flying objection to two than to labor at proving it the production of shakespeare it has been alleged as incredible that such a curiosity should be stifled and lost to the world for above a century to this my answer is short that though it never till now made its appearance on the stage yet one of the manuscript copies which i have is of above sixty years standing in the handwriting of mr downs the famous old prompter and as i am credibly informed was early in the possession of the celebrated mr betterton and by him designed to have been ushered into the world what accident prevented this purpose of his i do not pretend to know or through what hands it had successively passed before that period of time there is a tradition which i have from the noble person who supplied me with one of my copies that it was given by our author as a present of value to a natural daughter of his for whose sake he wrote it in the time of his retirement from the stage two other copies i have one of which i was glad to purchase at a very good rate which may not perhaps be quite so old as the former but one of them is much more perfect and has fewer flaws and interruptions in the sense  another objection has been started which would carry much more weight with it were it fact that the tale of this play being built upon a novel in don quixot chronology is against us and shakespeare could not be the author but it happens that don quixot was published in the year      and shakespeare did not dye till april      a sufficient interval of time for all that we want granted  others again to depreciate the affair as they thought have been pleased to urge that though the play may have some resemblances of shakespeare yet the coloring diction and characters come nearer to the style and manner of fletcher this i think is far from deserving any answer i submit it to the determination of better judgments though my partiality for shakespeare makes me wish that every thing which is good or pleasing in our tongue had been owing to his pen  as to the performance of the respective actors concerned in this play my applauding it here would be altogether superfluous the public has distinguished and given them a praise much beyond any that can flow from my pen but i have some particular acknowledgments to make to the managers of this company for which i am glad to embrace so fair an opportunity  i came to them at this juncture as an editor not an author and have met with so much candor and handsome treatment from them that i am willing to believe the complaint which has so commonly obtained of their disregard and ill behavior to writers has been more severely urged than it is justly grounded they must certainly be too good judges of their own interest not to know that a theater cannot always subsist on old stock but that the town requires novelty at their hands on the other hand they must be so far judges of their own art and profession as to know that all the compositions which are offered them would never go down with audiences of so nice and delicate a taste as in this age frequent the theaters it would be very hard upon such a community where so many interests are concerned and so much merit in their business allowed if they had not a privilege of refusing some crude pieces too imperfect for the entertainment of the public i would not be thought to infer that they have never discouraged what they might perhaps afterward wish they had received they do not i believe set up for such a constant infallibility but if we do but fairly consider out of above four thousand plays extant how small a number will now stand the test if we do but consider too how often a raw performance has been extolled by the partiality of private friendship and what a clamor of injury has been raised from that quarter upon such performance meeting a repulse we may pretty easily account for the grounds upon which they proceeded in discountenancing some plays and the harsh things that are thrown out upon their giving a repulse to others  but i should beg pardon for interfering in this question in which i am properly neither party nor judge i am only throwing out a private opinion without interest or prejudice and if i am right in the notion valeat quantum valere potest  prologue written by philip

twenty men of more delicate choice i speak not this altogether to unbend your affections to him but the meaning of what i say is that you set such price upon yourself to him as many and much his
