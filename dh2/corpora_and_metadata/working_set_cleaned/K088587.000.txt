the copernicus explained or a brief account of the nature and use of an universal astronomical instrument for the calculation and exhibition of new and full moons and of eclipses both solar and lunar with the places heliocentrical and geocentrical of all the planets primary and secondary etc  by william whiston ma sometime professor of the mathematics in the university of cambridge  london printed for the author in crossstreet hattongarden       to the right honorable general stanhope one of his majestys principal secretaries of state a great patron and encourager of learning and of undertakings for the public good particularly those of the author for the improvement of astronomy and geography this small manual is with all due submission and gratitude dedicated by the author  the copernicus explained this astronomical instrument which is made agreeably to the copernican system and therefore by me named the copernicus consists besides the immovable circle on the utside and the small moveable central circle within of ten intermediate concentrical annuli or broad circular rings fitted to revolve one within another but so as to be capable of being fixed by small pins in any situation whatsoever six of the circles toward the center are so contrived that they may be taken away upon occasion and yet when they are put in they are fast connected to the frame as well as the other and revolve as freely as they do there is also a terrestrial globe of nine inches diameter placed under the inner circles with its hour circle turning along with it in its diurnal motion and when those circles are removed the globe may be so elevated and fixed at any height and so regulated by screws as to be ready for the exhibition of those eclipses which the six outward circles assist us to discover to which last does also belong a rule with a groove containing an angle of      for the moons path in eclipses there is also a round plate of glass with    concentrical circles therein for the    digits in solar eclipses whose diameter bears the same proportion to the diameter of the globe that the apparent semidiameters of the sun and moon put together do really bear to the disk of the earth in those eclipses there is besides a map of the moon with   concentrical circles for the    digits in lunar eclipses whose diameter bears the same proportion to that of the globe which the real diameter of the moon bears to the real diameter of the earth there is also a dark circle representing that section of the earths conical shadow along which the moon passes in its own eclipses and is so much less in proportion than the diameter of the globe as is that of the real corresponding circle to that of the earth it self there are also two threads with their plummets fixed to the center of the instrument of frequent use in its operations  the nature of the several parts of this instrument is as follows  the outmost or largest circle which is immovable is the ecliptic with its known signs aries taurus gemini etc this circle is divided equally from the beginning of aries or the vernal equinox into   0 degrees or    signs of  0 degrees apiece and is the measure and standard of the whole instrument every planet or point or line being still fixed by knowing its place along this circle either by the signs with the particular degrees and minutes or by the bare number of degrees and minutes from the equinox  the second circle is for the months and days of the year which days being in a manner equal this circle is equally divided into     parts which is the number of days in a julian common year nor will the leap year cause any great trouble though it has one more day in february since it is already allowed for in those astronomical tables whence all our numbers have been transferred into this instrument and any day therein after february is counted one farther than in the common year but here several things are to be noted viz   that i suppose every body can readily tell in any month of any year how remote every day of it is from the beginning of that year and this both in common and in leap years and so can readily change one way of computation for the other as occasion shall require thus we know by the old memorial verses that thirty days has september april june and november february eight and twenty alone and all the rest have thirty and one accordingly we can tell that april    d the day of the next total eclipse of the sun in this common year is the     th day of the year as also that sept    th or michaelmas day next year which is leap year will be the     d day of that year and so in all other cases whatsoever   that in case we fix any one day of the circle rightly to that place in the ecliptic whereto it belongs every other day of the same circle will thereby be rightly placed also   that i have therefore set down upon this circle the true place of the vernal equinox for the past ages as well as for the present so that it is but bringing either the particular year of our lord it self since or any one which proceeded it before christ to the beginning of aries or the vernal equinox and the whole circle of months is rightly placed with respect to the ecliptic for that time   that yet if we desire to be exact we must in this case consider further what year it is from leap year that we are concerned with for if it be the first after it which the first of each century and score since and the fourth of each century and score before christ always are the position of the numbers is right of it self without any more consideration but if it be the second after it the circle is to be turned one third of a centurys motion or one quarter of a day forward if it be the third two thirds of a centurys motion or one half of a day forwards in order to its right position while if it be it self leap year the circle must be turned one quarter of a day backward in order to such a position   our astronomical centuries years months and days do ever commence from the noon foregoing so our  0 th of march in this instrument begins at noon march   th and ends at noon march  o th and is indeed reckoned by    hours entire from the one noon to the other thus because this is the third after leap year i turn this second circle onward half a day and find that the vernal equinox happens this year march   d    h 0 m or as we commonly reckon on march  0 about six of the clock in the morning and that by consequence april    d   h    m the time of the middle of the next great eclipse of the sun corresponds ponds to the    of taurus in the outmost circle of the ecliptic  the third circle is the annual elliptick orbit of the earth here rightly represented by a circle with the unequal divisions of the ellipsis corresponding to the inequality of the earths motion this circle is fixed to the due place of the ecliptic by a small arch of the place of the perihelion as the days of the month were fixed to the equinox  the fourth circle contains the menstrual orbit of the moon with its periodical revolution about the earth both in   0 parts and in    days   hours and    minutes the actual divisions are here made for the mean state of the orbit which is variable but points are set at every five degrees to be thence supplied at every degree and proportionably in other cases according to its several degrees of eccentricity upon the inner large part of this circle there is also a spiral line with the progressive mean motion of the moons apogee for a century with every one of the months and almost days motion also that so when we have fixed by a proper table the mean place of the apogee for the beginning of any century we may thereby find its mean place to any time in the same century also without any other assistance whatsoever  the fifth circle contains along its spiral the mean motion of the moons nodes and particularly of the ascending node whence the numbers begin for an entire century with its months and days that so when we have by a proper table once fixed that node right for the beginning of any century we may as before be hereby enabled to place it right at any time in the same century without any other assistance only we must here note that the motion of the nodes being retrograde the numbers on this circle are counted backward  the sixth circle contains in a spiral the mean motion of the moon for the several days in the year numbered at length and the moons mean motion for the distinct years of the century are put at the utmost edge of the circle for our future benefit in this case also  thus far i have described the largest and principal circles intended for the discovery of the new and full moons and especially for the calculation of eclipses both solar and lunar  as to those six lesser circles that follow to the center they need little explication being all of a piece and are indeed nothing but broad annuli or rings to contain the orbits of such of the primary planets as could be put upon them with the orbits of all the secondary planets both those about saturn and those about jupiter in their due proportions that so when the sun is supposed in the center the orbits of the primary planets may alone be made use of when saturn is there his and when jupiter is there his satellites may alone be contemplated only we must here note several things for the better understanding of this part of our instrument   because saturn and jupiters orbits were too large for these inner circles they are represented by small spheres on the second and sixth larger circles before described because saturns motion is only about    degrees in a year or one in a month as also jupiters only about  0 degrees in a year or   in a month there is no great necessity for these distinct orbits with their motions to be engraved upon these circles especially because of the confusion it would introduce there   these orbits are here circular or accommodated to the planets mean distances from the sun but so that the present places of the aphelia and perihelia are noted on the utmost edge of the whole instrument and the quantity of their several constant eccentricities are also noted where their orbits begin that so the little sphere representing each planet may be ever placed nearer to or farther from the center as its real distance shall require only the eccentricities of the earths and venuss orbits are too small to be here sensible   these orbits are all represented in the plain of the ecliptic as it was here necessary to do but then the present places of the ascending and descending nodes being set down at the utmost edge each planets inclination to the ecliptic and latitude on the earth may be nearly discovered for this age at the same time i mean this in case we observe the quantity of the several angles of inclination which those orbits make with the ecliptic which are as follows saturn 0   0 jupiter 0   0 mars 0     venus 0     mercury 0       the seeming motions of these aphelia and nodes in the ecliptic is only a degree in    years it is therefore but allowing to these aphelia and nodes that motion of one degree in    years forwards and their places in the ecliptic are known for all ages   when saturns secondary planets are concerned the sun is to be supposed in its proper place of the ecliptic at the distance of     feet from the center of the instrument in which case these orbits are in true proportions with regard thereto and when jupiters are concerned it is to be supposed in the like place at    feet distance for the same purposes at which points if a lamp be placed and this instrument be moved in a kind of circular orbit about it we shall have a just and natural representation of the revolution of these primary planets with their satellites about the sun both in their annual and menstrual motions  i come now to show the particular uses of this instrument and shall do it in the solution of the following problems  prob i lemma to rectify the first moveable circle or that of the months and days to any moment of time past present or to come  turn this circle till the given year exactly corresponds to the beginning of aries in the outmost circle but so that for the second year after leap year you turn it farther one third for the third year two thirds of a centurys motion forwards and for the leap year one third backwards beyond that beginning of aries  thus if you would rectify this circle to the time of the great solar eclipse this year which is the third after bissextile you would put a point that is a little beyond   0  two thirds of a centurys motion backwarder than the beginning of aries by which means this circle will be entirely rectified to the time  prob ii lemma to rectify the second moveable circle or that of the earths annual orbit with its true anomaly on it to any time past present or to come  this is readily done by bringing its beginning to the time assigned in the arch and is so easy and obvious as to need no farther explication only it must be noted that this place of the perihelion with regard to the earth is the place of the aphelion with regard to the sun or the place where when the sun is the earth is most remote from it whence every anomaly is to be begun  thus if you add to   s   d  0 m the place of the perihelion at the commencement of this century or   0  those    m which is its motion in    years you will have   s   d    m for the place of the perihelion at that time to which if you bring the beginning of this circle you will have this whole circle with the earths true anomaly or place thereon exactly rectified to the time of that eclipse  prob iii lemma to rectify the third moveable circle which is that of the moons apogee with its true anomaly or place upon it to any time past present or to come  look in the proper table for the place of the moons apogee at the beginning of the century assigned and accordingly fix it count along the spiral that is upon it the years months and part of a month of that century and lay one of your threads over that place then remove the apogee to that thread this will exactly show its mean place after this observe how far the sun is from the apogee or perigee and whether it have lately gone past or is going toward one of em and turn the circle accordingly forward or backward one third of that distance for in the former case that quantity is to be subtracted from in the other added to the former place in order to have the true place i mean this only as we reckon    d for the limit and remember that the fame equation is to be subtracted or added for any number that is equally distant from that limit as for  0 and  0  0 and  0  0 and  0  0 and  0 and so in all other cases whatsoever only observe that if nearest the limit you take considerably less and remotest from it a very little more than one third you will still more exactly rectify this circle  thus if you look for ad   0  you will find the mean place of the apogee then to be   s      and if you turn the circle forward to apr    you will have the mean place of the apogee then and if by turning still forwards you add the third part of the suns distance or   to the former place you will have the true place of the apogee at that time viz   s    d    m  prob iv lemma to rectify the fourth moveable circle which is that of the moons nodes for any time past present or to come  look in the proper table for the place of the ascending node at the beginning of the assigned century and there fix it count along the spiral thereon backwards the years months and part of a month of that century and lay your thread over that place then bring the beginning of the spiral or ascending node to the thread which will give you the mean place of that node then turn the circle forward a  0th part of the suns distance from either node if it have lately passed it or a  0th part backward if it have not yet passed it this will fix the nodes to their true places at that time i mean this also as we reckon here    the limit and remember that the equation is to be subtracted or added for any number that is equally distant from that limit only observe that if nearest that limit you take considerably less and remotest from it somewhat more than   0 you will still more exactly rectify this circle  thus if you look for ad   0  you will find the mean place of the ascending node to be  s       then turn the circle backward to apr   d and you will have the mean place of that node there and if by turning still backward you substract a  0 th part of the suns distance or    you will have the true place of the node at that time viz   s    d   m  prob v lemma to rectify the fifth moveable circle which is that of the mean motion of the moon it self for every day of a julian year for any time past present or to come  look in the proper table for the mean place of the moon at the beginning of the century assigned and there fix the circle then look along the outward edge of this circle for the complete number of years of that century and laying your thread exactly over that year remove the circle so far then count along the spiral upon it the number of days and parts till the time assigned over which laying your thread remove the circle so far this rectifies the circle of the moons mean motion for that time  thus if you look for ad   0  you will find the mean place of the moon to be  0 s   d  0 m whither bring the beginning of the circle accordingly lay then a thread over the number    and bring the former place thereto then is this circle entirely rectified at that time  note that the moons motion in hours is not distinguished here on the spiral because it may be better estimated on the ecliptic it self  note farther that when you go upwards as in the years before the christian era contrary to what is usual you add the mean motions of the node and substract those of the apogee and moon it self to and from the epoch to prepare the numbers for the instrument but then if you thereupon choose proper numbers for the beginning of each century before as well as after the beginning of the christian era you will have no farther difficulties in the use of the instrument it self thus if for the beginning of the     st year before christ you take  00 years backwards for the epoch of the century and    complete years after it for the beginning of the year it self you will have no farther difficulty in the use of this instrument in that case  note also that the three last of these circles will as well serve for a century backwards as forwards from any root or epoch i mean if the known number of degrees for any number of years backwards in the century be taken on the side of the epoch contrary to that it belonged to if the years had been forwards as every one will easily find upon the least consideration and trial  note farther that to make this instrument as ready as possible for the present century the epochae of the places of the moons apogee and ascending node and of the moon it self at the beginning of it are noted by the following marks upon the outmost circle with points at the opposite places at the same time and the like marks may be made for any other century as occassion shall require  note lastly that our time is here always the mean or equal time which the more curious may correct by the known equationtable but since this last is little more than a quarter of an hour different from the other at the utmost and almost always much less it is rather too nice to deserve much consideration in such an instrument  prob vi to find the sun s true place in the ecliptic for any time past present or to come  rectify the two outmost moveable circles look what sign degree and part of a degree corresponds to the time assigned lay your two threads over the first of aries and over that place and count the same number along the earths orbit which you find belongs to that number on the ecliptic this corresponds to the true place of the sun in the ecliptic for that time  thus if you look for    h    m upon the ecliptic on apr    d you will find over against it about    d  0 m this reckoned along the earths orbit reaches from   0 d  0 m which is over against the equinox to  0  d    m over against which last number stands    d    m of taurus which is therefore the suns true place in the ecliptic at that time  prob vii to find the moon s true place in the ecliptic for any time past present or to come  rectify the third and fifth moveable circles lay one of your threads over the moons mean place and the other over the moons apogee count along the moons orbit the same number which is intercepted between the threads on the ecliptic a thread laid over that place corresponds with the moons true place in the ecliptic  thus if you look for     d    h    m on the fifth moveable circle you will find it is distant from the moons apogee along the ecliptic about     d  0 m which number taken in the moons own orbit on the third moveable circle corresponds to    d    m of taurus the true place of the moon at that time but it is here to be noted that when the moons apogee is either in conjunction or opposition with the sun the eccentricity of the moons orbit is the greatest and the points or marks nearest the apogee are the true ones which is nearly the case in this example and accordingly made use of in it and when it is in the octants that excentricity is in a mean and the lines and numbers themselves are right but when it is in the quadratures the points or marks nearest the perigee are the true places and so in all other intermediate positions whatsoever which circumstances being considered and proportionably allowed for in all cases this problem will be exactly solved  prob viii to find the true conjunctions and oppositions of the sun and moon with the new and full moons for any time past present or to come  rectify the first second third and fifth moveable circles as before directed after that find the true places of the sun and moon for the time given as before if they are either the same or directly opposite you have the time already if not carry your threads that lie over the two places respectively along their own orbits forwards or backwards so that you carry the moons    degrees and a quarter to the suns one or a days motion of one to a days motion of the other and so all along proportionally ie somewhat above half a degree to an hour till the moons place overtakes the suns for that place where they are coincident gives you the conjunction or opposition with the new or full moon  thus if you look for the suns place at noon apr    which is astronomically    complete days in that month you will find it about    d  0 m in taurus and if in like manner you look for the true place of the moon at the same time you will find it about    d  0 m in aries whence if you carry both the threads so far as corresponds to    h    m you will perceive that the moon does there overtake the sun which shows that at that very time or apr    d about a quarter before ten in the morning the sun and moon will be in conjunction and it will be new moon but observe that if you do not at all know beforehand at what time of any month the conjunction or opposition will fall you must find the distinct places of the sun and moon at the beginning of the month and so go downwards as to the days as well as hours and parts of an hour till they are coincident as has been just now directed and you will thereby find the day hour and part of an hour of the next conjunction or opposition you may also if you please find the true places of the sun and moon to that last time over again as before directed especially where there is a design to examine an eclipse at the same time for the greater accuracy but note that if you only intend to find the time of conjunction or opposition in order to an eclipse you need not examine any month or days but only such as are near one of the nodes or within the limits of such eclipses which limits will be stated under the next problem  prob ix to find whether there will be either a solar or a lunar eclipse at any conjunction or opposition for any time past present or to come  all the circles first rectified and the time and place of the true conjunction or opposition found as already directed lay one of your threads over that place and the other over the nearest node if that distance be less than    degrees and an half and it be a conjunction there will be an eclipse of the sun somewhere if it be greater there will be no eclipse if that distance be less than  0 d    m and it be an opposition there will be an eclipse of the moon if it be more there will be no eclipse  thus it happening this year      that the sun and moon are in conjunction about a quarter before ten of clock on the next    d of april and that at   d distance from the descending node it is evident there will at that time happen an eclipse of the sun and there happening an opposition october   st about a quarter past   in the morning within   degrees and an half of the same node it is evident there will then be an eclipse of the moon also  note here that several other circumstances of eclipses may be discovered by the solution of this problem thus because the conjunction for the next solar eclipse happens before the moon has reached its descending node it is plain it must belong to the northern parts more than to the southern because it is in a sort of a mean distance between that descending node and the limit it will be a great and total eclipse and the greatest in the northern temperate zone because it happens near the aphelion of the earth and near the perigee of the moon when the apparent diameters of the sun is smaller and of the moon greater than usual it will not be annular but total and that for some few minutes also i mean along that line which the center of the penumbra describes upon the earth and because the solar eclipse this year happens here in the daytime and the lunar in the night they will both be visible i mean in case the cloud cause no interruption so that these circumstances do not need particular problems for their solution  prob x to rectify the globe and its hour circle for the exhibition of eclipses  bring london to the graduated side of the meridian and turn the hour circle till    of clock is pointed to by its index then turn the globe with its hour circle so far forward or backward as the right ascension belonging to the distance of the place of the conjunction from the beginning of cancer or capricorn does require reckoning still    degrees to an hour and   degree to   minutes hold the globe in that position and bring    in the hour circle to the graduated edge of the meridian again and there fix it fast to move with the globe all along afterward by this means the index will tell you the true time as it is counted at the meridian of london during the whole time of the eclipse and note that the distance from cancer or capricorn it self if increased or diminished one    th part or one degree in    according as the position of the sun and moon shall require will nearly give the right ascension reckoning the limit    as under the   d and   th problems and increasing or diminishing the equation as there also but note that this distance it self will never err   d  0 m or  0 minutes in time from the truth nay will usually be much nearer the same even without any allowance for that correction at all  thus if you bring london to the graduated edge of the meridian and the hour of    to the index and remove the globe with its hour circle backward from east to west  0 degrees ie   hours  0 minutes and then turn the hour of    to the index again and there fix it you will have the globe with its hour circle rectified for the time of the next total eclipse of the sun and every part of it will agree to that hour which the index shows on the hour circle  prob xi in any solar eclipse considered in general and with regard to the whole enlightened disk of the earth to find when and where it will begin and end whether it will be any where total or every where only partial and if partial how many digits will any where be eclipsed with the other general circumstances of the same  take the eleventh part of the distance of the place of the conjunction from the nearest node for the latitude of the moon at the middle of the eclipse remove the inner circles and elevate the globe that stands beneath them north or south as the case shall require by the side screws place it in the center or axis of your circles lay your rule with its glass of    circles then set over its middle point and its lamp or candle so that the node may lie in a position suitable to that of the moons orbit at that time which is easily known from the observations under the last problem and so that the middle point or that under the center of the glass may be directed to the place of the conjunction in the ecliptic turn your globe rectified as before till the index points to the time of the true conjunction already found that is very nearly the time of the middle of the general eclipse then turn your globe and draw your glass backwards any number of minutes equally so that an hour in the hour circle may ever correspond to an hour in the path of the moon and till the shadow of the edge of the circular glass begins to touch the nearest place of the globe for that is the time and that the place when and where the general eclipse begins carry both motions forward and observe whether the central bright spot does any where touch the globe if it does not the eclipse is no where total and the circles cast on the globe will show the number of digits eclipsed if it does touch note the time and place when and where it does so for that is the time and that the place of the entry of the central shadow or total darkness upon the earth do the like as to the central spot or other edge of the circles going off the globe afterward this will in like manner show the time and place of the end of total darkness and of the whole eclipse respectively and by this means all the other circumstances of the general eclipse of the sun may be most easily and readily discovered and exhibited to the eye with the greatest pleasure and satisfaction  thus in the next great solar eclipse considered in general you will find that it will begin in    d of north latitude and about  0 d westward from london and this about    m after   and will end in the latitude of  0 about    d to the east of london and this at   m after    that it will be a total eclipse for about   0 miles in breadth and that the center of the penumbra will go near the lizard point bristol stamford and boston and so by stockholm and archangel into russia siberia and east tartary  note that if instead of a lamp or candle you make use of the sun it self either by placing the instrument so that the rays may themselves fall parallel to the axis of the glass or that they may be inclined to it by a reflecting speculum or lookingglass it will be better  note also that if with a pencil put through the axis of the glass you draw a line or with a sharp pin or needle therein make points upon the globe as you move it and the glass together you will have the pathway of the center transferred upon the globe and may thereby exactly find all the places where the eclipse will be total or annular or central and may easily see from the like lines drawn or marks made at any number of digits distance how broad the path of any kind of partial eclipse will be also over the whole earth which how entertaining and useful a sight it may be to all the curious i leave to their own trial and determination  note also that the problem thus solved includes one main part of that famous discovery of sir christopher wren s dr halley s and mr flamsteed s published by the last and named the construction of solar eclipses without the tedious method of calculation only what they are forced to do with no small pains and in no short timegeometrically is here done with great ease and quickness and an exact imitation of the originals in nature and so with a great deal more pleasure and satisfaction  prob xii in a solar eclipse considered in particular and with regard to any single place to find when it did or will begin and end whether it was or will be there total or partial and if partial how many digits were or will be eclipsed with the other particular circumstances of the same in that place  this problem is in effect already solved under the former problem it being as easy to observe when the shadow of the edge of the glasscircle first touches or last leaves any place upon the globe which is the beginning and ending of the eclipse there when the bright erect line crosses it which is its middle there how near any circle of digits comes to it then which is the number of digits eclipsed there with other the like circumstances of that place as it was before to observe the same for the eclipse in general nor is there any occasion for farther directions  thus the next great solar eclipse will begin here at london april    about   h   m in the morning its middle will be about   h    m its end about  0 h    m and it will be entirely or very nearly total though if it be total here it cannot be so for much more than a single minute of time as dr halley s particular map fitted for this eclipse will easily show  note that if in the solution of this and the foregoing problem you add for east and substract for west longitude resolved into time you will have the moment of each of these appearances at any other place also  note also that the problem thus solved includes the remaining part of the forementioned famous discovery of the construction of solar eclipses and that not only as done with the like greater ease quickness and pleasure but principally that with the same operation and without any new trouble it discovers every thing for all particular places at once which neither that method of construction nor any other method of astronomy whatsoever could pretend to before and yet all this is here done only by such a close imitation of nature as is in it self most easy and obvious and what one would now imagine should have come into the thoughts of astronomers first of all before any other contrivance whatsoever  prob xiii in a lunar eclipse to find whether it was or will be total or partial and if partial how many digits were or will be eclipsed which of the lunar spots and mountains were or will be obscured and when they did or will begin or end to be so how long the entire or central or partial eclipse will last with all the other circumstances of the same  take away the globe and set the dark circle in its place take also the glass of    circles away and put the map of the moon with its   circles in its place then do in all things with this map of the moon as you were ordered to do with the glasscircle circle before by this means you will have all those phenomenon of lunar eclipses solved with greater ease and the like pleasure which were before represented in the solar nor is there any new difficulty in the application only note that this map of the moon being too small to have the names of its several seas and lands engraven on it it will be convenient to have withal a larger map of the moon with those names as an explication of the other which accordingly is here provided and placed on one side of the dark circle which is used with it and note farther that those who have a mind to be here very particular and exact may use the larger map of the moon instead of the other in case they join with it a dark circle of    inches and a quarter in diameter for the same proportion which the diameter of our smaller moon of two inches and an half bears to that of our dark circle of six inches and two fifths does the diameter of that circle or of the larger moon bear to that of a circle of sixteen inches and two fifths diameter whence its plain the larger moon and that largest circle will more exactly exhibit such lunar eclipses than the other though i believe there will be but few who will not be satisfied with the smaller dark circle so i have not provided the larger which yet mr senex or mr hudson the exact engraver and framer of this instrument will readily procure for any that desire them but then the several circles concerned must be ever so adjusted that the perpendicular of their centers may still be the same with the latitude of the moon at the middle of the eclipse and that as measured by a scale which is so much larger than ours as their diameters are larger  thus we shall find by this instrument that there will be an eclipse of the moon this year october    that it will not be a total but a partial eclipse that the digits eclipsed will be   and this on the north side of the moons body that the eclipse will begin about   h    m and end about   h  0 m in the morning and that mount aetna will enter the shadow about   h   m and emerge about   h    m  note those that would exactly imitate nature in these lunar eclipses must let the globe stand and have a lamp or circle of light larger in diameter than the globe through whose shadow the map of the moon must pass they ought also to have different maps of the moon out of hevelius to fit the different librations of the moon or the small variety there is in that face which is exposed to us in different eclipses but since this method would be much more troublesome and but little more advantageous or entertaining i chose the former easy way of exhibiting these lunar eclipses by this instrument leaving the other to those among the curious who shall think fit to bestow any extraordinary cost and trouble about it  but note that the diameters of the penumbra and of the moon are here still fitted to their mean quantity when the earth and moon are about the shorter axis of their ellipses so that when they are near their aphelion and apogee their perihelion and perigee or the earth its aphelion and the moon its perigee the earth its perihelion and the moon its apogee some small differences will arise in the business of eclipses which yet may easily be allowed for on a little consideration thus the next visible eclipse of the sun happening somewhat near the earths aphelion and nearer the moons perigee as the position of their orbits at that time in this instrument will show the moon will appear a little larger and the sun a little smaller than ordinary whereby the sun will be about   minutes and   quarters under a total eclipse all along the central path of the moons shadow and the    digits on your glass will not include the whole in this case you are to suppose all the circles   thirds of a digit enlarged and the central digit so much broader thus the next invisible eclipse of the sun october    happening somewhat near the earths perihelion and nearer the moons apogee the moon will appear somewhat less and the sun somewhat greater than ordinary so that this eclipse will be only annular and not total and the digits eclipsed will not be quite    in this case you are to suppose all the circles diminished   thirds of a digit and the central digit so much narrower and the like allowances are to be made in the numbers upon the path of and perpendicular to the moons shadow in the diameter of the moons map in the duration of eclipses etc which must be left to every curious persons own estimation only with this intimation that these differences from the standards here given are ever so small and commonly so insensible that they may be well looked on as almost perfectly inconsiderable in the use of this or the like instruments  yet the latitude of the moon will sometimes well deserve an allowance and may be corrected by taking not much above a    th part of the distance from the node near the moons perigee and almost a  0 th near its apogee instead of that    th part which is the usual standard whence at this next eclipse the real latitude of    m  0 s will be here represented by    m  0 s on our scale and so proportionally in all cases whatsoever  scholium since the computation and exhibition of all eclipses past or future is by this instrument become now so very easy it will be fit to examine thereby all the old eclipses men ioned by historians and to compare them with original accounts for the settling all ancient chronology and history which design was the very occasion of the contrivance of the same in particular it will be fit to examine hereby the very old pretended eclipses mentioned in the chinese records and to see how far they will agree with the real eclipses of those remote ages which may be also one valuable use as to lunar eclipses at least of the acute dr halleys tables for the periodical returns of eclipses which he has given us a specimen of already and which we shortly expect the completion of from him  prob xiv to find the heliocentrick true places of all the primary planets for any time past present or to come  by the help of the proper tables which are published in my astronomy find the true place of each planet as is there directed from thence you may set them accordingly by this instrument  thus for example let us compute the heliocentrick place of mercury

ephemeris such as is annually set out by mr parker whence you may readily transfer the heliocentrick places of the planets into your instrument accordingly by either method at the time of the next solar eclipse the six primary planets heliocentrick places will appear to be these  s saturn 0        jupiter 0  0     mars 0  0     earth 0        venus 0     0  mercury 0  00     prob xv to find the geocentrick places of any of the primary planets for any time past present or to come  having found as before the heliocentrick places of the other planets and particularly that of the earth noted all by several small spheres and having allowed for their proper eccentricities in the sticking of those spheres lay one of your threads from the earth to the planet and the other thread laid parallel thereto from the center gives you the geocentrick place of that planet for the time assigned  thus at the forementioned time the five primary planets geocentrick places will be nearly these s saturn 0        jupiter 0  0  0  mars 0        venus          mercury 00        prob xvi to find the mutual aspects of all the primary planets with one another and with the sun and moon their conjunctions oppositions trines quartiles and sextiles both heliocentrick and geocentrick for any time past present or to come  this is easily done when the places themselves of the primary planets with that of the moon are once found by the former solution nor is there then any difficulty in noting the several angles of distance   0  0 and  0 which make the trine quartile and sextile aspect but this problem looks too like the fooleries of astrology to deserve any nicer explication  prob xvii to find whether any primary planet with its satellits be direct stationary or retrograde at any time past present or to come  having found the heliocentrick and geocentrick places of the planets and set small spheres to represent em from the sphere representing any planet lay two rules or threads so as to touch the earths orbit on both sides if the earth be considerably without that mixtilinear triangle the planet is direct if considerably within it it is retrograde if about the limit it is stationary or at least lately was or soon will be so nor can you by this means absolutely determine near those limits whether the planet be direct stationary or retrograde but then by finding its geocentrick place two several times within a few days of one another and observing whether the planet at the latter time be farther or in the same place or not so far in the ecliptic as it was at the former time you may entirely determine the problem nor is the case of the inferior planets much different from that of the superior ones as to this matter only note that the rules or threads must be laid from the earth to touch their orbits which is the station or limit of the direction and retrogradation of those planets and is called their utmost elongation and that the inferior planets position near those limits are here correspondent to the earths position in the superior nor is this a case of such difficulty as to require any nicer consideration  thus at the time of the forementioned eclipse we shall find by this method that saturn and mars will be retrograde and that jupiter venus and mercury will be direct  prob xviii to find the places of the circumsaturnals and circumjovials from their opposition to the sun at any time since their motions have been known past present or to come  find the place of saturn or jupiter in the ecliptic for the given time as before then by the proper tables of their satellits motions about them when they shall be made for we have only one set of such tables yet published and rendered fit for our purpose i mean those of cassini for jupiters innermost fix the beginning of their orbits or the small spheres stuck there to represent those satellits place also or imagine a lamp or candle at the distance of about   0 feet for saturn and about the same number of feet for jupiter by this means you will have a true and noble representation of these systems of secondary planets at any time whatsoever  prob xix to find the eclipses of these secondary planets for any time since their motions have been known past present or to come  the time of opposition is the time of the middle of any eclipse and by taking away and adding the half duration of that eclipse you have the time of the immersion and emersion it is plain therefore that finding the opposition does in effect find the immersions emersions and entire durations of those eclipses also  note that the time of half duration in jupiter s innermost which is the most remarkable satellit in this matter is nearly   h   m and so the whole duration about   h    m perpetually  note farther that only one of these appearances the immersion or emersion of a satellit is generally visible at the same time viz the immersion from the conjunction of the primary planet with the sun till its opposition and the emersion from its opposition till its conjunction  note also that till we have more exact and suitable tables of the rest of these secondary planets it will be proper two nights successively to observe the position of as many as we can of them and from those observations to fix their places with relation to their primary ones to those times for since their orbits on our instrument gives their several periods exactly enough from those periods their future places and positions may be found by two such observations for a great while and such positions may be with pleasure enough compared with a great number of other observations afterward nor do we wholly want an astronomical method as to the most useful of these secondary planets which is the innermost about jupiter since the tables necessary for placing the same right and for the eclipses for some years to come though too large for this small manual are published in my astronomy with full directions for their use also to which i must refer the curious reader  note farther that we are generally to look for only one of saturn s satellites there being few glasses that can show us any more and none but those of the famous cassini that can discover the two innermost  note here that jupiter s planets are all in or near the plain of his equator which is near the plain of the ecliptic it self and that they are hardly at all eccentrical that saturn s most visible planet discovered by hugenius is the fourth in order or the outmost but one as also that its planets are in or near the plain of its ring which is about    degrees inclined to the ecliptic and that they do not any of them appear to be very much eccentrical neither  and note that our terrestrial globe may be so contrived that it may be also used with an horizon as any other terrestrial globe may and by consequence those who buy its celestial fellow may at the same time have a pair of globes as well as a copernicus which will at once save almost all the charges of one globe and afford a foundation for the understanding of both the principal parts of astronomy also i mean the doctrine of the sphere to which the globes and the theory of the planets to which our copernicus does immediately belong  note lastly that all who purchase this copernicus and desire to have it explained more distinctly to them according to the directions in this paper may apply themselves to the author who will endeavor to make the several parts and uses of it easy and familiar to them  mar           will whiston  errata page   line    read      p   l  0
