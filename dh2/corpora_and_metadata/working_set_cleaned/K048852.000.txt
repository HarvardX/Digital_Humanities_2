his majestys high commissioner to the general assembly of the church of scotland this sermon is inscribed with the highest respect and esteem by  his graces most obliged most humble and most obedient servant hugh blair  a sermon preached in the high church of edinburgh may   th      psalm lxxvi  0 surely the wrath of man shall praise thee the remainder of wrath shall thou restrain in this psalm some remarkable victory and deliverance is celebrated which the jewish nation had obtained a deliverance in which the hand of god visibly appeared rescuing his people from imminent danger very probably it was written in hezekiahs reign on occasion of their being delivered from the formidable invasion of sennacherib and the assyrian army when the angel of the lord in one night discomfited all their host and smote them with sudden destruction   king xix     to this signal interposition of the divine arm these expressions in the context may be naturally applied there brake he the arrows of the bow the shield the sword and the battle  the stouthearted are spoiled they have slept their sleep and none of the men of might have found their hands at thy rebuke o god of jacob both the chariot and the horse are cast into a dead sleep in the words of our text we have the psalmists religious and wise reflection upon all these events upon the violent designs of their enemies and the issue to which providence brought these designs surely the wrath of man shall praise thee the remainder of wrath shall thou restrain  the wrath of man that is all the rage and the impetuous passion of wicked men with the violent effects of war persecution oppression and other disorders it produces in the world all these the psalmist tells us shall praise god not indeed by the intention and design nor by the native tendency of the wrath of man but by these wise and good purposes which the providence of god causes it to accomplish from this poison extracting health and of things most unwilling and unapt in themselves to yield him glory forming instruments of good so that though the wrath of man as the apostle james speaks works not of itself the righteousness of god a it is nevertheless forced and compelled to minister to his praise the psalmist adds the remainder of wrath shall thou restrain that is god will give way to the wrath of man and allow it scope so far as it answers his good purposes and works his praise the rest of it shall be curbed and bound up when it would attempt to go beyond its prescribed limit he says to it as to the waters of the sea hitherto shall thou come but no further and here shall thy proud waves be stayed jam i  0  all this the last issue of things shall fully verify and declare when we shall be able more clearly to trace the divine administration through its several steps by seeing the consummation of the whole in some cases it may be reserved for this period only to disclose and unfold the mysterious wisdom of heaven but in general as much of the divine conduct and wisdom is at present manifest as gives just ground for this observation that the wrath of man praises god now before the whole world job xxxviii    this was the meditation of the psalmist after victory and conquest as we my brethren like him have lately seen the wrath of man raging around us in all its violence and in the midst of its fury have seen it restrained and checked by the powerful hand of god such a meditation must be acknowledged very suitable and becoming now that by serious contemplation of the ways of providence we may learn to view these revolutions which befall mankind with the devout sentiments of our psalmist  in prosecuting this subject i shall endeavor to illustrate and confirm the observation in my text by showing in what manner the wrath of man is made to praise god and then i shall lead your thoughts to the improvement we ought to make of such a meditation  the different ways in which the wrath of man turns out to the praise of god are reducible chiefly to these three i as it manifests most brightly the glorious perfections of god in the government of the universe ii as it illustrates and improves the virtues of good men and thus beautifies his church and people and iii as it is made the means of working out their greater prosperity and happiness upon the whole  i i say the wrath of man praises god as it gives occasion for the brighter and more illustrious discovery of his perfections in the government of the world  the beauty and order of the universe is much heightened by its being so complicated a system in which there are such a variety of springs to be adjusted and so many different movements to be regulated and kept in order interfering interests and jarring passions balanced in such manner against one another violent and unruly men kept under such a wise and regular control and the wrath of man made so to know its place that how opposite soever the several motions seem to be yet they concur and meet at last in one end this renders a divine hand sensible and illustrious this opens a more wonderful prospect of the divine government than if all its subjects were loyal and willingly obedient and makes that power and wisdom which can render such intractable things subservient to the ends of justice and goodness appear so much the more worthy of everlasting admiration and praise more particularly    the wrath of man redounds to the praise of gods almighty power as this is displayed in his restraining and baffling at pleasure all its fury and wickedness  to reign with sovereign command amidst the most disordered and turbulent state of things is the peculiar glory of omnipotence hence we find god described in scripture sitting on the flood riding on the wings of the wind dwelling in the darkness and the tempest as he stills the raging of the seas and the noise of their waves so he stills the tumults of the people when the passions of men are most agitated and inflamed and their violent designs just ripe for bursting into execution how often by some unforeseen turn of providence has he called upon mankind to observe that there is one higher than the highest on earth who can baffle all their devices with the breath of his mouth and command the earth to be still before him when proud fleets cover the ocean he blows with his wind and they are scattered when mighty armies go forth to battle in all the glory of human strength with what majesty does an omnipotent arm sometimes appear  as in the case of haughty sennacherib and that boasted tempest of wrath he threatened to pour upon all the jewish nation i will put my hook says god in thy nose and my bridle in thy lips and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou came   kings xix     in that night the destroying angel smote the host and he departed we are told with shame of face to his own land when the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing when the kings of the earth set themselves and its rulers take counsel together he that sits in the heavens shall laugh the lord shall hold them in derision then shall he speak to them in wrath and vex them in his sore displeasure psalm ii          again    the wrath of man is made to praise the wisdom as well as the power of god when he makes the unruly passions of bad men work in a secret way toward ends by them altogether unforeseen this most eminently displays the unsearchable depths of the divine counsel when we see them rendered the ministers of providence to forward designs which they intended to destroy  thus how surprising is it in the history of joseph that the cruelty of his brethren the lewdness and resentment of his mistress and the wrath of potiphar should all conspire to his advancement and prove the steps by which this persecuted and friendless man rose till he became the savior of all his kindred how remarkably did the wrath of man praise god in the case of daniel the malice of his enemies had thrown him into the den of lions for worshipping god they presumed his destruction accomplished and themselves completely delivered from so formidable a rival yet this very event proved not only the occasion of daniels greater honor and their utter ruin but of a decree through all the kingdom of the medes that all men should worship and fear before the god of daniel dan vi     thus god snareth the wicked in the works of their hands pasl ix     and erects his own counsel upon the ruin of theirs these things which viewed apart appear to us spots in the divine administration when considered in their connection with all the train of succeeding events often add a great luster and beauty to it were our views extensive enough we should discern it always to be thus    i might observe further that the wrath of man praises the goodness of god in all these purposes of general benefit both temporal and spiritual to which his providence renders it subservient but these will fall to be afterward considered i therefore proceed to observe    that the wrath of man is made to praise the divine justice  in many cases it is sufficient for this end that god let loose upon bad men for their own punishment these angry passions which make them the disturbers of others by giving them up to the workings of these he opens a source of restless pain within their breasts and delivers them over to themselves to be their own tormentors in thus connecting the punishment with the crime causing their own wickedness to reprove them and their backslidings to correct them the hand of justice is plainly seen and though the sinner that feels it may affect to disguise his suffering yet every one knows that no punishment is more real or more intense than the inward misery of a mind wrought and torn with despite revenge or wrathful passion in such a case we may understand that saying of the psalmist to receive its accomplishment the wicked have drawn out their sword and bent their bow to cast down the poor and needy  but the sword which they have drawn shall enter into their own heart pasl xxxvii         the wrath of man praises also the divine justice by being the instrutment of punishing other ambitious and violent men they are let loose upon one another to fulfill the vengeance of heaven one corrupt nation is raised up against another that both may suffer for their sins and as there can be no soild nor lasting bond of union amongst wicked men though they may be occasionally cemented by conspiracy against the good their continually interfering views and interests render them in the just judgment of providence a prey to mutual jealousy strife and fraud  finally the justice of god is praised in the vengeance which sooner or later he executes against the wrath and violence of sinners they may go on for a time and appear to prosper the justice of heaven may seem to slumber but it is awake and only waits till the measure of their iniquity be full how often has the world been awakened to the observation of the awful government of god by the sudden fall and destruction of tyrants god represents himself in scripture as permitting wickedness sometimes to arise to an overgrown height on purpose that its ruin may be the greater and the more astonishing for this cause he tells that wicked prince pharaoh he had raised him up that is allowed him to prosper and be exalted that he might show in him his power and that his name might be declared throughout all the earth exodus ix     the divine administration is glorified as well in the strange punishment he has decreed for the workers of iniquity as in the reward he has prepared for the righteous this is the purpose which the lord has purposed upon all the earth and this is the hand that stretched forth over all the nations isa xiv      thus the wrath of man is made to praise god by giving mankind deep impressions of that infinite power wisdom and justice that governs the world such impressions it is necessary for mankind to have and in their present imperfect state they can only receive them from something that is sensible and striking the commotions and disorders of the world open a field for signalizing the divine administration more than if all things went on in a quiet undisturbed tenor the waters must be sometimes troubled that we may attend to that hand which stills their raging and clouds must arise that the heavenly light which dispels them may strike our eye with the more sensible brightness we further observed  ii that the wrath of man may be justly said to praise god by that tendency which he gives it to improve and illustrate the virtues of good men and thereby to beautify his church and people now it has this effect    as it is employed by god to be the means of correcting good men for their faults these storms which ambition and pride raise among mankind he permits with the same intention that he sends forth tempests and hurricanes amongst the elements to clear the atmosphere of noxious vapors and purify it from that corruption which all things contract by too much rest bad men appear sometimes to have obtained entire power over the just they exercise their tyranny perhaps with a very heavy and oppressive hand the just complain and groan and in the bitterness of their soul can hardly forbear to exclaim  where is the lord and where the scepter of righteousness and truth has god forgotten to be gracious or does he indeed see and is there knowledge in the most high  their oppressors are really no more than the instruments of god to them for good he sees they stand in need of such correction and therefore raises them up enemies to cure the intemperance of prosperity and by that seriousness which affliction is fitted to introduce into the mind to lead them to think of themselves of their duty and their past errors in this way the disturbers of the earth are often represented to us in scripture as scourges in the hand of god sent forth to do his work upon a degenerating people they are employed in the execution of righteous and wise purposes concealed from themselves and when their commission is fulfilled recalled and destroyed of this we have a remarkable example in the king of assyria i will send him says god against an hypocritical nation and against the people of my wrath will i give him a charge to take the spoil and to take the prey  howbeit he means not so neither does his heart think so but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few  wherefore it shall come to pass that when the lord has performed his whole work upon mount zion and on jerusalem i will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of assyria and the glory of his high looks isa x         vainly then does the warth of man lift itself up against god  shall the ax boast itself against him that heweth therewith or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shakes it isa x     all things whether they will or not must work together for good to them that love god  this amongst the rest fills up the place assigned it by the ordination of heaven  and the proudest conqueror and the most oppressive tyrant possess only the same station with the famine the pestilence and the flood their triumphs are no more than the accomplishment of gods correction and the remainder of their wrath shall he restrain    god makes the wrath of man to praise him not only by employing it in chastisement but as the instrument of improving and signalizing the graces of good men and thereby raising them to higher honor and glory  had there been no persecutors and tyrants no oppressors of liberty no wrathful and furious men in the world what a number of great and worthy actions had never been heard of what shining examples of fortitude constancy and patience had been lost to the world what a field of virtues peculiar to a state of improvement and discipline had lain uncultivated  spirits of a higher order possess a state of established virtue that stands in need of no such improvements and trials but to us who are only under education for such a state it belongs to pass through the furnace that our souls may be tried refined and brightened we must stand the conflict that we may be graced and crowned as conquerors the wrath of man gives the occasion and the field  calls us forth to the most conspicuous and distinguished exercise of active virtue  and forms us to all those suffering graces which are amongst the brightest ornaments of the human soul when unjust attempts are carried on against our public interests these give us the means of discovering true public spirit and love to our country when we suffer in our private concerns there our enemies put it into our power to gain the noblest conquest by overcoming the world and to make ourselves greater than the greatest man who injures us by forgiving him when we suffer for the sake of truth and a good conscience there we have the desirable opportunity afforded us of gaining honor truly immortal by being witnesses for god and maintaining an exemplary and heroic fidelity in all this the wrath of man praises god  every single instance in which our souls are improved or some action of distinguished goodness is produced by means of the wrath of man redounds most highly both to our own good and to his praise who has ordered things in this manner for our improvement  it is thus the illustrious band of patriots and heroes of confessors and martyrs have been set forth to the admiration of all ages as the lights of the world whilst the violence and fury of enemies instead of bearing them down has only served to exalt and dignify them the more  we proceed now to the  iii view we proposed to give of the wrath of man praising god when providence makes it the mean of working out greater prosperity and happiness upon the whole to his people and church  i say the violence of enemies the rage of persecutors and the oppression of tyrants not only tend in the way of moral and religious improvement to the bettering of our souls but also are often made in their consequences to produce other unlooked for blessings to good men in this state as this is no rare nor unfrequent thing we shall point out some instances in which it appears thus  the hardships which good men suffer from others in their private concerns are often seen to give birth to their succeeding prosperity many exemplifications of this we find in history the unfortunate circumstances of mosess birth through the cruelty of an egyptian tyrant were the means of this exposed infants being bred up as a kings son and of his being accomplished for his future great achievements with all the wisdom and learning of the egyptian court the insolence and proud resentment of haman paved the way for the advancement of mordecai his enemy at the very critical time when he thought his designs ripe for sinking him into ruin and his cruel scheme for the destruction of mordecais whole nation proved the occasion of their being raised above all their enemies there are many devices in the heart of a man but the counsel of the lord shall stand prove xix     he connecting together each link in the chain of events that fill up our life by an unexpected contexture of causes makes those things which we most deplore bring on our better days and in the dark bosom of misfortune gradually ripens the latent seeds of future prosperity  how frequently have the attempts of enemies to run down and blacken good men by all the arts of malice made their character shine the fairer in the eye of the impartial world how frequently have the extremities to which they have been driven by injustice and violence proved the occasion of calling forth their courage and activity and of putting them upon such efforts to do themselves justice as have raised them higher than ever they fell how many in the course of their life have had reason to be thankful for being disappointed by the wrath of their enemies in designs which perhaps they very earnestly pursued but which if they had succcessfully accomplished they have afterward seen would have proved their ruin whosoever is wise and will observe these things even he shall understand the loving kindness of the lord psalm cvii      but if thus in private life the wrath of man is often made to praise god by becoming the occasion of greater good still more is the hand of god apparent in the ends of public benefit it is made to serve to nations and societies  the rage of civil wars the oppression of tyrants and all the other dismal effects of the ambition and wrath of man have often sung the praise of god to many succeeding generations thence have been made to spring public liberty to a people wise government good order and lasting peace nations have been thereby awakened to see their true interests and taught more effectually to secure them public affairs being once thrown into a ferment the corruptions of government like bad humors in the body have been purged and wrought off the feeling of grievous oppression has frequently been the first thing that made nations shake off the yoke and led them to assert their own just rights against tyrannical governors which had their tyranny been less insolent these nations would have remained longer perhaps for ever deprived of of this we have a memorable example in the late glorious and happy revolution in our own country our constitution and its liberties might have been insensibly undermined and ruined had it not been for the glaring and open violation of laws with a high hand which proclaiming all to be then at stake roused up the spirits of men to rnake a determined stand against incroaching tyranny and thus gave birth to that free and legal establishment with which we at this day are blessed and for which we hope late posterity after us shall continue to bless the providence of god had it not been for the avowed attempts then made against our religion and our fundamental rights britain might have been now under a popish sovereign and instead of that mild and temperate administration we have enjoyed under a series of princes who have always made the law their rule we would have been the subjects or rather slaves of those who arrogantly claim us as their property by divine right in like manner the tyranny and violence of tarquin produced the illustrious and victorious commonwealth of rome the oppression of the king of spain laid the foundation of the liberty of the united provinces and liberty from a few inconsiderable fishertowns has raised them to the most flourishing height of trade and opulence  as to the first establishment of freedom so to the further security of a public interest unjust and violent designs have been often subservient attempts to overthrow a good government have generally strengthened it more by these its false friends are unmasked and brought to light its secret foes suffer for their treachery the zeal of its wellwishers is awakened and increased and from what is felt of the violence and outrage of its enemies people are more confirmed in abhorrence of their designs and made more justly to prize the blessings of tranquillity and legal protection  further the wrath of man in the persecution of religion and truth signally praises god when it is made to turn to the greater advancement of religion and further propagation of truth  the church of god since the days of its infancy has never been free from the worlds wrath and yet in these ages in which it was most persecuted it has most flourished in vain the policy and the rage of the world united their strength to extinguish this divine light though all the four winds blew against it it only shone the brighter and flamed the higher many waters could not quench it nor all the floods drown it and the blood of the martyrs as has been often and justly said was the seed of the church the zeal of the primitive christians their constancy and fortitude in giving testimony to truth and their cheerful patience in suffering for it did much more to increase the number of converts to true religion than all the terror and cruelty of persecutors could ever do to lessen it the attempts that were used to bear down religion only enlarged its triumphs by displaying the victorious force of truth by this means the wrath of man was made to turn against itself to the destruction of its own purpose  like waves that assaulting a rock with impotent fury discover its immovable stability whilst they dash themselves in pieces at its feet prosperity greatness and worldly favor may have corrupted religion and sullied the purity of the church but never did the wrath of man try to overthrow it but in the issue it made its own weakness appear and raised the praise of god by purifying the church and advancing religion more  i shall only add one instance more of the wrath of man praising god by accomplishing ends of most extensive benefit and that is the death of jesus christ  never did malice rage and envy please themselves with the thoughts of having obtained a more complete triumph than in this case jesus was now put to death the revenge of his enemies gratified his name and his honor they believed rooted out from amongst men  yet behold how vain the wrath of man is all that they intended to overthrow they most effectually confirmed the ignominy of the cross became the standard of eternal honor to christ and his religion and his death perpetrated by them as a wicked murder was in the counsel of god the spring of everlasting life to all his followers he who restrains the remainder of wrath at his pleasure suffered their rage to suggest no other things to them than what himself had long before determined and his prophets foretold should be so done so that they all conspired to render the whole most exactly conformable to his original plan of mercy and goodness and each contributed his share to finish that great work which none of them knew any thing of nor in the least intended  so glorious an instance as this fully ascertained and laid out to us in scripture of the wrath of man ministering to the gracious designs of heaven ought to have the greatest weight as an exemplification of the conduct of providence in many other cases where we have not so much light afforded us for the discovery of its ways  and now by this induction of particulars you see upon the whole how much ground there is for asserting that the wrath of man shall praise god that all the disorders which the passion and pride of men occasion in the world though they take their first rise from the corruption of human nature are so ordered as to become parts of a wise and good constitution redounding to his honor and glory who has ordered all  either illustrating before the world his divine perfections in the government of things  or serving the purposes of moral and religious improvement to the souls of men  or by some secret tendency working out prosperity and happiness to those whom they seem most to threaten with suffering and evil  surely o god the wrath of man shall praise thee the remainder of wrath shall thou restrain in thy hand it is and thou never lets it forth but in weight and measure it is wild and intractable in its nature but thou tamest it blind and headlong in its impulse but thou directest it ever struggling to break its chain knowing no bounds but thou confinest it thou retrenchest all the superfluity of its fury  let us now consider what is the improvement to be made of this meditation on the ways of providence    let it lead us to a religious contemplation of the hand of god in all the occurrences and transactions of the world we behold a very mixed and busy scene of things passing before us the passions of men variously agitated and new changes daily brought forth upon this stage of time we behold peace and war taking their turns the fortunes of private men rising and falling and nations and kingdoms partaking in the same fluctuation and vicissitude in all this if we look no farther than to the operation of external causes and the mere rotation of events we behold only the dead side of nature  stop at the surface of things  contemplate them not like rational and religious beings the life and beauty of the universe arises from the view of that wisdom and goodness which animates and conducts the whole and unites all the parts in one great design there is an eternal mind that puts all these wheels in motion himself remaining for ever at rest of him we are to conceive not as removed from this world sitting a mere spectator of his creatures in his high abode but as an omnipresent spirit pervading directing and regulating all ever busy without toil and working without weariness nothing is void of him even in the passions and ragings of men god is to be found and when they think they guide themselves his hand controuls and guides them still  to what serious and solemn thoughts are we led by such a view as this when we attend not merely to the actings of men but to the ways of god deeply impressed with the belief that we and all our concerns are parts of his great administration    from what has been said we see that we ought not to be shaken in our minds by any present seeming disorders of the world so as on account of them to think ill of providence many things doubtless there are which appear as blemishes in the general order to a superficial view and which if we were to regulate the world we think should have no place in it and yet these various instances which we see and can clearly trace of the workings of passion and wickedness rendered subservient to worthy and good ends give us the highest reason to conclude that in all other cases of seeming evil the like ends are promoted this ought to satisfy our minds even where the prospect is most discouraging and the state of human affairs most dark and embroiled the schemes of divine wisdom are too large and comprehensive to be discerned by us in all their extent at one view and where we see only by parts we must be often at a loss to judge of the whole the way of god is in the sea and his path in the great waters his footsteps are not known psalm lxxvii     although thou say thou can not see him yet judgment is still before him therefore trust thou in him job xxxv     his it is to educe good from ill order from confuision his own just praise from mans wrath as in the natural world there is no real deformity nothing but what has either its own ornament or use so the most irregular and deformed appearances in the moral world shall be made to heighten the beauty of the whole and in the end all the works of god shall appear to be perfect god binds together the most opposite and disagreeing principles in the laws of universal concord and adapts even the most harsh and discordant notes to the harmony of his goodness as he has reared the goodly frame of nature from various and jarring elements and has settled it in peace so he has formed such an union by his providence of the more various interests and more jarring passions of men that they all conspire to his glory and cooperate for the general good  how amazing is that wisdom which comprehends such infinite diversities and contrarieties within its scheme how powerful that hand which bends to its own purpose the good and the bad the busy and the idle the friends and the foes of god which makes them all hold on their course to his glory though divided from one another by a multiplicity of pursuits and differing often from themselves and whilst they all move themselves at their own freedom yet by a secret influence winds and turns them at his will o the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out romans xi        from what has been said we see the greatest reason for entire submission to the will of heaven amidst all sufferings from the wrath and violence of men these befall us not in vain they are not to be considered as mere effects of the arbitrary pleasure and will of men nor are we to believe ourselves the sport of fortune and passion but good designs are going on god is always carrying forward his own ends and if we are certainly assured that all is tending to his glory which is ever the same with the general good is not this a sufficient reason for the most peaceable acquiescence on our part ought not we as parts of the whole cheerfully to resign our private interest to the advancement of a higher and more general good  but moreover by this resignation our own interest shall suffer nothing in the issue for the greatest happiness of every good man of each individual as well as of the whole is comprehended in that praise which the wrath of man is decreed to yield to god  hence ought to arise not unreluctant submission only but the most exalted joy in the divine administration to all who are pious and virtuous in all events their interest is secured and the severest trials of life are to them matter even of thankfulness and gratitude when viewed in their just light for in these very trials their advantage is consulted by them is their good promoted and the most hurtful designs of the wrath of man are converted into benefits and blessings  let this be enough to reconcile our minds to every part of our lot and to establish them in the most comforting trust and confidence in god in the way of our duty  if god be for us who or what can be against us he who can defeat all the purposes of our enemies and transform their intended evil unto real good is certainly the most powerful friend and if his wrath be once appeased there is no other wrath from which we have ought to fear    from all that has been said of the conduct of providence let us observe how much reason there is for acknowledging with thankfulness the hand of god in all these deliverances which we obtain from the wrath of man as we ought never to forget when we suffer by human violence that it is his hand which corrects us so when that violence receives a check we ought to remember it is his hand which restrains it in both these the wrath of man either permitted or restrained praises god and we have seen him remarkably praised in both  through all the steps of our late sufferings and our present happy deliverance such a series of divine wisdom has appeared as must present to the observation of every considering spectator a very beautiful scene in the history of providence  god beheld a nation whom he had favored with long tranquillity and peace sunk by that peace and tranquillity into luxury and corruption of manners he had blessed them with a happy constitution a mild government and equal laws but long enjoyment had deadend their sense of so invaluable a blessing and fed a giddy and factious spirit he had distinguished them with the purest enjoyment of pure religion above most nations of the earth but their religious privileges once struggled for with zeal began to be contemned and their first love to cool  behold how opportunely god sent forth the wrath of man to work a cure for all these evils  to shake that peace which had fostered luxury and impiety under its wings to threaten that religion and that government to the blessings of which we had beeninsensible and to display before us these terrors of oppressive power and persecuting religion to the danger of which we had been laid asleep  he made us feel the value of all we should have lost  he made the evil to grow sudden and unexpected from amongst ourselves and allowing it to proceed so far as might be sufficient to awaken the nation and to render us serious and wise he then gave a signal check to the wrath of man and restrained the remainder of it after it had gone the length which he saw meet our enemies boasted of the favor and countenance of heaven countenanced they were by heaven but not for their own sakes and the success permitted them for a time was meant for the improvement and benefit of those whom they intended to destroy when the proper season was come for god to assert his own cause then he raised up an illustrious deliverer whom for a blessing to his country he had prepared against this time of need him he crowned with the graces of his right hand to the conspicuous bravery of early youth he added that conduct and wisdom which in others is the fruit only of long experience and distinguished him with all those qualities which render the man amiable as well as the hero great he sent him forth to be the terror of his foes the confidence and love of his friends and in the day of danger and death commanded the shields of angels to be spread around him  what heart in which the love of british liberty remains warms not at the mention of his name  whose bosom overflows not with gratitude when he looks back upon the late dark and melancholy scenes of oppression and terror and surveys the fair prospect now opened by this chosen instrument of our deliverance of peace restored liberty flourishing and religion safe  let us lift up our eyes to heaven and say this is the doing of the lord and it is mavelous in our eyes psalm cxviii      him the wrath of man has indeed signally praised in our land praised him when it raged and praised him when it fell  when he arose his enemies were scattered as smoke is driven away and as chaff before the wind  give unto the lord ye mighty give unto the lord glory and strength psalm xxix    he breaks the bow and cutteth the spear in sunder he burns the chariot in fire psalm xlvi    his excellency is over israel his strength is in the clouds he gives strength and victory to his people psalm lxviii
