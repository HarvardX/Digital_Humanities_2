observations on the cowpox  by william woodville m d physician to the smallpox and inoculation hospitals  london printed and sold by william phillips giorgi yard lombard street    00  to edward jenner md frs fls etc sir that the vaccine matter with which the inoculations have been carried on in the hospital was contaminated with that of the variolous and that a hybrid disease has in consequence been propagated not only by me but also by others who have been supplied with that matter is a charge which i know to be unfounded and which it was my duty to refute  the performance of this task has however been very painful to me from being unable to avoid a certain degree of recrimination which attaches to a man for whom i have long entertained a friendly regard and to whom the public is under the great obligation of having been made acquainted with a discovery which promises the most important benefits to society  i am sir your obedient servant w woodville ely place july  st   00 i feel myself impelled to address the public a second time on the subject of the inoculation for the cowpock not only because an enlarged experience of it has now enabled me to produce more decisive evidence of its advantages but because some remarks upon my practice of this new inoculation have lately been made which call upon me for an immediate reply  i trust it will be generally acknowledged that the observations and opinions formerly adduced by me on this subject are strictly impartial and unprejudiced also that the facts on which they are founded have been related without the least reserve and with the most scrupulous fidelity notwithstanding my conclusions in respect to a point of considerable importance have been opposed in a manner which i deem wholly unwarrantable i allude to the pustular eruptions which appeared on more than half the patients first inoculated for the cowpock under my direction dr jenner in a late publication see his continuation of facts and observations relating to the variolae vaccinae having maintained that those pustules could only proceed from variolous matter introduced by inoculation into the constitution along with that of the vaccine that objections would be made to this effect might be foreseen and they were accordingly anticipated in my reports where several facts and arguments are brought forward to prove that all the cases which i had represented as cases of cowpox were produced from the inoculation of the matter of that disease uncontaminated with any other having done this in a manner which has generally been deemed satisfactory i did not now expect that any gentleman would publicly attempt to subvert my conclusion without first doing me the justice to show that the reasons on which it was founded were defective or fallacious although i have been disappointed in this expectation yet as i have no other object in view than a discovery of the truth i will fully state all the reasons which the ingenious inventor of the new inoculation has advanced in support of a contrary opinion he first enters upon the consideration of pustules at page   where he says when i consider the great number of cases of casual inoculation immediately from cows which have from time to time presented themselves to my observation and the many similar instances which have been communicated to me by medical gentlemen in this neighborhood when i consider too that the matter with which my inoculations were conducted in the years           and      was taken from different cows and that in no instance any thing like a variolous pustule appeared i cannot feel disposed to imagine that eruptions similar to those described by dr woodville have ever been produced by the pure uncontaminated cowpox virus on the contrary i do suppose that those which the doctor speaks of originated in the action of variolous matter which crept into the constitution with the vaccine and this i presume happened from the inoculation of a great number of the patients with variolous matter some on the third others on the fifth day after the vaccine had been applied and it should be observed that the matter thus propagated became the source of future inoculations in the hands of many medical gentlemen who appeared to have been previously unacquainted with the nature of the cowpox  were i to allow the above observations all the force which the author of them could reasonably expect they would still amount to no more than negative proof and conjectural inference against the evidence of positive facts it must however be remembered that the cowpox as casually produced by milking infected cows differs considerably from that which is the effect of a regular inoculation the local affection in the former case constantly exhibits a deep blue color an appearance which the inoculated disease never assumes the cows also according to dr jenners own statement readily communicate the infection to the persons who milk them although such persons have undergone the smallpox medical and physical journal v i p     dr pearson on the other hand has informed us that he made numerous trials to give the vaccine disease by inoculation to those who had previously received the smallpox but that all his attempts proved ineffectual therefore any arguments wholly founded upon the strict analogy between the inoculated and casual cowpox must be considered as inconclusive  from the manner in which dr jenner has referred to the inoculations conducted by him during the years           and      the reader may be led to infer that his experience had been sufficiently extensive to equal mine but it appears from his publication in the summer of      see dr jenners continuation of facts etc p    that his practice had not then extended to more than eight cases and no opportunity to inoculate the cowpox was offered to him again till he obtained from me matter for the purpose in february      with this matter which the doctor now reprobates as the contaminated source of pustules he inoculated twenty persons and in a letter to me at that time said the rise progress and termination of the pustule created by this virus on the arm was exactly that of the true uncontaminated cowpox this virus however which dr jenner from his own experience declared to be so perfectly pure and genuine was taken from the arm of an hospital patient who had   0 pustules all of which suppurated on what ground then can he say i cannot feel disposed to imagine that eruptions similar to those described by dr woodville have ever been produced by the pure uncontaminated cowpox virus  as a farther evidence of the genuineness of the cowpox matter which i sent to dr jenner i have the testimony of dr marshall who procured some of it from the persons inoculated by dr jenner and in the course of five weeks extended its effects in gloucestershire to  0  persons all of whom underwent the inoculation in the most favorable manner nor did any pustules that suppurated appear in a single instance dr jenner l c p      dr jenner in his last publication has given a transcript of a great part of dr marshalls letter in which the above  0  cases are stated but he does not represent these cases as the effect of the vaccine matter sent by me from the hospital on the contrary he professes to lay dr ms communication before his readers to show the result of the inoculation in particular with the matter which he procured from a cow at mr clarks farm at kentish town the very striking misrepresentation here pointed out must undoubtedly have arisen from some inadvertency for those who are most acquainted with dr jenner will i am sure be the last to suspect that he would willingly disguise the truth to serve any purpose whatever that i have not here mistated what the doctor has said will appear from the following paragraph introductory to the letter above referred to one experiment tending to elucidate the point under discussion i had myself an opportunity of instituting on the supposition of its being possible that the cow which ranges over the fertile meadows in the vale of gloucester might generate a virus differing in some respects in its qualities from that produced by the animal artificially pampered for the production of milk for the metropolis i procured during my residence there in the spring some cowpock virus from a cow at one of the london milkfarms it was taken by mr tanner then a student at the veterinary college from a cow at mr clarks farm at kentish town it was immediately conveyed into gloucestershire to dr marshall who was then extensively engaged in the inoculation of the cowpox the general result of which and of the inoculation in particular with this matter i shall lay before my readers in the following communication from the doctor see dr jenners continuation of facts and observations relative to the variolae vaccinae p         now it is very extraordinary but certainly a truth that dr jenner did not even obtain the matter from clarks cow till after the date of dr ms letter which is said to contain an account of its effects by inoculation nor does dr marshall mention the matter received by him from dr j till he had inoculated     persons when in a postscript to the letter giving a detail of the success of these inoculations he says i should have observed that of the patients i inoculated and enumerated in my letter one hundred and twentyseven were infected with the matter you sent me from the london cow i discovered no dissimilarity of symptoms in these cases from those which i inoculated from the matter procured in this county no pustules occurred except in one or two cases where a single one appeared on the inoculated arm no difference was apparent in the local inflammation dr jenner l c p      here the whole of what dr marshall has said militates most pointedly against the opinion of dr jenner who in the above citation is plainly told that the effects of the matter which he conveyed to dr m differed in no respect from that which had been employed before and which was sent from the inoculation hospital  dr jenner has not only given an opinion that the vaccine matter used by me at the hospital was variolated but he has also ventured to point out how it happened viz from the inoculation of a great number of the patients with variolous matter some on the third others on the fifth day after the vaccine had been applied the opinion here given would have had greater influence had the doctor first condescended to answer the reasons i gave twelve months ago to show that it was unfounded for i can hardly believe that mere conjecture on his part will be thought of sufficient authority to disannul the facts and arguments i had advanced  should all that dr jenner contends for be granted still none of his observations can apply to those patients who had pustules though inoculated with matter taken immediately from the cow and to whom no variolous matter was applied during the whole progress of the infection instances of this kind the dr must have read in my reports and must at the same time have known them to be irreconcilable with his opinion but i have discovered from repeated experience that if the matter of cowpox and that of smallpox be inserted in the arm of a patient even within an inch of each other so that on the ninth day the same efflorescence becomes common to both the local infections nevertheless upon inoculating with matter taken from the cowpock tumor the genuine vaccine disease is invariably produced and i am convinced from experience that the matter thus taken would not be more liable to produce pustules or a less favorable disease than matter procured directly from the cow  i have already published several other experiments to show that the cowpox does not hybridise with the smallpox even when inoculation is performed with the matter of these diseases intimately mixed together in equal quantities dr jenner must likewise know that his friend dr marshall has communicated to him the following fact which corroborates this opinion i visited a patient with the confluent smallpox and charged a lancet with some of the matter two days afterward i was desired to inoculate a woman and four children with the cowpox and i inadvertently took the vaccine matter on the same lancet which was before charged with that of smallpox in three days i discovered the mistake and fully expected that my five patients would be infected with smallpox but i was agreeably surprised to find the disease to be the genuine cowpox which proceeded without deviating in any particular from my former cases dr jenner l c p  0   i have now i presume said enough to convince the reader that dr jenners supposition is directly incompatible with established facts and i hope in future he will do the hospital matter the justice to speak of it as it deserves it has been employed by many medical gentlemen both in london and in the country and i do not know of one instance in which it has not fully answered the utmost expectations of the inoculator in making this remark i do not exclude as an additional proof i may appeal to his second publication on the variole vaccinae where we are informed that with this matter he inoculated two persons viz s jenner three years and a half and j hill four years old in the former case a few red spots appeared which quickly went off but hill had no eruption from hill the infection was transferred to    persons on none of whom did it produce any pustules the red spots which appeared upon s jenner were then regarded by the dr as an evidence of the genuineness of the vaccine disease because he had observed similar appearances in the casual cowpox he was therefore led to suppose that the pustules which the vaccine matter produced in london was occasioned by some peculiar influence of the town air since that time however dr j has adopted an opinion that the cowpox virus assimilates the variolous and facts though stubborn must as it often happens bend a little to favor the hypothesis thus in the drs last publication he says in a few weeks after the cowpox was introduced at the smallpox hospital i was favored with some virus from this stock in the first instance it produced a few pustules which did not maturate but in the subsequent cases none appeared the red spots are here changed into pustules and appear at first till the variolous poison is assimilated by that of the vaccine again at page    he says some of my correspondents have mentioned the appearance of small poxlike eruptions at the commencement of their inoculations but in these cases the matter was derived from the original stock at the smallpox hospital  but it is the nature of an hypothesis when once a man has conceived it that it assimilates every thing to itself as proper nourishment and from the moment of your begetting it it generally grows the stronger by every thing you see hear or understand  trist shandy dr jenner for in a letter to me the dr acknowledges that it had succeeded better than any of the vaccine matter which he had tried before i beg also to observe that it had a very strong claim to the doctors gratitude for of the four hundred and twentythree inoculations brought forward by him to show the advantages of the vaccine virus as used by dr marshall two hundred and ninetysix were performed with the matter sent from the hospital  last summer mr abernethy procured at the hospital some cowpock matter which he transmitted to the rev mr holt rector of finmere near buckingham with this matter the rector inoculated upwards of three hundred of his parishioners in all of whom the disease proved mild and tractable no variolouslike eruptions were produced except on two persons who had each one hundred pustules see medical and physical journal vol i p  0    the rev mr finch who was supplied by mr holt with some of this vaccine matter inoculated     persons on none of whom did any pustules resembling those of the smallpox appear now as dr jenner does not believe that variolouslike pustules have ever been produced by the pure uncontaminated cowpock virus he is involved in the dilemma of either relinquishing this opinion or of admitting that the above were not cases of genuine cowpox because in two of mr holts cases pustules occurred  although i differ in opinion from dr jenner in not imputing the pustular eruptions produced in the cases at the hospital to any adulteration of the vaccine matter employed in the inoculations yet i readily admit that they have been and still continue to be the effect of some adventitious cause independent of the cowpox  this will clearly appear from the following observations which likewise tend to place the subject in a new light  i had not long practiced the vaccine inoculation at the hospital before i was requested to extend it into private families in the metropolis where i soon discovered that the cowpox uniformly appeared in its mildest form and was never attended with eruptions i also supplied several medical gentlemen with the vaccine matter which was used by them with the like result hence i began to suspect that there existed some peculiar cause which rendered the patients under the vaccine inoculation in the hospital more liable to pustules than others and that this suspicion was well founded i have since from daily experience been fully convinced  at various times i procured the vaccine virus as produced in different cows and with it inoculated patients in the hospital but the effects of all the matter i tried were perfectly similar and pustules proved to be not less frequently the consequence of these trials than of those made with the matter formerly employed  the last matter of the vaccine poison which i introduced into the hospital was obtained from dr jenner and originally taken from clarks cow before noticed with this matter i inoculated at the hospital on the same day three patients on one of whom about  00 variolouslike pustules were produced this instance and numerous others of the like kind which i could adduce decidedly prove that where there can be no doubt entertained of the purity of the cowpock matter with which the patients in the hospital are inoculated pustules will frequently be the consequence  on the other hand i have to observe from daily experience during the last twelve months that among the great numbers of children residing in various parts of london to whom i have transferred the cowpock infection no instance of pustules that maturated has occurred now as these different effects of the disease between the patients in and those out of the hospital did not depend upon any difference or alteration of the matter with which the inoculations were performed the only cause remaining to which the frequent occurrence of pustules on the former can be rationally referred is the variolated atmosphere of the hospital which those patients were necessarily obliged to inspire during the progress of the cowpox infection  did it not lead me too much into detail i should show from many circumstances relating to the patients in the inoculation hospital that other reasons might from thence be adduced to support the opinion here advanced  mr evans surgeon at ketley in shropshire is the only person except myself who has given an account of the variolous and vaccine inoculations carried on separately in different persons at the same time and in the same house so that several of his patients while under the vaccine infection were exposed to the variolous effluvia the number of those which he inoculated for the cowpox amounted to sixtyeight and it is worthy of remark that more than onehalf of these patients had pustules many of mr evans patients were inoculated with matter sent from dr jenner it is true that the eruptions very rarely maturated but still their frequent occurrence would seem to show they arose from the same cause as those at the hospital i suspect also that in those places where the smallpox is epidemick or very generally prevailing the cowpox will be found to be equally liable to excite pustules as in the hospital  during the very general and fatal prevalence of the smallpox at a village eight miles distant from london more than  00 persons were inoculated under my direction for the cowpox of whom one in five had eruptions and as these furnish the only instances which i have experienced out of the hospital of the cowpox producing the variolouslike pustules i am disposed to attribute them to the adventitious cooperation of the variolous atmosphere to which the patients were exposed i have lately been favored with some communications from the country which tend to confirm this opinion in what way the variolous miasms act in thus modifying the cowpox or why they cooperate in some and not in all cases of vaccine infection i shall not even venture a conjecture the causes probably will continue as inexplicable as those constitutional peculiarities which produce all the varieties of smallpox  a month had scarcely elapsed after the publication of my reports on the vaccine disease before i thought it necessary to inform the public that the cowpock cases at the hospital had become considerably milder observing that out of the   0 inoculations only    were attended with pustules viz out of the first  00 nineteen produced pustules out of the second    and out of the last   0 only seven excited pustules since the above statement which was published in july      the new inoculation has by me or under my immediate direction been extended to about  000 persons with none of whom did the infection occasion a severe disorder or excite one alarming symptom  in the hospital however the disease still continues to occasionally produce pustules though not more than in the proportion of three or four cases out of  00 but in my private practice of inoculation for the cowpox which has been very extensive i have not met with one instance in which any pustules resembling those of the smallpox occurred hence the advantages of this inoculation over those of that of the variolous are as far as relates to the comparative severity of the disorder which they respectively excite most satisfactorily evinced  in order to show that those who had undergone the cowpox resisted the infection of the smallpox i observed in my reports that upwards of  00 of the patients who had received the former disease were afterward inoculated for the latter which in no instance was produced though more than  00 of the patients had the vaccine disease so very slightly that it neither produced any perceptible indisposition nor pustules in addition to this i can now say that more than  000 of those who had undergone the new inoculation have been put to the same test and that the like result has been experienced  the above facts added to a multiplicity of others of a similar import published by several professional men clearly demonstrate that the cowpox inoculation promises most important benefits to society and under this conviction i congratulate the public on the great progress it is making by which the real value of the invention will soon become generally acknowledged and duly appreciated  it was not to be expected that a disease originating in brutes should be recommended as a substitute for the smallpox and for this purpose be transferred to the human race without exciting much obloquy and opposition indeed several of the most valuable discoveries in medicine have met with a similar reception among these may be included inoculation of the smallpox against which the clamor became so considerable that it fell into disuse for several years to regulate the disputes which the introduction of that practice into this country occasioned and to direct the controversy to the true points at issue dr jurin then secretary to the royal society judiciously stated that the fate of inoculation depended upon the decision of the two following questions  first whether the distemper given by inoculation be an effectual security to the patient against his having the smallpox afterward in the natural way  secondly whether the hazard of the inoculation be considerably less than that of the natural smallpox  the application of these remarks to our inquiries into the merits of the vaccine compared with those of the variolous inoculation is too obvious to require being pointed out now if by distemper in the first query we understand that of the cowpox and if in the second we add new immediately before inoculation and substitute inoculated for natural i would answer both questions in the affirmative presuming that the facts already brought forward on the subject clearly decide the cowpock inoculation to be preferable to that of the smallpox  an opinion has been propagated and with several persons has had considerable influence that the power of resisting the insection of the smallpox which the constitution derives from the vaccine disease will continue only for a few years but this is mere conjecture contradicted by facts of casual cases of cowpox and contrary to analogy  we have abundant evidence to show that the cowpox and smallpox are closely allied and the effects of the former by preventing the action of the latter seem to prove that these diseases are in respect to a very principal point essentially the same and as the change which the constitution undergoes from the vaccine disease producing the effect abovementioned must be similar to that occasioned by the smallpox why should it not be equally permanent  in regard to the comparative mildness of the vaccine and variolous diseases as produced from inoculation i have been enabled to give a very different report from that which i published last year the reason why several of the cowpox cases then at the hospital proved severe like those of the inoculated smallpox has already been sufficiently explained and will i trust have the effect of placing the cowpock inoculation in a more advantageous point of view than my former reports presented  i have before observed that of the last  000 cases of cowpox under my care not a single alarming symptom was excited and i may now add that during the last eight months i have not met with one instance of the vaccine disease which has not been as favorable as the mildest cases of variolous inoculation i have no doubt therefore that the inoculated cowpox is as much milder than the inoculated smallpox as the latter disease is milder than the casual smallpox nay it seems to me from the very benign form in which the vaccine pock has of late invariably appeared that it may be considered as a disease perfectly harmless in its effects  indeed upon this consideration several persons have been persuaded to have their children inoculated for the disease although they were very doubtful of the reality of its antivariolous power for if it proved a security to the children against the infection of the smallpox the object would be attained by the safest means if it did not no harm would arise from the experiment since it was tried merely as a preliminary expedient to the inoculation for the smallpox the result however has constantly furnished additional evidence in favor of the new inoculation and of course has tended greatly to promote the adoption of it in london  another consideration highly important to the community is that as the cowpox unless from the adventitious circumstances beforementioned very rarely if ever appears with variolouslike pustules it would seem incapable of propagating itself by effluvia a child who had neither undergone the smallpox nor cowpox slept every night in the same bed with its father mother and brother during the whole time the three latter were under inoculation for the cowpox yet the child did not receive the disease till sometime afterward in consequence of inoculation hence by the substitution of the vaccine for the variolous inoculation the casual spreading of the smallpox from the inoculated a circumstance which has greatly contributed to swell the bills of mortality for the metropolis and of which the public has long justly complained is completely avoided nor is it unreasonable to conclude that if the new inoculation were to be universally adopted the variolous disease in process of time may be wholly extinguished  in my former publication on the cowpox i subjoined a tabular statement of the cases in order to show at one view the result of each and it was my intention to continue this table so as to include all the inoculations that have since been under my direction but as i now find such a statement could not be comprised in less than one hundred pages and from what has already been observed would be rendered in a great measure useless i trust the reader will readily excuse its omission i shall therefore conclude the subject with some practical remarks  those who have had much experience in inoculating with the matter of the vaccine pock must have observed that it is more apt to fail in communicating the infection than variolous matter especially if it be suffered to dry upon the lancet before it is used this does not seem to depend upon the virus of the former being more volatile and more easily carried off by evaporation than that of the latter but from its becoming more hard and less dissoluble upon exsiccation care should therefore be taken to moisten it a considerable time before it is used when fluid matter is employed the lancet should be held nearly at a right angle with the skin in order that the infectious fluid may gravitate to the point of the instrument which in this direction should be made to scratch the cuticle repeatedly until it reach the true skin and become tinged with blood this method has many advantages over the common puncture and i have found it a more convenient and effectual mode of performing the inoculation than any other it may be remarked however that there are persons who have never had the smallpox and are incapable of receiving it by inoculation or by any other means whatever the proportion of these to those liable to the disease have been differently stated by authors i have not found them to be more than about one in sixty but as such persons also resist the infection of the cowpox the inoculation of the latter must therefore sometimes fail independently of the mode in which it is performed or of the matter employed  when a considerable tumor and an extensive redness take place at the inoculated part within two or three days after the infectious matter has been applied the failure of inoculation may be considered as certain as where neither redness nor tumor is the consequence this rapid and premature advancement of the inflammation will always be sufficient to prevent the inoculator from mistaking such cases for those of efficient inoculation but there are other circumstances under which i have found the inoculation to be equally ineffectual and which as being more likely to deceive the inoculator require his utmost circumspection and discrimination i here allude to cases in which it happens that though the local affection does not exhibit much more inflammation than is usual yet neither vesicle nor pustule supervenes and in which about the sixth or seventh day it rapidly advances into an irregular suppuration producing a festering or crustaceous sore care however should be taken to distinguish this case from that in which the inoculated part assumes a pustular form though it continue for one or two days only when the same appearances follow as those above described for i have experienced the latter inoculation to be as effectual as where the tumor has proceeded in the most regular manner these observations which i hope will be found useful to inoculators are drawn from a considerable number of cases some of which created in my mind much anxiety for the reputation of the cowpox for until i had ascertained the discriminating circumstances here pointed out i considered every new appearance of morbid action which seemed to take place at the inoculated part before the usual period at which the disease affects the constitution as suggesting a doubt with respect to the efficacy of the inoculation hence i sometimes judged it necessary to inoculate the same patient a second third and even a fourth time some parents however were unwilling to subject their children to a repetition of the inoculation and could not be prevailed upon to comply without much difficulty even where their refusal might have been of fatal consequence i inoculated two children of the same family for the cowpox the younger of whom was    months and the elder four years old on the fourth day the redness of the local affection in the elder extended to about onethird of an inch or more in diameter and no vesicle appeared on the sixth day the redness of the tumor was much increased on the following day the tumor suppurated and produced a superficial ulcer for two or three days when the induration and inflammation of the part wholly went off and the fore healed in the younger child the progress of the infection was perfectly regular throughout all its stages and the disease was extremely mild on the sixth day i told the parents of these children that the elder had not received the cowpox and that a second inoculation would be necessary at this they appeared surprised and observed that the inoculation had produced more effect upon the elder than the younger child however on the ninth day they suffered me to reinoculate the elder in both arms when each puncture produced the true vaccine pustule and the infection proceeded in the most regular manner  of mistakes arising from ineffectual cases of the variolous inoculation many instances have come under my knowledge one of which was so very remarkable that i shall relate it here not more than two months ago i was desired to attend a boy about five years old affected with the casual smallpox of the most confluent kind  i was informed by the father that his son who was then ill of the smallpox had been inoculated for this disease three years before by mr  who was a professional man of much experience but as no pustules were produced from the inoculation he requested mr  to try the effect of a second inoculation and this request he earnestly repeated at different times mr  however declined it and assured him that his child was perfectly secure against the smallpox the boy was therefore suffered to play with his sister while she was under inoculation and from her he received the disease of which he died were the vaccine inoculation to be followed with a similar event it is highly probable that without adverting to the cause it would be brought forward as a proof that the cowpox has not the power of preventing the smallpox and considering that of late the new inoculation has been very generally practiced i am surprised that evidence against it of this description has not yet been brought before the public  the time at which the cowpox affects the constitution after the virus has been applied appears to be differently stated by inoculators according to my observations it corresponds nearly to that of the variolous inoculation however it not unfrequently happens that a rash takes place as soon as the local action of the infectious matter becomes evident the efflorescence at the inoculated part which seldom supervenes before the eighth or latter than the eleventh day is to be regarded as an indicacation that the whole system is affected and if the patient has not felt any indisposition on or before its approach he may be assured that there will not be any afterward when the efflorescence does not commence till the eleventh day it is almost always attended with more indisposition than when it occurs on the eighth or ninth day the efflorescence is more frequent in young infants than to children advanced to three or four years of age and the former have the efflorescence sooner and the disease more favorably than the latter insomuch that by far the greater part of them have no perceptible illness and require no medicines on the other hand in adults the cowpox frequently produces headache pain of the limbs and other febrile symptoms for two or three days which are greatly relieved by a brisk purgative  after the local tumor has advanced so far as to become a dry scab a few scattered papulous or pustular eruptions sometimes appear these however are seldom of long continuance and the pustules rarely suppurate but when they do the pus they contain is capable of producing the disease by inoculation i have inoculated some children for the cowpox whose parents have been desirous that two or three variolouslike pustules should be produced which i have generally though not always been able to accomplish by taking a little of the vaccine matter from the inoculated part upon a needle and with it making a slight puncture in those parts where it was wished the pustules should appear this should be done about the eighth or ninth day or when the efflorescence commences if recent variolous matter be used instead of the vaccine the effect will be the same with regard to the appearance of pustules from the vaccine inoculation i shall extract the following communication by dr pearson which clearly shows that dr jenners opinion upon this subject is contradicted by facts    in a person inoculated by dr jenner in the country who came to town and was under the care of mr cotton the eruptions bore much resemblance to the inoculated smallpox in number from twelve to twenty see mr cottons letter to dr pearson    no one has been more active and successful than mr ring this gentleman whose experience i know has been very extensive could not avoid eruptive cases although he got matter with great pains from different sources i have says mr ring in his letter to dr pearson inoculated thirty patients with matter given to me by mr paytherus and to him by jenner one of these had about   0 pustules these were not distinguishable from variolous ones by any diagnostics with which i am acquainted the matter was purulent became perfectly opaque and on exsiccation formed a scab as large as that left by the smallpox was the virus used in these cases pure and uncontaminated a gentleman lately obtained some vaccine matter from the inoculation hospital which produced a full eruption of pustules that this was owing to some mistake i have no doubt but whatever was the cause i think it right to mention it as an exception to what has been before noticed   london printed by wm phillips george yard lombard street
