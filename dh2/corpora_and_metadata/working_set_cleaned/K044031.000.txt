remarks on some observations on dr browns dissertation on poetry and music in a letter to the author of the observations  london printed for l davis and c reymers against graysinngate holborn printers to the royal society mdcclxiv  remarks etc i address the following remarks to you not because i pretend to guess at your person but because i think you are most interested in them and i send you them plain and simple without prefacing them either with compliments or acrimony  i entirely agree with you in your first general observation p   that of most if not all arts or exertions of human faculty those which dr brown has chosen for his subject are most liable to be influenced by a variety of causes seemingly most remote and minute and most difficult to be observed but surely your conclusion is not logical that to think by laying down one or a few principles to deduce the progress of them systematically is parallel to almanackmakers foretelling the weather in my opinion the present question is not whether they can be solved systematically or not but whether dr b  s solution is just or groundless and if you apply this conclusion to his work before you have examined it your determination must be ranked with the judgments of those countries where they behead a man first and try afterward whether he is guilty  your second observation is of the unimportance of such investigations as being mere amusing gratifications of curiosityyet if you are really in earnest how came you who have affected to display so large a fund of reading to have  p   employed so much of your thoughts on a small part of this very subject and ibid if ever you publish your thoughtsi appeal to your own heart in what estimation you would hold the man who should tell you they were of no importance to mankind or rank them as you have done dr b  s with almanackmaking  your third objection of the doctorial manner and air of science with which it has been fashionable of late to advance conjectures is at least not liberal if dr b  s conjectures are false it ought to be triumph enough for you to prove them so if on the contrary notwithstanding your arguments they prove true ought they not to be advanced with the confidence of truth by a man who knows them so  i entirely acquiesce in your fourth observation that since truth is the principal purpose these investigations can answer misrepresentation or even error in matter of fact is less excusable in them than in any other kind of enquiry except in such as yours and mine where if we misrepresent either through prejudice or partiality or err in matters of fact when we would correct the errors of others then we are less excusable because we are less honest  so much may suffice for your preliminaries the body of your work remains now to be examined    you say i will not take the advantage of the obvious ridicule which arises from the searching the seeds and principles of all the most refined and transporting poetry of greece in the dreary wilds of north america p     it is indeed out of the common road for dr b to carry us so far in quest of brutality when he might have found it so much nearer home among the old pelasgi of ancient greece who certainly were no better than the modern iroquois we know they were acorneaters and maneaters  sylvestres homines sacer interpresque deorum caedibus and victu foedo deterruit orpheus horace   this is the most we know of them and this we know of the modern iroquois too but then we know a great dealmore now what we know of the mordern iroquois dr b on the foundation of analogy applies to the old pelasgi he attempts to prove by an easy chain of reasoning that in case of a supposed civilization of iroquois such consequences might naturally be expected to arise as did actually arise in ancient greece and viceversa that as the old pelasgi were once in the same state as the iroquois are now they actually did proceed by the same steps as these would probably do upon a similar civilization the argument is new i confess but is not therefore to be treated with contempt if the principles on which all savage tribes proceed are always simple and nearly the same in all making only some small allowance for the difference of soil and climate if the similarity of causes and effects be too clear and convincing to be denied in a word if even where variations of character arise they serve rather to illustrate than confound the subject certainly any conclusions properly drawn from so amazing an analogy must fall little short of demonstration  the method then of argumentation no rational man can object to let us therefore see whether dr b  has sustained it properly in those parts which regard ancient greece  you begin with a very material point which if once made out would overthrow dr b  s hypothesis from the foundation you tell us it is taken for granted all along that the poetry and music and legislation and religion of greece were entirely the spontaneous productions of that climate but that it is certain the first seeds of them were imported p   you then appeal to ancient authors and affirm from them that dr bs system cannot hold since their first civilizers did certainly introduce foreign gods and were not the object of worship themselves p     to prove that it was otherwise you cite herodotus and you say he assures us that the pelasgi had no more than some general notion of a superior power who made the world p    now how can you whose work professes to be built on the pillar of strict quotation how can you begin with so egregious an untruth in your translation you have represented the pelasgi acorneaters and maneaters as pure theists and it seems it was orpheus who afterward debased them into gross idolaters euterpe l     now herodotus says nothing of all this he mentions not a superior power but expressly says gods  nor does he speak one word of their making but only of their governing the world p    and is not this a palmary argument in proof of their having no religion that they worshipped the gods who in their opinion governed the world  well but it seems they knew no name for any divinity the names of their gods were brought from egypt and if their gods had been their own chiefs their names would have been better remembered than any thing else p    here i confess with pleasure is some appearance of good reasoning  but to set this matter in its true light and acquaint you whence it probably came to pass that the savage pelasgi had no names for their gods i must in imitation of dr b carry you once more among your new acquaintances the savages of america  you must know then that the savage tribes seldom retain the particular name of the chieftain whom they deify and worship and the reason of this is because he generally loses it even before be dies when he is exalted to the rank of chief his former name is commonly dropped and a new appellation is given him suited to the station he is raised to this title rather than name is generally that of father senior or sun of the tribe in proof of this i might refer you to all the writers on the manners of savage tribes on this subject however lafitau and the lettres edifiantes will give you ample satisfaction under this state of things the savage tribes offer sacrifice consult oracles and perform the general acts of a native religion this then seems to have been the idolatrous state of the old pelasgi they probably worshipped their first savage chieftains for it is clear on the evidence of herodotus himself that they offered sacrifice to their gods and consulted the oracle of dodona whether they should give the egyptian names to their own deities herod ib  two circumstances which prove even to demonstration that they had deities before the time of orpheus  you will say what then did orpheus introduce if he introduced not the gods of greece why herodotus tells us as plain as words can tell us he introduced mysteries  and that he might distinguish the native gods whom he found already established by a general worship he appropriated particular rites to each and to this end very properly distinguished each god by a particular appellation but sure never was critic so unlucky in his remarks as you for it has been made appear by a learned writer that these  these very mysteries which orpheus introduced to greece were so far from being the beginnings of hero worship that they were intended as a detection to the initiated of the errors of preestablished polytheism div leg of moses b ii sect     it appears then that the oldest gods of greece were strictly native i shall now prove that they were the chiefs and first civilizers of the savage inhabitants that they were such is evident from the testimony of several ancient authors founded on the traditions of the country which are the only original evidences that can be obtained in a case of this nature  the first and chief of these was he to whom orpheus it seems gave the name of jupiter this old chieftain was born in crete and was brought young by his mother into greece strabo l x  he conquered the titans probably another tribe of savages at enmity with the pelasgi and civilized the inhabitants of the country which he subdued diodorus l iii  after he had vanquished the titans he is said by some authors to have instituted the olympian games in commemoration of his victory pausanias l v   another of these most ancient gods of greece to whom orpheus gave the name of apollo was a chief who killed the serpent python and the tyrant titius taught the inhabitants of greece the use of the fruits of the earth and civilized the inhabitants of several districts strabo l ix   two more of these ancient gods of greece were the famed brothers castor and pollux they were natives of the little isle of pephnos near messene pausanias l  and taught the lacedaemonians the arts of dancing and of war lucian de saltatione   now these four are the very ancient gods whom dr b has singled out as being delivered down to posterity under the characters of musicians singers and dancers all of them chiefs and civilizers of ancient greece in some department or other of legislation  but he might have added several more of this class was mercury he was born in greece pausanias arcad  was the inventor of the lyre and is said to have been deified for this invention eliac   another deification i must not pass over you have led me to it yourself it is that of bacchus whose love of wine dance and music is too well known to need a comment you speak of his mysteries as being not of grecian but foreign original and thence you conclude that the god himself was so i need hardly bid you turn back to the preceding pages to put you in mind how inconclusive this argument is the old chieftain himself was a civilizer of greece though his mysteries introduced by orpheus were egyptian you will demand a proof of the god being a civilizer of greece take the following account then which unfortunately contains as ample a confutation of all you have advanced on this subject as any heart can wish philonides informs us that the vine having been transplated from the borders of the red sea into greece by bacchus  the greeks when the unmixed wine is brought to table at supper invoke the good genius or god honoring or worshipping the power who invented it this god is bacchus athen deip l xv   thus your capital objection to dr bs system seems absolutely untenable and void of all foundation    you proceed next to object against his account of the origin of poetic numbers p        etc what you have advanced on this subject i shall only style an instance of your power of representation  you confound the origin of poetry with the origin of mere rythm nor perhaps is it necessary that a mere critic should know the difference  you represent savages in their lowest state of nature to have no leisure for amusement when if you will read you will find they have more leisure than any civilized nations  you charge dr b with representing them as going formally to work with an apriori notion of harmony and measure to adapt their words to music when in reality he tells you from lafitau that they dance and sing and join their words to their music as well as they can and to this end that they even retrench and strike off some syllables from their wordsthat they may tally better with their dance and music and hence the natural origin of rythm or numbers  you own that the dance cannot be totally without measure and yet you deny its tendency to produce a correspondent measure in the annexed words  you say that violent emotions of the mind naturally produce harmonious periods yet though you are very angry through your whole work you never produce one harmonious period  such are the materials of this article which i shall leave to the readers contemplations    but you have not yet done with the old deities of greece you say you remember a passage of aristotle full in the teeth of dr bs system wherein it is observed that the poets never represent jupiter singing p    truly neither does dr b for he only says on the authority of a very old poet that jupiter danced it is a little hard upon the father of gods and men thus to tie him hand and foot because he wanted an ear or happened to be hoarse and because he did not sing that you will not let him dance neither good sir be a little more ingenuous in your application of ancient authors  but you affirm that arctinus mentions jupiters dancing as a thing unusual lb  now why did not you refer to the passage in athenaeus which you here allude to was it for fear the reader might consult it  with some trouble i have found it and am sorry to say i have detected you in what an illiberal critic would call a downright falsehood the following is a literal translation of the passage eumelus or arctinus the corinthian somewhere introduces jupiter dancing saying among them danced the sire of gods and men deip l i  not a syllable occurs here on its being either an usual or unusual thing  but it seems the character of the poet should be ascertained whether serious or burlesque etc before any thing concerning the whole system of grecian religion be determined by one quotation at secondhand from him p      you are a notable logician  but it happens that the proof of dr bs system does not depend upon this one quotation he has in the course of his dissertation given twenty more which are generally corroborative of this    you next come to consider dr bs account of the origin of poetic history you charge dr b with misquoting and misrepresenting the author of the life of homer in order to bring him to his own purpose p     but in reality all that dr b has done is to express that properly which the author of the life of homer had expressed improperly both their expressions imply the same thing you farther charge dr b indeed with turning spanish works into arabic ones p     now these spanish fragments are indeed arabic by descent and this is evidently dr bs meaning but you i find being ignorant of their original did not comprehend his meaning    on the subject of ancient laws being written in verseyou say the actions of their gods and heroes were such as could not be a foundation for moral exhortations to imitation p     here i suspect that instead of putting yourself in the place of the savages you have put the savages in your place certainly to a modern englishman the actions of their gods and heroes could never have seemed a worthy model for imitation yet to an ancient savage greek an acorneater and a maneater they might very well pass for such plunder and revenge as you observe p     being what the savage chiefly values an exhortation to this purpose would naturally be included in the songfeast     you say i would fain know why the doctor should suppose the practice of religious dance and song to have necessarily arisen from a false religion which as he himself takes notice made a part of the true p     but where has the doctor asserted that they necessarily arose that they naturally arose both among pagans and jews he has made it very evident now why should we have recourse to a pedantic principle of imitation void of evidence for a practice which manifestly arises from nature i expect you will prove in your next work that all pagans learnt of the jews how to beget children and eat their victuals    you now come to the old poetic oracles of greece so far as the affair of mere reasoning is concerned i shall again leave you to the natural penetration of the reader with respect to the literary part of the argument i at length give you joy of a small discovery for you have detected dr b in calling an ancient priestess of apollo by the name of phemonoe instead of herophile i wish you had been as successful in your next attack  for the main point worth contending for an this subject is whether the ancient pythian oracles were the effect of enthusiasm to prove that they were not you bring a story from homer who tells us of a wonderful feat of apollo who  st changed himself into a dolphin  dly drove the cretan voyagers from their course at sea  dly appeared to them qu in his own shape or the dolphins and told them they were to be his sacrificers  thly that the poor fellows being hungry he assured them they need not fear for a subsistence for that he could foretell they should live comfortably on the sacrifices on which they believed him and became his priests  now on this curious and authentic trait of history which you call rational and probable you found the rise of the delphic oracle believe your creed who may i shall not endeavor to shake his faith but in respect to those who may think that any thing can possibly be fabulous which comes from that most scrupulous and true historian old homer i can only set against him the weak authority of that poetical and lying romancer diodorus the sicilian now this author tells us in the most express terms that the rise of this famed oracle was from enthusiasm that the first diviners being seized with this began to prophecy and were agitated with wild and frantic gestures which were so violent that many of them leapt into the deep cleft of the earth near the place where now the temple of delphi stands and that in process of time the diviner or pythia was confined to the tripos as the means of preventing the like fatal consequences diodorus l     this whole account confirms all that dr b has advanced concerning the origin of the old poetic oracles of greece it overturns all the objections you have mustered on this subject and as to the illiberal misrepresentations of dr bs method of reasoning which close your argument i am quite ashamed of them and might give you for answer a maxim of your own that a buffoon always places things in that light which is most advantageous to his satire p        on the subject of the greek melody you say you have little to object and for the same reason perhaps i have nothing to object and i fear the reason is because we do not understand it  however you are even with him in the next paragraph in which you prove yourself a greater adept in prosody not only than dr b but even than the learned vossius himself and here you have laid hold of a fair opportunity of exposing dr b for another mans ignorance at least if not for his own on this important head therefore i will lay down a brace of maxims built on your most ingenious criticism which i defy him and all his adherents to overturn   that a writer is answerable for any incidental error of the author whom he quotes though it be not essential to his subject   that though the author who made a trifling mistake may be a man of sense and learning yet he who passes it unnoticed must be an ignorant blockhead   0 you own that the power of the greek melody is justly attributed by dr b to the power of association p      but  ay right or wrong there must be a but  but this is in effect owning that it is in a great measure unaccountable ib  let us see now how this argument stands  if we know that it is justly attributed to association then surely we know what association means and if so then i apprehend it is clearly accounted for  had i not been tolerably acquainted with you before i arrived at this logical paragraph i should have wondered to hear a man saying and unsaying the same thing at a breath  well but we will pass over this as one of those propositions you speak of which are neither true nor false we will suppose that all you mean to assert is only what follows that their particular associations being unknown the particular nature of their melody which arose from these associations must be unknown likewise  this is a proposition which has both sense and truth in it but then unluckily for you it is the very thing that dr b asserts for he tells you even again and again that notwithstanding all the pretenses of your whole critical fraternity we know nothing particular about the matter     but now you hasten into the midst of things and to confess the truth take such strides in absurdity that it requires some pains to follow you  dr b says their songs were of a legislative cast and being drawn chiefly from the fables or history of their own country contained the essential parts of their religious political and moral systems  this it seems you cannot digest and yet i fear you will be compelled to swallow it   first you acknowledge that the songs of orpheus and amphion were of this legislative cast that they employed them to persuade the savages to live together sociably and without injuring each other and to worship the gods p     so far we go together  but as soon as the conveniences of life began to abound they began to seek amusement and then it is in the light of pleasing and charming not sage or useful we find them considered ib  now with all due deference to the contrary opinion and practice of a learned critic who lards his sentences with scraps of greek may not a work be at once pleasing and instructive or to express myself in a way more suitable to the taste of certain writers because less intelligible to half their readers may not the utile and the dulce be joined together as a full proof that this was the fact in the poems of the ancient greeks i need only refer to what dr b has quoted from plato dissert sect v art     there it appears at large that the poems of their bards were taught to their children as the foundation both of their opinions and their manners and the very reason is assigned by plato why this method of instruction was used because the youthful mind is not apt to attend to serious study therefore the pleasing vebicle of song is to be administered  but you urge further that the bards profession was not of that dignity which dr b ascribes to it and as for his ranking the bard next to kings i can quote him two passages where he is ranked with carpenters p      you might have saved yourself the trouble because dr b himself has produced an instance from another country ireland where the bards had thought proper to rank themselves with thieves and robbers dissert p      yet in this very country there had been a time when they were ranked with kings and gods ib p      this shrewd observation therefore arises only from your being unfairly carried off your ground and obliged to talk on a subject you are not acquainted with you suppose the dignity of the bards character to have been always stationary and the same whereas indeed it appears from dr bs work that it was generally fluctuating according to the accidental changes in civilization arts and manners  again you say had homers work been legislative his business would have been to deliver a more perfect and improved system in each kind p     how do you know that has homer himself told you so upon what authority do you make homer wiser than he was and wiser than the times had made him he painted what he saw and believed says dr b and painted truly the fault lay in the opinions and manners of the times in the defects of an early and barbarous legislation which had but halfcivilized mankind dissert p      but now after having granted that homer did not deliver a perfect and improved system of doctrines you proceed like a profound philosopher to prove that he did p     0  your argumentation on this head i shall leave to the natural and common sense of the reader only adding this remark that homers fables were such a picture of life and morals as plato in a more refined period thought proper to banish from his republic lest they should destroy all good morals  dr b has particularized some of the chief of them which sufficiently justify platos censure differt p      you next proceed to pindar and here when i found you allowed that the poetic songs must abound with reflections on what was laudable or the contrary and with pictures and recommendations of what that age and nation reputed virtueand also that fables built on the current traditions at once struck the imagination soothed the vanity and excited the awful respect of the hearers p     now said i we are happily agreed but see the vanity of human hopes in the very next line we are all broke to pieces for it seems pindars intermixed fables were so far from being necessary to his odes that in his first ode he wrote without mixing fables at all until an elder and more experienced artist corinna told him how necessary they were ib   i durst hold an even wager that this same corinna was a sensible old woman you see she was instructing a young greek divine in the art of preaching you tell us too that he followed her advice marry and with good reason for it appears from dr bs dissertation as well as corinnas advice that fables were regarded as an essential part of the performance dissert p         your subsequent remark is a downright triumph for here you prove irrefragably that dr b has called pindars chair a chair of gold when in reality it was only a chair of iron this is the second error you have luckily hit by which you have more than made good the ancient proverb that once a blind man killed a batt i cannot conceive how dr b will bring himself off here unless he should perversely affirm that he speaks metaphorically and calls pindars a chair of gold in the same manner as if he were to speak of the chair in which certain modern critics sit and write he would call it a chair of lead  you go on the three greek tragedians says the doctor are the last of this illustrious catalogue of legislative bards  woe is me  for in the most private conversations i hve had they never gave me a hint of their being legislators or legislative writers p        no wonder they never whispered the secret to you who seem only to have been counting your fingers and scanning verses if they had whispered any thing to you i think i can guess what it would have been but you have set me an example of politeness and therefore notwithstanding all the friendly freedoms i take with you i will not so much as hint what it was the reeds whispered to midas  yet you allow that they hold forth the leading principles of the greek religion polity and morals and their subjects are the grecian gods and heroes p        here then you seem to carry about you more truth than you are aware of you remember what grave creature it was that formerly carried the mysteries and yet was never the wiser but i make no illnatured applications  but solon you say does not seem to have had that high idea of the tragic writers as useful servants of the state ib  what tragic writers the three that dr b speaks of solon was dead long before they existed you shall take your choice whether you will have this set down to the account of your learning or your modesty  but plutarch informs us that he expressed a great dislike of their art in the practice of thespis p     true he did so and you tell us yourself in another place what it was that solon disliked it was the new circumstance of dramatic representation p     but this was not the place for you to bring that circumstance into view because it would have unmasked your battery solon was alarmed at a a change in their poetic and musical contests which hitherto had maintained their simpler form and it was probably his high idea of their preestablished utility which induced him so severely to censure this innovation thus in the end this affair of solon and thespis tends to confirm dr bs opinion rather than to confute it  but now you suddenly come round and become quite goodhumoured nay you are willing to lend dr b a lift and produce a passage which tends to the confirmation of his system p        for you tell us euripides himself is introduced affirming that the reason why poets are to be honored is for their ingenuity salutary admonitions and bettering their fellowcitizens this is a method of confutation altogether new and very ingenious to confirm an adversarys system by proofs which he himself was ignorant of and thus to demonstrate your superiority  and now to close this article in your own manner i will also produce some additional evidenees in favor of dr bs system and then i think we shall have humbled him sufficiently between us  the doctor must know then for to be sure if he had known it he would have said it that in the ancient times of greece there was no other code either religious moral or political but the songs of their bards if there was even one let dr b produce it at his peril these songs or poems then were indeed the great repository of their principles having no real revelation or guide from heaven they took up with the best they could find and hence laid hold of the examples of their fabulous gods and heroes as the means of fixing the fluctuating principles of their refpective societies by a certain standard however defective these songs therefore may on this foundation be properly styled legislative because they actually stood in the place of law  in farther proof of this i will give dr b two or three authorities hesiod and homer says herodotus were they who formed a theogony for the greeks giving names to their gods and fixing their shapes or figures herod euterpe as a consequence of this a respectable modern tells us that the writings of homer became the standard of private belief and the grand directory of public worship life of homer p       another learned modern expresses himself in still stronger terms for speaking of the ancient greeks he affirms that homer was their bible and whatsoever was not read therein nor could be expressly proved thereby passed with them for apocryphal div leg of moses vol ii part i p    again he calls homer and hesiod the popular and only authorized books of divinity amongst the greeks which assign the names the attributes and the form to each god ib p      how it happened that these fables which were swallowed in times of ignorance came to be established in a more knowing age this learned person likewise inform us the great poets of greece who had most contributed to refine the public taste and manners and were now grown into a kind of sacred authority had sanctified these silly tales in their writings which time had now consigned to immortality lb vol i part ii p  0    now all these authorities every one of them tending to confirm his system dr b has ignorantly omitted and with an apriori notion as you elegantly style it has pretended to be wiser than his neighbors and gone about to prove with the most consummate arrogance that it must be so and that from the natural progression of savage manners it could not be otherwise  having thus sufficiently humbled dr b by bringing arguments in his favor which he knew nothing of we will now take leave of this article and proceed to number     you preface your criticisms on this article by stiling them loose observations p    which we must take without much order for you have not time enough to methodize them  and yet you have been a whole year in throwing up your crudities  your first loose observation on the   th article is this that although the greeks regarded music as a necessary part of a liberal education yet this only implies that it was an accomplishment parallel to dancing in present times and in proof of this you add that one modern author intitles his book on the subject the rudiments of genteel education p        i could have furnished you with an instance still more to your purpose of a dancing master who writ a treatise to prove that all the vices of the present age are owing to the neglect of dancing  you go on even the abstracted lock and rousseau insist on it in their treatises on education  may we not then conjecture the cases were in some measure alike ib  truly we might conjecture as we pleased if the clear evidence of antiquity was not against us but unluckily again dr b has proved from various ancient authors that their poems were the bible of ancient greece that these poems were sung both in public and private and not only so but that their children were taught to sing them to the lyre as the very first foundation of a virtuous education dissert sect v art    p    etc  he has proved that all this was done even before they learnt the gymnastic arts and these if you had been properly conversant with ancient manners were what you would have compared to modern dancing music says plato in a passage quoted by dr b relates to the mind the gymnastic to the improvement of the body dissert sect v art    p    etc   well but plato gives notice that when he speaks of music he includes the subject words or song and by the passage quoted from the alcibiades it appears that this was not the popular sense p     very true but very consistent with nay corroborative of all that dr b has said he has observed that in the time of plato the separation of poetry and music had commenced therefore it was proper and natural in plato to explain himself particularly whenever he writ on this subject and to inform his readers that he spoke of music in the ancient sense and not in the new in his alcibiades too he writ altogether according to character for it was natural for alcibiades a young debauche to adopt the new sense and for socrates to put him in mind of the old  you next charge dr b with writing in that style which is neither true nor false because he has not precisely fixed the point which separates what he calls the early from the late periods of antiquity with regard to the use of music merely instrumental y in this point you not a little resemble an honest lawyer at the bar who was examining a witness to a fact the witness said it happened between nine and ten in the morning was it at five minutes or ten minutes or a quarter or half or three quarters after nine said the honest lawyer the witness declaring he could not fix it to a few minutes the man of logic turned about to the jury and said now gentlemen i hope you are convinced that the fellow talks in a style that is neither true nor false and that he knows nothing of the matter  but it seems you have at length discovered a passage where dr b speaks of a particular period as an early one in which i will prove that a separation had taken place in a passage from strabo he speaks of something done after the crissaean war as done in ancient times ib  dr b says no such thing pray examine his book once again he says exactly what strabo says but unluckily you understand neither dr b nor strabo that author says that in ancient times there was a contest of musiciansand then he tells us farther that this was established at delphi after the crissaean war this dr b translates literally from strabo dissert p  0   who manifestly speaks of two distinct periods but the first of these happening to lie beyond the depth of your chronological plummet you have learnedly jumbled them into one the ancient times that dr b after strabo speaks of here were the times of apollo and his immediate followers  but of this you will hear more in due time  however an early period you are resolved to find though it make never so much against you if this should not satisfy the doctor pausanias in his history of the pythian contentions will tell him of one eleutheres whom he mentions before hesiod that gained the prize for mere execution singing a composition not his own he will tell him likewise that hesiod did not play on the harp so that there was a separation of the poets and musicians character very early p      certain stars there are which ray out light and others i have read of in a profound author which are said to ray out darkness of this latter kind is the paragraph before us which in this sense may be styled of the first magnitude it requires no common genius for absurdity to crowd so much of it into so small a compass as you have put into this short paragraph the point in question is whether at this early period there was an allowed separation of vocal and instrumental music in the public contests dr b affirms there was not and you bring this passage to prove that there was now whoever will look into pausanias will find from this very passage  st that eleutheres because he could join the vocal with instrumental music was allowed to sing the composition of another and hesiod because he could not join them was not allowed to sing his own pausanias phoc  his not being able to join the vocal and instrumental melody was regarded as such a defect in this poet as all his eminent talents could not make up for thus the very passage which you bring in confutation of dr bs system when fairly and honestly given to the reader is a collateral proof of the truth of all he has said on the subject  these cavils arise manifestly from your power of representation the next to give you your due is chiefly the effect of pure ignorance this relates to the second instance which dr b has alleged concerning the power of ancient music on this you observe that the instrument in question was the flute both quintilian and iamblicus agree and how the most able musician could play on this instrument and sing too i do not well conceive except it could be proved that the  was that truly respectable and ancient instrument the scottish bagpipe p     right sorry i am to lie under a necessity of exposing the errors of a learned critic who piques himself on a familiarity with all ancient authors  now that the instrument was the  or tibia these authors do both agree but did they agree to give you leave to translate or transform it into a flute a pipe if you please but the name and fashion of a flute are so connected in the idea of a modern that by this transition you carry your cause at once even before your argument comes on every flute is indeed a pipe but every pipe is not a flute and here lies the whole mystery of the matter for in the first place you will see from the passage you have quoted from pausanias that echembrotus gained the prize at the pythian games for singing and playing on the pipe there was the song to the harp as formerly there was the song to the pipe and there was the pipe itself without song cephalon won the prize among those who sung and played on the harp echembrotus among those who sung and played on the pipe sacadas among those who played on the pipe only pausan in phocicis   that the same person sung and played on the pipe is evident  st from the greek name  which is compound and implies both  dly from the circumstance recorded of hesiod that he was not admitted to the pythian contest because he could not both sing and play  farther it is evident from many passages in theocritus particularly from his  th eidyllium that the shepherds both sung and played on their pastoral pipe at the same time in their contention they are represented as accompanying their song with the pipe and to prepare us for this union we are told in the opening of the pastoral that they were both skilled in playing on the pipe both skilled in singing  in virgils eclogues this union of the shepherds pipe and song is no less clearly alluded to sylvestrem tenui musam meditaris avena  formosam resonare doces amaryllida sylvas ecl i  in which passage we have the subject of his song and the instrument with which he accompanies it  again an mihi cantando victus non redderet ille quem mea carminibus meruisset fistula caprum ecl iii  once more in the same eclogue the union is expressly declared cantando tu illum aut unquam tibi fistula cera juncta fuit non tu in triviis indocte solebas stridenti miserum stipula disperdere carmen there is a hint at it in the following lines which however i give you chiefly for the sake of a picture it contains which perhaps you may know the next time you look in your glass aut hic ad veteres fagos quum daphnidis arcum fregisti and calamos quae tu perverse menalca et cum vidisti puero donata dolebas et si non aliqua nocuisses mortuus esses again and if possible in still clearer terms  o mihi tum quam molliter ossa quiescant vestra meos olim si fistula dicat amores ecl x  i could transcribe several other passages but shall conclude with the following in which the shepherd invokes his pipe his tibia the very instrument in question to accompany his song  incipe moenalios mecum mea tibia versus ecl vii   as to the means by which this union was accomplished whether the pipe was inflated from above or from below by wind or by water i shall leave to your investigation is is a subject too sublime for me to attempt but every way worthy of your exalted genius on this therefore i shall commend you to your most profound meditations guided by julius pollux bartholine and other learned men who have written de tibiis veterum in the mean time please to accept if you will condescend so far a little information from that poor ignorant fellow isaac vossius si solas exceperis organicas fistulas quae in templis vulgo usurpantur vix ullas invenias alias quae tibiarum dignae sunt vocabulo de poem cantu p      ascaul seu utricularii veterum nihil omnino discrepant ab hodiernis organariis ib p     according to this author you see you are ignorant even of the genealogy of a bagpipe i am sorry to be under a necessity of joining my evidence to his against you for you must know the true scotch bagpipe still used in the highlands is blown by the mouth and that blown by the bellows is a theft from the continent and probably as the passage of vossius implies delivered down from ancient times     your next attack on dr b is upon the subject of the hymnal or lyric species and here you charge him with confounding two things together which were essentially different you affirm that the hymn was always written in heroic measure and was the more ancient form of the two that the lyric ode was always written in varied measures and was much later in its production being no older than the age of thespis p           you are so confident of the propriety and truth of this distinction that you insult dr b on his ignorance and boast that by this argument alone you have cut and torn his cobweb hypothesis p      of all the men of criticism i ever read you my friend are the most unfortunate had you been as well acquainted with ancient authors as you are with your prosody you would not have given dr b such an opportunity of exposing your ignorance i will prevent your having the mortification of being severely chastised and will lay on the rod as gently as i can by referring you to a passage in dr bs history of the rise and progress of poetry which i have now lying before me it is a quotation from proclus in which that author tells us that in the pythian nomos or hymn in praise of apollo terpander who lived after the age of homer was the first who used the hexameter or heroic verse and that after him phrynes joined this to the various or lyric measure which alone had been employed before terpandrum vero nomon absolvisse apparet cum adibuisset heroicum carmen  phrynes vero novam rationem commentus est hexametrum enim cum soluto carmine conjanxit proclus apud photium  see the passage quoted at large below p        here then it appears that both what you call the hymnal and the lyric measure were actually employed together and this many ages before thespis existed it appears farther to the total annihilation of all your critical pretensions that the various or lyric measure  solutum carmen was the more ancient of the two in this pythian hymn or song so far from being the the invention of the age of thespis it was from the earliest times employed in the pythian song even as far back as the times of apollo indeed it had been very strange had it been otherwise that regular hexameters should have been invented before irregular rythms were used could never have been supposed by any one whose researches had gone beyond his prosody but there the hexameter standing first in rank it was natural enough for a mere scanner of verses to imagine it was the first in the order of nature but how consistent you are with yourself in another place i leave yourself to determine you have told us before that in the rudest periods of society the passions of men naturally produce a loose kind of verse p    etc the solutum carmen and now toward your conclusion you tell us that the loose kind of verse the solutum carmen had no existence till about the time of thespis and that the regular hexameter existed long before it you might as reasonably affirm that savages built palaces before caves and cabins had existence     you next proceed to deliver your sentiments concerning the rise and progress of tragedy but as you confess that it is no more than what every school boys knows p     i shall save myself the trouble of commenting on it this being indeed the vulgar track of criticism which dr b has set himself to expose through the course of his work as therefore you offer no new evidences but only retail the old ones which every school boy knows i shall leave this part of your observations to shift for itself with this general remark which truth compels me to make that the inconsistency and disagreement of the several ancient writers which you quote on this subject is so glaring that in fact they overturn each others authority and would induce any unprejudiced man to go in quest of some more general and rational foundation for the rise of tragedy than the mere accidental adventure of thespis and his route and this i perceive is one of the main purposes of dr bs inquiry with which if you please we will therefore go on  to this you say i have a few objections to urge   st i would fain know if this be the natural origin of tragedy how it came to pass that in all nations except greece the more pathetic drama is without a chorus at all r critic be a little more cautious in your assertions in three other instances where tragedy has arisen from nature among the chinese proper indians and peruvians dr b has shown that in the first there is a manifest remnant of a choir in the second a choir actually exists and in the third that of peru we know not whether there was a choir or not disiert p     etc  so far is it from the truth what you assert that in all nations except greece the more pathetic drama is without a chorus  again you object if the rise and progress of tragedy be so extremely natural since every thing that is natural is universal how came this species of poetry to arise or be cultivated in athens only which that it was we have platos word p      my remarks on this observation are   st every thing that is natural is not universal because there are different degrees of civilization and knowledge among mankind which are attended with accidents or improvements peculiar and natural to each but not universal or natural to all    dramatic representation was not cultivated at athens only it has been cultivated in china in india and peru though we have not platos word for it    the degree of civilization and the concomitant powers of the mind may be so weak among many nations as never to produce the dramatic form which was the case among some of the tribes of ancient greece as likewise of ancient gaul britain and other countries    the progress of poetry up to the dramatic form may be checked by a variety of accidents either internal or external by accidents internal as among the egyptians where the first rude forms of poem and melody were established by law which prevented all change that is either improvement or corruption and again as among the hebrews where the purity of religion prevented their poetry from assuming the dramatic form  by accidents external as where war conquest a subversion of religion or government destroyed that original system of pagan principles on which natural tragedy is built and if by any of these the original form of tragedy was once changed it could not probably be renewed by the mere force of nature  i have been the more particular on this article because the objection though ignorantly made by you gave room for a farther opening of the main subject  but  dly you object that unfortunately it is declared as fully as any thing can or need be that the ancient tragedy consisted of a chorus alone and without an actor p      i suppose you mean it was so at athens but does it therefore follow that it wore the same form every where else dr b has proved in a passage which must soon rise up in judgment against you that even in the earliest celebration of the pythian games at delphi there was a narrative if not a dramatic episode divided into five acts from this passage it farther appears that long before the time of thespis or even of homer this episode was performed by a single person and not by the choir see hist of poetry p   0 etc the passage is quoted below p  0     now if this existed at delphi even soon after the age of apollo what is it to the purpose to say that it did not exist at athens dr b is investigating the rise of tragedy from nature and finds its first rude form existing at delphi in or about the time of apollo and to disprove this you most philosophically endeavor to make it out that it did not appear at athens till many ages after this is another of your new modes of confutation  your  th objection is as follows it will likewise follow from the doctors system that the choral part would be of course only an appendage to the episode and the chorus would be but a supposed spectator of the action or a subordinate personagein it but that the contrary does happen in striking instances is well known to those whose ideas of greek tragedy are taken from eschylus euripides and sophocles not merely from dissertations bibliothecas and institutiones poeticae p      again  the chorus in several ancient tragedies are themselves principal personages and deeply interested  in two eumenides and iketides they are the leading personages etc p      in reply to this i shall give you the following paragraph from dr bs history of poetry  by thus tracing the tragic choir to its true foundation the savage songfeast we are now enabled to give a clear and easy solution to a difficulty which has embarrassed all the critics it has been held a circumstance unaccountable or absurd that the choir in several of the ancient greek tragedies should be made privy to some of the most atrocious designs and yet should not reveal them though its character was confessedly moral this indeed on the common supposition that the choir originally made an essential part of the dramatic persons is a thorough absurdity but in reality it appears in the savage songfeast that they who recite or represent the action are a body quite distinct from the choir and that the choir in its original state is indeed the audience who surround the narrator or actor and answer him at every pause with shouts of triumph approbation or dislike this being so how could they the choir or audience properly reveal any secret designs either good or bad  to whom should they reveal them to each other  this was needless because they knew them already  must they then reveal them to the actors of the drama this could only have confounded the representation and destroyed the plot it would have been precisely on a level with the practice of an honest country lad who was present at the representation of othello when he foresaw that iagos treachery was likely to end tragically for poor desdemona he called aloud to othello sir the rascal lies he stole the handkerchief himself  this naturally leads to the elucidation of another circumstance in the beginning of the time of eschylus the choir consisted of no less than fifty persons afterward the number was lessened to fifteen how came it to pass that in the more barbarous periods the number should be so much greater manifestly on the principles here given because that rude age bordered on the savage times when the whole audience had sympathized with the narrative actor and became as one general choir  this solution naturally clears up another circumstance which is unaccountable on the common system if the choir were originally a part of the dramatic actors why were they placed in a balcony or gallery separate from the stage no good reason can be assigned but if we suppose them to have been originally the spectators of the drama we see they were in their natural and proper situation  but to this it may be objected that the choir sometimes maintains a dialogue with the actor in the greek tragedies and ought therefore to be regarded as a dramatic person  to this which has been observed above it is replied that though the choir sometimes speaks yet this is only by its leader and then only occasionally and from necessity to fill the place of another actor when no more than one or two are upon the stage for this reason eschylus uses the expedient oftener than his successors because his dramatic persons were fewer but though the choir sometimes speak by their leader yet they never take part in the action as sufficiently appears by their not revealing the secrets of it  it may be urged again that in the eumenides and iketides of eschylus the choir is certainly to be considered as a dramatic person because they are indeed the chief actors in the drama true they are so but though this objection looks formidable yet on a deeper consideration the bugbear will vanish  eschylus was desirous to represent an action of fifty furies and another of fifty daaids at a time when only two dramatic persons were allowed by custom to come on the stage together what expedient could he use why surely no other than that which we find he has used to throw these numerous bodies into the form of a choir and thus he gained them admittance on the stage  to speak with precision therefore we ought to say that the action of these two tragedies passes without a choir that is without any supposed spectators who take no part in it hist of poetry p     etc   i hope that in your next edition you will prove this strange paragraph to be a heap of nonsense and absurdity or persuade the reader by all means if you can that dr b picked it out of some dissertation bibliotheca or institutio poetica  i must now give you a gentle rebuke for rashly charging dr b either with ignorance or hypocrisy for saying that we are assured on the authority of other writers that a report prevailed in greece that certain poets had in ancient times contended at the tomb of theseus  this you affirm happened at a late period which late period by the way dr b had mentioned in his dissertation p      when sophocles won the prize from eschylus and then you leave it to dr bs choice whether he will submit to the charge of ignorance or dissimulation now i perceive that in the history of poetry he has cleared himself of both this says dr b is asserted by scaliger in the clearest terms and is alleged by him as a proof of the existence of tragedy before the age of thespis tragediam vero esse rem antiquam constat ex historia ad thesei namque sepulchrum certasse tragicos legimus de poet l i c   on what authority he says this i know not if any ancient author has asserted it this contest must have been held at the place where the remains of theseus had been interred before they were brought to athens by cimon for that event happened in the time of sophocles and left the public to fix upon you what name they please  what that name is you may guess from the next remark i am now compelled to make for as a reader of some curiosity observed to me after the critic had charged dr b in his text with dishonesty or ignorance in a sly corner of a note which he supposed many readers would pass over he confesses that his charge is groundless and says a friend then with me told me he feared i was mistaken this charge then continued the gentleman though at first it might possibly have been written by mistake yet was certainly persisted in and printed in hypocrisy and malice because both the charge against dr b and the confession of its falsehood are printed on the same page and therefore nothing is more certain than that he might have struck out this slander if he pleased  you proceed but now follows a passage which i do look upon to be the masterpiece of dr bs whole work where i know not which most to admire the learning exactness fidelity or judgment p      you then proceed to translate at large a passage from strabo which dr b has refered to and in part transcribed this passage relates to the pythian nomos or song and dr b having alleged it to prove that the rude form of tragedy existed many ages before thespis you affirm on the contrary that dr bs argument is a heap of ignorance blunder and misrepresentation you endeavor to persuade the reader  st that this pythian nomos hymn or song did not exist till after the crissaean war which was about the time of thespis  dly that dr b asserts or supposes this crissaean war to have been before the time of homer  dly that the musical contest alluded to by strabo was merely instrumental  thly that the nature of this musical contest was not well understood and was only explained in a particular manner by one who lived three hundred years after p       etc  on this subject i presume the following paragraph may give you entire satisfaction  but a still stronger evidence presents itself for even the very substance and form of one of these rude outlines of savage tragedy remains in several respectable authors of antiquity i mean in their accounts of the celebration of the pythian games these were first celebrated in the times of apollo himself and contained a mimetic narration by poetic song melody and dance of his victory over the python this representation was called the pythian nomos and underwent the following changes or improvements through the several successive periods of antiquity the poem called nomos had apollo for its subject and took its name from him for apollo was named nomimos because in ancient times when the whole choir used to sing the nomos to the pipe or lyre chrysothemis the cretan was the first who clad in a splendid robe and playing on the harp sung the nomos alone in imitation of apollos victory and being much applauded this form of the contest remained to afterages certamen apud delphos antiquitus fuit citharoedorum paeanem in laudem dei canentium strabo l ix  nomos quidem in apollinem conscriptus a quo appellationem sumpsit apollo enim nomimos appellatus est quia veteribus choros constituentibus and ad tibiam vel lyram nomon canentibus chrysothemis cretensis primus stola usus insigni and accepta cithara apollinem imitatus the original is stronger  solus cecinit nomon qui cum valde probatus esset permansit hic modus certaminis proclus apud photium bibl ed hoesch p       what this form was we learn from the following accounts the poem was divided into five parts or acts the first contained the preparation for the fight the second the challenge the third exhibited the fight itself the fourth the victory of apollo the fifth contained the triumph of the god who danced after his victory pythici vero nomi qui tibia canitur parts quinque sunt rudimentum provocatio iambicum spondeum ovatio representatio autem est modus quidem pugnae apollinis contra draconem  et in ipso experimento locum circumspicit number pugnae conveniens sit  in provocatione vero provocat draconem  sed in iambico pugnat  spondeum vero dei victoriam representat et in ovatione deus ad victorialia carmina saltat  jul pollux o l iv c  0   it appears that terpander improved the nomos by adding the heroic measure after him arion enlarged it greatly being both a poet and a performer on the harp phrynes introduced a new circumstance for he joined the hexameter with the various measure terpandrum vero nomon absolvisse apparet cum adhibuisset heroicum carmen post arion methymnaeus non parum auxit poeta ipse and citharaedus phrynes vero mitylenaeus novam rationem commentus est hexametrum enim cum soluto carmine conjunxit proclus apud photium ib   in a later period this poetic and musical representation was formally established at delphi after the crissaean war institutum a delphis post crissaeum bellum  afterward the amphictyons added a contest of music merely instrumental adjecerunt autem citharoedis tibicines et qui cithara luderent sine cantu modularenturque carmen quod nomos five modus pythius dicebatur  strabo l ix  but preserved what had been practiced in former times there was the song to the harp as formerly there was the song to the tibia or pipe and there was the pipe itself without song certamina instituerunt amphictyones cantus ad citharam ut pridem cantus item ad tibiam ipsarum etiam per se tibiarum  pausanias in phocicis  this addition of music merely instrumental was likewise imitative being designed as a mimetic description by mere melody of the battle between apollo and the python it consisted likewise of five parts corresponding with those of the ancient song quinque sunt ejus parts anacrusis ampeira katakeleusmos iambi and dactyli syringes seu fistulae sibilae strabo ib   timosthenes in the time of the second ptolomy writ a poem descriptive and explanatory of this musical contention according to this author the subject was the victory of apollo over the serpent the first part was the prelude to the battle the second was the beginning of the engagement the third was the battle itself the fourth was the paean or triumph on the victory the fifth was an imitation of the agonies and hissing of the dying serpent carmen composuit timosthenes secundi ptolemaei claffr praefectus  vult autum apollinis adversus draconem certamen celebrari eo carmine and anacrusin significare praeludium ampeiran certaminis initium katakeleusmon ipsam pugnam iambum and dactylum paeanem qui victoriae accinitur talibus modis five rythmis quorum hymnus quidem proprius est iambus autem desunt quaedam and iambizare fistulas autem mortem imitatas serpentis vitam cum sibilis quibusdam finientis strabo ib  these passages are given in the latin translations which though not always elegant are sufficiently correct that a greater number of readers may be enabled to judge of the evidence   now though these ancient authors differ from each other in two or three trifling circumstances yet as to every thing essential they perfectly agree and from their concurrent evidence we have clear proof of the following facts   that the immediate followers of apollo began these poetic and musical contests   that till chrysothemis appeared in or near the time of apollo there subsisted only a choir   that he first sung the episode single and alone   that his song was a mimetic narration or imitation of apollos victory   that the form which he gave to this continued through succeeding times   that this poem was divided into five parts or acts containing a progressive description and imitation of the battle and victory and lastly that songs of triumph exultation sarcasm and contempt together with a correspondent dance accompanied the narrative episode scaliger is of opinion that the dance was mimetic of the whole narration or action and divided into the same number of acts at vero seorsum saltatio haud illi absimilis edebatur in totm actus aeque distributa poet l i c    if indeed this was added it amounts to a strict dramatic representation for as the same learned critic says elsewhere sane ludi sunt tacitae fabulae fabulae vero ludi loquentes lb c xxii but as this circumstance is not so clearly delivered as the rest i lay no stress on it   thus in this most ancient pythian song as delivered down from the times of apollo himself and performed and augmented through the succeeding periods of ancient greece we have the very substance and form of a first rude essay toward tragedy divided into five acts and compounded of poetic narration imitative music dance and choral song  and it is worthy of singular observation that through this whole representative scene of apollo singing dancing and praising his own exploits the ancient greek historians transport us as it were into the wilds of modern america and present to us the genuine picture of a savage chieftain see the description of the savage song feast from lafitau sect ii   it appears therefore that tragedy had a much earlier and deeper foundation in ancient greece than the accidental adventure of thespis and his route that it arose from nature and an unforced union and progression of melody dance and poetic song history of poetry p  0  etc   you see here that your whole critical fabric is annihilated at a blow for  st it appears on the clearest evidence that this pythian song was performed in ancient times even as ancient as those of apollo himself  dly it appears that when you charge dr b with ignorance in supposing the crissaean war to have been before the time of homer your objection is unhappily founded on your own ignorance on your not understanding strabo nor dr b who both speak of two different periods which you have profoundly jumbled into one  dly it appears that this musical contest was not merely instrumental but contained a mimetic song performed by a single person in imitation of apollos victory and  thly we are at no loss for the essential parts of it but know certainly that it contained a progressive description of apollos battle and victory over the python  and now let me cordially advise you for the future to be less insolent in a state of imagined security and conquest lest your own expressions should be retorted upon you  thus  a few such mistakes as mr  here presents you in a bunch would serve a man of ordinary genius to spread through a whole book  is it not a fine thing for a man to set up for an instructor of mankind who is ignorant of what his commonest readers know p      and other modest expressions scattered through your work of the same nature   0 the same spirit still impels you to proceed though i look upon you now as little more than the ghost of a departed critic  dr b having endeavored to prove by a variety of arguments that eschylus was an original writer and not a mere imitator of homer you say you can oppose the testimony of eschylus himself of whom it was a common and wellknown saying as athenoeus tells us that his pieces were small scraps or morsels of the magnificent entertainment of homer p      i could not but smile at your simile of the faggotbinder and thought you had got a small advantage over dr b till i looked into the history of poetry where i found the following note it is said indeed of eschylus that he called his tragedies no more than fragments of the magnificent entertainment given by homernow this expression being only metaphorical we ought to interpret it in that sense only to which a comparison of their writings leads us and as it appears that there is no resemblance between them either in the particular subjects or in the manner of treating them the only rational interpretation that can be given seems to be this that the subjects of his tragedies were only small morsels or fragments of the grecian story whereas homer had given a general system of their fabulous history both in a more extensive and a more connected manner     you accuse dr b of treating the author of elfrida and caractacus with indignity p      now what has that author to do in the present debate are you in any respect concerned for the reception or credit of his works or after all is there not some other author on whose account you are so touched to the quick though you are too prudent to mention or even to hint at him  but if dr b has treated the author of elfrida with indignity how do you know that that author had not first deserved it by treating himself with indignity  i could say more for i have heard more but it is neither generous nor worth while to disturb the ashes of the dead     you go on the union of music with tragedy he says was never accounted for to which i add nor is it yet but of that you will hear another time p      come on then with your proofs for of your affirmations we have had enough     concerning his comment on aristotles definition of tragedy you add i have more to say than you or i have at present time for ib  my learned friend find a little time if you can i am satisfied that your comment will be a great curiosity     this article is of consequence to the main question and therefore i must be particular in my remarks  you say on his account of the masque and buskin which he says arose from the custom of selecting the tallest and strongest men for their chiefs i have to observe that the actions of their tragedies are almost universally taken from a period in which their kingdoms were hereditary and in which men succeeded not by election for bulk or any thing else but by birth and descent p      here you not only affirm but you reason i wish i could say like a man and not like a child  what is it to the purpose whence the subjects of the more modern tragedies of eschylus sophocles and euripides were taken to satisfy dr b in this point you must tell him what were the subjects of all those fifteen tragedians who were prior to the age of thespis nay i question whether he will be content with this for we have found him very exorbitant in his claims but will insist upon your telling him what were the subjects of all the oldest irregular savage bards who existed as early or perhaps even more early than apollo himself this will carry us you see up to the period of savage life in which we must allow i am afraid that the tallest and strongest men are commonly selected as chiefs  but then you will say that the masque was the invention of a later age even a later than thespis himself  in attica possibly it might be so but though eschylus is said by some to have been the inventor of the masque yet aristotle fairly confesses that its origin is absolutely unknown and clemens alexandrinus affirms that it was in use even in the times of orpheus these circumstances are not a little favorable to dr bs system and seem to imply that dramatic representation had existed in greece though not perhaps at athens even as long ago as the age of orpheus and it is beyond all doubt that a very little before the age of orpheus the time was when the savages elected the tallest and strongest men for chiefs     etc  you now declare you are tired with the task of combating chimeras p     and truly so am i  we will therefore hasten to a conclusion as fast as possible some few scattered observations only now remain  you charge dr b with an error in insisting that the last institution of the pythian games was no more than a separation of the gymnastic exercises from the musical whereas the words of strabo whom he quotes are as clear as possible that only the musical subsisted before and that the gymnastic and equestrian were then added to them p     for truths and decencys sake do not give dr b so many repeated occasions of calling your sincerity in question who would not believe from the tenor of this passage but that dr b in his quotation from strabo had some how or other disguised this circumstance of the addition of the gymnastic and equestrian exercises yet on looking into the passage in dr bs dissertation i find it quoted in the very same words indeed the doctor questions the strict propriety of strabos saying that the gymnastic exercises were added because he conceives they were there before making a part of the ancient musical exercises under the denomination of the dance diss p      this he has attempted to prove by some very plausible arguments i must confess not one of which you have disproved however what you cannot disprove you can misrepresent which with some readers may do as well  again you charge him with interpreting as an account of the effect of music on manners what plato means only as an illustration of the ill effects of a licentious democratic spirit etc p     on the contrary dr b has made it appear by passages quoted from plato himself that platos argument included both these causes diss sect vi art               another censure is on his supposing that the writings of archilochus were banished from sparta on account of their sarcastic turn which was indeed on account of their obscenity p     as the passage in dr b is short i will give it entire that every one may judge for himself the spartans ordered the writings of archilochus to be banished from their city because they thought the perusal of them was dangerous to the purity of manners diss sect vii art   in a correspondent article he explains himself still more particularly because nothing could be more dangerous to a commonwealth established on severity of manners than the unbounded licentiousness of sentiment and speech which this the old comedy must tend to produce ib   seriously i am at a loss how to express myself properly on this occasion and therefore shall briefly set down this as another instance of your modesty  i shall now conclude all with a most shining proof of your being eminently possessed of this great virtue after very notably squabbling with dr b about a dubious passage in xenophon and quarrelling him for not rendering it exactly as you would have him you charge him with falsely translating the word  the better to serve his purpose you affirm that this word does not imply good and virtuous men but only the rich or powerful the better sort as we say p      now my most ingenuous friend turn back to the   th and   th pages of your own work and you will see a gorgons head which if you are not totally melted into modesty will turn you into stone here we find this very word translated by your good self in that very sense in which dr b had translated it the reason say you why poets are to be honored is  for their admonitions and bettering their fellowcitizens  reader you may stare but the assertion lies open to broad day light in his   th and   th pages  wits have short memories says pope and dunces none but one class of men there is who all the world agree either have or ought to have good memories  two or three other paragraphs there are on which i might very reasonably bestow a farther panegyric but this last contains so delicate a picture of your amiable mind and of the generous motives that set you to work to criticize dr b that i am unwilling to draw off the reader from the contemplation of so sweet a pourtrait  thus through the course of my remarks you see i have been very free but very friendly i cannot help congratulating you on your good fortune in falling into the hands of one who has made great allowances for your imperfections and even passes over many inferior blots which a censorious critic would have hit of this kind is a slight mistake p   in your saying the oracle of delphos instead of the oracle of delphos you may knock down your adversary with your critical dungfork if you please but who gave you leave without provocation to break poor priscians head what would you say of dr bs knowledge in grammar should he affirm that aristotelem was not so profound a reasoner nor longinum so sublime a critic as you  yet this he might have said with the same propriety  i mean so far as grammar is concerned  the more so because you openly profess to treat dr bs errors with severity p     whereas mere errors have ever been supposed to merit indulgence add to this that your bitterness to a man who has put his name to his work while you conceal yours has in the opinion of some people the air of dishonest cowardice and what they will needs call stabbing in the dark  you conclude with a solemn charge against dr b of his being flagrantly guilty of misquoting authors i wish you had better maintained this heavy charge i am bold to say that the instances you have produced have turned out to the confirmation of his system and little to your honor give me leave to put you in mind of a passage in a certain book which relates to a mans pulling a mote out of his brothers eye while he sees not the beam that is in his own  i will now conclude with a hint of advice to you in which i am sure i shall deserve your thanks whether i obtain them or not i mean only to exhort you for the future to stick to that species of criticism for which you are apparently qualified in every instance where you attack the larger parts of dr bs system my regard to truth obliges me to say that you fail most miserably but when you get hold of him upon a minute article you are sure to pinch him to the bone thus on the wide subject of the old greek religion the origin of poetic numbers the genius of savage manners the rise and progressions of poetry consequent on these with several other large and extensive articles of inquiry you are totally off your ground but to make amends for this small defect you are amply revenged by detecting him in the important blunder of calling herophile by the name of phenomoe stiling pindars chair a chair of gold when it was only of iron and in the painful and laborious article of prosody or scanning verses isaac vossius himself is forced to yield to you  now as you observe in the beginning of your work multi multa possunt sed nemo omnia  nobody can have at once the microscopic and the telescopic eye therefore improve the talent which nature has given you if you cannot see  cultivate that kind of vision which is  that is if you cannot comprehend large and distant objects apply yourself diligently to the nearathand or purblind criticism  with this advice i shall take my leave of you esteeming it a sufficient waste of time and labor thus for once to have unmasqued the empty parade of a trifling and disingenuous caviler  personam tragicam forte vulpes viderat o quanta species inquit cerebrum non habet the end fig   the scale of vthe etc b e c g d
