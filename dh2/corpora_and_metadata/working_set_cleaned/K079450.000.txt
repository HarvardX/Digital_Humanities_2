the farewell  the farewell p farewell to europe and at once farewell to all the follies which in europe dwell to eastern india now a richer clime richer alas in every thing but rhyme the muses steer their course and fond of change at large in other worlds desire to range resolved at least since they the fool must play to do it in a different place and way  f what whim is this what error of the brain what madness worse than in the dogstars reign why into foreign countries would you roam are there not knaves and fools enough at home if satire be thy object and thy lays as yet have shown no talents fit for praise if satire be thy object search all round nor to thy purpose can one spot be found like england where to rampant vigor grown vice choaks up every virtue where selfsown the seeds of folly shoot forth rank and bold and every seed brings forth a hundred fold  p no more of this  though truth the more our shame the more our guilt though truth perhaps may claim and justify her part in this yet here for the first time even truth offends my ear declaim from morn to night from night to morn take up the theme anew when days newborn i hear and hate  be england what she will with all her faults she is my country still  f thy country and what then is that mere word against the voice of reason to be heard are prejudices deep imbibed in youth to counteract and make thee hate the truth it is the sure symptom of a narrow soul to draw its grand attachment from the whole and take up with a part men not confined within such paltry limits men designed their nature to exalt wherever they go wherever waves can roll and winds can blow wherever the blessed sun placed in the sky to watch this subject world can dart his eye are still the same and prejudice outgrown consider every country as their own at one grand view they take in natures plan not more at home in england than japan  p my good grave sir of theory whose wit grasping at shadows never caught substance yet it is mighty easy over a glass of wine on vain refinements vainly to refine to laugh at poverty in plentys reign to boast of apathy when out of pain and in each sentence worthy of the schools varnished with sophistry to deal out rules most fit for practice but for one poor fault that into practice they can never be brought at home and sitting in your elbowchair you praise japan though you was never there but was the ship this moment under sail would not your mind be changed your spirits fail would you not cast one longing eye to shore and vow to deal in such wild schemes no more however our pride may tempt us to conceal those passions which we cannot choose but feel there is a strange something which without a brain fools feel and with one wise men cannot explain planted in man to bind him to that earth in dearest ties from whence he drew his birth if honor calls wherever she points the way the sons of honor follow and obey if need compels wherever we are sent it is want of courage not to be content but if we have the liberty of choice and all depends on our own single voice to deem of every country as the same is rank rebellion against the lawful claim of nature and such dull indifference may be philosophy but cannot be sense  f weak and unjust distinction strange design most peevish most perverse to undermine philosophy and throw her empire down by means of sense from whom she holds her crown divine philosophy to thee we owe all that is worth possessing here below virtue and wisdom consecrate thy reign doubled each joy and pain no longer pain when like a garden where for want of toil and wholesome discipline the rich rank soil teems with encumbrances where all around herbs noxious in their nature make the ground like the good mother of a thankless son curse her own womb by fruitfulness undone like such a garden when the human soul unculturd wild impatient of control brings forth those passions of luxuriant race which spread and stifle every herb of grace whilst virtue checked by the cold hand of scorn seems withering on the bed where she was born philosophy steps in with steady hand she brings her aid she clears the encumbered land too virtuous to spare vice one stroke too wise one moment to attend to pitys cries see with what godlike what relentless power she roots up every weed  p and every flower philosophy a name of meek degree embraced in token of humility by the proud sage who whilst he strove to hide in that vain artifice revealed his pride philosophy whom nature had designed to purge all errors from the human mind herself misled by the philosopher at once her priest and master made us err pride pride like leaven in a mass of flour tainted her laws and made even virtue sour had she content within her proper sphere taught lessons suited to the human ear which might fair virtues genuine fruits produce made not for ornament but real use the heart of man unrivaled she had swayed praised by the good and by the bad obeyed but when she overturning reasons throne strove proudly in its place to plant her own when she with apathy the breast would steel and teach us deeply feeling not to feel when she would wildly all her force employ not to correct our passions but destroy when not content our nature to restore as made by god she made it all new over when with a strange and criminal excess to make us more than men she made us less the good her dwindled power with pity saw the bad with joy and none but fools with awe truth with a simple and unvarnishd tale even from the mouth of n  might prevail could she get there but falshoods sugared strain should pour her fatal blandishments in vain nor make one convert though the siren hung where she too often hangs on m  tongue should all the sophs whom in his course the sun has seen or past or present rise in one should he whilst pleasure in each sentence flows like plato give us poetry in prose should he full orator at once impart the athenians genius with the romans art genius and art should in this instance fail nor rome though joined with athens here prevail it is not in man it is not in more than man to make me find one fault in natures plan placed low ourselves we censure those above and wanting judgment think that she wants love blame where we ought in reason to commend and think her most a foe when most a friend such be philosophers  their specious art though friendship pleads shall never warp my heart never make me from this breast one passion tear which nature my best friend has planted there  f forgiving as a friend what whilst i live as a philosopher i cannot forgive in this one point at last i join with you to nature pay all that is natures due but let not clouded reason sink so low to fancy debts she does not cannot owe bear to full manhood grown those shackles bear which nature meant us for a time to wear as we wear leadingstrings are laid aside when we can walk alone but on thyself by peevish humor swayed will thou lay burdens nature never laid will thou make faults whilst judgment weakly errs and then defend mistaking them for here is dare thou to say in our enlightned age that this grand master passion this brave rage which flames out for thy country was impressed and fixed by nature in the human breast if you prefer the place where you was born and hold all others in contempt and scorn on fair comparison if on that land with liberal and a more than equal hand her gifts as in profusion plenty sends if virtue meets with more and better friends if science finds a patron amongst the great if honesty is minister of state if power the guardian of our rights designed is to that great that only end confined if riches are employed to bless the poor if law is sacred liberty secure let but these facts depend on proofs of weight reason declares thy love cannot be too great and in this light could he our country view a very hottentot must love it too but if by fates decrees you owe your birth to some most barren and penurious earth where every comfort of this life denied her real wants are scantily supplied where power is reason liberty a joke laws never made or made but to be broke to fix thy love on such a wretched spot because in lusts wild fever there begot because thy weight no longer fit to bear by chance not choice thy mother dropped thee there is folly which admits not of defense it cannot be nature for it is not sense by the same argument which here you hold when falshoods insolent let truth be bold if propagation can in torments dwell a devil must if born there love his hell  p had fate to whose decrees i lowly bend and even in punishment confess a friend ordained my birth in some place yet untried on purpose made to mortify my pride where the sun never gave one glimpse of day where science never yet could dart one ray had i been born on some bleak blasted plain of barren scotland in a stuarts reign or in some kingdom where men weak or worse turned natures every blessing to a curse where crowns of freedom by the fathers won dropped leaf by leaf from each degenerate son in spite of all the wisdom you display all you have said and yet may have to say my weakness here if weakness i confess i as my country had not loved her less whether strict reason bears me out in this let those who always seeking always miss the ways of reason doubt with precious zeal theirs be the praise to argue mine to feel wish we to trace this passion to the root we like a tree may know it by its fruit from its rich stem ten thousand virtues spring ten thousand blessings on its branches cling yet in the circle of revolving years not one misfortune not one vice appears hence then and what you reason call adore this if not reason must be something more but for i wish not others to confine be their opinions unrestrained as mine whether this loves of good or evil growth a vice a virtue or a spice of both let men of nicer argument decide if it is virtuous sooth an honest pride with liberal praise if vicious be content it is a vice i never can repent a vice which weighed in heaven shall more avail than ten cold virtues in the other scale  f this wild untemperd zeal which after all we candor unimpeachd might madness call is it a virtue that you scarce pretend or can it be a vice like virtues friend which draws us off from and dissolves the force of private ties nay stops us in our course to that grand object of the human soul that nobler love which comprehends the whole cooped in the limits of this petty isle this nook which scarce deserves a frown or smile weighed with creation you by whim undone give all your thoughts to what is scarce worth one the generous soul by nature taught to soar her strength confirmed in philosophic lore at one grand view takes in a world with ease and seeing all mankind loves all she sees  p was it most sure which yet a doubt endures not found in reasons creed though found in yours that these two services like what we are told and know of gods and mammons cannot hold and draw together that however loath we neither serve attempting to serve both i could not doubt a moment which to choose and which in common reason to refuse invented often for purposes of art born of the head though fathered on the heart this grand love of the world must be confessed a barren speculation at the best not one man in a thousand should he live beyond the usual term of life could give so rare occasion comes and to so few proof whether his regards are feigned or true the love we bear our country is a root which never fails to bring forth golden fruit it is in the mind an everlasting spring of glorious actions which become a king nor less become a subject it is a debt which bad men though they pay not cannot forget a duty which the good delight to pay and every man can practice every day nor for my life so very dim my eye or dull your argument can i descry what you with faith assert how that dear love which binds me to my country can remove and make me of necessity forego that general love which to the world i owe those ties of private nature small extent in which the mind of narrow cast is pent are only steps on which the generous soul mounts by degrees till she includes the whole that spring of love which in the human mind founded on self flows narrow and confined enlarges as it rolls and comprehends the social charities of blood and friends till smaller streams included not oerpast it rises to our countrys love at last and he with liberal and enlarged mind who loves his country cannot hate mankind  f friend as you would appear to common sense tell me or think no more of a defense is it a proof of love by choice to run a vagrant from your country  p can the son shame shame on all such sons with ruthless eye and heart more patient than the flint stand by and by some ruffian from all shame divorced all virtue see his honored mother forced then no by him that made me not even then could i with patience by the worst of men behold my country plundered beggared lost beyond redemption all her glories crossed even when occasion made them ripe her fame fled like a dream while she awakes to shame  f is it not more the office of a friend the office of a patron to defend her sinking state than basely to decline so great a cause and in despair resign  p beyond my reach alas the grievance lies and whilst more able patriots doubt she dies from a foul source more deep than we suppose fatally deep and dark this grievance flows it is not that peace our glorious hopes defeats it is not the voice of faction in the streets it is not a gross attack on freedom made it is not the arm of privilege displayed against the subject whilst she wears no sting to disappoint the purpose of a king these are no ills or trifles if compared with those which are contrived though not declared tell me philosopher is it a crime to pry into the secret womb of time or born in ignorance must we despair to reach events and read the future there why be it so  still it is the right of man imparted by his maker where he can to former times and men his eye to cast and judge of what is to come by what is past should there be found in some not distant year o how i wish to be no prophet here amongst our british lords should there be found some great in power in principles unsound who look on freedom with an evil eye in whom the springs of loyalty are dry who wish to soar on wild ambitions wings who hate the commons and who love not kings who would divide the people and the throne to set up separate interests of their own who hate whatever aids their wholesome growth and only join with to destroy them both should there be found such men in aftertimes may heaven in mercy to our grievous crimes allot some milder vengeance nor to them and to their rage this wretched land condemn thou god above on whom all states depend who know from the first their rise and end if there is a day marked in the book of fate when ruin must involve our equal state when law alas must be no more and we to freedom born must be no longer free let not a mob of tyrants seize the helm nor titled upstarts league to rob the realm let not whatever other ills assail a damned aristocracy prevail if all too short our course of freedom run it is thy good pleasure we should be undone let us some comfort in our griefs to bring be slaves to one and be that one a king  f poets accustomed by their trade to feign often substitute creations of the brain for real substance and themselves deceived would have the fiction by mankind believed such is your case  but grant to sooth your pride that you know more than all the world beside why deal in hints why make a moments doubt resolved and like a man at once speak out show us our danger tell us where it lies and to ensure our safety make us wise  p rather than bear the pain of thought fools stray the proud will rather lose than ask their way to men of sense what needs it to unfold and tell a tale which they must know untold in the bad interest warps the cankered heart the good are hoodwinked by the tricks of art and whilst arch subtle hypocrites contrive to keep the flames of discontent alive whilst they with arts to honest men unknown breed doubts between the people and the throne making us fear where reason never yet allowed one fear or could one doubt admit themselves pass unsuspected in disguise and against our real danger seal our eyes  f mark them and let their names recorded stand on shames black roll and stink through all the land  p that might some courage but no prudence be no hurt to them and jeopardy to me  f leave out their names  p for that kind caution thanks but may not judges sometimes fill up blanks  f your countrys laws in doubt then you reject  p the laws i love the lawyers i suspect amongst twelve judges may not one be found on bare bare possibility i ground this wholesome doubt who may enlarge retrench create and uncreate and from the bench with winks smiles nods and such like paltry arts may work and worm into a jurys hearts or baffled there may turbulent of soul cramp their high office and their rights control who may though judge turn advocate at large and deal replies out by the way of charge making interpretation all the way in spite of facts his wicked will obey and leaving law without the least defense may damn his conscience to approve his sense  f whilst the true guardians of this charterd land in full and perfect vigor juries stand a judge in vain shall awe cajole perplex  p suppose i should be tried in middlesex  f to pack a jury they will never dare  p there is no occasion to pack juries there  f against prejudice all arguments are weak reason herself without effect must speak fly then thy country like a coward fly renounce her interest and her laws defy but why bewitched to india turn thy eyes cannot our europe thy vast wrath suffice cannot thy misbegotten muse lay bare her brawny arm and play the butcher there  p thy counsel taken what should satire do where could she find an object that is new those traveled youths whom tender mothers wean and send abroad to see and to be seen with whom least they should fornicate or worse a tutors sent by way of a dry nurse each of whom just enough of spirit bears to show our follies and to bring home theirs have made all europes vices so well known they seem almost as natural as our own  f will india for thy purpose better do  p in one respect at least  there is something new  f a harmless people in whom nature speaks free and untainted amongst whom satire seeks but vainly seeks so simply plain their hearts one bosom where to lodge her poisoned darts  p from knowledge speak you this or doubt on doubt weighed and resolved has reason found it out neither from knowledge nor by reason taught you have faith every where but where you ought india or europe  what is there in a name propensity to vice in both the same nature alike in both works for mans good alike in both by man himself withstood nabobs as well as those who hunt them down deserve a cord much better than a crown and a mogul can thrones as much debase as any polished prince of christian race  f could you a task more hard than you suppose could you in ridicule whilst satire glows make all their follies to the life appear it is ten to one you gain no credit here however welldrawn the picture after all because we know not the original would not find favor in the public eye  p that having your good leave i mean to try and if your observations sterling hold if the piece should be heavy tame and cold to make it to the side of nature lean and meaning nothing something seem to mean to make the whole in lively colors glow to bring before us something that we know and from all honest men applause to win i will groupe the company and put them in  f be that ungenrous thought by shame suppressed add not distress to those too much distressed have they not by blind zeal misled laid bare those sores which never might endure the air have they not brought their mysteries so low that what the wise suspected not fools know from their first rise even to the present hour have they not proved their own abuse of power made it impossible if fairly viewed ever to have that dangerous power renewed whilst unseducd by ministers the
