a declaration of the peoples natural right to a share in the legislature etc  a declaration of the peoples natural right to a share in the legislature which is the fundamental principle of the british constitution of state  by granville sharp  qui non libere veritatem pronunciat proditor est veritatis   inst epil london printed for b white at horaceshead in fleet street  mdcclxxiv  preface the following declaration of the peoples natural right to a share in the legislature is founded on principles which are certainly unquestionable and cannot easily be controverted but i was not aware i acknowledge i freely acknowledge my deficiency in historical as well as most other branches of learning which require much reading and leisure to be obtained but though this affords an argument against my own personal credit and abilities in general as a writer yet it does not at all affect any particular point which in my several tracts i have labored to maintain for upon these a candid reader will determine according to the evidence produced and not by the general character or demerit of the author in other respects   when i sent the same to the press that there had ever been any controversy before the  th of king george i concerning the freedom of our fellow subjects in ireland or that any englishman acquainted with the principles of our excellent constitution of state had ever before that time presumed to advance any doctrine which might tend to deprive our irish brethren of their natural freedom and of the inestimable benefits of that happy legal constitution which british subjects in general are commonly supposed to inherit by birthright  if i had not esteemed this point incontrovertible when i wrote the said declaration i should not have quoted the union between great britain and ireland as an example of the true constitutional mode of connecting british dominions that are otherwise separated by nature but having done this and having also given several copies of the declaration to my friends which cannot now be recalled i have thereby brought upon myself the necessity of maintaining the propriety of the said example which might as easily have been avoided had i been aware of any such controversy because the general principles on which my arguments are founded would have been amply sufficient i apprehend to prove the truth of my declaration even though examples and custom had been against it for the common law of england teaches us that examples and precedents are not to be followed if they are unreasonable or inconsistent with legal and constitutional principles this is clearly proved by a variety of unquestionable maxims judicandum est legibus non exemplis malus usus abolendus est in consuetudinibus non diuturnitas temporis sod soliditas rationis consideranda est multitudo errantium non parit errori patrocinium    though on the other hand they are to be esteemed of very great weight and authority in law when there are no just exceptions against them  et quia consuetudines illae nec contra legem divinam nec contra rationem in aliquo existunt et pro bono communi totius regni ex earum diurnitate censentur fore necessariae vim legis retinent etc doct et stud c    and of this latter kind is the example which i have quoted to illustrate my declaration for though many great and respectable writers have made exceptions to the constitutional freedom of ireland which i had supposed to be unquestionable yet after the most careful examination of their opinions and the reasons given for the same in which the proofs ought to consist i am now fully convinced that there are no just exceptions against that example and consequently i am bound in justice to my fellow subjects in ireland not to give it up because the necessity beforementioned of maintaining the propriety of the example cited in my declaration arises not from any obstinate partiality to my own assertion which i confess was at first too hastily and unadvisedly made but from a firm persuasion after a most cautious enquiry into the real state of the controversy that the advocates for the liberties of ireland have truth and reason on their side which i hope the  d part now added to my declaration will sufficiently testify  it is necessary also for me to guard against another objection which might perhaps hereafter have been started against the following declaration  i have quoted therein a maxim of the english constitution as a principle of natural equity which had previously been denied that rank by one of the most eminent civilians of his time and therefore to avoid the influence of so great an authority against my argument i think it prudent in this preface to examine the grounds of his objections that my readers may have sufficient evidence before them to distinguish where the truth lies for it is certainly necessary for me to establish the first principles on which i have proceeded before i can expect to have any attention paid to the arguments which i have built upon them  the maxim which i wish to maintain is as follows viz that law to bind all must be assented to by all principia leg et aequit p    to which is added by way of illustration canons therefore bind not the laity    this maxim i have quoted in the following declaration as a principle of natural equity though it seems the learned civilian baron puffendorf has expressly refused to rank it with the laws of nature he or rather i should say his translator calls the edition which i have followed is only an english translation printed at oxford in    0   it only a notion  we cannot here but observe says he that the notion maintained by some authors that the consent of the people is requisite to make laws oblige the subject in conscience is neither true in the laws of nature nor in the civil laws of monarchical or of aristocratical rulers nor indeed at all unless it be understood of implicit consent as a man by agreeing to the sovereignty of another is at the same time supposed to have agreed to all the future acts of that sovereignty law of nature and nations book   c   p     he has nevertheless thought proper to add an observation which makes strongly against his own argument though it would really be very useful says he and contribute much to engaging the subjects in a voluntary obedience if the laws could be made with their consent and approbation especially such as are to pass into their lives and manners  now it would be impossible i apprehend to find so just a reason in favor of the former part of the learned barons assertion as he himself has here given directly against it and yet he is frequently harping upon the same harsh string of absolute implicit obedience which inconsistency cannot easily be accounted for unless it be attributed to the prejudice of his education as a student in the impeperial or civil law for though the civil law contains many excellent maxims highly worthy of our esteem most of which have been adopted by our ancient english writers of the common law of this kingdom what use our ancestors have made of the civil law will readily appear to any one that will take the trouble to compare the several works which compose that voluminous body with some of the most ancient english lawyers as glanvil bracton and others who have adhered very closely to the rules and method of justinian have transcribed his laws in their own proper language and sometimes entire titles as familiarly as if they were the original laws of england dr bevers discourse on the study of jurisprudence and the civil law p     yet it includes some heterogeneous positions that have been forced upon it by the overbearing influence and corrupt practices of unlimited imperial courts which are highly unreasonable and contradictory to the general equity of its other principles a position of this kind too implicitly received as law seems to be the groundwork of the learned barons difficulty i mean that unreasonable and dangerous position of the civil law which attributes to the princes will and pleasure the force of law quod principi placuit juxta leges civiles legis habet vigorem fortescue de laud leg ang c    p    in this same chapter the learned chancellor fortescue recites many dreadful effects of this abominable principle in the government and police of france viz the pernicious and dangerous policy of maintaining a standing army for which the people were compelled to provide quarters and provisions in all the great towns and villages  also the abominable oppression of the salt tax whereby the poor were compelled to purchase of the king a certain quantity of salt whether they chose to have it or not at an excessive price by which together with the assessments to pay the troops and various other tallage rateable at the kings pleasure the common people were reduced to extreme penury and want of every comfort in life and with respect to persons of highter rank if any nobleman or gentleman was accused of a crime even by his enemies he was liable to be dragged to a private examination by the intermediation of messengers in the kings chamber or elsewhere in a private place without seeing his accusers himself alone being seen and when the king or perhaps his minister has been pleased to judge him guilty the poor passive subject is popped into a sack and in the night time cast into the river by the marshals servants howsoever incredible such abominable injustice may appear to englishmen yet the worthy chancellor who wrote this account for the instruction of edward prince of wales the son of king henry vi when in france appeals to the young princes own knowledge of the notoriety of such facts you have heard says he that more men by much have died in this manner than by the ordinary course of justice yet nevertheless says he ironically whatsoever has pleased the king according to the civil law has the force of law and while you have been in france and in the neighborhood of that kingdom continues the chancellor to the young prince you have heard of other enormities like to these and some even worse than these  detestably and damnably perpetrated no otherwise than under the color or pretense of that law viz quod principi placuit juxta leges civiles legis habet vigorem etiam et alia enormia says he hiis similia acquaedam hiis deteriora dum in francia et prope regnum illud conversatus es audisti non alio quam legis illius color detestabilitur damnabiliter que perpetrata quae hic inserere nostrum nimium dialogum protelaret etc whether or not this particular mode of dispatching the french kings subjects is yet in use i know not but of this we are well assured that private executions of persons unknown are still practiced there which in effect are equally dangerous and cannot be considered in any other light than that of so many wilful murders for which the kings of france and all those men whom they have entrusted with the administration of justice are most certainly accountable and must one day answer in their own private persons as individuals besides the enormous guilt which lies heavy upon that whole people as a nation for passively permitting such notorious and crying iniquity to be practiced among them under the borrowed name of law and it is not only the dispatching of men to put them out of the way of opposition to government that is intended by these midnight executions but also in some cases to satisfy a base malicious revenge by torturing the helpless victim with the cruel death of breaking on the wheel for as both the name and crime of the sufferer is concealed or perhaps a wrong name given out to prevent pity it cannot be said that such cruelty is used by way of example to deter bad men from commiting treason or other particular crimes so that such private executions can be attributed to nothing but a diabolical depravity in the minds of those who order them  it also appears that one use of a standing army in that unhappy kingdom is to guard the avenues of streets to prevent the people from discovering the actors as well as sufferers at such horrid masked tragedies as i have mentioned and therefore i cannot help remarking the extreme absurdity of that otherwise sensible and shrewd people in boasting of their national military honor when even large bodies of their bestdisciplined troops who are frenchmen also by birth and have the means in their own hands to render justice and restore liberty to their muchinjured countrymen can yet tamely yield themselves so far to the absolute will of any man or men on earth as to become silent accomplices like the detestable turkish mutes of old to the horrid crime of wilful murder for such are the secret executions of france and professed tools for perpetrating the most abandoned wickedness to such a disgraceful and slavish pitch of passive obedience is that oncespirited nation now reduced that they seem to give up all pretensions to that fundamental right of human nature which alone distinguishes men from brutes i mean the indispensible right of judging for themselves and of yielding obedience to the impulse of conscience according to that natural knowledge of good and evil which is implanted in all men french soldiers as well as others and of which they must one day render a strict account in a separate disbanded state as individuals which i have before remarked stripped of their arms and regimentals  shall we then adopt the laws of france quod principi placuit etc it is not impossible that such a measure may sometime or other be proposed by an inconsiderate minister and that a parliament through the unequal representation of the people the want of frequent elections and other defects in the constitution etc may hereafter be led to yield their consent to it but even if ever that should be the case i shall still entertain hopes from the general disposition of our british troops notwithstanding the alarming effects of standing armies in all other nations that they will never become so detestably base and degenerate as to permit their country to groan under any such iniquitous oppressions as are practiced in france nevertheless should they also become such slavish tools of despotism as to assist in enforcing any such unconstitutional measures let them know for a certainty that as soon as the national spirit of freedom of which they at present participate is by their means unhappily suppressed even they themselves must necessarily degenerate with their countrymen and will be no more able to stand before their enemies than the other wretched troops whom they have so often driven before them    i do not find indeed that he has literally cited the corrupt maxims but he has manifestly laid down the same principle though in different words toward the beginning of the same chapter where he is defining the difference between law and some other things which seem to bear relation to it as counsel which requires reasons to produce an obligation etc  but law says he though it ought not to want its reasons yet these reasons are not the cause why obedience is paid to it but the power of the exactor who when he has signified his pleasure lays an obligation on the subjects to act in conformity to his decree though perhaps they do not so well apprehend the reasons of the injunction etc and after citing a similar passage from mr hobbs he adds for no man can say sic volo sic jubeo so i will and so i command unless   stet pro ratione voluntas his will is his reason we obey laws therefore says he not principally upon account of the matter of them but upon account of the legislators will book   chap       thus the learned civilian seems to consider the will and pleasure of a sovereign as the life and spirit of laws which notion is highly unreasonable in every case but one viz when we are speaking of the laws of that sovereign alone whose will is the fountain of reason and whose pleasure by our own natural reason we are convinced is infinite goodness justice and mercy toward all those to whom he has signified his commands because we cannot separate the idea of infallible reason wisdom and eternal justice from any command of divine authority  and yet this application of the barons doctrine even to the supreme law is not conformable throughout to what i understand in this place of the barons idea of law for he assigns no other cause why obedience is paid to it but the power of the exactor whereas gods laws have many other apparent causes of obligation of which i have alteady mentioned the due sense we naturally entertain of the infinite wisdom and truth as well as the power of the divine author who is so far from being an exactor of laws that the revelation of his will for the good government of mankind has generally been addressed to the senses and reason of men that their covenant with god might be founded on free consent the highest and most obligatory cause of obedience  now as the laws of god are thus tendered to us under the equitable form of a reciprocal covenant thereby binding even himself the supreme lord and creator of all things to us his poor mortal subjects under conditional promises which cannot fail on his part how much more ought all mere worldly governors to be restrained and limited by equitable covenants of mutual obligation between them and their subjects since their equality in nature gives the latter an undoubted right to insist on this the only safe mode of worldly government  the consideration of this point leads me to one of the principal grounds of baron puffendorfs mistake beforementioned  he does not seem to have been aware that in all societies of men governed by laws some sort of general covenant must be understood to subsist between the several sovereigns and their subjects respectively and though such covenants are not always expressed yet most certainly they are always implied because we must necessarily presume that the good of the people is the original intention and principal end of all legal human governments since all men are naturally equals and a man who submits himself to the sovereignty or government of another that he may enjoy the benefit and protection of society does not on that account cease to be a man neither can the temporal sovereign himself be released from the natural ties of that relation for whenever he forgets that he himself is a man of the same fallible understanding and natural infirmities with his subjects who are his equals both on their entrance and at their exeunt from the stage of life he immediately loses the best rule for his conduct as a prince and necessarily degenerates into brutality so that in such cases to suppose that the will of the prince is to be allowed the force of law is the highest absurdity nay even the baron himself has elsewhere declared that the word man is thought to carry somewhat of dignity in its sound and we commonly says he make use of this as the last and the most prevailing argument against a rude insulter i am not a beast a dog but i am a man as well as yourself since then human nature agrees equally to all persons and since no one can live a sociable life with another who does not own and respect him as a man it follows as a command of the law of nature that every man esteem and treat another as one who is naturally his equal or who is a man as well as he book   c   p     it would therefore be unreasonable to conceive that any society of men should voluntarily submit themselves to a temporal sovereign without supposing at the same time some reciprocal obligation or duty to subsist between them which is nothing else but the implication of a mutual covenant and indeed the formalities of every coronation sufficiently indicate and warrant such an implication and the infringements made by monarchs on such implied covenants have in all ages been occasionally punished by the expulsion and destruction of the tyrants themselves of which most nations have at some time or other afforded an example  nevertheless the learned baron seems to have neglected these necessary considerations for he asserts that the distinction between a compact or covenant and a law is obvious for a compact says he is a promise but a law is a command in compacts the form of speaking is i will do so and so but in law the form runs do thou so after an imperative manner book   c     p     he had before been speaking of democratical governments and had remarked not only that the ancients frequently apply to laws the name of common agreements but also that the laws among the grecians were made upon the proposal of the magistrate with the knowledge and by the command of the people and so as it were in the way of bargain or stipulation says he they gave them the name of covenants and agreements beforementioned and yet he will not allow notwithstanding such authority that they are properly styled covenants having puzzled himself with the difference between a national covenant and a covenant of individuals for in this last case says he a person that dissents is not bound and the party cannot proceed without him whereas in the former case even the dissenting party is tied and obliged by the plurality of votes now the learned baron has not been aware that this very reason which he himself has assigned confirms the propriety of that ancient custom which he condemns  viz the applying the name of covenants and agreements to laws for he allows that the dissenting party is tied and obliged by the plurality of votes and therefore even a whole nation in that case may be said to act as an individual because that to which the greater number give consent as he himself remarks in the preceding paragraph is taken for the will and decree of all so that by this means a whole nation is as capable of making a covenant or compact as an individual and i will only add to what the baron has allowed about the binding of those who dissent that they are bound only so far as the imposed obligation is consistent with their superior covenant and duty to god which is always to be implied for even the sovereign of the world the king of kings who alone can be said to have an absolute right to govern his creature man without a free covenant if he had been pleased so to do has nevertheless condescended to include all his positive laws in two express legal covenants the old and the new both of which have been from time to time confirmed and fulfilled and still respectively subsist to this day in all points wherein the former is not superseded and fulfilled by the latter it therefore ill becomes this learned civilian to separate the idea of a compact or covenant from law and more especially when he endeavors thereby to establish the power of the exactor the capricious will of mere temporal fallible sovereigns which he supposes to be law independent of all compacts or covenants expressed or implied  thus i hope i have traced to the very foundation the barons error in denying the principle or maxim beforementioned concerning the necessity of popular assent in legislation for if he had not attempted to separate the idea of a covennant from law he could not have overlooked the absolute illegality of those pretended laws which are ordained only by the will and power of the exactor because the meanest professor of the english common law would have told him that every submission promise or agreement that is extorted by fear and compulsion is according to the law of nature totally null and void in itself and he himself is sufficiently sensible of this in another place those promises then or pacts we take to be invalid which a man is compelled to engage in by the unjust force of the party to whom they are made for since he who extorts any thing from another by using unjust terrors is by the law of nature bound to restore it and must consequently make good what the other person loses by such forced bargain the necessity of reparation in the party who offered the violence takes off all obligation to payment in the party who suffered it etc book   c      p      and even if an oath should be obtained to confirm the unjust power of the exactor it will not increase his right for the barons own doctrine again in another part of his book affords a sufficient answer to annul every pretense of obligation on account of oaths extorted by unjust fear but what are we to think of oaths extorted by unjust fear surely the person who by means of this fear procured a promise upon oath is no less obliged to release the promise thus violently obtained than if no oath had been added to confirm it therefore there appears no reason why compensation should not be admitted in this case in opposition to the claim of the injurious party according to the rules laid down by us says he when we treated of the general subject of fear book   c     p       thus the maxim concerning the necessity of assent for which i contend is sufficiently proved to be a law of nature even by the learned barons own arguments and i desire no better  in consequence of the barons general misconception i have spent the more time in warning my readers against the errors of this celebrated civilian because the studying of his works i am informed is at this time considered as a material part of education in our universities so that the rising generation of the very best families in this kingdom are liable to imbibe as it were with the milk of instruction these poisonous doctrines which thereby become fixed and engrafted in their tender minds as a foundation for their future political principles  thus a most dangerous source of unconstitutional notions has been opened and seems already to have flowed throughout the kingdom so that we need not wonder at the modern partiality for increasing the number as well as the powers of courts of admiralty and other seminaries of the civil law though the very existence of british liberty depends on duly restraining and limiting the civil law courts within those bounds of jurisdiction which have been allowed them by the ancient constitution of this kingdom and therefore i hope my readers will excuse my having exceeded the usual form of publications in making so long a preface to so short a work since it was absolutely necessary to guard against these dangerous and inveterate errors of the civil law before i could safely proceed to my declaration in favor of popular assent    concerning the necessity of agreement to make laws valid he has asserted also that neither the divine positive laws nor the laws of nature had their rise from the agreement of men etc book   c     p     now his observation is certainly true as far as it relates to the rise or origin of such laws for the laws being divine must necessarily have had their rise from god but yet this does not set aside the agreement of men by which they have been ratified and confirmed in all ages the baron seems to have overlooked the information we have received from scripture that men inherit a divine attribute from their parents i mean that knowledge of good and evil which they took upon themselves contrary to the express command of god and thereby unhappily entailed sin and death on all their posterity for that divine knowledge necessarily engages and includes our agreement or assent to the the laws of nature whether we obey them or not and thereby renders us answerable for our imperfect conduct in this world and consequently guilty before god and from hence arises the necessity of a redemption to relieve mankind from that unhappy effect of the original sin for as the strength of sin is the law the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law   cor xv    so the guilt of every criminal action is with justice imputed to us because we have wilfully offended against this natural light or law in our hearts by which we ought to have known how to refuse the evil and choose the good  this knowledge of good and evil was discovered even by the gentiles to be a divine attribute cicero calls this natural knowledge of good and evil law lex says he in his first book de legibus est ratio summa insita in natura quae juhet ea quae facienda sunt prohibetque contraria eadem catio cum est in hominis mente confirmata et confecta lex est and in his third book de officiis where he is speaking again of natural reason he calls it a divine law  i psa naturae ratio quae est lex divina et humana  and elsewhere he more particularly declares it to be a divine attribute  recta  numine deorum tracta ratio and he mentions this attribute again in his second book de natura deorum where he speaks of prudence or the choice of good and rejection of evil as a universal law common to god and man sequitur ut eadem sit in his diis quae in genere humano ratio eadem veritas utrobique sit eademque lex quae est recti praeceptio pravique depulsio ex quo intelligitur prudentiam quoque et mentem a diis ad homines pervenisse etc    though they were unacquainted probably with the occasion of its being engrafted in human nature it must therefore appear that the agreement or assent of mankind to the moral and eternal laws of god which the baron and other civilians commonly call the laws of nature may very fairly be presumed and admitted as a natural effect of the human understanding whenever any of the said laws are mentioned for all persons who have any reflection must be sensible that we stand selfcondemned by conscience which is only another name for the knowledge of good and evil whenever we offend against the moral laws of god by which our agreement and assent to the justice of them are sufficiently implied and acknowledged i have traced this subject more at large in a separate tract on the law of nature and principles of action in man intended also for the press    and with respect to what the baron has likewise insinuated concerning the want of human agreement to the divine positive laws the direct contrary thereto is clearly demonstrated as i have before hinted by the remarkable examples of two incontestible legal covenants between god and man the old and new testaments those two original written charters or grants of perfect liberty the one containing the promises and the other the accomplishment of our glorious freedom which we are bound to maintain and defend to the last moment of our lives  the mention that has already been made of these two unquestionable monuments of the free state and condition to which the almighty has been pleased to invite his creature man might perhaps be sufficient for my present purpose without descending to farther particulars but yet as i received extraordinary satisfaction myself in tracing minutely the manner in which the said covenants have been tendered and ratified i am inclined to suppose that many of my readers will reap the same satisfaction by perusing some examples of it because they demonstrate the real dignity and natural rights of man far beyond any thing that i could possibly have conceived before i made the said examination with this particular view to the freedom of man and as i have too much reason to apprehend that many of my countrymen have overlooked or neglected these striking instances which relate to the present subject the right of assent i propose to add sometime hereafter as soon as i can possibly find leisure to revise it for the press a third part also to this declaration of the peoples natural right to a share in the legislature which  d part being founded on some remarkable examples in scripture concerning the gracious and most liberal mode whereby the revealed laws even of god himself have been tendered from time to time to the consideration and acceptance of mankind proves by comparative demonstration that the maxims of the foreign civilians whereby they set up the mere will of fallible earthly princes as law viz quod principi placuit habet vigorem legis  stet pro ratione voluntas etc substituting will for reason are impious and unjust since even the almighty sovereign of the universe to whose will alone such deference is justly due has not so dealt with his creature man enforcing his will for his reason but on the contrary has mercifully condescended to convince us his frail mortal subjects that reason is his will and that he has limited if i may be allowed such an expression even his own infinite power by the eternal rules of justice and righteousness which our own natural reason teaches us can never fail and therefore as true freedom consists in the certainty of known laws so the most perfect liberty must necessarily subsist under the government of the almighty who has appealed by his prophets from time to time in the most affecting manner to the reason and senses of mankind that his laws might be confirmed by a voluntary popular assent the only true foundation of all valid compacts and that the said laws have accordingly been solemnly ratified and voluntarily accepted by the people in two mutual compacts or covenants commonly called the old and new testaments whereby not only the people are bound on their part but even the eternal king himself is conditionally bound also on his part to the performance of the most glorious promises the promises of god are made to all mankind without exception who receive and keep his covenant so that every true believer be his rank in life ever so mean is undoubtedly capable of becoming an adopted son of god  that we might receive the adoption of sons said the apostle to the galatians and because ye are sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father gal iv        a temple of god by the inward dwelling of his holy spirit  know ye not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwells in you if any man defile the temple of god him shall god destroy for the temple of god is holy which temple ye are   cor iii      see also   cor vi       an heir of salvation  that the gentiles should be fellowheirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel ephesians iii        a joint heir with christ  if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ romans viii       and all such shall come with him to judge the world  for the saints shall judge the world   cor vi     now as the eternal dignity to which human nature is invited is so great and glorious can we suppose that god has not some regard also for the temporal rights of his highlyfavoured creature man how then can any particular man or body of men presume to set up their own will for law and thereby deprive their brethren of that right which of all others is most essential to reasonable beings i mean the right of assent let those men who thus inconsiderately venture to affront the dignity of mankind by withholding from them their temporal rights  viz choice freewill and the due exercise of that reason which god has given them beware lest they themselves should thereby forfeit their own eternal privileges  know ye not that we shall judge angels  how much more things that pertain to this life   cor vi       and he has accordingly instituted by his son the eternal word in whom dwells all the fullness of the god head bodily col ii   not only a form for the admission of new members or parties to his free covenant but also ordained a solemn rite for the renewal and acknowledgement of the said covenant from time to time at his holy table from which the subjects of his kingdom cannot safely abstain without seeming to deny that allegiance and homage which they indispensibly owe to their eternal sovereign  i had intended also to have added to this declaration a little tract on the law eternal which limits legislature and forms the basis of the subjects rights but the same reason which obliged me to postpone the third part of the declaration already mentioned obliged me to defer this also for the present nevertheless as my declaration is founded on many of the principles and maxims of that same  eternal law i shall beg leave to add to this preface a short quotation from the said tract concerning the weight use and manner of applying the maxims or rules of eternal reason which is the more necessary at this time because i find there are great numbers of people who are so ill informed of these matters as to talk of the omnipotence of parliament as if they conceived that every thing whatsoever that is ordained by parliament must be law whether it be good or evil right or wrong  a most pernicious and baneful doctrine this  a kind of popery in politics if i may use such an expression which is dangerous to the eternal as well as temporal happiness of mankind  the welfare and happiness of society indeed require that every individual from the highest to the lowest should have some general idea of law but more particularly is this requifite in england where the people enjoy as the most valuable heritage derived from their ancestors the natural and most equitable right of forming a part of the legislative power  law is indeed a very comprehensive term which includes such a prodigious fund of abstruse learning that a particular and accurate knowledge of it is scarcely to be acquired with the utmost assiduity and labor even of a mans whole life and yet a general idea of law i mean that which is immutable and eternal and which forms the ground and basis of all other laws may nevertheless be very easily inculcated and as easily retained because the great outlines or rather the elements and first principles of the law consist of the most obvious and selfevident conclusions of reason which are implanted in our very nature since we inherit from our first parents the knowledge of good and evil good and evil are not matters of law or of logic they are the most if not the only essential circumstances of the world they are what every thing else refers to they stamp an eternal mark and difference on all things which even imagination cannot cancel or erase the enjoyment of the one and the avoiding of the other is the very end of our being and likewise of all the beings which do or which even can be supposed to exist and which have a sense and perception of them whatever therefore relates to the general good and evil of a people is of a public nature it is that circumstance which makes it so the terms are as good as synonimous whatever concerns on the contrary only this or that individual is of a private nature it is confined to his or their happiness or welfare to his or their good and evil there is again the true and unerring criterion these things seem clear to the greatest degree of intuitive certainty it is strange to be forced to reason about them considerations on the measures carrying on with respect to the british colonies in north america  d edit p          the considerations indeed of this sensible author in every other part of his work highly merit the most serious attention of all those persons of what party soever who desire real information and good council concerning the present disputes with our brethren in america    beforementioned by which every man who is not an idiot or madman that is every man of common sense is naturally enabled to receive discern and approve the first elements or leading principles of law and reason when fairly proposed to him in his own language and these same elements and their supreme incontrovertible authority being once known and acknowledged it is very easy in general for any man of common sense to discern by comparison what is contrary and repugnant thereto for the law is compared to a rule or right line  lex est linea recti  by which every thing that is oblique crooked transverse or different from that right line is easily known to the meanest capacity and therefore in the law the right line is always to be preferred linea recta semper praefertur transversali co lib  0 b and from hence it arises that the adjectives oblique crooked transverse etc which have no immoral signification when applied to material shapes and figures are nevertheless odious in law which is well observed by the great sir edward coke rectum says he is a proper and significant word for the right that any has and wrong or injury is in french aptly called tort because injury and wrong is wrested or crooked bring contrary to that which is right and straight etc  see in the margin below the remainder of this remark  now the law that is says sir edward coke linea recta est index sui et obliqui and briton says that tort a la ley est contrary and as aptly for the cause aforesaid is injury in english called wrong and injuria is derived from in and jus because it is contrary to right so as a fair tort is facere um and fleta says est autem jus publicum et privatum quod ex naturalibus praeceptis aut geiiua at civilibus st collectum et quod injure scripto jus appellatur id in lege augliae rectum esse cicitur and in the mirror and other places of the law it is called droit as droit defend the law defends   inst lib   c    p     the last two words however ought rather to have been rendered the law forbids than the law defends because the english verb defend is very seldom used in the sense which sir edward coke meant to express     but when great nations become too subservient to one or a few individuals either by the corruption or total exclusion of popular representation in their respective legislatures they generally seem to lose all sense of right and wrong all common honesty in their political measures as if they thought the command of an earthly superior would be a sufficient warrant for them to set aside the eternal law and so perpetrate the most abominable actions with impunity how shall we account for such wretched time serving in men who are endued with the natural light of reason and common sense perhaps it may be often attributed to the fear of temporal sufferings and inconveniences which supercede that reason and conscience which should always control the actions of men and distinguish them from brutes for without these they deserve not the name of men since a more evident mark of the beast need not be sought for than the neglect of reason and conscience or the baseness of yielding the same in an active obedience to the arbitrary will of any man or body of men whatsoever    they forget that whilst they yield an implicit active obedience to the unlawful commands of any temporal monarch or legislature through the fear of present inconveniences or corporal sufferings they rebel against the king eternal who has power over their souls as well as their bodies i say unto you said our lord my friends be not afraid of them that kill tho body and after that have no more that they can do but i will forewan you whom you shall fear fear him which after he has killed has power to cast into hell yea i say unto you fear him luke xii    see also matthew x        it was on this principle alone this sense of superior duty arising from the fear of god that i founded my address to the gentlemen of the army in my little tract on crown law respecting the due distincton between murder and manslaughter but as my sentiments on that head have since been censured i hope it will not be thought too foreign to my present topic if i insist that no act of injustice can be more flagrant than that of denying to any particular order of men whether soldiers or others their natural right of appealing to the eternal law and of acting agreeable to the dictates of their own reason and conscience  in my former tract i remarked that the law will not excuse an unlawful act committed by a soldier even though he commits it by the express command of the highest military authority in the kingdom etc and that men of true honor who have also a true sense of religion will not only be mindful that they are soldiers and subjects to an earthly king but that they are also soldiers and subjects to the king of kings whose laws and precepts they will on all occasions prefer to every other command etc  but this has been denied it seems by a critic in the monthly review for january      who calls it a strange principle in an age of infidelity indeed it may perhaps be allowed in one sense to be a strange principle but then we have the greatest reason to lament the ignorance and depravity of those men who esteem it so in any other sense than than of being too often neglected and transgressed for i trust that no man who admits or believes the divine authority of the holy scriptures will doubt the truth of it  if this strange principle had not been equally true the english nation as i remarked in my former tract would long ago have been enslaved and i will now add that even the very standing army itself would by this time have been reduced to that abject state of political slavery which at present disgraces the standing army of france i am a professed enemy indeed to standing armies but god forbid that i should be so to the individuals incorporated therein whose true honor natural dignity and just privileges as men i shall over be ready to assert and vindicate and indeed i am bound to do so by that indispensible duty which i owe to the great author of human nature in opposition to the spiritual prince of this world who is ever plotting to corrupt vilify and enslave that noblest work of god mankind and as this same love and reward which i here profess for the individuals of the army are certainly due also to the individuals of every other body of men whose general principles are censured in this declaration i must beg leave to assure my readers that i do not mean to oppose the men but merely their unreasonable principles without any personal application whatsoever for otherwise the severity of my expressions especially against the church of rome and the french government would be entirely inconsistent with that good will to men which i am indispensibly obliged upon this point i have wrote a distinct tract which is intended also for publication and entitled a tract on the law of liberty    for my own eternal happiness to maintain    and therefore those writers who attempt by any fallacious sophistry to withdraw our british soldiers see note in page x of this preface from their obedience to the eternal law or from that allegiance which they indispensibly owe to the empire of reason and conscience may justly be said to trial them more like brutes than men  but as all men of common sense are enabled by that hereditary knowledge beforementioned which has been common to all ranks of people ever since the fall of man to distinguish good from evil this point is more particularly examined and proved in my tract concerning the law of nature and principles of action in man    so they are equally enabled and indeed entitled thereby to judge do ye not know that the saints which term is not confined to persons of any particular rank or office shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters  know ye not that we shall judge angels  how much more things that pertain to this life   cor vi      concerning the legality of all human ordinances that is to discern and distinguish right from wrong equity from iniquity droit from tort jus from its opposite injuria etc this universal faculty of discernment perhaps will be better known and more readily acknowledged under the title of conscience for by that natural instinct of conscience every individual knows when he does amiss and is thereby rendered responsible before god and man for all his actions  and as all natural faculties may be improved by the rudiments of art and science so even the natural feelings of conscience may be rendered more sensible tender and distinguishing by a proper knowledge of the elements or leading precepts of the law eternal  the remainder of the tract consists in a recital and application of such general maxims as must be allowed by all persons of common sense to be the necessary conclusions of reason and are therefore to be esteemed laws of nature such as no power on earth can have any authority to counter act and the said general maxims or rules of reason and natural law are accordingly by our law writers with great propriety esteemed the first foundation of the english law primum fundamentum legis angliae est lex rationis etc quae in hoc regno sicut in omnibus aliis regnis ubique tenentur doct et stud c   p     there is indeed an inferior order of maxims though yet of very great authority which arise from general customs and the approved ancient determinations of the courts of law and these form what is called the fourth foundation of the english law though they may be ranked as the author of doctor and student informs us with the general ancient customs on the third foundation  si quis tamen pro uno solo fundamento ea meaning the general customs and the several maxims arising therefrom censeri judicaverit ad placitum suum ea pro uno tantum fundamento compotare potest et tune secundum illum quinque fundamenta for otherwise he reckons six in in all legis angliae tantum assignari debent doct et stud c   p    but as the true meaning of the said inferior maxims is not obvious to people in general like those belonging to the first foundation it is happy for us that they are not necessary to be known by any persons who do not profess the law neither indeed can they be known without great study and labor of which we are well apprised by the learned author of doctor and student haec vero maxima solum in curiis regiis five inter legis angliae peritos noscuntur nec leviter absque magno studio in legibus angliae habendo cognoci possunt ideo pro separabilibus fundamentis ponuntur ibid    it is on these incontrovertible and plain maxims these necessary conclusions of reason that the following declaration is founded and therefore as we are warned also by the revealed laws of god not to do evil that good may come the apostle paul has delivered a most tremendous warning to those wretched politicians who  the baneful doctrine  let us do evil that good may come for he immediately adds  whose damnation says he is just romans iii   if those persons who contend for the absolute necessity of bribery pensions and other undue means of parliamentary influence for the carrying on public business would carefully consider the said warning they would have just reason to be alarmed on account of their own personal danger for having promoted such a baneful and destructive principle    every reasonable man must necessarily admit that good and evil right and wrong justice and iniquity can never change their real properties through the supposed necessity of any political measures whatsoever and that nothing but justice and righteousness can ever establish the throne take away the wicked from before the king and his throne shall be established in righteousness prove xxv   it is only against some particular opinions and evil council and not against the persons of those who may have promoted the same that i mean to apply this excellent proverb the real intentions of such men though erroneous may have been as sincere as my own and i therefore protest that my earnest wish is to promote a change of opinions and measures rather than of persons since those who are once convinced of their former mistakes may hereafter prove more useful servants to the public than others perhaps whose abilities and conduct are yet untried   of our most gracious sovereign for whose peace and real happiness both temporal and eternal there is not a more sincere wellwisher amongst all his subjects notwithstanding the freedom of the followdeclaration than  granville sharp  a declaration of the peoples natural right to a share in the legislature etc an accurate and critical knowledge of law such as can only be acquired by much reading and long experience in the profession is indeed a necessary qualification for those persons who undertake to deliver their opinions concerning the nicer and more difficult questions of jurisprudence but when the natural rights of any of our fellow subjects are apparently at stake every man has a right to judge for himself and to declare his sentiments as far as plain conclusions of reason and commonsense will fairly warrant and such only are referred to in the following declaration of the natural right of popular representation in the legislature  amongst all the rights and privileges appertaining unto us said that truly noble lawyer lord summers judgment of whole kingdoms etc p     that of having a share in the legislation and being to be governed by such laws as we ourselves shall choose is the most fundamental and essential as well as the most advantageous and beneficial etc  and as all british subjects whether in great britain ireland or the colonies are equally free by the law of nature they certainly are equally entitled to the same natural rights that are essential for their own preservation because this privilege of having a share in the legislation is not merely a british right peculiar to this island but it is also a natural right which cannot without the most flagrant and stimulating injustice be withdrawn from any part of the british empire by any worldly authority whatsoever because by the natural law whereunto he almighty god has made all subject says the learned hooker hookers ecclesiastical polity lib    0 p    the lawful power of making laws to command whole politic societies of men belongs so properly unto the same entire societies that for any prince or potentate of what kind soever upon earth to exercise the same of himself or themselves and not either by express commission immediately and personally received from god or else by authority derived at the first from their consent upon whose persons they impose laws it is no better than mere tyranny laws they are not therefore which public approbation has not made so agreeable to the same just principles of natural equity is that maxim of the english constitution that law to bind all must be assented to by all principia leget aequit p    and there can be no legal appearance of assent without some degree of representation  it must indeed be acknowledged that the representation of the people of england is not so perfect as equity may seem to require since very many individuals have no vote in elections and consequently cannot be said expressly to give their assent to the laws by which they are governed nevertheless the whole country which they inhabit and in which they earn their bread and even the very houses in which they live whether they are housekeepers or lodgers are represented i must beg leave to refer the reader also to some excellent observations on this head in a pamphlet published since the above was written entitled an argument in defense of the colonies p       and      by the votes of the respective proprietors since every freeholder has a right to vote so that in this one respect the representation is general and though far from equal would still be a sufficient check against arbitrary power and afford sufficient security for the lives and property of those persons who have no vote if the laws against parliamentary corruption and especially that act of   and   will iii c   were duly enforced and also if all persons who are entrusted with the disposal of public money were required to render a strict account of it and to be severely punished whenever convicted of exerting the influence of the public treasury against public liberty which is the most baneful treachery and dishonesty that men in office who are the servants of the public as well as of the king can possibly commit but notwithstanding the inequality of the english representation and the various means practiced to corrupt it yet it has been the principal instrument of preserving amongst us those remains of natural liberty which we still enjoy in a greater proportion than most other kingdoms and has occasioned more examples of just retribution on tyrants traitors and courtfavourites in the english annals than the history of any other nation affords so that m rapin is thereby led to conclude his account of k richard ii that notorious corrupter of parliaments and enemy to the privileges of london and other corporations with the following reflection that in a government such as that of england all the efforts that the sovereign makes to usurp an absolute authority are so many steps which lead him toward the precipice cest que dans un gouvernement tell que celui dangletorre tous les efforts que le souverain fait pour usurper un pouvoir absolu sont autant de pas qui le conduisent verse le precipice tome   live x p     it is manifest therefore that the constitutional government of england even with all its defects is infinitely better than any other form of government whereby the people are deprived of their just share in the legislature the celebrated chancellor fortescue asserts that a limited or politic government like that of england is infinitely more eligible for the interest and satisfaction even of the prince himself than an absolute regal power  non jugum sed libertas est politice regeve populum securitas quoque maxima nedum plebi sed et ipsi regi alleviatio etiam non minima solicitudinis suae  viz that to rule the people by government politic is no yoke but liberty and great security not only to the subjects but also to the king himself and further no small lightening or easement to his charge de laud leg angl cap    p    so that those politicians who plead the necessity of securing at any rate a majority in parliament to vote implicitly for whatever the minister proposes do miserably betray the true interest and peace of their sovereign for this fixes upon the king and his ministers as in arbitrary governments the blame and ignominy of every determination that happens to be wrong which would otherwise either have been overruled by the free council of the nation or else must have been equally imputed to the people themselves and yet this wretched policy has alternately been adopted by all parties notwithstanding that it is founded like many of machiavels doctrines on that abominable antichristian principle of mere worldlyminded men  let us do evil that good may come  whose damnation says the apostle to the romans is just romans iii   the evil of an undue parliamentary influence they endeavor to excuse by the plea of necessity for the good of the state though it is certainly the most flagrant violation of the fundamental principles of the state and is absolutely destructive of the true interest both of the prince and people   so that the inequality of representation in this island affords no just argument for setting aside the representation of the people in other parts of the british empire because experience teaches us that even a defective representation is better than none at all and therefore it is highly unreasonable and contrary to natural equity to pretend that our brethren and fellow subjects in the more distant parts of the british empire ought to be deprived entirely of their natural rights and liberties merely because our own liberties are not entirely perfect or because our own representation in the legislature appears in some few respects to be defective and it would be quite as unreasonable to allege that the principle or reason of the maxim before quoted  viz that law to bind all must be assented to by all is unjust and inconclusive merely because it would be very difficult to accomplish it literally by the express assent of every individual but it is clearly sufficient that the maxim be construed to signify that delegated assent of the people by a majority of their legal representatives which is constitutionally necessary to make all laws binding nedum principis voluntate sed et totius regni assensu ipsa  i e angliae statuta conduntur quo populi laesuram illa efficere nequeunt vel non eorum commodum procurare etc  et si statuta haec tanta solennitate et prudentia edita efficaciae tantae quantae conditorum cupiebat intentio non esse contingant concito reformari ipsa possunt et non sine communitatis et procerum regni illius assensu quali ipsa primitus emanarunt etc chancel fortesc de laud leg ang c    p  0 b   and such a legal representation of the people is therefore absolutely necessary to constitute an effectual legislature for any part of the british empire for no tax can be levied without manifest robbery and injustice where this legal and constitutional representation is wanting because the english law abhors the idea of taking the least property from freemen without their free consent  it is iniquitous  iniquum est says the maxim iniquum est ingenuis hominibus non esse liberam rerum suarum alienationem co lit     and again quod nostrum est sine facto five defectu nostro amitti seu in

aliquod statutum esset editum contra eas leges divinas nullius vigoris in legibus angliae censeri debet etc doct et stud c   p        in every point of view the making laws for the subjects of any part of the british empire without their participation and assent is iniquitous and therefore unlawful for though the purport of any law so made be in itself perfectly just and equitable yet it becomes otherwise qui aliquid statuerit part inaudita altera aequum licet dixerit haud aequum fecerit princip leg et aequit p  0 or  haud aequus fuerit   co      that is unjust and iniquitous and therefore unlawful by the want of these necessary legal formalities  forma legalis forma essentialis  0 co   00 and forma non observata infertur adnullatio actus    co     of representation and assent for if the inhabitants of one part of the empire might determine a question or enact a law for the peculiar advantage only of that one part though to the manifest detriment and injury of another part without the representation of the latter the former part would be made judges in their own cause a circumstance that would be literally partial the very reverse of justice and natural equity and which must therefore be esteemed iniquity even to a fundamental maxim iniquum est aliquem rei sui esse judicem  in propria causa nemo judex principia legis et aequitatis p      viz it is iniquitous for any one to be a judge in his own cause partiality is therefore such an abomination in the eye of the law that no power on earth can make it lawful for even an act of parliament says the learned judge hobart rep    made against natural equity as to make a man judge in his own case the example observe is the very point in question  is void in itself for jura naturae sunt immutabilia and they are leges legum  every king of england apparently for the same reason is restrained by the law from changing or making new laws without the assent or consent of his whole kingdom in parliament expressed neque rex ibidem per se aut ministros suos tallagia subsidia aut quaevis onera alia imponit legiis suis aut leges eorum mutat vel novas condit sine concessione vel assensu totius regni sui in parliamento suo expresso etc chancell fortescue de laudibus legum angliae c    p    b and the whole kingdom even of great britain itself is only a part of the british empire and therefore by a parity of reasoning cannot justly or equitably be permitted to make laws for the whole because where the same reason is the same law or right must prevail ubi eadem ratio ibi idem lex or jus principia leg et aequit p       for turpis est pars quae non convenit cum suo toto plowden     and nihil in lege intolerabilius est eandem rem diverso jure censeri   co    the free representation of the people in the legislature is therefore to be esteemed of all our rights the most essential as lord summers has declared to maintain that excellent equilibrium of power or mixed government limited by law which our ancestors have always most zealously asserted and transmitted to us as our best birthright and inheritance major haereditas venit unicuique nostrum a jure et legibus quam a parentibus   inst    so that every attempt to set the same aside in any degree or in any part of the empire or to corrupt it by undue influence of places and pensions or bribes with public money is treason against the constitution the highest of treason the first and highest treason is that which is committed against the constitution lord sommerss judgment of whole kingdoms p    est autem injuria omne quod non jure fit fleta l   c   and on the other hand they neither are nor can be traitors who endeavor to preserve and maintain the constitution but they are the traitors who design and pursue the subversion of it they are the rebels that go about to overthrow the government of their country whereas such as seek to support and defend it are the truly loyal persons and do act conformable to the ties and obligations of fealty lord summers p    agreeable to this doctrine was the answer of dr sharp archbishop of york when the question was put to him how a person who had sworn allegiance to king james could with a good conscience take the same oath to king william to which he replied that the laws of the land are the only rule of our conscience in this matter and we are no further bound to pay obedience to governors nor to any other governors than the laws enjoin if therefore king william in the eye of the law be our king we must in conscience pay obedience to him as such i take this says he for a certain truth that as the law makes the king so the same law extends or limits or transfers our obedience and allegiance and all oaths imposed by the law oblige the conscience no further than the law meant they should oblige only this is always to be remembered that whatever obedience the laws of the land require of us it is to be understood with this proviso that it be not contradictory to the laws of god but in that case we must obey passively though we cannot obey actively and with this tacit condition i do suppose all oaths of fidelity in the world are given and taken life of abp sharp part  d page       and    ms wrote by his son for the use of his grandchildren   and therefore whatsoever is ordained that can clearly be proved to be contrary to the constitution must be allowed to be fundamentally wrong and therefore null and void of itself for sublato fundamento cadit opus jenk cent  0  but more particularly the parliament has no power to give up the ancient and established right of the people to be represented in the legislature because an act for so base a purpose would entirely subvert the principles and constitution on which the very existence of the legislature itself which ordained it is formed so that such an unnatural act of the state would be parallel to the crime of felo de se in a private person and being thus contrary to the nature of things can never be rendered valid by any authority whatsoever quae rerum natura prohibentur nulla lege confirmata sunt finch    and nihil quod est contra rationem est licitum co lit      and indeed it is laid down as a maxim by the great lord summers that no man or society of men have power to deliver up their preservation or the means of it to the absolute will of any man or men and they will have always a right to preserve what they have not power to part with p    and if a politic society has no just power to deliver up even its own preservation it certainly has much less right to deliver up the necessary preservation of other societies of their brethren and friends not represented among them without their consent and all such attempts must necessarily be deemed void and ineffectual because there is no necessity to obey where there is no authority to ordain ubi non est condendi authoritas ibi non est parendi necessitas dav    and judicium a non suo judice datum nullius est momenti  0 co      for as it so clearly appears from what has been said that natural equity does not permit even the inferior property of lands goods chattels or money to be alienated without the consent or fault of the proprietors much less can it permit the alienation annulling or changing of our most valuable inheritance the law without the due assent and consent of the heritors themselves the people at large or their lawful representatives in their respective assemblies or parliaments nam non potest rex angliae ad libitum suum leges mutare regni sui principatu nam que nedum regali sed et politico ipse suo populo dominatur and again quia nec leges ipse rex sine subditorum assensu mutare poterit nec subjectum populum renitentem onerare impositionibus peregrinis quare populus ejus libere fruetur bonis suis legibus quas cupit regulatus nec per regem suum aut quemvis alium depilatur etc chancel fortescue de laud leg ang c   p      this is a necessary conclusion of reason and commonsense drawn from the effect and force of natural equity even in cases of much less consequence  viz respecting goods and common pecuniary property so that the distinction which some great and able politicians have lately made between taxation and legislation in the late disputes about taxing the colonies was certainly erroneous though well intended since it plainly appears that the right of legislation is not less inseparable by natural equity from the people of every part of the british empire than the right of granting or withholding taxes for otherwise the free subjects of one part of the empire would be liable to be most materially injured in their greatest and most valuable inheritance the law by the hasty decisions of men on the other side of the empire with whom probably they would be totally unacquainted and whose interest might perhaps be as widely different from theirs for any thing they could know to the contrary as their situation upon the face of the globe is distant that is as widely different as the east is from the west would this be equitable could such notorious injustice si a jure discedas vagus eris et erunt omnia omnibus incerta co lit     and rerum ordo confunditur si unicuique jurisdictio non servetur   inst proem for if the fundamental rule of the constitution be set aside even in one instance the baneful influence of such an evil precedent will soon prepare the way for the destruction of the whole law because uno absurdo dato infinita sequuntur   coke  0    be ever made lawful the true constitutional mode of connecting british dominions that are otherwise separated by nature is demonstrated by the established example of the union of great britain and ireland which by long experience has proved to be sufficiently effectual it must be acknowledged indeed that an act of parliament was made in the  th of k george i chap   wherein it is laid down that the king and parliament of great britain may make laws to bind ireland if the preceding arguments are not sufficient to prove in what light the said act is to be considered yet the present distinct and separate jurisdiction of the irish parliament the continuation of their ancient and constitutional privileges notwithstanding the doctrine asserted in the said act and their annual transactions both in taxation and legislation are facts which prove better than arguments that the people of ireland have an inherent right to enact laws independent of the british parliament otherwise the kings assent would not be sufficient to render the said laws valid and binding without the especial approbation and consent also of the british parliament which indeed is never required so far is it from being necessary and farther the inhabitants of great britain would think it extremely unreasonable and unjust if the parliament of ireland should claim a right of making laws with the kings assent to bind any part of this island the argument is reciprocal so that if we should really detest such a measure against ourselves the law of laws forbids us to claim the like power over any of our fellow subjects without their free consent non facias alteri quod tibi non vis fieri this is laid down as one of the most common precepts of the law of reason doct and stud c   p   and such is the immutability of the law of reason that against it there can be no prescription statute or custom and if any are made contrary thereto they are not to be esteemed statutes or customs but corruptlae i e corruptions or depravities  non sunt statuta sive consuetudines sed corruptelae doct and stud c   p   to the same effect is that command of christ himself recorded in matt vii    which our lord declared to be the law and the prophets viz whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for this is the law and the prophets so that it may justly be entitled the law of laws and a statute therefore which is contrary thereto is doubly unlawful  the separate interests of the two kingdoms are sufficiently restrained with respect to each other by our excellent constitution of state which requires the assent of the people that is of those which are concerned respectively to render any law valid and binding upon either nation which the foregoing arguments demonstrate and i hope the ingenious and sensible author of the argument in defense of the colonies lately published will acknowledge that he has allowed too much when he admits in page     that the whole kingdom of ireland is bound by the acts of the supreme legislature etc which doctrine leads him afterward to make a distinction between taxation and legislation  and again the two kingdoms are so firmly united by the bands of allegiance to one head or monarchy of limited power that their interests in all material external exigences are thereby rendered mutual as well as their internal interest in the maintenance of natural and constitutional liberty in each kingdom respectively because one of them cannot be deprived of this as they are governed by the same head without hastening the destruction of the other and this intimate connection of mutual interest in the constitution of state and in the reciprocal enjoyment of the same reasonable common law whereby each kingdom enjoys an equality of privilege and natural freedom renders the union of the two kingdoms more just and equitable and consequently more safe and durable than it could possibly have been made by any other means and the inhabitants of both islands though sprung from a variety of jarring jealous and fierce nations have by these means acquired a certain mutual consideration for each other as fellow subjects which could never have been produced by mere alliances guarantees or defensive leagues nor perhaps by any other mode of government whatever than that by which divine providence has effected it viz the english constitution this has firmly united the strength of the two islands whereby reciprocal succor in time of need is insured to both   but as it does not appear that the parliament of ireland ever acknowledged or gave any formal assent to the said act the same must necessarily be considered as a mere assertion on one part at the making of which the persons most materially concerned on the other part were neither heard nor represented a defect qui aliquid statuerit part inaudita altera licet aequum dixerit haud aequum fecerit so that if any act is ever so just in itself yet it becomes otherwise that is unjust and iniquitous as is before remarked by the want of these legal formalities   the most notorious that can possibly be attributed to any proceeding either in the enacting or execution of laws and therefore it is to very little purpose to cite the said act as a precedent for taxing the american subjects without their consent for the privileges which the parliament of ireland has maintained and enjoyed both before and since that time clearly distinct and separate from the british parliament afford a better and more authentic precedent on the other side of the question  viz in behalf of the peoples natural rights than the act itself does against them for as the king and the people including the lords and commons of great britain constitute the sovereign power under god or legislature of great britain so the king and the people of ireland are the natural and constitutional legislature or state of that kingdom and actually exercise both in legislation and taxation their distinct jurisdiction to this day which is the best proof of their right and in like manner according to this ancient and established legal precedent the king together with the people of every distinct province subject to the imperial crown of great britain and detached as ireland is from this island ought to be and have been esteemed from the first establishment of our colonies the only proper and constitutional legislature for each province respectively every establishment in the american colonies has been settled by our ancestors as nearly as possible to the constitutional form of government in the mother country and as the advantages of this mode have been proved by the experience of more than a century see an argument just published in defense of the exclusive right claimed by the colonies to tax themselves p          it is very dangerous now that the colonies begin to be filled with people to vary the ancient and approved form of the constitution periculosum est res novas et inusitatas inducere co lit     and clausulae inconsuetae semper inducunt suspicionem   co    and again quae praeter consuetudinem et morem majorum fiunt neque placent neque recta videntur   co    and lastly whatsoever is against the rule of law is inconvenient co lit p       because the representation of the people in every part of the british empire is absolutely necessary to constitute an effectual legislature according to the fundamental principles of the english constitution for none of them separately can be esteemed a competent legislature to judge of the others rights without the highest injustice and iniquity which is before demonstrated by some of the first maxims or principles of reason and yet howsoever distinct these several parts or provinces may seem in point of situation as well as in the exercise of a separate legislative power for each which constitutional right they have enjoyed beyond the memory of man they are nevertheless firmly united by the circle of the british diadem so as to form one vast empire which will never be divided if the safe and honest policy be adopted of maintaining the british constitution inviolate in all parts of the empire for it is a system so natural so beneficial and so engaging to the generality of mankind that by the same means we might hold the empire of the world were the laws of natural equity justice and liberty to be strictly observed and the abomination of domestic the toleration of domestic slavery in the colonies greatly weakens the claim or natural right of our american brethren to liberty let them put away the accursed thing that horrid oppression from among them before they presume to implore the interposition of divine justice for whilst they retain their brethren of the world in the most shameful involuntary servitude it is profane in them to look up

nor is it merely the first and highest treason in itself that a member of a political society is capable of committing to go about to subvert the constitution but it is also the greatest treason he can perpetrate against the person crown and dignity of the king for such an endeavor both annuls and vacates all his title to superiority over those above whom he was exalted from the common level by virtue of the constitution and deprives him of all rightful and legal claim of rectoral authority over the society by destroying the alone foundation upon which it was erected and by which he became vested with it etc ibid p   and  0 because a king of england has no legal authority to govern by any other mode than that limited government called the english constitution which he is sworn to maintain for such is the frailty of human nature that no man or body of men whatever is to be entrusted with the administration of government unless they are thus limited by law and by a due representation of the people at large subject to a frequent appeal by election to the whole body of constituents for it is a maxim that he who is allowed more power by law than is fit or equitable the same will still desire more power than is already lawful cui plus licet quam par est plus vult quam licet   inst     so that no power on earth is tolerable without a just limitation and law which

copy extract of a letter on the foregoing subject to a friend in america dated february         i have also sent you a book lately published by dr  respecting the government of the british colonies  the reason of my sending the latter is not because i approve of it or have the least connection with the author but on the contrary that you and your friends in america may be aware of the unconstitutional doctrines which are thereby propagated amongst us i have not indeed had opportunity to peruse it regularly neither do i now think it necessary to do so for i was lucky enough when i first took it up to turn over a few pages in the fourth part containing five propositions upon the point in question whereby the authors sentiments and intentions may be sufficiently known without descending to his arguments upon them for not one of them not even the  th and last which he himself prefers can possibly be reconciled either to law equity or sound politics so that if the doctor with the same neglect of law and constitutional principles had multiplied his propositions to the number of an hundred times five he would not have been able to lay down a plan or mode of government tolerably suitable to the case before him because in this as in many other things there is but one right though very many wrong methods of proceeding and the doctor has unfortunately forgot to state the only right proposition upon the subject in question that can be admitted consistently with the necessary principles abovementioned of law equity and sound politics viz to do justice to our brethren of america that is to govern them according to the established principles of the english constitution and known laws of the land and heartily to acknowledge their unalienable right to the same happy privileges by which the liberties of the mother country have hitherto been maintained the most essential of which is the privilege of paying no other taxes than what are voluntarily granted by the people or their legal representatives in general councils or parliaments  dr  is inexcusable for having omitted this sixth proposition for he cannot be ignorant of the legal and established mode of extending the english constitution to countries detached from this island because we have a standing precedent and example which has long subsisted and has been universally allowed in the present government of ireland for that island though unjustly conquered by our ancestors enjoys or at least is allowed to be entitled to the same constitutional privileges as the seat of empire england itself the respective parliaments of the two islands are entirely independent of each other they separately grant from time to time the necessary supplies to the state and no man may presume to deny their right of enquiring respectively into the application of them but notwithstanding this distinct economy and the entire independency of the natives or subjects with respect to each other yet they are firmly united by the bands of allegiance to one head or monarchy of limited power whereby they enjoy the privileges of the same reasonable common law and the same excellent constitution of state so that the equality of privilege and condition renders the union more just and equitable and consequently more safe and durable than it could possibly have been made by any other means  and the inhabitants of both islands though sprung from a variety of jarring jealous and fierce nations have by this means acquired a certain mutual consideration for each other as fellow subjects which could never have been produced by mere alliances guarantees or defensive leagues nor perhaps by any other mode of government whatever than that by which divine providence has effected it viz the english constitution  this has firmly united the strength of the two islands whereby reciprocal succor in time of need is insured to both this established example of the true constitutional mode of connecting british dominions that are otherwise separated by nature will enable us by comparison to discern the illegality and injustice of dr  s five propositions the stately vine of british dominion if i may use that scriptural type has providentially extended its luxuriant branches to the most distant parts of the earth and will continue to spread and increase as long as justice and the laws of liberty are duly maintained by those who are entrusted with the administration of government unless the wickedness of individuals manifested by the exercise of domestic slavery and oppression in the colonies and of political corruption and venality at home with the growing vices attending both respectively should unhappily draw down gods vengeance upon us and perhaps our mutual punishment is at this time impending in the present differences and ignorance of the english constitution but how will the trunk or stock of the british vine appear if we should entirely separate or lop off the branches  the american branches are already detached indeed in point of distance and widely separated from the trunk by a vast ocean but the imperial crown of great britain is nevertheless a sufficient band of union or connection between them it being the legal ensign of authority for the maintenance and execution of the same just laws the influence of which may by a due constitutional exertion of the regal power be circulated like wholesome sap from the root to the most distant branches  but if according to dr  s  th proposition the flourishing branches of north america were to be entirely separated from the trunk and excluded from the circle of the royal diadem the effect would be reciprocally humiliating for the act of separation would at the same time unavoidably contract the imperial authority of the british empire to the narrow limits of british and irish ground except a few small sugarislands peopled chiefly by the most miserable of slaves so that both great britain and her colonies would reciprocally lose importance strength and security by the disunion a guarantee of independence against all foreign invaders as proposed by dr  would fall far short of the effect which we enjoy by the present constitution because it would not like the latter produce that mutual consideration and protection which are due from fellow subjects our connection according to the doctors measure would be upon no better footing than alliances of the same kind with detached foreign powers which as experience teaches us subsist no longer than the private interest or separate views of the contracting parties  if all these points are duly considered the very proposing so pernicious a measure must appear highly criminal if not treasonable especially as the author has been pleased to insinuate that there is no alternative  if we neither can govern the americans says he nor be governed by them if we can neither unite with them nor ought to subdue them what remains says he but to part with them on as friendly terms as we can but is it not treason against the crown to insinuate that the americans cannot be governed as well as treason against the people at large to say that we cannot unite with our american brethren when there is a constitutional mode both of government and union established by law and an unquestionable precedent the observance of which would undoubtedly satisfy every honest american subject  the advocates for the jurisdiction of the british parliament in america like all promoters of bad measures will not fail to represent those that oppose them as licentious and disaffected persons and therefore as it is highly necessary for the general welfare and subsistence of the british empire both in europe asia and america upon the principles already explained that we should strictly maintain our loyalty to the crown at the same time that we steadily assert our legal and constitutional rights  i think we ought to lose no proper opportunity of expressing our personal attachment to the king and the royal family who in themselves indeed are truly amiable and worthy of esteem but it is very difficult in this world to guard against misrepresentation and bad advice however i trust that a steady perseverance in love and duty will be the true means of your prevailing in the end as it will prove that your opposition is not occasioned either by disaffection or disloyalty but is truly legal and constitutional  i am with great esteem dear sir your obliged humble servant granville sharp p s i am entirely unacquainted i profess with the nature of the crown charters or grants to the several american proprietors and therefore left these should contain any condition or acknowledgement on the part of the landholders which may seem to militate against the foregoing observations i must beg leave to add that the legislature has agreed and laid down as a rule that all the ancient arbitrary and military tenures of land and even socage in capite of the king and the consequents upon the same have been much more burdensome grievous and prejudicial to the kingdom than they have been beneficial to the king see preamble to the act of   th of charles ii chap    for taking away the court of wards and liveries and tenures in capite and by knights service and purveyance etc and for this just reason founded on former experience whereas it has been found by former experience that the courts of wards and liveries and tenures by knightsservice either of the king or others or by knightsservice in capite or soccage in capite of the king and the consequents upon the same have been much more burdensome grievous and prejudicial etc   the crown has ever since been restrained by the law from granting any manors lands etc upon such or indeed any other conditions whatsoever than free and common socage only see  d and  th sections of the said act   i have heard indeed that a certain island in the northern part of america was granted to a noble lord with a particular jurisdiction upon the ancient feudal plan whereby he is said to have been established as lord paramount with a peculiar unconstitutional authority but this i am willing to presume is merely report and even if it were true the grant would be innocent enough in its effects provided the people be instructed in their rights because all such undue conditions as i have mentioned are absolutely null and void in themselves for the law obliges us to construe them as if they had no other meaning than a legal grant of lands in free and common socage see the  th section of the said act and be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid that all tenures there is none excepted hereafter to be created by the kings majesty his heirs or successors upon any gifts or grants of any manors lands tenements or hereditaments of any estate of inheritance at the common law shall be in free and common socage and shall be adjudged to be in free and common socage only and not by knights service etc    soli deo gloria et gratia a declaration of the peoples natural right to a share in the legislature etc part ii qui non libere veritatem pronunciat proditor est veritatis   inst epil part ii containing a declaration or defense of the same doctrine  viz the natural right of the people to a share in the legislature when applied particularly to the people of ireland in answer to the assertions of several eminent writers on that point which have hitherto been permitted to pass without due animadversion when the first part of this declaration was sent to the press i was not aware that there had been any controversy before the sixth of king george i concerning the freedom of our fellow subjects in ireland or that any englishman acquainted with the principles of our excellent constitution of state had ever before that time presumed to advance any doctrine which might tend to deprive our irish brethren of their natural freedom and of the inestimable benefits of that happy legal constitution which british subjects in general are commonly supposed to inherit by birthright  but i have since had the mortification to find that such great authorities as lord coke judge jenkins lord chief justice vaughan judge blackstone the honorable mr justice barrington etc might be quoted in favor of a contrary doctrine and as i have mentioned the union between great britain and ireland in the first part of this declaration etc as an example of the true constitutional mode of connecting british dominions that are otherwise separated by nature i thought myself therefore obliged to search and examine the grounds upon which these grew and learned men have founded their opinions that if they should have truth on their side they might have the credit of it but if not that the truth of this important question when plainly and impartially stated might prevent for the future any such undue pretensions on the one hand and jealousies on the other as have too frequently occasioned misunderstandings and controversies between the subjects of the two kingdoms  lord hussy chief justice in the reign of king henry vii seems to have been the first who ventured publicly to assert that statutes made in england shall bind the subject of ireland hussy chief justice disoit que les statuts falts on angleterre liera ceux de ireland que ne suit moult  ds autres justices nient obstant que acn de oux furent en coutrarid opinione le derrein term en son absence year book   hen vii p    and though the doctrine is unconstitutional and dangerous if admitted in a general unlimited sense which is clearly proved by sir richard bolton chancellor of ireland in the declaration etc printed in harriss hibernica p     as to the opinion of hussy chief justice in first of hen   fol   that the statutes made in england shall bind them of ireland this opinion as it is put by him generally cannot be law for brook in abridging that case in title parliament sect    says that that opinion was denied to be law the last term before and added further tamen nota that ireland is a realm of itself and has a parliament in itself implying thereby that ireland could not be bound but by a parliament of ireland and according to that is the opinion of the judges in  0th hen vi fol   in john pilkingtons case and in  d rich iii fol ii in the merchants of waterfords case before remembered and likewise contrary to the opinion of hussy are the judgments of eight several parliaments in ireland before the statute of  0th of hen vii viz   th of edw ii   th of edw ii   th of hen vi   th of hen vi   d hen vi   th hen vi and  th edw iv and since the statute  0th hen vii of five parliaments viz   th of hen viii   d of hen viii   th of eliz   th of jam and  0th car besides the statute of  0th of hen vii itself    yet in justice to judge hussy it must be allowed that his declaration was certainly right with respect to the particular case then before him which related to the exportation of goods from waterford for the irish subjects themselves do not deny the jurisdiction of great britain upon the high seas nor in matters of external this binding in external transactions seems to be allowed though unwillingly by mr molly neux a zealous asserter of the liberties of ireland in the reign of king william they seem says he speaking of english acts of parliament at the utmost reach to extend the jurisdiction of the english parliament over the subjects of ireland only in relation to their action beyond seas out of the realm of ireland as they are the king of englands subjects etc p      commerce though the english power even in that respect may sometimes perhaps have been extended farther than reason and equity can fairly warrant but before lord chief justice hussy delivered his opinion this proper distinction concerning the english acts binding the irish in external transactions had been made in his absence by the other judges in a preceding term all the judges but we must except hussy were assembled in the exchequer chamber and there with respect to the first question it was said that the lands of ireland have a parliament among themselves and all kinds of courts as in england and by the same parliament they make laws and change laws and are not bound by statutes made in england because they have not here knights of parliament but this is understood of lands and things only to be effected in those lands but their persons are subject to the king and as subjects they are bound to any thing out of that land that is done out of that land contrary to statute like as the inhabitants of calais gascoigne guicone etc while they were subjects of the king and in like manner are obedient under the admiral of england concerning any thing done upon the highseas and also a writ of error of judgment given in ireland is cognizable in the kings bench here in england  anno secundo rich iii p    omnes justiciarii but we must except hussy associati fuerunt in camera scaccarii et ibi quoad primam questionem dicebatur quod terrae hiberniae inter se habent parliamentum et omnimodo curias prout in anglia et per idem parliamentum faciunt leges et mutant leges et non obligantur per statuta in anglia qui non hic babent milites parliamenti sed hoc intelligitur de terris et rebus in terris ill tantum efficiendo sed personae illae sunt subjectae regis et tanquam subjecti erunt obligati ad aliquam rem extra terram illam faciendam contra statutum sicut habitantes in calesia gascoignie guien etc dum fuerunt subjecti et similiter obedientes erunt sub admirall angliae de re facta super altum mare et similiter breve de errore de judicio reddito in hibernia in banco regio hic in anglia etc    which accounts for the remark of the reporter that this opinion of chief justice hussy was not much denied by the other judges though some of them were of a contrary opinion the last term in his absence but by the expression that it was not much denied it is apparent that the other judges did not receive the doctrine of chief justice hussy entirely and absolutely without some demur which could only consist in their adding that due distinction beforementioned for it plainly appears notwithstanding the assertion of the reporter that they were not really of a contrary opinion in the former term with respect to the case before them which related to an external transaction the same that in their former opinion they declared to be subject to the control of england and therefore there was no reason why they should much deny the opinion of chief justice hussy since the particular case before them did not require it  but the like excuse cannot be made for sir edward coke who in calvins case seems to have adopted the opinion of chief justice hussy and yet has not considered the nature of the case on which the same was delivered having declared a similar opinion in an indiscriminate general sense that albeit ireland was a distinct dominion yet the title thereof being by conquest the same by judgment of law might by express words be bound by act of parliament of england calvins case  th rep p      without paying the least regard to that just distinction between the external and internal government of ireland which the other judges had before so clearly laid down and confirmed by an unanswerable reason see the former note in p    quia non hic habent milites parliamenti why the irish should not be bound in the latter by any other laws than those to which their own parliament had assented viz quia non hic habent milites parliamenti which doctrine was agreeable also to what had long before been declared by that celebrated constitutional lawyer the great judge fortescue on pilkingtons  et auxi la terre de ireland est severe del roiaume d angleterre car si un disme ou quinzime soit grante icy ceo ne liera ceux d ireland mesque le roy manderoit m cel estat for estatute en ireland soubz son grand seel sinon que ils veul en leur parliament ceo approver mes sils veul allower ceo donq sera tenu la et ils seront lies par icel year book   th hen vi p     case in the   th of hen vi which was readily admitted at the same time by judge portington and for any thing that appears to the contrary agreeable also to the opinion of all the other judges that were then present for sir richard bolton remarks that this was not denied by markham yelverton and ascough the case is stated by sir richard bolton chancellor of ireland in his declaration etc printed in harriss hibernica p    as follows that one john pilkington brought a scire facias against one a to show cause why letters patents whereby the king had granted an office in ireland to the said a should not be repealed whereas the said john pilkington had the same office granted him by former letters patents granted by the same king to occupy to himself or his deputy whereupon the said a was warned and appeared and said that the land of ireland time beyond the memory of man has been a land separated and severed from the realm of england and ruled and governed by the customs and laws of the same land of ireland and that the lords of the same land which are of the kings council have used from time to time in the absence of the king to elect a justice which justice so elected has power to pardon and punish all felonies trespasses etc and to assemble a parliament and by the advice of the lords and commonalty to make statutes and he alleges further that a parliament was assembled and that it was ordained by the said parliament that every man who had any office within the said land before a certain day and he puts the day in certain shall occupy the said office by himself or otherwise that he shall forfeit his office and shows further how the said john pilkington occupied the said office by a deputy and that insomuch as he came not in proper person to reside upon his office before the day that his office was void and that the king by his letters patents granted the said office so become void to the said a and prayed that the said letters patents should be effectual and not repealed and upon the plea the said john pilkington demurred in law in the argument of which case it was debated by the judges yelverton fortescue portington markham and ascough whether the said prescription were good or void in law yelverton and portington held the prescription void but fortesine markham and ascough held the prescription good and that the letters patents made to a were good and effectual and ought not to be repeated and in the argument of this case it was agreed by fortescue and portington that if a tenth or fifteenth be granted by parliament in england that shall not bind them in ireland although the king send the same statute into ireland under his great seal except they in ireland will in their parliament approve it but if they will approve it then it shall bind in ireland and portington said that if a tenth be granted in the parliament of england that shall not bind in ireland because they have not any commandment by writ to come to our parliament and this was not denied by markham yelverton or ascough upon this case these points following are to be observed first that the lords of the council of ireland had then power in the absence of the king and vacancy of a lieutenant or deputy to elect a justice and that is plainly proved by the preamble of the statutes of   d of hen viii chap   in ireland the words are these for as much as continually since the conquest of this realm of ireland it has been used in this same realm of ireland that at every such time as it has chanced the same realm to be destitute of a lieutenant deputy justice or other head governor by death surrender or departure out of the said realm or otherwise the council of this realm of ireland for the time being have used by the laws and usages of the same to assemble themselves together to choose and elect a justice to be ruler and governor of this realm till the kings highness had deputed and ordained a lieutenant deputy or other governor for the same realm which justice so being elected was and has been always by the ancient laws and customs of this said realm of ireland authorized to do and exercise the said room of deputy there for the good rule and governance and leading of the kings subjects within the said realm of ireland and in ministration of justice with diverse other authorities preeminences and jurisdictions there which usage election and authority of the said justice has been many times ratified and confirmed by diverse statutes in this realm provided and made but this order of election of a justice is now by the laid statute of   d of hen viii altered as by the said statute more at large may appear   sir john fortescue had declared that if a tenth or fifteenth were granted here this should not bind those of ireland even though the king should send the same statute into ireland under his great seal except they will in their parliament approve it but if they will allow it i e then it shall be held there and they shall be bound by it and to this point judge portington expressly declared his assent  et auxi quant a ceo que fortescue ad dit que si un disme soit grante en le parliament icy ceo ne liera ceux d ireland jeo veux bien pur ceo que ils nont commandment ove nous per breve de venir al parliament year book   th hen vi p    jeo veux bien says he and then assigns the incontestible reason pur ceo because they the irish subjects have no summons with us to come to parliament  but lord coke has unfortunately neglected to weigh the importance of this just reason and consequently has been led to misconstrue the doctrine to which it has at different times been applied by the judges for in calvins case  th rep p     he cites the opinion of the judges in  d rich iii beforementioned viz that ireland has a parliament and they make laws and our statutes do not bind them and he cites also their reason viz because they do not send knights to our parliament but he adds in a parenthesis that this is to be understood unless they be especially named and  d rich iii    says he hibernia habet parliamentum et faciunt leges et nostra statuta non ligant eos quia non mittunt milites ad parliamentum which is to be understood unless they be especially named sed personae eorum sunt subjecti regis sicut habitantes in calesia gasconia et guyan etc calvins case   rep p        thus he is so far from perceiving the weight of the reason assigned by the former judges that he has ventured to set it aside as if it had no meaning at all by the insertion of an arbitrary parenthesis in the middle of the sentence without assigning a stronger reason or even any reason at all for his authority and therefore we are certainly bound to prefer the declaration of the other judges who founded their opinion on a clear legal reason that has never yet been disproved for the reason of the law is the life of the law ratio legis est anima legis jenk cent p      the naming or not naming ireland in our english acts cannot in the least affect the argument of the former judges for if it holds good to secure the irish subjects from being bound when not especially named which is allowed even by sir edward coke himself it certainly is equally effectual when they are named or rather i ought to say the reason is much more forcible in the latter case which apparently enhances the propriety and importance of it because when the business relating to ireland is debated it is manifest that the irish subjects stand most in need of a due representation which cannot therefore be denied them at such a time without the most flagrant violation of justice and natunal equity  but lest any of my readers should still retain any doubt concerning the groundless doctrine broached by sir edward coke that english statutes bind in ireland when especially named i have yet another authority to add which must needs turn the scale being no less than the testimony even of sir edward coke himself upon this very point let his own words judge him  he informs us in his  th inst cap    p   0 that sometimes the king of england called his nobles of ireland to come to his parliament of england etc and after reciting the form of the writ used on such occasions  0 octobris rex affectans pacificum statum terrae hiberniae mandavit richardo de burgo com ulton et aliis nobilibus terrae predictae quod sint ad parliamentum suum quod summoneri fecit apud westminster in octabus sancti hillarii proxad tractand ibid cum proceribus etc regni sui super statu terrae praedictae rot parl   e   m     he adds  an excellent president  says he to be followed whenever any act of parliament shall be made in england concerning the statute of ireland etc  but if this be an excellent president the same spirit of justice which inclines us to approve it as such must needs force us to condemn the opposite notion concerning mere english statutes hinding ireland when especially named and consequently it must appear that lord coke was not sufficiently upon his guard when he advanced this unjust doctrine and yet alas he has repeated the same in this very page immediately after the information before quoted concerning the nobles of ireland being summoned to the parliament of england for he adds  and by special words says he the parliament of england may bind the subjects of ireland etc but it lucklly happens that he is less reserved in this place than in the other passage already is asserted for here he has attempted to justify his opinion by an example which out of respect to so great an author we may of course presume to be the very best that could have been produced for that purpose especially since he mentions it as one example for many and yet happily for the truth this one example for many proves nothing so much when duly considered as the direct contrary to his assertion about binding ireland by special words etc for it amounts to an implied acknowledgment upon public record of the injustice of pretending to bind the subjects of ireland without their express consent being in reality a copy of the kings writ beforementioned to summon the nobles of ireland to the parliament at westminster there to treat with the nobles etc of his kingdom upon the state of the said land i e ireland thus it is plain that the english legislature even so early as in the reign of edward ii by whom the writ was issued did not esteem it equitable to debate upon the state of the said land  super statu terrae praedictae without some legislative representation thereof but besides this one example for all sir edward coke has given us also in the same page a memorandum from the parliament rolls of the   th of edw iii rot parl    e   irrot sic anno    e   de concilio fummonit pro terr habentibus in hibernia maria comitissa norf ad mittendum fide dignos ad colloquium aelianora com orm ad mittendum fide dignos ad colloquium jana la despencer ad mittendum fide dignos ad colloquium

who in their own right held lands in ireland and of these no less than nine to summon them to send representatives or proper persons to confer with the parliament ad mittendum fide dignos ad colloquium and consequently if lord cokes doctrine for which he has cited these examples had in those early times been current viz that by special words the parliament of england may bind the subjects of ireland it is apparent that the same could not have been understood in any other light than that of including a due representation of the irish parliament within the parliament of england which the examples themselves sufficiently demonstrate in the same page likewise  th inst p   0 lord coke has produced still more evidence to prove the parliamentary rights of the irish subjects for he cites the parliament rolls of  0th of edw ii  de parliamentis singulis annis in hibernia tenendis et de legibus et consuetudinibus ibidem emendandis and he remarks thereupon  hereby it appears says he that there were parliaments holden in ireland before this time and order taken at this parliament says he that they should be holden every year and the like acts were made in england in  th e iii and   th e iii for parliaments to be holden in england so that regular annual parliaments were established in ireland before they were in england    and that this was really the case is clearly proved by some other english records cited by mr mollyneux in his case of ireland pp    and    whereby it appears that even knights of the shires citizens and burgesses were elected in the shires cities and boroughs of ireland to serve in parliament in england formerly says mr mollyneux when ireland was but thinly peopled and the english laws not fully current in all parts of the kingdom it is probable that then they could not frequently assemble with convenience or safety to make laws in their own parliament at home and therefore during the heats of rebellions or confusion of the times they were forced to enact laws in england but then this was always by their proper representatives for we find that in the reign of edward the third and by what foregoes it is plain it was so in edward the firsts time knights of the shire citizens and burgesses were elected in the shires cities and boroughs of ireland to serve in parliament in england and have so served accordingly for amongst the records of the tower of london roe claus  0 edward the third parl   memb    we find a writ from the king at westminster directed to james butler lord justice of ireland and to r archbishop of dublin his chancellor requiring them to issue writs under the great seal of ireland to the several counties cities and boroughs for satisfying the expenses of the men of that land who last came over to serve in parliament in england and in another roll the  0th of edw iii membr    on complaint to the king by john draper who was chosen burgess of cork by writ and served in the parliament of england and yet was denied his expenses by some of the citizens care was taken to reimburse him  if from these last mentioned records it be concluded that the parliament of england may bind ireland it must also be allowed that the people of ireland ought to have their representatives in the parliament of england and this i believe we should be willing enough to embrace but this is in happiness we can hardly hope for  this sending of representatives out of ireland to the parliament in england on some occasions was found in process of time to be very troublesome and inconvenient and this we may presume was the reason that afterward when times were more settled we fell again into our old track and regular course of parliaments in our own country and hereupon the laws aforenoted page    were enacted establishing that no law made in the parliament of england should be of force in ireland till it was allowed and published in parliament here    which ancient privilege of the irish commoned has either been unknown or also overlooked and forgot by lord coke and indeed it is not probable that the irish parliament was ever summoned to england regularly or as a matter of course to meet the english parliament but only on extraordinary occasions wherein the subjects of ireland were particularly concerned and could not we may presume be  specially named and bound that is consistently with natural equity and their own just rights without their express assent for it is apparent that regular parliaments were held in ireland both before since and even during the reigns of those very princes who issued writs to summon them to england which latter therefore can only be attributed to some extraordinary or peculiar circumstances out of common course which rendered it necessary  in addition to the clear precedents before cited it may not perhaps be improper to take notice of a circumstance quoted by the honorable mr justice barrington from petyt mss vol xxvii p     for though it is not a precedent exactly to the point in question  i e the sending representatives from ireland to the english parliament yet it tends to corroborate the same equitable doctrine concerning the necessity of representation in general which ought to be the basis of all determinations either in the privy council to which the example particularly relates or elsewhere there is a writ says he of edward iii in the  0th year of his reign to oblige the inhabitants of cork to pay the expenses of john droup who is stated to have been chosen by the community to attend the kings privy council in england observations on the more ancient statutes etc p      the business of his attendance however does not appear but on whatever account he might attend the privy council he was probably the same person that is mentioned in the record before cited from mr mollyneux by the name of john draper who was chosen burgess of cork by writ and served in the parliament of england for as the other circumstances correspond both with respect to the place from whence he came and the year of his being sent it is natural to conclude that the small disagreement in the name may have been occasioned by some accidental mistake viz john droup for john draper or vice versa and he might serve the inhabitants of cork in the double capacity of representative in parliament and agent for them to the privy council or perhaps his summons and attendance even at the kings privy council might have been in his parliamentary capacity for if a due representation from ireland was to attend the king here in his privy council such an assembly might without danger i apprehend be allowed all the powers of an effectual legislative to bind ireland provided the respective branches of irish representation be preserved entire and distinct for the english privy council could have no legal voice in such a case except that of advising the assent or dissent of the sovereign and yet whenever it was necessary to call a distinct irish parliament in england it is not improbable but that they might be summoned to meet the king in his privy council by way of distinguishing their separate assembly from the jointmeeting of the english and irish parliaments beforementioned and that such distinct irish parliaments have sometimes been held in england appears by a record cited by mr mollyneux there have been other statutes or ordinances made in england for ireland which may reasonably be of force here because they were made and assented to by our own representatives thus we find in the white book of the exchequer in dublin in the  th year of edward the first a writ sent to his chancellor of ireland wherein he mentions quaedam statuta per nos de assensa prelatorum comitum baronum and communitates regni nostri hibexniae per upud lincoln and quaedam alia statuta postmodum papud eborum facta these we may suppose were either statutes made at the request of the states of ireland to explain to them the common law of england or if they were introductive of new laws yet they might well be of force in ireland being enacted by the assent of our own representatives the lords spiritual and temporal and commons of ireland as the words aforementioned do show and indeed these are instances so far from making against our claim that i think nothing can be more plainly for us for it manifestly shows that the king and parliament of england would not enact laws to bind ireland without the concurrence of the representatives of this kingdom  wherein mention is made of statutes made at lincoln and at york in the  th of edw i by the express assent of the irish parliament in all its branches of legislature viz per nos de assensu prelatorum comitorum et communitates regni nostri hibernioe without the least mention of the english parliament thus it appears probable that the irish have been represented in england as well in separate as in joint parliaments and upon such equitable terms of representation in england i presume no irish patriot will object to the binding of english statutes  add hereunto says sir william petty in his political survey of ireland p    that if both kingdoms were under one legislative power and parliament the members whereof should be proportionable in power and wealth of each nation there would be no danger such a parliament should do any thing to the prejudice of the english interest in ireland nor could the irish ever complain of partiality when they shall be freely and proportionably represented in all legislatures the same author has also made a very striking remark in p    concerning the necessity of maintaining the independence of the legislative power whether we apply the same to ireland or to any other part of the british empire for why should men says he endeavor to get estates where the legislative power is not agreed upon and where tricks and words destroy natural rights and property   whether ireland be  especially named or not because the just reason of objection before cited from the judges in the   th of henry vi and  d richard iii no longer subsists when a due representation is allowed  how much later than the reign of edw iii this practice was continued of occasionally summoning the irish parliament into england does not appear though we may be certain that it did not continue so late as the reign of hen vi because the great fortescue and the other judges his cotemporaries could not have declared as has already been shown that a tenth or fifteenth granted here should not bind those of ireland if the practice of sending representatives from thence had continued to that time nevertheless the proofs already produced are amply sufficient to confute the observation of judge jenkins in his  th century p     viz that the statutes of england which expressly name ireland bind them and their lands and goods as the statute of york says he made   th e ii and the   th e i de mercatoribus and others for as i have produced sufficient examples of the irish parliament being summoned to england in both the reigns which he has mentioned these statutes cited by him can afford no testimony of what he supposes because the irish might probably have been represented in those very parliaments for which opinion i have already shown there is some evidence and i am not apprehensive that any evidence at all can be produced to the contrary  the same reply holds good also against the most material examples cited in sergeant mayarts answer to sir richard boltons declaration the learned editor of these two tracts mr harris who has published them in his hibernica printed at dublin in    0 supposes that sir richard bolton was not the author of this declaration and informs us in his preface that he is inclined rather to give the honor of the performance to patrick darcey esquire an eminent lawyer and an active member of the house of commons in the parliament assembled at dublin in    0 who was the author of a similar argument delivered by him at a conference with a committee of the irish lords in      printed in      the conformity says mr harris between what is alleged in the declaration and in darcys arguments inclines me to think him the author of that paper but a conformity in substance between two authors upon one and the same national question is very far from affording so substantied a proof of the real author as the name of sir richard bolton upon one of the manuscripts probably the impeachment of sir richard bolton in the same year of high treason for betraying in his capacity of chancellor of ireland the constitution of that country viz for having traitorously contrived introduced and exercised an arbitrary and tyrannical government against law throughout this kingdom ireland by the countenance and assise of thomas earl of strafford then christ governor of this kingdom see the  st article of impeachment against sir richard bolton and others with the speech of mr audley mervi on that occasion taken from nalsops collection of papers and raprinted at dublin in      at the end of darcys argument    might be another reason for mr harriss supposition but this very contrary behavior with which sir richard bolton was charged does not appear to have been so much the effect of his private opinion as of him political timeserving or yielding with his brethren in administration to the arbitrary notions of lord strafford the then lord lieutenant of ireland or perhaps the dangerous increasing power of the papists at that time might occasion his thus yielding to measures which were so diametrically opposite to his own just principles though indeed no danger whatever can justify such conduct since honesty is always most certainly the best policy nevertheless not only sergeant mayarts answer acknowledges sir richard as the author of the declaration but mr mollyneux in p    and    cites a marginal note of sir richards when he was lord chief baron of the exchequer in ireland which he had affixed in his edition of the irish statutes stat  0 henry vii c    to the following purport resembling the substance of the declaration attributed to sir rich bolton much more than the argument of mr darcy viz that in the   th of edward the second by parliament in this realm of ireland the statutes of merton made the  0th of henry the second and the statutes of malbridge made the   d of henry the third the statute of westminster the first made the  d of edward the first the statute of gloucester made the  th of edward the first and the statute of westminster the second made the   th of edward the first were all confirmed in this kingdom ireland and all other statutes which were of force in england were referred to be examined in the next parliament and so many as were then allowed and published to stand likewise for laws in this kingdom and in the  0th of henry the fourth it was enacted in this kingdom of ireland that the statutes made in england should not be of force in this kingdom unless they were allowed and published in this kingdom by parliament and the like statute was made again in the   th of henry the sixth these statutes are not to be found in the rolls nor any parliament roll of that time but he sir richard bolton had seen the same exemplified under the great seal and the exemplification remains in the treasury of the city of waterford mollyneuxs case of ireland pp    and       setting forth how and by what means the laws and statutes of england from time to time came to be of force in ireland and it is undeniable that the irish parliament have in general thought it necessary to examine and to authenticate by the express assent of their own assemblies such english statutes as they judged proper to be admitted as law within their own island of which sir richard bolton has produced a great variety of examples but such statutes as have been made in england since the   th of king john and are introductory and positive making new laws or any ways altering adding unto or diminishing the ancient common laws have not been binding or any ways of force in ireland until such time as they have been enacted allowed and approved of by act of parliament in ireland as may appear by the judgments of nine parliaments holden there viz in the   th of edward ii in a parliament in ireland the statutes of merton and marlebridge made in the time of henry iii and the statutes of westminster  st and of westminster  d and the statute of gloucester made in the time of edward i were confirmed and approved to be of force in ireland and all other statutes which were of force in england were then referred to be examined in the next parliament and so many of them as should be then allowed and published to be accepted for laws in ireland and afterward in a parliament holden in ireland in   th of edward ii it was enacted that the statutes made in england should not be of force in the kingdom of ireland unless they were allowed and published in that kingdom by parliament and the like statute was made again in   th of henry vi  but these statutes are not to be found in these parliament rolls nor any parliament rolls at that time but the same are exemplified under the great seal and the exemplifications were remaining in the treasury of the city of waterford and it is most certain that not only these parliament rolls but also many other rolls and records miscarried in those troublesome and distempered times which have been in ireland for in all the times of edw iii  rich ii  hen iv  and hen v which is almost an hundred years there is not any parliament roll to be found and yet it is most certain that diverse parliaments were holden in those times moreover in   th of edw i   th of edw iii    th of edw iii    th of edw iii    th of edw iii  and  th of rich ii diverse good laws were made in england by several acts of parliament against the extortions and oppressions of purveyors which laws were never received nor put into execution in ireland until the   th of hen vi chap   that it was enacted agreed and established by parliament in ireland that all statutes made against purveyors within the realm of england should be holden and kept in all points and put in execution in ireland  afterward in the time of edward iv a doubt was conceived whether the statute made in england in  th of rich ii chap   concerning rape ought to be of force in ireland without a confirmation thereof by parliament for the clearing of which ambiguity and doubt in  th edward iv chap   in ireland it was enacted by authority of parliament that the said statute of  th of richard ii be adjudged and proved in force and strength and that the statute may be of force in this land of ireland from the  th day of march then last past and from thenceforth the said act and all other statutes and acts made by the authority of the said parliament within the realm of england be ratified and confirmed and adjudged by the authority of parliament in their force and strength from the said  th day of march  so as until the said statute of  th edw iv  the said statute of  th rich ii was not wholly of force in ireland and that may appear by the words of the said statute of the  th of edward iv  for by the words thereof the said statute of  th rich ii was to be of force from the  th of march then last past whereas the said statute of  th rich ii had been but a declaration or explanation of the stature of westminster   chap    it would have been of force at all times since the making of the statute of westminster  d which was in   th edw i  but afterward  0th hen vii c    it was enacted in a parliament in ireland this is one of the acts commonly called poinings acts that all statutes then lately made within the said realm of england concerning or belonging to the common or public weal of the same from thenceforth should be deemed good and effectual in the law and over that accepted used and executed within the land of ireland at all times requisite according to the tenor and effect of the same and over that by the authority aforesaid that they and every of them be authorized proved and confirmed in the said land of ireland  by all which statutes made from time to time in ireland it plainly appears that all statutes made in england before  0th hen vii concerning or belonging to the public and commonwealth of england are made to be of force and to become laws in ireland  in   st hen viii chap   an act was made in england that makes it felony in a servant that runs away with the goods of his master or mistress and this act was not received in ireland until the same was enacted by a parliament holden in ireland in   d hen viii sess   chap    in   st hen viii chap     there was a law made in england that all lords might distrain upon the lands of them holden for their rents and services and to make their avowries not naming the tenant but upon the lands but this law was not received in ireland until it was enacted there in   d hen viii sess   chap    an act was made in england in anno    hen viii chap   that joint tenants and tenants in common should be compelled to make partition which act was not received in ireland until it was enacted there in   d hen viii sess   chap  0  in   th hen viii chap  0 the statute of uses was made in england for transferring of uses into possession which statute was never received nor of force in ireland till the same was enacted in ireland  0th car   chap    so likewise   d hen viii chap   a statute was enacted in england whereby it is directed how lands and tenements may be disposed by will and concerning wardship and primer seizins which statute was never received nor of force in ireland until it was enacted by parliament in ireland in  0th car i chap    in anno  st eliz chap   there was an act made in england for the uniformity of the common prayer and administration of the sacraments which act was not received in ireland until the same was confirmed and established by parliament in anno  d eliz c    in anno  th eliz c   there was an act of parliament made in england for the punishment of wilful perjury which act was not of force in ireland until the same was enacted by a parliament in ireland in   th eliz chap    another act was made in england in anno  d eliz chap    for the punishment of witchcraft and sorcery and another act in the same year chap    for the punishment of forgery which acts were not of force in ireland until the same were enacted by parliament there in   th eliz chap      in   th hen viii chap    there was an act made in england for the punishment of piracy which act was not of force in ireland until the same was enacted in ireland in   th of james chap    in   th of eliz chap   an act was made in england against fraudulent conveyances which act was not of force nor received in ireland until the same was enacted in ireland  0th car i chap    besides many other acts made in the several reigns of henry viii  edward vi  queen elizabeth  king james  and the kings majesty who now is  in   th hen viii chap    etc an act was made in england concerning appeals made to rome which act does by express words extend to all his majestys dominions yet the same was not received nor of force in ireland until it was enacted by act of parliament there in   th hen viii chap    also the statute of   th hen viii chap   made in england concerning the first fruits of the clergy extended by express words to any of the kings dominions yet the same was not received or of force in ireland until it was enacted there by parliament in   th hen viii chap    likewise the act of faculties made in england   th hen viii chap    extended by express words to all the kings dominions yet the same was not received or of force in ireland until it was enacted by parliament in ireland   th henry viii chap       some general and some particular made at different periods of time from the   th of edward ii to the reign of king charles i the time when he wrote and of these examples not less in number than eighteen which surely are sufficient to prove the uniform sense of the irish parliament upon this point in every age since they received the english law  of the general examples which he has cited that in the  0th of hen vii one of poinings acts whereby all the english statutes then in force were adopted by the irish is the most remarkable and it is necessary to take particular notice of this act because the effect of it is frequently misunderstood for some have supposed that hereby all the statutes made in the parliament of england concerning the public should be observed in ireland without observing any farther distinction in this indiscriminate manner monsieur rapin has expressed himself and has thereby given a wrong idea of the irish legislature to such of his readers as do not care for the trouble of secking better information for in speaking of the two statutes commonly called poinings acts after having mentioned that act relating to the kings permission for assembling the parliament he adds un autre portoit que tous les acts faits dans le parliament dangleterre concernant le public seroient observez on irlande ces deux statuts font encore en force aujourdui tome   p        as if they thought the statute capable of including not only all the english acts then made but likewise all such as should be ordained in future and if this had really been the case it would have been in vain to have contended for the liberties of ireland but the act itself is not capable of such a construction notwithstanding that some have thought it doubtfully worded the tenor of it is recited by lord coke in his  th instit p     as follows that all statutes late made within the realm of england concerning or belonging to the common or public weal of the same from henceforth be deemed good and effectual in the law and over that be accepted used and executed within this land of ireland in all points etc and though the word late was afterward deemed a doubtful expression with respect to the extent of its effect yet it sufficiently restrains the act to the introduction of such english statutes only as were of prior date which effect is confirmed also by a resolution of the judges in the  0th of james cited by lord coke in the same page and hill  0 jacobi regis it was resolved by the two chief justices and chief baron that this word late in the beginning of this act had the sense of before so that this act extended to magna carta and to all acts of parliament made in england before this act of  0 h   but it is to be observed that such acts of parliament as have been made in england since  0 h   wherein ireland is not particularly named or generally included extend not thereunto for that albeit it be governed by the same law yet is it a distinct realm or kingdom and as has been said has parliaments there   inst p      and he has likewise stated the true effect of that act in his is it institute     b viz  by an act of parliament called poinings law holden in ireland says he in the  0th year of henry the  th it is enacted that all statutes made in this realm of england before that time should be of force and be put in use within the realm of ireland etc  this act of poinings therefore sufficiently proves what sir richard bolton intended by citing it viz that the irish did not esteem the english laws binding in that kingdom until allowed by the authority of their own parliament otherwise the act itself had been nugatory as also the other irish acts which he has cited for the same purpose in some of which it seems the parliament itself expressly asserted the doctrine for which he contends as in that of the   th of edw ii wherein it was enacted that the statutes made in england should not be of force in the kingdom of ireland unless they were allowed and published in that kingdom by parliament see sir richard boltons declarations etc in harriss hibernica p    sir richard bolton also informs us that a like statute was made again in the   th of henry vi and therefore notwithstanding that sergeant mayart has taken great pains and filled many pages with citations of precedents from old records of law cases writs etc in order to prove that english acts of parliament have been referred to and allowed in judicial proceedings before the same were confirmed in ireland yet all his labor has been bestowed in vain for besides that he ought first to have proved the acts in question to have been made by the english parliament alone without any such representation of the irish parliament jointly therewith as i have already shown to have been frequently practiced in those early days let it be also remarked that though we should allow that the irish courts of justice might perhaps in some particular cases of difference between individuals but of indifference to the general liberties of ireland have followed the directions of some mere english acts of parliament as esteeming them wholesome regulations of justice proper to be adopted for the determination of the cases before them yet the confirmation of such acts afterward at different periods clearly proves the irregularity of such premature proceedings in the courts and that the highest court of that kingdom the court of parliament did not esteem the english acts of sufficient legal authority till confirmed by themselves for otherwise the confirmation would have been unnecessary since the acts if sergeant mayarts examples are admitted were already received into use and therefore all such courtprecedents as are cited by the learned sergeant are clearly precedents of irregularities and not of law so that they are not entitled to any consideration at all especially as the irish legislature itself which has certainly a better right to determine what shall be esteemed law in ireland than any of the inferior courts has positively declared by the express acts of the   th of edward ii and the   th of henry vi before cited that english statutes shall not be of force in ireland unless allowed by the irish parliament and agreeable to this is the declaration of the irish house of commons in      article the first that the subjects of this his majestys kingdom of ireland are a free people and to be governed only according to the common law of england and statutes made and established by parliament in this kingdom of ireland and according to the lawful customs used in the same p      now though the conviction by these weighty authorities will probably destroy the credit of sergeant mayart as a writer in the opinion of every honest irishman yet the irish are more obliged to this author than he himself perhaps intended they should be for he clearly proves that a charter of liberties for the only mistake of lord coke is that he conceived says he that magna charta was not of force in ireland till the  0th of hen   which is only a mistake of a matter of fact for in truth we find continues the sergeant that statute was given to them of ireland in the first year of hen   and all the chapters thereof except three or four of the last chapters are entered in the red book of the exchequer of ireland where in the beginning after the kings style recited he says imprimis concessimus deo et hac praesenti charta nostra confirmamus pro nobis and haeredibus nostris in perpetuum quod hibernica ecclesia libera sit etc  first we have granted to god and by this our charter confirm for us and our heirs for ever that the church of ireland be frec  sir john davis cites a record in the tower  st of hen   memb    of the like charter of liberties granted by hen   to his subjects in ireland as himself and his father had granted to the subjects of england but yet this mistake is only for that coke was not informed of that matter of fact harriss hibernica pp            agreeing in all the chapters with our magna charta was separately granted to the kings subjects of ireland without distinction in the first year of king henry iii so that all the subjects of ireland the conquered irish not excepted from that very early period and even sooner for the english settlers carried their rights with them and the native irish gladly accepted the english common law as soon as it was tendered to them by the english conquerors of which i have produced ample testimony in a note on page  0  so that their just title to english liberty and all the legal immunities of the conquerors was clearly established and confirmed by this irish magna charta  they were very soon afterward indeed wickedly excluded from these equitable privileges by the inconsiderate english settlers many of whom for the sake of tyrannizing over their poor neighbors even degenerated as sir john davies informs us in p    into the lawless irish manners themselves adopting the old irish oppressions of tanistry cosherings cuttings sessings coigne and livery etc under which most wicked these most wicked oppressions originally spang from the undue power and unlimited sway of the ancient irish chieftaine or lords over their poor brethren but i must refer my readers for a particular description of them to sir john davies who has emply set forth the grosa injustice and pernicious effects of such unlimited power in men nevertheless i am tempted to cite by way of sample what he has menioned in on place concerning the wickedness of coigne and livery in particular for in showing the ill effects of english degeneracy he remarks in p    by this says he it appears why the extortion of coigne and livery is called in the old statutes of ireland a damnable custom and the imposing and taking thereof made high treason and it is said in an ancient discourse says he of the decay of ireland that though it were first invented in hell yet if it had been used and practiced there as it has been in ireland it had long since destroyed the very kingdom of beelzebub the same bad effects are produced in some degree by every kind of vassalage so that the bad policy of establishing seigneuries in canada or eltewhere is but too apparent   pretenses they devoured the poor natives as well as the poorer sort of english settlers and thereby occasioned almost continual wars for several ages which in the end turned out to their own great peril and disadvantage according to the neverfailing maxim or rather warning of the apostle paul if ye bite and devour one another take heed that ye be not consumed one of another gal v    but though the irish were by this wretched policy of the english long deprived of the benefit of the english common law yet this by no means deprived them of their just right or claim to it which must necessarily be acknowledged to have been due from the time that the english first settled in that country    were as much entitled to english liberty and all the immunities and benefits of the english common law as the inhabitants of england themselves and yet lord coke himself it seems  d inst p    was not aware of this circumstance but conceived says sergeant mayart p     that magna charta was not of force in ireland till the  0th of hen   which is only a mistake says he of a matter of fact for in truth we find says he that statute was given to them of ireland in the first year of hen   etc but though this was only a mistake of a matter of fact yet it was such a mistake as might probably in great measure have occasioned the erroneous opinions ever after of that great and worthy man concerning the constitution of ireland  but sergeant mayart has not profited so much as might have been expected by this knowledge that the subjects of ireland were honored with a distinct charter for after pointing out in page     the several chapters of the charter wherein as he supposes that law differs from the ancient common law he adds them triumphantly to his collection of precedents for binding ireland by statutes made in england as if a charter of liberties freely given and gladly accepted could afford any evidence against liberty for this undistinguishing man did not consider that the king by this charter of liberties binds and restrains himself rather than his people in all the most dangerous points of prerogative wherein the rulers of other countries are left too much unlimited and therefore that the subjects of ireland might accept the same which they most willingly did without the least derogation from their just and natural rights  and as this charter was granted to the kings subjects in ireland without distinction it affords the most ample proof that even the conquered irish were entitled to all the immunities protection and benefits which the english conquerors themselves enjoyed by it for even sergeant mayart himself proves in p    that the english laws were given at first  tam anglis quam hibernicis as well to english as irish sergeant mayart also informs us that the whole realm of ireland was anciently reduced into counties and that the english laws had passage throughout the same as appears says he by several piperolls of the time of hen   in the exchequer of ireland where there are accounts says he made for fines paid by the mere irish for disseisins and many other kinds of trespasses committed by them in those places which the author calls irish territories though some of the irish with their posterity after them being always averse to the english laws could not digest them but hid themselves in the bogs mountains etc but this aversion of some of the irish to the english laws is easily accounted for since it appears very clearly from sir john daviess book that the irishry had much more experience and woeful knowledge of english oppression than of the english laws for when any of them wore driven from their lands and possessions through the avarice and by the unlawful power of the great english lords who found their interest in treating them as enemies it was very natural for them to attempt to disseize and recover their former rights and possessions and again when they found no protection from the english laws nor other exertion thereof than that of sining and punishing them for such disseizins etc which were mere reentries it was equally natural for them to imbibe prejudices against the english laws and to fly to their bogs etc thus the english oppressions were apparently the cause why some of the irish were averse to the english laws which i have expressed more at large in a note on p  0     the irish nation are also obliged to sergeant mayart for some other proofs in their favor which he intended against them for amongst his precedents of giving law he informs us in p     that in the reign of king henry ii the common law and lawful customs of england were received planted and established in this his majestys kingdom of ireland a point which every irish patriot is zealous to maintain and he has favored us in page   0 with another notable example of binding the irish by english laws this it seems was in the reign of king john of whom says he triumphantly in that respect it may be well said that statuit et praecepit leges he appointed and established the laws as also because he put them in writing and left them in his court of exchequer for their better directions but he happily informs us at the same time which spoils his own application of the precedent that all this was done at the instance says he of the irish as the record says or of the english who accounted themselves irish etc and therefore as these english laws and customs are clearly acknowledged by himself to have been introduced at the instance of the irish it must manifestly appear that this ancient example excludes the doctrine which he meant to support by it in opposition to sir richard bolton and therefore if all these points are duly considered i think we may very fairly retort his own words which he exultingly applied to sir richard bolton upon himself viz whereupon it must needs also follow that the authors discourse falls all in pieces and is nothing to the purpose that he would have it  sergeant mayart has also taken a great deal of needless pains to prove ireland to be annexed to the crown of england and that the king and parliament of england have power over ireland and he cites several acts of parliament and other authorities in pages    and    of his answer in the hibernica which clearly prove indeed the former part of the assertion that ireland is annexed to the crown of england a point which the irish themselves are so far from denying that they are rather desirous to maintain it case of ireland p    it has ever been acknowledged that the kingdom of ireland is inseparably annexed to the imperial crown of england the obligation that our legislature lies under by poinings act  0 hen vii c   makes this tie between the two kingdoms indissoluble and we must ever own it our happiness to be thus annexed to england and that the kings and queens of england are by undoubted right ipso facto kings and queens of ireland and from hence we may reasonably conclude that if any acts of parliament made in england should be of force in ireland before they are received there in parliament they should be more especially such acts as relate to the succession and settlement of the crown and recognition of the kings title thereto and the power and jurisdiction of the king and yet we find in the irish statutes    hen viii c   an act for the succession of the king and queen anne and another chap   declaring the king to be supreme head of the church of ireland both which acts had formerly passed in the parliament of england so likewise we find amongst the irish statutes acts of recognition of the kings title to ireland in the reigns of henry viii queen elizabeth king james king charles ii king william and queen mary by which it appears that ireland though annexed to the crown of england has always been looked upon to be a kingdom complete within itself and to have all jurisdiction to an absolute kingdom belonging and subordinate to no legislative authority on earth though it is to be noted these english acts relating to the succession and recognition of the kings title do particularly name ireland  see also page    where the same author speaks of irelands being annexed to and as it were united with the imperial crown of england by several acts of parliament both in england and ireland since king johns time but how far this operates i shall enquire more fully hereafter i shall only at present observe that i conceive little more is effected by these statutes than that ireland shall not be aliened or separated from the king of england who cannot hereby dispose of it otherwise than in legal succession along with england and that whoever is king of england is ipso fucto king of ireland and the subjects of ireland are obliged to obey him as their liege lord    but none of his authorities afford the least shadow of evidence for the latter part of his assertion viz the power of the english parliament over ireland and because sir richard bolton had allowed that such laws made in england as are declaratory of the common law do bind ireland without any confirmation there see hibernica p    etc sergeant mayart hopes to avail himself of the circumstance and observes thereupon it must necessarily follow says he p    that the parliament of england has still an influence upon ireland etc and a little farther he adds but if it should happen says he that the parliament of england should make an exposition of a law in force in ireland and the parliament there should make another and that it may be different or contrary to that of england certainly says he ireland must be bound by the authors own rule meaning sir richard bolton by the declaratory statute of the parliament of england  but sir richard boltons rule includes no such doctrine for there is nothing unreasonable in supposing that the irish subjects without prejudice to their natural rights and the privileges of their own parliament might receive the declaratory statute of the parliament of england as the best exposition of the common law which they before acknowledged and freely accepted by their own express assent and desire sir edward coke himself bears ample testimony to this  our student must know says he that king john in the   th year of his reign went into ireland and there by the advice of grave and learned men in the laws whom he carried with him by parliament de communi omnium de hybernia consensu ordained and established that ireland should be governed by the laws of england which of many of the irishmen for the common consent before mentioned must mean that of the english settlers according to their own desire was joyfully accepted and obeyed and of many the same was soon after absolutely refused preferring their brehen law before the just and honorable laws of england  st inst p      but this subsequent refusal and preference given to the brehen law must not be charged to the native irish in general for sir john davis in his discovery of the true causes why ireland was never entirely subdued etc demonstrates that the english settlers were principally to be blamed for this he shows p     that the scopes of land which were granted to the first adventurers were too large and the liberties and royalties which they obtained therein were too great for subjects  and in p     that these grants of whole provinces and petty kingdoms those few english lords pretended to be proprietors of all the land so that there was no possibility left of settling the natives in their possessions and by consequence the conquest became impossible without the utter extirpation of all the irish which these english lords were not able to do nor perhaps willing if they had been able this he afterward explains showing that false notions of private interest among the english lords prevented both the conquest and the introduction of the english law they hoped to become lords of those lands which were possessed by the irish whereunto they pretended title by their large grants etc p     and that therefore they persuaded the king of england p     that it was unfit to communicate the laws of england unto them that it was the best policy to hold them as aliens and enemies and to prosecute them with a continual war hereby they obtained says he another royal prerogative and power which was to make war and peace at their pleasure in every part of the kingdom which gave them an absolute command over the bodies lands and goods even of the english subjectes here meaning in ireland where he wrote and he adds in the same page and besides says he the irish inhabiting the lauds fully conquered and reduced being in condition of slaves and villains did render a greater profit and revennew than if they had been made the kings free subjects they also feared as he declares in the preceding page that if the irish were received into the kings protection and made liegemen and freesubjectes the state of england would establish them or rather reestablish them in their possessions by graunts from the crown etc and the troth is says he in p     that those great english lords did to the uttermost of their power cross and withstand the enfranchisement of the irish for the causes before expressed  and he rightly lays the fault upon the pride covetousness and illcounsell of the english planted here which in all former ages says he have bin the chief impediments of the final conquest of ireland  on the other hand he clearly exculpates the native irish from the charge of wilfully refusing to be subject to the laws of england but perhaps says he in p     the irishry in former times did wilfully refuse to be subject to the laws of england and would not be partakers of the benefit thereof though the crown of england did desire it and therefore they were reputed aliens outlawes and enemies assuredly the contrary does appear as well by the charters of denization purchased by the irish in all ages as by a petition preferred by them to the king anno   ed iii desiring that an act might pass in ireland whereby all the irishrie might be enabled to use and enjoy the laws of england without purchasing of particular denizations  and in p     he adds  i am well assured that the irishrie did desire to be admitted to the benefit of the law not only in this petition exhibited to king edw iii but by all their submissions made to king richard ii and to the lord thomas of lancaster before the wars of the two houses and afterward to the lord leonard gray and sir anthony st ledger when k henry viii began to reform this kingdom in particular the birnes of of the mountains in the   th of hen viii desire that their country might be made shire ground and called the county of wicklow and in the   d of hen viii o donnel does covenant with sir william skeffington quod si dominus rex velit reformare hiberniam whereof it should seem he made some doubt that he and his people would gladly be governed by the laws of england  these quotations sufficiently demonstrate the willingness of the native irish to adopt the english laws and constitution and that the denial of such a reasonable desire was the just cause of their almost continual rebellions and bloody wars against the english settlers however in the reign of king james i the irishry were restored to their just rights and the benefit and protection of the law of england communicated to all as well irish as english without distinction or respect of persons etc p     and sir john davies himself was one of the judges employed in that most grateful business to a benevolent man i mean the visitations of justice whereby the just and honorable law of england was imparted and communicated to all the irishry p     and he informs us in the same page that the common people were taught by the justices of assise that they were free subjects to the kings of england and not slaves and vassals to their pretended lords that the cuttings cosheries sessings and other extortions of their lords were unlawful and that they should not any more submit themselves thereunto since they were now under the protection of so just and mighty a prince as both would and could protect them from al wrongs and oppressions they gave says he a willing ear unto these lessons and thereupon the greatness and power of those irish lords over the people suddenly fell and vanished when their oppressions and extortions were taken away which did maintain their greatness etc in p     he informs us that sir edmund pelham and himself were the first justices of assise that ever sat in those countries speaking particularly of tyrone and tirconnell and in that circuit says he we visited all the shires of that province besides which visitation though it were somewhat distasteful to the irish lords was sweet and most welcome to the common people who albeit they were rude and barbarous yet did they quickly apprehend the difference between the tyranny and oppression under which they lived before and the just government and protection which we promised unto them for the time to come  thus the common people of the irishry were at length restored to that equality in the eye of the law to which they were justly entitled though shamefully deprived of it from the earliest time that the english began to be known in that kingdom even from the first establishment of the english conquerors for sir john davies shows from matthew pariss history that king henry ii before his return out of ireland held a counsel or parliament at lissemore where the laws of england were by all willingly received ubi leges angliae ab omnibus sunt gratanter receptae et juratoria cautione praestita confirmatae p  00 and he informs us in the next page that king henry the third did grant and transmit the like charter of liberties to his subjects of ireland as himself and his father had granted to the subjects of england as appears says he by another record in the tower   hen iii patm    and he cites also a writ of the   th year of the same king commanding the lord justice of ireland to cause the charter of king john to be read and confirmed by parliament and again that the same king by letters patent under the greatseal of england did confirm the establishment of the english laws made by king john and that all writs of the common law should have course there as in england  quod omnia brevia de communi jure quae currunt in anglia similiter current in hibernia etc thus it appears that all irish subjects without distinction are entitled according to the clearest and most unquestionable testimony to all the rights immunities and advantages of magna charta and the english common law     but let us suppose that in some such declaratory act they had reason to think the english exposition improper and should therefore choose to confirm their own sense of it by the authority of their own parliament surely the latter would be binding in ireland and not the english statute as sergeant mayart supposes for there is no example of an irish act of parliament being set aside by the authority of the english parliament which sergeant mayart allows neither is it to be imagined says he in p     that the kings and parliaments in england will ever avoid any laws made in ireland without a good and just cause since they have not done any such things for about four hundred years which is time enough to have experience of their honor and justice etc  and he afterward uses this plea concerning the honor and justice of the english parliament as an inducement for the irish to be bound by it and seeing says he in p     that for above  00 years they have never done hurt to ireland etc therefore we may well trust them hereafter etc and again in p     but we all know says he with what great consultation deliberation and knowledge of things and the circumstances of them the kings and parliaments of england have still ordered their affairs etc and we may says he as all our ancestors have done trust to their wisdom justice and judgment as a sufficient hedge and security for us but surely no people who have the use of reason or commonsense would be induced by such an argument to submit themselves implicitly to a parliament in which they have no share of power or representation though indeed it may be alleged in behalf of this writer and his argument that parliaments before his time were in general less corrupt than they have been since if we except the parliaments of richard ii and queen mary but in these latter times we all know with what great consultation deliberation and knowledge of things etc etc etc  if it had been possible for the irish subjects to have given up to sergeant mayart this contested point concerning the necessity of a due representation in the legislature without giving up at the same time all due limitation of government and consequently all pretensions to their natural freedom this advice of his might have been esteemed excusable  but it is representation alone which forms the basis the superiority and the essential difference of the english constitution of state from all others for in countries where this is wanting or where it is become totally corrupted it makes but little difference to the bulk of the people whether the executive part of government be in the hands of one of a few or of many viz of an emperor of a triumvirate or of a senate of nobles or proud patricians as among the romans at different periods of time the administration of each of these orders of power respectively is almost equally arbitrary uncertain and dangerous to the community to which the histories of all monarchical as well as aristocratical governments i mean those that are merely or too nearly such bear sufficient testimony so that the representation of the people is the grand point of distinction the fundamental principle whereby the equity and safety of the english government is to be measured when we compare it with such governments as either that of france or that of poland  i have already given some specimens of french government and french law in my preface it being necessary that british subjects should be well aware of the nature and tendency of that law which has so lately received the solemn sanction even of our own legislature the late act for establishing the laws of france in the most extensive province of the british empire must indeed seem very strange and unnatural to the genius of englishmen in general especially when we consider that even the french inhabitants of that province themselves are zealous for the privileges of english subjects which plainly appears by some expressions in their late address to the governor on that occasion and we may therefore rest assured that they are not in general so ignorant and void of commonsense as really to prefer the laws of france to the equitable constitution of england howsoever they may have been misrepresented we must nevertheless except a few french seigneurs who having already been allowed greater exclusive privileges than are consistent with the safety and freedom of their poor neighhours and fellow subjects would rather wish to promote the french laws and customs which permit such an unjust vassalage than the equitable laws of england and we may likewise except the priests and some other absolute bigots to the romish religion who being entangled in the slavery of antichristian principles and the doctrines of devils are ready to submit to any temporal conditions whatsoever for the sake of that spiritual or rather satanical bribe which was wickedly thrown out to them on this occasion i mean the setting up their adultecated religion as the established church of that province with a legal right to collect tithes etc by national authority this was the more unjust and inexcusable because the romanists had no reason to complain of that toleration which they so freely enjoyed before in a note on p     where i have occasion to mention the defects of some supposed statutes i have added some examples which naturally occurred thereupon concerning the abominable tyranny and wickedness of the adulterous church of rome and these i trust will sufficiently justify the severity of my expressions against that antichristian church see also my remarks on several very important prophecies part   p    and part   p      as being proper to be renewed and enforced in a certain province of the british empire and the hon mr justice barrington in his observations on the ancient statutes has also in just abhorrence of the french law cited several fundamental maxims si veut le roy si veut le loi the kings will is law some of the pernicious effects of this detestable maxim i have already shown in my preface   of it upon which the kings prerogative is founded which as he justly remarks may not only be matter of some curiosity to an englishman but by comparison may make him thankful for the noble constitution to which he is happily born a cappadocian says hemay indeed refuse from custom and long usage to exchange a despotic for a more free government but i can never be persuaded says this benevolent gentleman but that there is a necessary connection between slavery and misery and between freedom and happiness seneca says he nobly inforces the communication of liberty to the subject from the safety it procures to the king this was the uniform doctrine of all the ancient constitutional lawyers of england and especially of the great chancellor fortescue whose opinion i have expressly quoted and added some farther observations upon the same point in a note on page   of this declaration part     errat si quis existimat tutum esse ibi regem ubi nihil a rege tutum est securitas securitate mutua paciscenda est p     now this necessary mutual security can only be insured by a free representation of the people in the legislature and therefore the learned author of this excellent remark will readily allow i trust when he comes to consider these arguments that he himself was not sufficiently upon his guard in another part of his useful work p     where he had occasion to mention the irish laws having there unfortunately adopted the mistaken doctrine of lord coke about binding the subjects of ireland by english statutes if ireland is mentioned but it is certainly very natural for a gentleman regularly bred to the profession of the law to be less circumspect when he follows so great an authority as sir edward coke who is generally and for the most part justly esteemed the oracle of the english law  mr barrington is commenting on the ordinance of    edw i pro statu hiberniae and after informing us that it is not found in the collection of irish statutes which begin only with the ordiance of kilkenny in the  d of edw ii he adds there can be no doubt says he however that this law extends to ireland if not repealed by some irish act of parliament this sentence contains an implied acknowledgement that a law made in england relating to the government of ireland may be repealed by an irish act of parliament and if this be allowed which it certainly ought to be there can be no room to suppose the irish subjects bound by an english act if ireland is mentioned for wherein is the force or binding of the english act if the irish are allowed a right to repeal it such binding amounts to nothing we may as well say that an english act binds the emperor of morocco and his subjects or the wild anabs when especially named since it can bind no longer than while they shall be willing to submit to it but that the irish subjects really have a right to repeal an english act relating to their own internal government if we may with propriety apply the word repeal to acts that were originally defective and void for want of the irish assent is clearly proved by mr mollyneux in his case of ireland page      as by poinings law in the time of henry the seventh all precedent here the hon mr barrington confirms what is before laid down in pages    and    concerning the effect of poinings law   english statutes are made to bind in ireland and he remarks thereupon in a note that subsequent statutes only bind if ireland is mentioned as for wales continues he all statutes are now made to extend to it whether mentioned or not by a clause inserted in the middle of  0 geo ii cap xlii etc but the true reason why this doctrine may be applied to wales with propriety and justice and yet not to ireland without injustice is because the welchmen give their assent to the english laws by their representatives in the english parliament whereas the assent of the irish which is equally essential cannot be known in a legal manner but by the voice of their own parliamentary representatives so that the very reason why all english statutes extend to wales whether named or not forbids the application of the like doctrine to ireland and as the opinion of the judges in the   th of hen vi and in the  d of rich iii before cited in favor of ireland was founded on this very reason  quia non hic habent milites parliamenti i hope the same will be thought sufficient to justify my dissent as well from mr barrington as from the great author whom he seems to have followed in this matter i mean lord coke himself whose assertion i propose to examine still more closely before i conclude this  d part of my declaration  the hon mr justice barrington also observes in p     that there have been great and learned controversies between molyneux and others with regard to an english act of parliament binding in ireland and molyneux says he who contends it should not has argued strongly from an english statutes not being supposed to extend to ireland before poynings act in the reign of henry the seventh etc  and a very strong argument it is which i hope has already been shown but the hon mr barrington proceeds to cite from the parliamentrolls of the   st of edw i a memorandum of a very unwarrantable exertion of royalprerogative by that monarch viz his sending a copy of the ordinance the hon mr barrington in p    very justly remarks concerning the statute of merton in the  0th year of hen iii that the said statute as well as many others of this century seems to be only an ordinance the difference says he between an ordinance and statute according to sir edward coke consisting in this that the ordinance wants the consent of one component part of the legislature which is in all instances that of the commons now this seems to be exactly the case of the act in question of the   st of edw i de malefactoribus in parcis for though the act itself declares that it was ordained by the king at his parliament our lord the king at his parliament after easter the   st year of his reign at the instance of the nobles of his realm has granted and commanded to be from henceforth firmly observed etc   and at the instance of the nobles of his realm yet the assent of the commons is not expressed which was very well known even at that time to be necessary as the assent expressed in the acts of the preceding year sufficiently demonstrates viz our lord the king in his full parliament and by his common council has ordained etc statute de defensione juris  0 e   again in the statute of vouchers by his common council has ordained etc again in the statute of waste our lord the king in his full parliament holden etc by a general council has ordained so that a proper form of declaring the assent of the commons even at that time was very well established notwithstanding that many statutes are deficient therein and consequently are exceptionable in point of authority as for instance the statute de escheatoribus of the   th year of this reign seems to be thus defective for though it is dated very speciously like the act in question de malefactoribus in parcis at the parliament of our lord the king at lincoln etc yet it seems only to have been agreed to by the privy council or the kings council  by his council it was agreed and also commanded by the king himself  per consilium regis concordatum est coram domino rege ipso rege consentiente et illud extunc fieri et observari precipiente etc  so that it was apparently enacted and ordained only by the king and his council without the least mention of the consent of the parliament or of the common council of the kingdom and seems therefore to have been a mere order in council though artfully dated at the parliament in order to give it the appearance of law sir edward coke in his  th inst p    gives several instances of supposed statutes that had been repealed or disaffirmed wanting the assent of the commons which were nevertheless published and enforced as real statutes viz   r ii c   stat   touching enquiries of heresies and   h iv c    against pretended heretics giving power to the bishop or ordinary to convent before him or imprison any person suspected of heresys and ordaining contrary to the laws of god that an obstinate heretic or any person whom an ignorant popish enthusiast was pleased to call so shall be burned before the people both which as sir edward coke remarks were disavowed by the commons and yet the pretended acts printed   inst p    and   inst p  0 and    also   hen v cap   which sir edward coke by mistake calls cap   against preachers was disavowed the next parliament by the commons for that they never assented and yet the supposed act was printed   inst p    by such notorious treachery and dishonesty did the zealots of the romish church introduce the papal tyranny into england  sir edward coke in his  d inst pages  0 and    clearly proves from the parliamentrolls and other records the fraudulent introduction of the abovementioned act in the  th of rich ii by a popish prelate sir edward coke calls him john braibrook   inst p    but according to bishop godwin his name was robert braybrook  de praesulibus angliae com p     but both of them testify that he was bishop of london as well as lord chancellor among the blessed effects of his pious fraud the following are repoted by sir edward coke  d inst p  0  by color of this supposed act   rich ii certain persons that held that images were not to be worshipped etc were holden in strong prison until they to redeem their vexation miserably yielded before these masters of divinity to take an oath and did swear to worship images which was against the moral and eternal law of almighty god this and many other such instances of hardened apostasy in popish professors sufficiently justify our applying to the papal tyranny in general that prophecy of the apostle paul concerning the man of sin that was to be revealed the son of perdition who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called god or that is worshipped so that he as god sits in the temple of god showing himself that he is god   thessalonians ii   to   and whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming verse    o that all those persons whose hearts are not yet entirely seared with the hot iron of popish enthusiasm may duly consider these glaring instances of popish craft in opposition to the laws of god and consequently the apparent danger of adhering to that church which has so notoriously perverted the doctrines of the gospel lest they should be found in communion with the enemjes of christ at his glorious coming    who at that time was lordchancellor and the same learned author thereupon directs us to mark well the manner of the penning the act for seeing says he the commons did not assent thereunto the words of the act be it is ordained and assented in this present parliament that etc and so it was being but by the king and the lords  the same rule enables us to judge concerning the authenticity of many other ancient acts wherein the assent of the commons is not particularly mentioned and yet they are published the constitutions called statutum de bigamis for instance are declared to have been set forth in the parliament after michaelmas etc editae fuerunt apud westminster in parliamento post festum sancti michaelis etc mag char cum statutis quae antiqua vocantur etc p  0  b ed      but when we mark will the manner of the penning the act according to sir edward cokes rule it appears to be very deficient in parliamentary authority though he himself has taken great pains to prove its authenticity he remarks that these words in the  st chapter concordatum est per justiciarios et alios sapientes de concilio regni prove it to be by authority of parliament for concilium regni says he is the lords and commons legally called commune concilium regni  d inst p     but even according to this argument the word commune is apparently wanting to make up what he himself allows to be the legal expression for the lords and commons and if we duly consider the words which immediately follow it must appear that the sapientes de concilio regni etc here mentioned were only such particular sapientes as held judicial places  qui consuetudines et usum judiciorum hactenus habuerunt so that the expression cannot with propriety be supposed to include the whole representative body of the commons as well as the lords etc but merely the judges and such lords prelates and others as held judicial places and were of the kings council mentioned in the preamble viz in praesentia etc quorundam episcoporum angliae et aliorum de concilio regis which sir edward coke by what authority i cannot guess is pleased to call a committee of both houses though it can mean nothing more than a meeting of the kings privy council and the same may be said of that second meeting afterward mentioned coram domino rege et concilio suo wherein the said constitutions were again read auditae et publicatae and ordered to be engrossed and observed quod in scripturam redigerentur ad perpetuam memoriam et quod firmiter observentur which be pleased to remark is the principal enacting or enforcing clause of this act and therefore when we consider that the same was agreed to or ordained by the judges as well as others  tam justiciarii quam alii concordaverunt quod in scripturam etc we may be assured that the meeting was not the parliament in which the judges as such have not any vote or voice at all except that of advising but merely the kings privy council and therefore judge shard as cited by lord coke had surely reason on his side when he beholding the manner of the penning of this act compare this with lord cokes own rule to the same purpose abovementioned was of opinion that it was no act of parliament though sir edward coke was pleased to censure him saying that the contrary is holden by many express authorities both before and after him  d inst p     but what authorities can be equal to the internal evidence of the act itself according to his own rule mark well the manner of the penning p etc for though it may have been allowed the force of an act in judicial proceedings as well as in the writings of some respectable commentators yet this is nothing but the natural consequence of its having been published and printed without remarks among the other acts the undue authority acquired by such impositions was still more notorious in the credit that has been given even by the legislature itself to the three other false statutes beforementioned against what the papistscall heresy two of them are expressly recited and formally repealed by an act of parliament in the the  st of edward vi cap      as if they had really been statutes ordained by the authority of the whole legislature and all the three false statutes together are recited acknowledged and revived by another act of parliament in the   and   p and m cap   and are yet again expressly entitled statutes and as such are formally repealed by a third act of parliament in the  st of eliz c      but yet these several great authorities by no means invalidate the evidence which sir edward coke has produced to prove that the said three wicked ordinances were really no statutes   agreeable to the intention of those who unlawfully promoted it but lord shard declared from the bench in the assizes at winchester anno  0th e   that this never was a statute lib assisarum p     shard negativa nihil implicat et ceo que vous parles del statut de bigamis ceo ne fuit unquam ascun statut  another objection against this supposed statute is the apparent evil intention of the  th article de bigamis from whence it has acquired its title which was to acknowledge a foreign popish law as if it were already without interposition of parliament of legal force in england and needed only some small explanation with respect to the manner of putting it in execution an idea this which all free english parliaments even in popish times most zealously opposed but above all the iniquity of the foreign decree itself which is introduced by this  th article affords the most ample argument against the whole statute as it seems to have been drawn up principally for purpose of enforcing and smuggling in amongst other articles that diabolical popish decretal of pope gregory ix for discouraging lawful marriages of widows or widowers the marriages of the clergy had been absolutely forbid as the forbidding to marry is ranked by the apostle paul amongst the doctrines of devils   timothy iv   so the papal antichrist in very early times began to discourage the marriages of the clergy but pope gregory vii alias hildebrand a monster in iniquity to prove which dr cave has cited unexceptionable authorities hist liter p     more openly revealed the man of sin in the   th century and amongst other notorious manifestations of most impious tyranny made a decree in  0   that from that time forward it should no more be lawful for priests to marrye etc recons relics of rome p    b this was apparently a contrary doctrine to what st paul preached and consequently it subjects the roman see to the anathema of that apostle though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed gal i   and   the marriage of the clergy had never before been forbidden except among the worst of heretics but had been allowed by the whole church of christ from the time of the apostles for above  000 years down to this unhappy century and with respect to ireland in particular sir edward coke informs us that at a synod holden in ireland by st patrick their apostle it was unanimously agreed that irish priests should have wives   inst p       about  00 years before and those who were already married forcibly separated from their wives becons relics of rome p    b in open contradiction to the laws of god by a decree of pope gregory vii which was still further enforced by his successors and the clergy were compelled at length to submit to that unnatural tyranny by a variety of the most unjust and cruel laws and oppressions see for instance the several decrees of a council held at london by anselm archbishop of canterbury in   0  upon this subject to oblige the clergy to forsake their lawful wives who were mentioned by the council as concubines and were ordered to be delivered up to the bishops as adulteresses together with all the goods of those unfortunate husbands who persisted in their natural affection tenth and last article omnia vero mobilia lapsorum posthac presbyterorum diaconorum etc meaning the goods of those who continued to visit their wives tradentur episcopis et concubina cum rebus suis velut adultera howels synopsis canonum etc vol   p      that satanical malice could possibly devise in the several ecclesiastical synods of that and the following century  but the decree against bigamy was aimed at the laity as well as clergy since every layman that could read was before entitled to the benefit of clergy when convicted of some particular offenses which privilege was by this decree taken away from all persons called bigami or who had been twice married successively bigamie says sir william staunford in his plees del coron p     est un counterplee a clergy lambard calls it an ungodly and popish counterplea eiren p     s a dire que cestui qui demand le privilege de son clergy suist espouse a un feme a tiel lieu deynz tiel dioces et que le dit feme morust et ad espouse auter feme etc   the principal purpose of this new popish ordinance being to cast an odium and restraint upon lawful second marriages and confound them with the real felony of having two wives at one time thus the intention of the romish church was apparently diabolical under a false pretense of extraordinary purity to discourage lawful marriages and thereby ensnare mankind through their natural frailties into real pollutions and it is notorious that the popish tenet of forbidding to marry is one of the distinguishing scriptural marks of antichrist   for i cannot properly call it a statute de malefactoribus in parcis into ireland with an order to the chief justice of ireland to enforce it and he remarks thereupon  this note fully proves says he that it was supposed the king by his sole authority could then introduce any english law and will that authority says he be lessened by the concurrence of the two houses of parliament but this by no means invalidates the justice of mr molyneuxs argument while the injustice of which he complains is still continued viz the inequitable pretension to bind the subjects of ireland by laws made without their assent and this even without any exception or just distinction concerning external or internal government for the irish themselves do not deny the propriety of the pretension in the former case the exertion of royal prerogative abovementioned was certainly illegal and therefore must be esteemed a bad precedent for mr barrington himself who cites it does not pretend to justify it and i know that he will as readily allow that one bad precedent cannot justify another so that his adding still more precedents of the same kind adds no weight to his argument because the authority of precedents must always be weighed and governed by firstprinciples and constitutional law otherwise we should be liable to adopt the most dangerous doctrines since there is nothing so bad but that a precedent may be found for it  the second precedent of this nature which he has produced for the same purpose still helps to confirm my observation on the other side of the question for this precedent is nothing less than the order of king charles the first in the  d year of his reign to the treasurers and chancellors of the exchequer both of england and ireland by which they are directed to increase the duties upon irish exports which shows says he that it was then imagined the king could tax ireland by his prerogative without the intervention of parliament  now the precedent shows indeed as mr barrington justly remarks that it was then imagined etc that is it shows that this false doctrine was then imagined by the king and those wretched courtiers who either through ignorance or wickedness or both betrayed him with their unlawful counsels but it by no means shows that such an arbitrary proceeding was really law at that time any more than it is at present for the very same volume of rymers foedera  viz tome xviii that contains the abovementioned precedent contains also other precedents of the like authority which equally show that it was then imagined the king could tax even england itself by his prerogative without the intervention of parliament  see a declaration of his majestys clear intention in requiring the aid of his loving subjects in that way of loan the compulsive means used on this occasion to extort money from the people sufficiently demonstrate that the way of loan which was then intended by his highness amounted to an exaction of the most notorious nature many people were imprisoned and many others pressed into the land and sea service for refusing to contribute see rushworths collection vol   p     sir thomas wentworth afterward lord strafford was one of the sufferers on this occasion for he was imprisoned by the lords of the council for refusing the royal loan supplement to the new and general biographical dictionary p     his majesty demanded of the city of london the loan of an hundred thousand pounds rushworths collection vol   p     if such precedents were to be admitted or allowed any weight at all in this argument the very same reign would afford precedents sufficient to render the king of england as despotic as the emperor of morocco in the fourth year of this reign the kings commission was issued to the lordtreasurer and barons of the exchequer and to the customers of the ports to collect tonnage and poundage without authority of parliament  know ye that we by advice of our lords that is the lords of his council mentioned in the beginning of the commission declare our will that all those duties be levied and collected as they were in the time of our father and in such manner as we shall appoint and if any person refuse to pay then our will is that the lordtreasurer shall commis to prison such so refusing till they conform themselves and we give full power to all our officers from time to time to give assistance to the farmers of the same as fully as when they were collected by authority of parliament rushworth vol   p     here the neglect of the authority of parliament is openly avowed though the forgetful monarch was bound under a solemn oath at his coronation to maintain the laws of the land   which is now intended by his highness tome xviii p     nay it was then imagined it seems by those disloyal persons who falsely called themselves the kings friends that the king could not only tax his english subjects by his prerogative but that he could also seize imprison try and even hang them by martial law without judge or jury  the very same volume of rymers foedera tome xviii affords several authentic precedents for delegating such unlimited power by the kings commission viz one for the county of sussex p     another for the whole county of kent p     and a third for the town and county of southampton p  0  the commissioners were empowered not only to use martial law against soldiers or mariners but also against other dissolute persons joining with them or any of them whereby under the latter denomination a way was opened to render all other persons besides soldiers and mariners liable to the uncertain decisions and hasty rigor of martial law any man whatever might be unjustly charged as a dissolute person etc and the accusation alone whether true or false was sufficient to divest the person accused of all the privileges of an english subject at the very time when he stood most in need of them so that if the kings commissioners should happen to dislike any particular person within the county or limits of the jurisdiction expressed in their commission it was possible for them to promote such an accusation and thereby render themselves judges in their own cause since the kings commission contrary to his majestys most solemn engagement before god at his coronation deprived the accused subject of a legal trial and the due process of the law the only defense of the innocent by substituting an illegal process in lieu of it and the horror of this monstrous usurpation of power was much increased by the following circumstance that the commissioners were expressly authorized by their commissions to erect gallows or gibbetts and in such places as they shall think fit   and therefore as it would be partial to admit an arbitrary precedent as an evidence on one side of the question  ie against ireland without weighing at the same time the similar precedents in the same unfortunate reign which equally affect the other side of the question i mean the privileges of the english legislature we must necessarily exclude from the present enquiry the most distant idea that mr barringtons  d precedent for taxing ireland by prerogative can possibly afford the least evidence against the just rights of the subjects in ireland for if such precedents are admitted to prove any thing at all they prove too much for they equally show that it was then imagined the king could tax and oppress even england itself as well as ireland by his prerogative without the intervention of parliament and i am very sure that the worthy writer who unguardedly cited from rymer the abovementioned precedent against ireland would be as zealous to oppose any such doctrine as myself  his  d precedent is still more destitute if possible of legal evidence  what would have been the answer of the english legislature says he in the year    0 to the late claim of independency in the colonies will appear by the preamble to an ordinance of the  d oct of that year  whereas in virginia and the islands of st christophers nevis montserrat and diverse other islands and places in america which were planted at the cost and settled by the people and authority of this nation which are and ought to be subordinate to and dependent upon england and has ever since the planting thereof and ought to be subject to such laws orders and regulations as shall be made by the parliament of england p      but though this was indeed the opinion of what mr barrington calls the english legislature in the year    0 yet no just argument can be drawn from thence with respect to the present question  viz the pretension to bind ireland without representation or assent because it affords as good an argument as the others abovementioned for binding even england itself without any representation or assent at all since the said legislature as it is called was totally defective in every point that is essentially necessary to constitute an english legislature for besides the total suppression of the legal rights of the crown to a share in the legislature even the necessary assent of the whole body of the people was also excluded since it is evident that neither the lords nor the commons of england were represented in that packed junto of hypocrites which was then called the english legislature for after the violent seizure of    members of the house of commons in rushworths collection  th part vol   p      we read the names of the

of military power which was permitted to sit for no other purpose than that of lending a pretended parliamentary authority to the arbitrary measures and wicked resosolutions of an illegal council of war as if the mere name of a parliament without the thing itself a due representation of the people was sufficient to authorize and justify the most detestable despotism the whole proceedings of the council of war from the time the king was feized at holmby though he himself was deceived by their temporizing dissimulation clearly proves their fixed intention to proceed to extremities contrary to

such a share of limited power as they thought consistent with their own safety but alas the standing army was now become the ruling sovereign of the kingdom and was not less zealous to maintain an unlimited authority than the former ruling sovereign whom they had so lately fought against and imprisoned for the like unlawful pretensions so that the arbitrary proceedings and injustice of the king in the beginning of his reign were severely repaid in kind by proceedings equally arbitrary illegal and unjust as oppression is generally punished by oppression that even the injustice of mankind may

military post of general or imperator of the standing army for such is the original root both of the name and power of emperors that he ventured by dint of his military authority to turn the

of england scotland or even of ireland of their just right to a free and frequent representation in parliament now the english legislature of      for the title is not less due than it was in    0

military commander general cromwell whom they invested with the title and power of protector of the three kingdoms i have thus far pursued the history of those arbitrary times as well to show the danger of keeping a standing army i might have saved myself much trouble upon this point had i been aware when i wrote the foregoing pages that the danger of keeping standing armies had been so well enforced by mr quincy in his observations on the boston port bill that ingenious and sensible writer has very judiciously collected a number of unquestionable examples upon the subject which together with his own pertinent observations upon them demand the most serious attention not only of every loyal english subject at this time but of all friends to mankind in general   and of permitting a national militia to become such the example of military tyranny which i have already recited demonstrates the great danger of permitting any part of a national militia to be absent longer than is absolutely necessary from the particular county or district to which it properly belongs for as soon as militiamen begin to depend upon their pay or sold dictionnaire militaire p     instead of their industry and the regular daily employments which they followed at home they cease to be the constitutional defenders of their country and become mere soldiers soldats or mercenaries and therefore as it is now reported that great pains are at this time taken in the several american colonies to renew the ancient discipline of the militia in their respective provinces it is a matter of great consequence as well for their own internal happiness and liberty as for the preservation of peace and union with the mother country and a continuance of that due constitutional subjection to the crown of great britain which is the true interest of all parties as it connects every branch of the empire and insures mutual confidence and protection against foreign enemies that no persons whatever be allowed the rank of officers in any of their provincial regiments of militia unless they have a competent fortune either in land or money to enable them to live comfortably without military pay lest they should ever entertain a separate interest from that of the public and like the degenerate militia under cromwell enslave their country even a common militiaman is not properly qualified for that public trust for such it is unless from his situation in life or as the master of a family he has some permanent interest in the welfare of the community   as to demonstrate the insufficiency and illegality of the precedents which have been cited to justify the fatal pretension of england to govern ireland and the other colonies without the representation and assent of the respective inhabitants for we might as well enquire what would have been the answer of the english legislature in the year      when the whole legislature was comprised within the narrow compass of cromwells own doublet as  in the year    0 to which this learned writer has referred us since the authority of the nominal legislature in    0 was entirely illegal as well as that in      both of them having been set up and maintained by the same unconstitutional arbitrary power and both of them totally void of the indispensable representation of the people for though the wretched remains of the longparliament in    0 being about  0 representatives or members instead of     that had been elected ainsi ce parliament qui dans son commencement avoit ete compose du roi dune chamber denviron sixvingts seigneurs

inspiroit a tout le monde rapin tome ix p   at the beginning of that parliament were indeed chosen by a small part of the people of england yet the legal representation even of that small part was out of date and void from the length of time that the said representatives had continued without reelection which was about ten years whereas it is well known that the due effect or virtue of popular representation was formerly supposed to be incapable like some annual fruits of being so long preserved in useful purity without a seasonable renewal the sensible and patriotic author of the letters from a farmer in pennsylvania to the inhabitants of the british colonies      remarks in a note on page  0  that the last irish parliament continued thirtythree years that is says he during all the late reign the present parliament there has continued from the beginning of this reign and probably will continue says he to the end  this is indeed as he justly calls it a most pernicious particularity it being a greater defect in the constitutional liberties of ireland than any other that i ever heard of and as it is apparently contrary to the intention and legal constitution of parliaments must necessarily reflect the greatest dishonor on those persons whoever they are that have introduced this monstrous infringement on the natural rights of the irish subjects  these excellent letters which contain much seasonable instruction are said to be written by john dickinson esquire the same eminent author to whom thanks were most deservedly given by the committee for the province of pensylvania on the   st of july last for the great assitance they had derived from the application of his eminent abilities to the service of his country in another performance since published entitled a new essay by the pennsylvanian farmer on the constitutional power of great britain over the colonies in america etc and the said committee with great justice and propriety recommended that performance as highly deserving the perusal and serious consideration of every friend of liberty etc   from time to time so that our more prudent ancestors imitating nature required also an annual sir edw coke in his  th inst p   speaking of the matters of parliament informs us of the reasons usually expressed in the writs for calling a new parliament as pro quibusdam arduis urgentibus negotiis nos statum et desensionem regni nostri angliae et ecclesiae anglicanae concernentibus quod dam parliamentum nostrum etc teneri ordinavimus etc and he adds in the next paragraph now for as much says he as diverse laws and statutes have been enacted and provided for these ends aforesaid and that diverse mischiefs in particular and diverse grievances in general concerning the honor and safety of the king the state and defense of the kingdom and of the church of england might be prevented an excellent law was made anno    edw iii c  0 which being applied to the said writs of parliament does in a few and effectual words set down the true subject of a parliament in these words for the maintenance of the said articles and statutes and redress of diverse mischiefs and grievances which daily happen a parliament shall be holden every year as another time was ordained by a statute which statute here referred to was made in the  th year of the same reign cap    item it is accorded that a parliament shall be holden every year once and more often if need be but sir william blackstone supposes that the king never was obliged by these statutes to call a new parliament every year but only to permit a parliament to sit annually for the redress of grievances and dispatch of business if need be   com c   p      it is too true indeed that our kings in general did not think themselves  obliged by these statutes as they ought in conscience to have been for the safety of their souls to call a new parliament every year nay it is certain that many of them would never have called a parliament at all had they not been obliged by necessity and the circumstances of the times but by what authority could a representative in one parliament take his seat in the next annual parliament without reelection before any laws were made for lengthening the duration of parliaments and besides if the king did  only permit a parliament to sit annually etc by what authority could the parliament be convened at all under such a circumstance seeing that a mere permission to sit excludes the idea of a prorogation from year to year however the learned commentator himself very justly observes in a preceding page   0 concerning the manner and time of assembling that the parliament is regularly to be summoned by the kings writ or letter issued out of chancery and it is well known that these writs are not addressed to the knights citizens and burgesses elected for any former parliament but to the sheriffs alone to cause kinghts citizens etc to be elected for when the said acts were made such an absurdity in politics had never been conceived in england as that of entrusting the representation of the people for a term of years as at present to the persons elected on the contrary when the business of each sessions was finished the parliament of course was at an end and therefore lord coke did not speak in vain when he mentioned the excellent law  viz the act for annual parliaments being applied to the said writs of parliament etc before recited  a man of so much goodsense learning and judgment as sir william blackstone is master of must be well aware of the pernicious effects of investing the representatives of the people with a legislative power beyond the constitutional term of a single session without reelection and therefore i cannot but be surprised at the unguarded manner in which he has expressed himself in his comment on the two excellent statutes of edward iii for annual parliaments viz that the king is not or ever was obliged by these statutes to call a new parliament every year etc he has caused the word new to be printed in italies as if he meant thereby to insinuate that the legislatures of those early times were not unacquainted with our modern idea of conferring on the popular representatives a kind of continued senatorial dignity without reelection for several years together whereas he certainly must have known that this corrupt modorn practice has produced a new order of men amongst us a most dangerous increase of aristocratical power which was entirely unknown to our ancestors in the glorious reign of edward iii if he could show that there ever was a parliament in those times that was not a new parliament his comment might be justified but it is notorious that writs were issued to the sheriffs for new elections almost every year during that whole reign the writs for the most part are still preserved with the returns upon them in the catalogue of electionwrits which prynn has given in his brevia parliamentaria rediviva p   to   there is an account of writs issued for new elections in every year of that kings reign between his   th when the last act for annual parliaments was made and his  0th year except   viz the  0th   st and   th years in which years the records of summons to the prelates and lords of parliament are also wanting as appears by sir william dugdales perfect copy of summons to parliament of the nobility etc  and yet this affords no absolute proof that parliaments were not held in those very years for which the writs are wanting because the bundles of writs for the said years may have been lost or mislaid the only wonder is that more have not been absolutely lost when we consider the very little care that had been taken of them for prynne found many of these writs dispersed amongst a vast miscellaneous heap of other records on various subjects as he himself relates in his epistlededicatory to king charles ii of his brevia parliamentaria rediviva calling the said heap a confused chaos under corroding putrefying cobwebs dust and filth in the darkest corner of caesars chapel in the white tower as mere useless relics not worthy to be calendred etc and in page  0  of that same work he speaks of     bundles of writs whereof    had only been then lately discovered filed and bundled by himself but many of these     bundles says he are not complete above half or three parts of the writs being either rotted consumed maimed torn or utterly lost through carelessness wet cankers or other casualties and some of them have not above two three or four writs and one or two but one writ and retorn remaining  but that there were really writs for parliaments even in those three years which appear to be wanting at least in two of them is very certain because it was in the  0th year of this reign as sir edward coke informs us   inst p    that the pope demanded homage for the kingdoms of england and ireland and the arrears of revenue granted by king john to pope innocent iii whereupon the king in the same year calls his court of parliament in this parliament it was unanimously agreed by the prelates dukes counts barons and the commons et la common and again at communes that the said king john nor no other could put himself nor his realm nor his people in such subjection without their assent sans assent de eux and if it was done it was done without their assent that is without the assent of the commons for the assent of the barons was expressed in the charter and contrary to his oath at his coronation p    whereupon lord coke remarks in the margin that no king can put himself nor his ream nor his people in such subjection without assent of the lords and commons in parliament etc   etc as sir edward coke proves from the parliamentrolls of that year no   remarking at the same time that the act then made was never yet printed see the margin  th inst p     and it appears that a parliament was held also in the   th year of this reign because supplies were in that year granted to the king by parliament as related by sir richard baker in his chronicle p     viz in his eight and fortieth year in a parliament is granted him a  0th of the clergy and a   th of the laity so that there is but one year out of so many in which we cannot trace the meeting of the annual parliaments and annual writs for new elections were regularly issued for the first    years of the following reign as appears by prynns  d part of a brief register and survey of the several kinds and forms of parliamentary writs pages     and     till richard ii that wretched perjured monarch had rendered himself absolute his arbitrary proceedings very soon afterward occasioned his own loss of power and total ejectment from the throne so that notwithstanding his boasted firmness in executing his favorite measures he was at last reduced to the most abject acknowledgements of his own unworthiness to reign     after considering these unquestionable evidences of the issuing writs annually for new elections it will be difficult to comprehend the meaning of sir william blackstones comment on the said two acts for annual parliaments not that he the king is or ever was obliged by these statutes to call a new parliament every year but only to permit a parliament to sit annually for the redress of grievances and dispatch of business if need be  these last words says he are so loose and vague that such of our monarchs as were inclined to govern without parliaments neglected the convoking them sometimes for a very considerable period under pretense that there was no need of them etc  but these last words are not so loose and vague as either to justify his own explanation of the said statutes  viz not to call a new parliament every year but only to permit a parliament to sit etc or to excuse in the least degree the criminal neglects of those depraved monarchs who were inclined to govern without them for the words if need be cannot according to the most obvious sense of the act wherein they are found be applied to the main purpose of the act the holding annual parliaments but merely to the remaining part of the sentence viz and more often that is and more often if need be the order that a parliament shall be holden every year once is absolute and the discretionary power expressed in the words if need be relates apparently to the calling parliaments more often for if the said discretionary words if need be could with any propriety be applied to the whole sentence the act itself would have been nugatory which could never be the intention of the legislature but the true meaning and sense of the legislature is very clearly proved by the histories of those times for it is manifest not only that new representatives were elected every year with only one exception for a considerable number of years after the last of the said acts was made which confirms the main purpose of the acts viz the holding annual parliaments but it is also manifest that parliaments were frequently held more often than once a year writs were issued for electing   new parliaments in the  th year of edw iii   in his   th year   in his   th year and even   in his   th year and there appear to have been   new parliaments in the  th of r ii see prynnes brevia parliamentaria rediviva p   and     which amply confirms also what i have before said concerning the meaning of the discretionary power expressed in the said act by the words if need be  these very frequent elections sometimes two three and four times in one year sufficiently prove that the power delegated by the people to their representatives continued no longer in force than during the session of the particular parliament to which they were summoned which being once determined says prynne  st part of brief register etc of parl writs p     they presently ceased to be knights citizens burgesses barons in any succeeding parliaments or councils unless newly elected and returned to serve in them by the kings new writs as our law books referring to   ed iv f    brook officer       hen viii c    and experience resolve etc and therefore judge blackstones insinuation against the calling of a new parliament has no real foundation for if it was the intention of the legislature in the two acts abovementioned that the king should ever summon any parliament at all they must necessarily be understood to mean a new parliament on all occasions i e not only that the regular parliaments which they ordained to be holden every year once should be new parliaments but those also that should be summoned upon any extraordinary unforeseen occasions which is sufficiently expressed in the  st of the said acts by the words and more often if need be the meaning of the act is unquestionably proved by the actual issuing of writs to the sheriffs for electing knights citizens etc for two three and sometimes four new parliaments in one year as mentioned above and if any person should object that such very frequent elections must be attended with insuperable difficulties and inconveniences we may quote the experience of all ancient times as affording ample and sufficient proofs to the contrary there being not above two or three cases of elections questioned or complained of from    hen iii till    edw iv that is more than  00 years for ought that appears by the retornes or parliamentrolls and not so much as one double return or indenture wherewith all the late bundles or writs are stored and the house of commons and late committees of privileges pestered perplexed to the great retarding of the more weighty public affairs of the king and kingdom prynne brevia parl rediv p     this enormous evil the retardment of business by undue returns will not i may venture without the spirit of prophecy to assert be remedied by the new regulation for that purpose the commons were never in ancient times of freedom esteemed the proper judges of their own elections but the king alone that is in his limited judicial capacity by his justices and his sworn juries in the courts of common law if my countrymen will seriously consider all these points they must be convinced that the only sure method of healing the alarming distempers of our political constitution viz the enormous national debt the numerous pensions the secret parliamentary influence a standing army of near  00 battalions of foot besides cavaly in time of peace i etc etc etc which must render the estates and property of individuals precarious and insecure or finally eat them up with growing burtbens if these fatal symptoms of the most dangerous political consumption are not speedily checked and thrown off by the wholesome prescriptions of a free and equal representation of the people   is to restore to the people their ancient and just right to elect a new parliament  every year once and more often if need be whatsoever judge blackstone may think of it  no parliament could have any right to deprive the people of this inestimable law unless the representatives had expressly consulted their respective constituents upon it as the alteration was of too much moment to be entrusted to the discretion of any representatives or deputies whatsoever being infinitely more important than any new devie moved on the kings behalf in parliament for his aid or the like for the most essential and fundamental right of the whole body of the commons i mean the principals not the deputies or agents was materially injured by the fatal change and the peoples power of control for the general good of the kingdom was thereby apparently diminished so that if it is the duty of representatives even in any new device of mere aid or the like to consult their constituents how much more upon the proposal of so material an alteration in the constitution ought they to have answered that in this new device they dare not agree without conference with their countries these are the words of lord coke who mentions them as the proper answer when any new device is moved etc and he adds whereby it appears says he that such conference is warrantable by the law and custom of parliament   inst p    so that no representative can be justified according to the law and custom of parliament who refuses to receive the instructions of his constituents notwithstanding that several very sensible worthy and i believe sincerely patriotic gentlemen have lately declared themselves to be of a contrary opinion but when they peruse the several authorities which i have cited concerning the absolute necessity of a very frequent appeal to the sense of the whole body of the people i trust in their candor and love of truth that they will alter their sentiments   renewal of their parliamentary representation as being necessary for the maintenance of public virtue  thus the third example given by this learned gentleman for taxing ireland and virginia etc without the assent of the respective inhabitants is manifestly illegal since it must appear that what he calls the english legistature in the year    0 was totally void of every essential and legal qualification to render it worthy of so distinguishing a title but supposing that the english legistature in the year    0 had been a legal and constitutional parliament yet the resolutions he has mentioned would have been totally illegal and amount to no more than a mere vain assertion as void of law and reason as it was really of effect which is proved by the answer of the english legislature at virginia then representing the people of that province to the unreasonable pretensions beforementioned of the mock legislature at london for otherwise if we were to consider what would have been the answer or rather what really were the claims of the one legislature without considering at the same time the real answer of the other to such vain and unjust pretensions we should lay ourselves open to the charge of partiality  the judicious author of a late apppeal to the justice and interests of the people of great britain in the present disputes with america has reported the answer of the virginian legislature on that occasion upon the dissolution of the monarchy says he the commonwealth dispatched a governor with a squadron to take possession of virginia he was permitted to land upon articles of which the following is one and decisively shows what were their original ideas of their rights article  th virginia shall be free from all taxes customs and impositions whatsoever and none shall be imposed on them without consent of the general assembly an appeal this little tract contains a great dear of intelligence and sound reasoning concerning the natural rights of mankind and is highly worthy the perusal of every good citizen who desires information concerning the present differences with the british colonies and upon the same occasion the clear and unanswerable arguments of another able writer also who signs himself free swiss must not be forgot the title of the work last mentioned seems indeed to be the only exceptionable part of it viz greatbritains right to tax her colonies placed in the clearest light by a swiss for a right without a just foundation cannot with propriety be entitled a right nevertheless he has most certainly placed in the clearest light the impropriety of any such claim upon the colonies   etc p     i have dwelt much longer upon these three precedents cited by the honorable mr barrington against ireland than i at first intended but the several different subjects to which i was naturally led in the examination of them are of so much constitutional importance and so necessary to be known to every englishman that i hope i may be excused for having as they occurred enlarged upon them in the several notes which i have added to my text  and with respect to the three precedents themselves i flatter myself that every impartial reader who carefully considers what has been already said upon them will freely pronounce them illegal and totally unworthy of being allowed the least weight or consideration as precedents against the independence of ireland since they are equally capable of being retorted as precedents for enslaving even england itself but i must therefore repeat what i have before declared in p     and elsewhere that i am very sure the worthy writer who unguardedly cited them will be as zealous to oppose any such doctrine as myself and i believe that i may farther assure myself that this learned author will not be displeased or offended with the freedom of these remarks upon his work for though i have not the honor to be personally acquainted with him yet i am sufficiently acquainted by other parts of his writings with the general benevolence and rectitude of his intentions and also that he is an admirer and fast friend to our constitutional liberty which plainly appears in many other parts of his useful work as well as myself so that any corrections on that side of the question will be taken i dare say by him as they were meant by me that is in good part and without the least ill will and his work i speak of it in general has very deservedly acquired so much esteem and credit in the world that i could not without great injustice to the subject before me permit any arguments therein upon the point in question to remain unanswered  the same observation i am inclined to think is equally applicable as well to the candor and disposition as to the writings of sir william blackstone whose very learned and useful commentaries must also be strictly examined upon this point before i conclude my declaration and had the other great and eminent writers lord coke lord chief justice vaughan judge jenkins etc whose opinions upon the present subject i am obliged also to call in question been still alive i should have thought myself equally sure of their benevolence and forgiveness if i except sergeant mayart because the undeserved contempt with which he has treated sir richard bolton the learned author whom he attempted to answer prevents my entertaining so charitable and friendly an opinion of him as i do of the rest  though i have now drawn these remarks concerning the constitution of ireland to a much greater length than i at first proposed yet i must not conclude whilst any material assertions of great authority remain unanswered several of sir edward cokes objections on this head have already toward the beginning of this  d part been proved i hope to want foundation but there still remains to be considered a further doctrine on the same point advanced by him in calvins case which i trust will appear to be equally unjust though founded on the opinion of all the judges in england  in anno    reg el says he it was resolved by all the judges in england in the case of orurke an irishman who had committed high treason in ireland that he by the stat of    hen viii c    might be indicted arraigned and tried for the same in england according to the purview of the statute   co      but this doctrine notwithstanding the great authority with which it is here delivered is obnoxious to a fundamental right of the subject the trial by a jury of the vicinage or of neighbors to the fact which is due to every private person in the british dominions according to the ancient laws and customs of this realm otherwise the government would cease to be limited and thereby would cease to be lawful so that if sir edward coke had been as much upon his guard when he quoted this  resolution of all the judges as he was when he made his remarks on that wicked act of parliament in the reign of k hen vii by which also the fundamental right of trial by juries was violated he would neither have mentioned that resolution of all the judges or even the act itself without guarding against the pernicious effects of such an unconstitutional doctrine by a proper censure as he did in the former case  it is not almost credible to foresee says he when any when any maxim or fundamental law of this realm is altered as elsewhere has been observed what dangerous inconveniences do follow which most expresely appears by this most unjust and strange act of    hen vii for hereby not only empson and dudley themselves but such justices of peace corrupt men as they caused to be authorized committed most grievous and heavy oppressions and exactions grinding of the face of the poor subjects by penal laws be they never so obsolete or unfit for the time by information only without any presentment or trial by jury being the ancient birthright of the subject but to hear and determine the same by their discretion inflicting such penalty as the statutes not repealed imposed etc  th inst c   p     and afterward he adds this statute of    h vii we have recited and showed the just inconvenience thereof to the end that the like should never hereafter be attempted in any court of parliament and that others might avoid the fearful end of these two timeservers empson and dudley qui eorum vestigia insistunt eorum exitus perhorrescant ibid  but though these two wretched judges were hanged for their timeserving yet it appears by this account of lord coke that when they presumed to dispense with the interposition of juries they acted by the express authority of a statute or act of parliament and though they were timeservers so far as to acquiesce contrary to their duty as judges in enforcing that wicked and unconstitutional statute which exceeded the due bounds to which the english legislature is necessarily limited yet it seems they adjudged no penalties in consequence thereof but such as the statutes not repealed imposed and it is plain therefore that the crime of those two judges against which lord coke mentioned the fearful end of those two timeservers as a warning to all future judges consisted in allowing the force of law to a wicked unconstitutional act of parliament by which a fundamental law of this realm was altered so that their crime was exactly parallel to the equally criminal resolution of all the judges in england in the case of orurke the irishman heforementioned which was in like manner founded on an express act of parliament viz    hen viii c    and parallel also to the crime for it must be so esteemed of all the judges of england when they resolved in sir john perrots case that for a treason done in ireland the offender may be tried by the statute    hen viii in england because the words of the statute be all treasons committed out of the realm of england  and ireland is out of the realm of england etc  d inst p    but the judges in both these cases were quite as inexcusable as the two timeservers dudley and empson for if the real intention of the legislature by the said acts of    and    hen viii had been so general as to include all places whatever out of the realm of england without leaving room for pleading a legal exception in behalf of those territories wherein the laws liberties and constitution of the realm of england were already established the said judges ought to have known that a fundamental law of this realm was thereby altered and consequently that they incurred the risk of being hanged by some future administration like their timeserving predecessors for presuming to enforce such unconstitutional acts of parliament by which according to the just remark of the same great reporter on a former act viz    h   a fundamental law of the realm was altered whereas they really might have attributed a constitutional meaning to the said acts by duly distinguishing those they might have alleged that if an ambassador sent from this kingdom to france spain or to any other foreign state out of the dominions of the imperial crown of great britain should notoriously betray his king and country and plot their destruction he might legally and constitutionally be punished according to the letter and meaning of the said acts of parliament and also that any other british subject whatsoever that is in like manner guilty of treason to his king and country during his residence in a foreign realm may be treated accordingly because all men certainly are accountable to their country for any such treason and as they cannot be tried in the foreign realms where the offenses were committed it is reasonable and just to suppose that they may be tried in england by an impartial jury though the same ae not neighbors to the fact nor impannelled de vicineta that is from the neighborhood where the offense was committed for though this circumstance is essentially necessary to the legality of a jury in every other case yet the law does not require impossibilities and it may therefore perhaps be legally dispensed with when it is apparent from the nature of the case that such an unexceptionable jury cannot be obtained and yet that an exemplary punishment is manifestly due to the traitor or traitors but when treasons and other offenses are committed in any country under the dominion of the crown of england where the criminals might have a legal trial according to the laws of this realm as in ireland the said most essential formality of being tried by a jury de vicineto cannot be dispensed with because this would deprive the subject of an unalienable right and alter a fundamental law of this realm so that any judge who should venture to enforce the said act in such cases would manifestly deserve to be hanged as much as dudley and empson  the examination of this point gives some general idea how far the power of the high court of parliament notwithstanding that imaginary omnipotency which some men have ignorantly attributed to it may be allowed to extend for the more high and absolute the jurisdiction of the court is the more just and honorable it ought to be in the proceeding and to give example of justice to inferior courts  th inst p    which is most strictly true for whenever the supreme temporal powers exceed the honorable limits of natural justice and truth they lessen their own dignity and in proportion to their errors forfeit that respectful consideration and esteem which would otherwise be due from their subjects and we must remember likewise that the being just and honorable in mere profession of words without the reality will have very little weight with the body of the people who are endued with commonsense as well as their superiors to discern what is just and honorable from that which is merely called so and that a pretense to justice and honor in a bad cause is only an aggravation of injury and iniquity the most wicked ordinances have sometimes been ushered into the world under the most sanctified titles and specious pretenses the abominable act beforementioned of hen vii was expressly said to be against great enormities and offenses which have been committed and have daily contrary to the good statutes for many and diverse behoovefull considerations severally made and ordained to the displeasure of almighty god and the great let of the common law and wealth of the land  now notwithstanding this fair flattering preamble as sir edward coke calls it yet the purview of that act as he justly remarked tended in the execution contrary ex diametro viz to the high displeasure of almighty god the great let nay the utter subversion of the common law and the great let of the wealth of this land ibid p  0 as indeed every other act of parliament must inevitably do which perverts the due course of the law and robs the subjects of any fundamental right as for instance let us suppose  st that an act is made to stop up or proscribe the passage to any seaport town or any haven shore of the sea or great river without the consent and to the great detriment of all the neighboring inhabitants such an act would be fundamentally wrong as being contrary to the first or most essential right of mankind the law of nature for it is clearly laid down by bracton that all ports havens shores of the sea and great rivers are free to all peaceable passengers but more particularly we may add to the nearest inhabitants by the law of nature and of nations naturali vero jure communia sunt omnia haec aqua profluens aer et mare et littora maris quasi maris accessoria nemo enim ad litus maris accedere prohibetur dum tamen a villis et aedificiis abstineat quia littora sunt de jure gentium communia sicut et mare etc and again publica vero sunt omnia flumina et portus etc riparum etiam usus publicus est de jure gentium sicut ipsius sluminis itaque naves ad eas applicare funes arboribus ibi natis religare onus aliquae in eis reponere cuivis liber est sicuti por ipsum fluvium navigae sed proprietas earum est illorum quorum praediis adbaerent etc lib   c    p   and   so that such an act would be mainifestly contrary to the law of nature and nations and consequently is such as no legislature on earth can render valid or legal because natural rights and the laws of nature are immutable  jura enim naturalia sunt immutabilia and again jura enim naturalia dicuntur immutabilia quia non possunt ex toto abrogari vel aufirri etc ib c   p   and besides it must be remembered that to proscribe the passage or highway to any city or town especially if it is done with an avowed design to distress the inhabitants thereof in their lawful occupations is an intolerable nuisance which is clearly adjudged in law to be such a malum in se as can never be made lawful  but malum in se the king nor any other can dispense mes malum in se le roy ne null autre poit dispenser sicome le roi yeut pardonner a occire un autre ou lui license a fair nuisance in le haut chemin ceo est void etc    hen vii p    wherefore it is generally true as judge vaughan remarks that malum per se cannot be dispensed with etc rep p      or  dly suppose an act should be made to empower the governor of a province without the consent of the council to appoint judges and other lawofficers who shall hold their commissions during the pleasure of the crown instead of the approved and established legal condition quamdiu se been gesserint thereby setting up will and pleasure above law and justice which are the first and most essential rights of the people  would not such an act tend to the great let nay the utter subversion of the common law etc suppose likewise it should be odained in such an act that the freeholders and inhabitants of the several townships in any particular province shall not be permitted even when they are authorized to assemble together to treat upon matters of the most general concern  except the business be expressed in the leave given by the governor which implies that one or a few individuals have a more equitable pretension to treat upon matters of the most general concern than even the general meeting or whose collective body of persons themselves who are concerned  a principle which is subversive of all common right and natural equity and consequently must tend to the high displeasure of almighty god as well as  the great let of the wealth of the land and to complete the iniquity of such an imaginary act let us suppose a clause whereby  it shall and may be lawful lawful for the justices etc in any cause or action which shall be brought to issue to order the said cause or action to be tried in any county other than the county in which the said cause or action shall have been brought or laid by a jury of such other county as they shall judge fit etc  such a clause must strike at the very foundation of justice  or  dly if this imaginary act should not be esteemed sufficiently injurious to the people though it is apparently calculated to rob them of that fundamental and unalienable right the trial by a jury de vicineto let us suppose an act still more partial if possible in the administration of justice and rendeted still more aggravating and insulting by bearing a title contrary ex diametao to the purport of it  let us i say endeavor to stretch that notorious injustice to the utmost extent of inconvenience and injury that a wicked imagination can possibly conceive or express that is to establish a power of removing the causes and trials and even those which are of the most importance viz for capital offenses not only to a neighboring county or to a more distant colony but even if caprice should require it to the furthermost extent of the globe that is without aggravation as far as the east is from the west  or  thly if we may conceive the idea of an act calculated to fulfill the measure of iniquity let us suppose an act expressly for the purpose of establishing the arbitrary laws of france  quod principi placuit habet vigorem legis etc see my preface thereupon and in order that it may be destructive to the souls as well as the bodies and property of the wretched subjects as i have already shown let us suppose that ample provision is made therein for the establishment not the mere toleration of downright idolatry and image worship for the toleration of the most notorious exorcisms  exorcismus aquae  exorcismum salis  exorciso te creatura salis  see the missal and spiritual witchcraft in short let us suppose that such an act provides for the establishment of that adulterated religion which has long been perplexed with all the enthusiasm of heathen ignorance long prayers vain repetitions as the heathen do and bears the most apparent marks of antichrist insomuch that we might be certain at least who was the first spiritual instigator and promoter of such a bill though the bodily proposer of it should be lucky enough toremain undiscovered who shall presume to say that any power on earth whatsoever weak and ignorant men may think of the omnipotence of parliament has authority or right either to establish such notorious spiritual abominations or to render lawful such gross iniquity and palpable injustice   and therefore if any such act should be made in our days howsoever specious the preamble it is our duty as good subjects to remember that the same ought to be considered as null and void of itself and that it cannot authorize or indemnify the judges or any other persons who presume to enforce it for all men and judges in particular ought to take warning from the fearful end of those two timeservers dudley and empson that such an active obedience would perhaps endanger their own necks for suppose  dly that such an act was to be decked with the most flattering title let us call it for instance an act for the better regulating the government of any particular province or  dly let it be called an act for the more impartial administration of justice in the cases of persons questioned for any acts done by them in the execution of the law or for the suppression though the suppression of riots and tumults is here included as one of the fair flattering pretenses in the title of the above mentioned imaginary act of parliament yet it it is apparent that the wicked act itself would be the most effectual method that could possibly have been devised for the promotion instead of the suppression of riots and tumults for which consequently none but the promoters and makers of such an unjust law could with any propriety be esteemed accountabled since it is true even to a maxim that he makes the strife or tumult who first offends  qui primum peccat ille facit rixam prin leg et aequit p      of riots and tumults etc or  thly suppose such an injurious and unlawful act should be entitled an act for making more effectual provision for the government of any particular province etc yet if the purview as lord coke justly remarked of any such imaginary acts should tend in the execution contrary ex diametro to all these specious pretenses set forth in their titles and preambles by establishing principles whereby any fundamental law of the realm is altered the same would manifestly endanger the necks i must repeat it of any judges that were imprudent enough to enforce them notwithstanding that the express authority of king lords and commons should be alleged as their sufficient warrant because we find that the like authority afforded no justification or excuse for poor empson and dudley in a similar case neither did the consideration of their having acted by parliamentary authority render their wretched fate more pitiable in the eyes of the public and therefore i sincerely wish that all modern timeservers may have prudence enough to form by that plain example some reasonable judgment concerning the imaginary omnipotence of parliament which cannot insure its wretched votaries from the most ignominious punishment nor secure even the parliament itself from the just and lasting censures of the sages of our law such as lord coke for instance who warned them in another place also expressly upon this point  by color of which act says he meaning the said unjust act of    hen vii shaking this fundamental law the law of juries it is not credible what horrible oppressions and exactions to the undoing of infinite numbers of people were committed by sir rich empson knt and edm dudley etc and upon this unjust and injurious act as commonly in like cases it falls out a new office was erected etc and in the next paragraph he adds  and the fearful ends of these two oppressors says he should deterred others from committing the like and should admonish parliaments that instead of this ordinary and precious trial per legem terrae they bring not in absolute and partial trials by discretion  d inst p      particular cases wherein they may legally be enforced without thwarting any fundamental law of the realm  from what has been said i hope it will appear sufficiently clear to my readers that the severe censure which lord coke so justly bestowed on the two wicked judges dudley and empson for acting by the authority of an unconstitutional act of parliament is equally applicable for the very same reason to the resolutions beforementioned of all the judges in england though lord coke himself even the author of the former censure has cited them without the least animadversion  the judges in the   d year of queen elizabeth who gave their opinion in the case of orurk or ornick see  d inst p    margin the irishman are the more inexcusable for their resolution upon the act of    hen viii c    because they had an excellent example set them but a few years before that time by two very learned and respectable brethren the judges wray and dyer together with the said queens attorney general concerning several similar acts of parliament which example is worthy the most serious attention of all future judges that they may ever be careful to restrain by a legal construction not only the said acts of king henry viii and king edward vi but all others likewise that may happen to be equally liable to alter the free constitution of the realm and rob the subjects of any essential fundamental right that ought to be esteemed unalienable  judge dyer himself has reported the circumstances of it he informs us gerrarde

arraigned and put to his trial in england for the offense by the statute    h viii c        h viii c       h viii  and   and   ed vi c    and it was maintained by wray dyer and gerrarde the attorney general that he could not for he cannot have his trial here by his peers nor by any jury of    because that he is not a subject of england but of ireland and therefore his trial shall be there etc  these worthy lawyers were not afraid it seems to maintain the weight of a legal and fundamental reason against the combined force of four express acts of parliament and such a reason though it had been advanced only by a single judge or even by a private person is certainly of much more weight than the opinion of all the judges in england when given contrary to reason or against the tenor of any fundamental law  i never heard that this reason assigned by the judges wray and dyer and the attorney general against the force of the said four acts of parliament has ever been questioned or disallowed as insufficient in the case of an irish peer and therefore a similar reason is certainly as effectual in the case of any private irish subject whose crime is parallel because true justice is equal in all her ways and has no respect to persons but if ye have respect to persons ye commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors james ii   for the same law which entitles the nobleman to a trial by his peers per pares suos magna charta c    or  per legale judicium parium suorum lb c    secures also to every other person his parallel right to a legal impartial trial by a

prince where the crown of england has no jurisdiction but in all other cases whatsoever the trial by a jury of neighbors to the fact is the unalienable right of all british subjects according to the ancient law of the land nay this particular mode of trial is so inseparably annexed to the law of the land that it is sometimes expressed and known by that general term the law of the land lex terrae as if there was no other law of the land but this one which emphatical expression sufficiently proves that this particular law for the mode of trials is the first and most essential law of the constitution for otherwise it could not be entitled to such an eminent and peculiar distinction in preference to all the other excellent laws of the land and consequently this principal or fundamental law is so necessarily implied and comprehended in that general term the law of the land that the latter may be considered as entirely subverted and overthrown whenever the former is changed or set aside for sublato fundamento cadit opus jenk cent  0   in the   th chapter of magna charta the law of the land seems to be mentioned in this peculiar sense nec super cum ibimus nec super eum mittemus nisi per legale judicium parium suarum vel per legem terras lord cokeresers us for the true sense and exposition of these words to the statute of    ed iii cap   meaning chapter the   th where the words by the law of the land says he are rendered without due process of law etc which he farther explains toward the end of the same sentence  that is says he by indictment or presentment of good and lawful men where such deeds be done in due manner or by writoriginal of the common law  these last are the express words of another act of edw iii  viz    e iii c   item whereas it is contained in the great charter of the franchises of england that none shall be imprisoned nor put out of his freehold nor of his franchises nor free custom unless it be by the law of the land it is accorded assented and stablished that from henceforth none shall be taken by petition or suggestion made to our lord the king or to his council unless it be by indictment or presentment of his good and lawful people of the same neighborhood where such deeds be done in due manner or by process made by writoriginal at the common law nor that none be put out of his franchises etc unless he be duly brought in answer and forejudged of the same by the course of the law and if any be done against the same it shall be redressed and holden for none    ed iii c   wherein they are given as an explanation of the words by the law of the land mentioned in the great charter and the great charter itself as well as this particular act and many other excellent acts of k ed iii is expressly cited and confirmed in an act of the   th cha i c  0 whereby the due process of the law or the ordinary course of the law see sect v is again reestablished in opposition to the unlawful authority that had been usurped by the king privy council and star chamber  this due process of the law therefore can be no otherwise than by a legal jury of    credible men  in presentia duodecim fide dignorum virorum facto vicinorum de quo agitur et circumstantiis ejus qui et noscunt eorundem testium mores maxim si vicini ipsi fuerint noscunt etiam et si ipsi sint credulitate digni etc fortescue de laud leg ang c    p    see also the    and   th chapters of that excellent little book   who are neighbors to the fact and unexceptionable to the parties concerned according to the ancient custom or law of the land item per antiquam legem et consuetudinem regni omnes exitus quae emergent in aliqua curia de record infra regnum nisi pauci de quibus non est hic necesse tractandum debet triari per xii liberos et legales homines de vicineto etc qui nulli partium ulla affinitati attingent doct and stud c   p    b and that the same is also a fundamental and essential right of the subject every man who pretends to doubt of it may be informed by the feelings of his own breast if he will only take the trouble for a moment to suppose himself in such a situation through the false accusations of his enemies that nothing but an impartial trial by a jury of neighbors well acquainted with him and his case and the malignity of his accusers can possibly save him from destruction and farther it is apparent that the said due process of the law by a jury de vicineto is now become an unalterable part of the constitution and must ever remain in force not only against all contrary resolutions and opinions of the judges such as i have mentioned but even against the express authority of any act of parliament that happens inadvertently to have been made to the contrary because all such must necessarily be holden for none according to the    ed iii c   which is cited by judge jenkins for that purpose jenkinsius redivivus p    and though it may be alleged against the authority of this act of parliament that another act may unbind what it has bound according to the maxim eodem modo quo quid constituitur eodem modo dissolvitur yet a due consideration of this very maxim will afford us a substantial argument to the contrary for at the time the said act was made  viz in the    ed iii the great charter had been expressly confirmed by many parliaments not only in the reigns of that noble kings ancestors but also by at least twelve preceding parliaments and parliaments at that time were preserved in purily and independence by a very frequent renewal of the popular representation viz every year once and more often if there was need etc which i have already proved in pages   0 to   0 of this declaration so that there was not then the least room even for the bare suspicion of undue influence   even in his own glorious reign so that the parliament in his   d year had certainly sufficient authority to add to their confirmation of the charters that if any statute be made to the contrary that shall be holden for none and the reason is plain for no statute whatever eodem modo constituitur is ordained by so great authority as that which magna charta has at length acquired by the express confirmation from time to time of so many different kings and parliaments in the time of sir edward coke the charters had been expressly confirmed by thirtytwo different parliaments as he himself witnesses in the proeme of his  d institute the said   charters says he have been confirmed established and commanded to be put in execution by    several acts of parliament   the wisdom of ages has made it venerable and stamped it with an authority equal to the constitution itself of which it is in reality a most essential and fundamental part so that any attempt to repeal though some particular articles of magna charta are indeed rendered useless at this day by subsequent statutes yet this affords no argument against the general stability of the charter with respect to its main object the freedom of the people it is a charter of liberties and therefore the subsequent statutes which enlarged those liberties by annihilating the several oppressive customs which are mentioned therein and limited within certain bounds as knights service escuage wards and liveries etc cannot be said to operate against the charter but rather in aid of it for though the said oppressive tenures and dangerous prerogatives are permitted by the charter in a certain degree yet the apparent intention of the several articles wherein they are mentioned was not to establish but only to restrain them as much as the circumstances temper and prejudices of those early times would permit so that the statutes which afterward entirely removed the oppression cannot be esteemed contrary to the purpose of the charter because they enlarged those liberties and franchises of the people to which the charter itself is so apparently dedicated   it would be treason to the state this glorious charter must therefore ever continue unrepealed and even the articles which seem at present useless must ever remain in force to prevent the oppressions and prerogatives there named from being extended beyond certain limits in case the same should ever hereafter be revived no single act of parliament can unbind or remove the limits here laid down nothing less than the same accumulated authority by which the charter is now established can possibly set it aside or any part of it according to the maxim before recited eodem modo quo quid constituitur eodem modo dissolvitur for no single act of parliament eodem modo constituitur is ordained in the same manner the many repeated confirmations of its authority were a work of ages so that the said authority cannot legally be set aside unless it be done eodem modo quo constituitur that is by the repeated suffrages of as many parliaments against it as have already expressly confirmed it and god forbid that any such gross depravity and corruption should ever obtain such a continuance in this kingdom as to accomplish so great an evil for that could not be without a total national reprobacy dangerous to us not only in this world but also in the next  it must therefore be obvious to every person who duly considers all these circumstances that the resolutions of all the judges in england in the cases of orurke or ornicke the irishman and sir john perrot were contrary to a fundamental law in the great charter and consequently ought to be holden for none according to the express determination of the parliament in the   d ed iii c   viz that the great charter and the charter of the forest be holden and kept in all points and if any statute be made to the contrary that shall be holden for none   and ought to be void in the law and holden for error according to the second chapter  it is assented and accorded for the good governance of the commons that no man be put to answer without presentment before justices or matter of record or by due process and writ original according to the old law of the land which i have already proved to signify in an especial manner the trial by a jury of the vicinage and if any thing from henceforth be done to the contrary it shall be void in the law and holden for error   of the same excellent statute because the two acts of parliament of the    and    h   on which they grounded their opinion cannot have any legal force notwithstanding the literal meaning of the general expressions therein when applied to offenses committed in any country province or colony whatsoever that is subject to the imperial crown of great britain so that even if ireland had been especially named therein the said acts would have been so far from binding that kingdom according to the effect supposed by lord coke judge vaughan judge blackstone and others that the very naming ireland for such purposes as were intended by the said acts would have rendered them absolutely null and void and to be holden for none because they would in that case have been directly contrary to the great charter whereas at present there are some particular cases as i have before remarked wherein they may perhaps be allowed a legal force  now though what i have already remarked will probably be thought a sufficient answer to the two resolutions of all the judges in england cited by lord coke as precedents against the liberties of our brethren the subjects of ireland i am nevertheless inclined to add one more testimony against the said resolutions which has no less authority than that even of lord coke himself in another part of his writings against all similar resolutions and opinions  let him now bear witness both against the said judges and himself  and albeit judgments in the kings courts says he are of high regard in law and judicia are accounted as jurisdicta yet it is provided by act of parliament that if any judgment be given contrary to any of the points of the great charter or charta de foresta by the justices or by any other of the kings ministers etc it shall be undone and holden for naught proeme to his  d institute  if lord coke when he mentioned the binding ireland in the parliament of england by special words  th inst p   0 and by being especially named calvins case  th rep p     had meant nothing more than what is clearly proved by his one example for all beforementioned  viz that a representation of the subjects in ireland ought to be summoned to the english parliament whenever an act of parliament shall be made in england especially concerning the statute of ireland there would have been no essential difference between his opinion and that natural justice for which i contend but alas that great man has confirmed his error upon that subject in another part of calvins case p     wherein he declares that albeit ireland was a distinct dominion yet the title thereof being by conquest the same by judgment of law might by express words be bound by act of the parliament of england here he has luckily given us another reason which leads us to the detection of his error  yet says he the title thereof being by conquest etc now it is very remarkable that so many of the most eminent law writers should have copied and adopted this erroneous opinion without examining the force of it as if the authority and real worth of this learned writer in other respects were sufficient to render valid a mistaken and groundless argument judge jenkins indeed has adopted the opinion without quoting the reasons but judge vaughan who has also adopted the opinion refers us expressly to lord cokes reason against ireland viz the title by conquest  that it is a conquered kingdom says he is not doubted but admitted in calvins case several times etc vaughans rep p     and upon the strength of this reason he proceeds very confidently to determine what things the parliament of ireland cannot do and to give instances of laws made in the parliament of england binding ireland p     of which neither the first a law concerning the homage of parceners called statutum hiberniae    hen iii  mr cay says the hon mr barrington very properly observes that it is not an act of parliament and cites the old abridgement title homage he allows it a place however in his edition of the statutes not to differ from former editors this in some measure gives the authority of legislation says this learned gentleman ironically to the kings lawprinters and yet if such an ordinance is inserted in every edition of the statutes for near   centuries together by printers known to print under the authority of the kings patent and the parliament permits this for such a length of time it becomes a question of some difficulty to say what force it may have acquired no such question fortunately can ever arise upon this statute as it is merely a rescriptum principis to certain milites adventurers probably in the conquest of ireland or their descendants who had doubts with regard to the tenure of lands holden by knights service and deseending to coparceners within age etc observations on the more ancient statutes p      nor the second a statute of nottingham called ordinanatio pro statu hiberniae    e i  upon which the hon mr barrington remarks it is very singular says he that though this ordinance has found a place amongst the english acts of parliament the collection of irish statutes printed by authority at dublin begins only with the ordinances of kilkenny in the  d year of edward the  d there can be no doubt however that this law extends to ireland if not repealed by some irish act of parliament as by poynings law in the time of henry the seventh all precedent english statutes are made to bind in ireland ib p     nevertheless i must beg leave to observe that this is neither an english nor an irish statute but a mere letterpatent of the king by the assent of his council though it might be dated perhaps during the sittings of a parliament at nottingham  edward par la grace de dieu roy dengliterre seignor dirland etc  a toutes ceux que ceux letters verront ou oiront salutes saches que a le mendement de gulement de nostre terre dirlande a pluis grand peax et tranquil de nostre people en cel terre a notin as octaves del st martin etc par assent de nostre counsel illonques etc this is not the style of an act of parliament neither is the assent of the common council or general council expressed but only  by the assent of our council that is the kings council which is always understood to signify the privy council and not the national council besides the king expressly calls this ordinance our letterspatent and witnessed it as such in the usual form viz en tesmoignance de quel chose nous avons fait fair cestes nous letters overtes done a notyngham le    jour de novembre lan de nostre reign dix septisme secunda pars veterum statutorum printed ann      p    and      are in the least entitled to the name of laws made in the parliament of england though they are printed in the statutebooks this seems also to be the case with the  d voucher which he has produced for his assertion viz laws for ireland made by e   per advisamentum concilii nostri etc that is if he meant the laws contained in the ordinance of that kings   st year viz ordinatio facta pro statu terrae hiberniae because this ordinance is no more entitled to the name of a law or act of parliament than the two former for long before this period the necessity of expressing the assent of the commons in order to render an act valid was well understood as the hon mr barrington remarks on the   th of ed iii the statutes now begin to appear says he in a new and more regular form etc whilst the preamble in every instance makes express mention of the concurrence of the commons p     whereas this ordinance has no such mention of their concurrence but only the assent of the council that is the assent of the kings council  de assensu consilii nostri ordinanda duximus etc whereas the assent of the great council of the nation is expressed in very different terms as i have remarked in the former notes as also in the notes on pages     and      but if this learned judge meant any other laws  for ireland made by edward iii than this ordinance of his   st year for he refers us in the margin to the parliamentrolls of his  th year yet the same cannot afford the least proof or precedent for binding ireland in england without assent because i have already cited ample testimony that the parliament of ireland in those days was frequently summoned to england sometimes to confer with the english parliament and sometimes to meet the king and his council in distinct seffions of the irish legislature see pages    to  0  his fourth voucher adds no more confirmation to his assertion than the three former for though it is really an act of parliament yet it cannot be produced as a precedent for binding the irish subjects without their consent because it is made expressly for the purpose of enforcing an act of the irish parliament estatute fait en la terre d ireland and therefore as the question relates only to the carrying the said law into execution which is properly the office of the king and his courts it is certainly indifferent whether be is advised therein by his privy council or by his common council of england especially as the latter in the case before us were so far from advising the king to invade or alter the irish law that they confirm it in the strongest terms  que le di estatute estoise en sa entier force et que bien et duement soit gardez et pleinement execute etc  with respect to his  th voucher referring us to  the late acts made in    car   etc it would be very unfair to draw from thence any conclusions unfavourable to the privileges of the irish parliament because that was the fatal year of the popish massacre in ireland when the protestant subjects of that kingdom were almost universally oppressed and all law and regularity overturned by the open rebellion of the popish party so that even the parliament of scotland as well as the parliament of england thought it right to take the affairs of ireland under their consideration at that unfortunate juncture and sent two commissioners properly instructed by the states of that kingdom to treat with the english parliament about the means of suppressing the irish rebellion sir john temples history of the irish rebellions p     to      but notwithstanding that some acts might have been made in the   th of charles i without the assent of the irish parliament yet they afford no evidence in favor of that opinion for which they are cited by the learned judge for mr molyneux has proved that by the repeal of those very acts of    cha i that they afford an argument even on the other side of the question viz that the parliament of ireland may repeal an act made in england in relation to the affairs of ireland p     and again with respect to the  th and last voucher under that head  viz the resolution of the judges in the exchequerchamber in the case of the merchants of waterford it by no means relates to the question in dispute for that concerns only the exportation and importation of goods and the irish do not pretend to contest the right of great britain to the dominion of the seas nor do they deny the power of the british parliament to regulate commerce as i have before remarked now as it appears that not one of these precedents is sufficient for the purpose proposed and as we cannot doubt but that so learned a lawyer as judge vaughan as i have before observed of judge coke would select the most applicable precedents that could be found the doctrine which he has built upon these insufficient precedents must necessarily fall to the ground     amongst the modern writers who have likewise unfortunately adopted the same erroneous opinion of lord coke the learned judge blackstone is the most eminent and therefore demands the most careful examination  in the introduction to his commentaries p  0  he has delivered his sentiments much to the same effect as the other more ancient writers already mentioned  that no acts of the english parliament since the twelfth of king john extended into that kingdom ireland unless it were specially named or included under general words such as within any of the kings dominions etc and in page  0  he repeats the same doctrine that no acts of the english parliament made since the  0th hen vii do now bind the people of ireland unless specially named or included under general words for this inclusive power of general words judge black stone refers us to lord cokes    rep     but i shall take no pains to refute any error in that last collection of his reports which are well known says the honorable mr barrington p     not to be of equal authority with those that precede and besides i have already demonstrated i hope in my comment on the cases of orurke the irishman and sir john perrot as also by the clear and decisive resolution of the worthy judges wray and dyer and the attorney general gerrard for restraining the general words of four express acts of parliament that all such general words in statutes must be duly restrained by a legal construction if the judges who enforce them mean to avoid the risk of exemplary punishment   and in the same paragraph he assigns the very same reason drawn from the conquest of ireland which had misled both lord coke and judge vaughan before him and on the other hand says he it is equally clear that where ireland is particularly named or is included under general words they are bound by such acts of parliament though i hope i have already made the contrary appear equally clear for this follows says he from the very nature and constitution of a dependent state dependence being very little else but an obligation to conform to the will or law of that superior person or state the irish do not pretend to deny a legal dependence on the superior state of england for they acknowledge that the sovereignty of their island is inseparably annexed to the crown of england of which i believe i have already quoted some examples but when dependencs is defined in the manner judge blackstone represents it as an obligation to conform to the will or law of the superior person or state etc it ceases to be a legal dependence according to the common law and constitution of england though the learned judge is certainly right enough if he will be pleased to confine his definition of dependence to those countries where the civil law prevails as in france or prussia for instance because in such despotic realms the oppressed people seem indeed to acknowledge an obligation to conform to the will or law of the superior person or state and the learned commentator if he meant to refer to the laws of such enslaved people as these must certainly be allowed to have delivered his meaning in the most expressive and judicious terms that he could possibly have chosen for such a purpose for in speaking of the will of that superior person or state to which he supposes an obligation to conform etc he mentions it as a synonimous term to the word law viz will or law says he that is an obligation to conform to the will or law of that superior person or state etc which is indeed a most lively description of the dangerous unlimited power of the french prussian or imperial administrations of government for wheresoever these two words will and law are considered as synonimous there law must of course be any thing be it ever so wicked or iniquitous that the superior pleases that is in short quod principi placuit legis habet vigorem but i have already held up that detestable maxim of the civil law to the view of my readers and therefore i shall now only remark in general that neither the laws of england nor the laws of ireland acknowledge and such precept as the setting up the will of a superior for law or what is the same thing they do not acknowledge any such state of dependence as an obligation to conform to the will or law those synominous terms of the superior person or state etc  our laws indeed acknowledge the king of great britain for the time being as the superior or head of both kingdoms but the dependence which is thereby required of the inferior whether the term enferior he applied to the inferior kingdom as subordinate or to persons viz to each individual as a subject in either case is a politic or legal dependence and not absolute and unlimited  principatu namque nedum regali sed et politico ipse suo populo dominatur the laws leave no room to suppose that there is  an obligation to conform to the will or law if the latter has no other foundation than the will of that superior person nam non potest rex angliae ad libitum suum leges mutare regni sui principatu namque nedum regali etc as above fortescue de laud leg angliae c   p    b and if even the kings power is not regal but politic and limited which the same learned writer chancellor fortescue has clearly proved in a distinct tract expressly on that subject entitled the difference between absolute and limited monarchy much less can the kings subjects be said to exercise a sovereigns legislative power   com p  0  over any nation or people whatsoever that have no share in the said power by a due representation of their own collective body for the sovereign majesty of the people ought never to be exerted except in their own necessary defense or to maintain the natural rights and equitable privileges of mankind against tyrants and oppressors for the good of society in general through that disinterested evangelical principle good will toward men but when on the contrary any particular nation or people exerts that sovereign legislative power to deprive another different nation of their natural rights and liberties they no longer deserve to enjoy their own and indeed divine justice will inevitably overtake them sooner or later for as the crimes of individuals will surely be punished with personal condemnation so national sins must feel the additional weight of temporal national retribution which i trust i have demonstrated in a little tract intended sometime or other for publication entitled the law of retribution and in particular of gods temporal vengeance on slaveholders   upon which the inferior depends and then he immediately adds the original and true ground says he of this superiority in the present case is what we usually call though somewhat improperly very improperly indeed the right of conquest etc now i most heartily join with him in his application of the adverb improperly to the words which follow viz the right of conquest whenever it is mentioned as a reason to justify this claim or imaginary right of binding the people of ireland either by being specially named or included under general words for i hope i shall convince that learned gentleman himself as well as the rest of my readers before i conclude that the right of conquest is not the original and true ground of any such superiority in the present case as he supposes but on the contrary that it seems rather to have been the original and true ground of all the dangerous mistakes which have been made upon this important question by lord coke judge vaughan and himself for if this learned gentleman will be pleased to review this argument founded on the right of conquest as applied by himself and the other two very eminent writers beforementioned to the free kingdom of ireland i trust through the great opinion i entertain of his candor and good sense that he will readily give it up for though the right of conquest may be as he says a right allowed by the law of nations if not by that of nature that is in some particular cases yet it certainly is contrary both to the law of nations and that of nature to which he has appealed that the right of conquest should be pleaded for binding the conquerors themselves or their descendants without their assent for of such consist the greatest part of the landed interest in ireland at this day who are entitled to all the rights and liberties of the ancient conquerors by inheritance and lineal descent  titles so just and sacred that i am sure judge blackstone will never persist in opposing them especially when he sees hereafter by what authority i make this assertion nay the right of conquest is so bad a plea to extenuate the iniquity of exerting any such oppressive and unlimited power that it fails in reason and in natural justice even when applied as an excuse for oppressing the conquered  much less therefore can it affect the liberties and natural rights of the conquerors themselves  that these liberties and natural rights of the conquerors are entailed upon a very great part if not the most numerous at least the most considerable in point of rank and fortune of the present inhabitants of ireland is a point i believe which cannot be contested for judge blackstone himself has declared in a preceding page     that the inhabitants of ireland are for the most part the following extract from sir wm pettys political survey of ireland will corroborate this just remark of sir william blackstone  the british protestants and church have threefourths of all the lands fivesixths of all the housing ninetenths of all the housing in walled towns and places of strength twothirds of the foreign trade etc p       descended from the english who planted it as a kind of colony after the conquest of it by king henry the second etc and consequently the most part of the said inhabitants ought to be considered as standing in the place of the conquerors rather than of the conquered so that if the reason assigned by these three learned men has any weight viz that some degree of superiority is acquired by right of conquest it must be allowed that the most part of the said inhabitants are equally entitled to it in right of their conquering ancestors for it would be highly injurious to deprive them of their hereditary privileges which descend to them from the actual conquerors themselves  and on the other hand it would be equally unjust wicked and impolitic to make any partial distinction between them and the descendants of the conquered irish who after many years struggle are now at last happily incorpotated and blended with them as one free people  having now examined the opinions of the most eminent writers that have favored this notion of a right in the british parliament to bind the subjects of ireland when especially named i trust it will appear to every impartial reader that such doctrine is so far from having any real foundation to support it that it is really diametrically opposite to some of the most essential foundations of law and is apparently subversive of one of the first principles of the british constitution so that it will be needless for me to take notice of any thing that has been said to the same purpose by inferior writers or by the editors or collectors of law dictionaries etc who have only quoted these great authorities which i have already demonstrated to be erroneous and i may therefore i hope be now allowed to repeat with double satisfaction and certainty what i before asserted only upon general principles in the first part of this declaration viz that the true constitutional mode of connecting british dominions that are otherwise separated by nature is demonstrated by the established example of the union of great britain and ireland which by long experience has proved to be sufficiently effectual p     but notwithstanding that i have already been led to a tedious length of argument by the necessary examination of so many authors i must beg leave still to add some general remarks upon the abovementioned groundless argument drawn from the right of conquest for judge blackstone has been equally unguarded in what he has laid down concerning the american colonies in p  0  of the same volume where he has made a very improper use of this same mistaken notion about the right of conquest  our american plantations says he are principally of this latter sort  viz conquered or ceded countries of which he was treating in the preceding sentence being obtained says he in the last century either by right of conquest and driving out the natives with what natural justice i shall not at present enquire or by treaties and therefore says he the common law of england as such has no allowance or authority there they being no part of the mother country but distinct though dependent dominions but when he reconsiders this part of his work i trust he will allow that the common law of england is principally founded on reason natural justice and the eternal laws of god and consequently all that part of the common law which arises from these foundations must have allowance or authority not only there viz in the english colonies but every where else if the unjust pretensions of tyrants were to be duly restrained by law and equity and with respect to the remaining part of the common law consisting in ancient and approved usages and customs peculiar to english subjects he will not be backward i trust to grant them also allowance or authority there when he is reminded that these conquered countries are not inhabited by the conquered people but chiefly by british subjects successors to the conquerors who are entitled by birthright to the common law of england and every other privilege of englishmen quite as much as those english subjects mentioned by him at the top of the same page for it has been held says he that if an uninhabited country be discovered and planted by english subjects all the english laws then in being which are the birthright of every subject are immediately there in force   com p  0  this doctrine is unquestionable and the more so because allowed by himself and though he has been pleased to add that this must be understood with very many and very great restrictions that such colonists carry with them only so much of the english law as is applicable to their own situation etc yet it must be apparent that if they carry with them any laws at all it most be by virtue of their natural right as englishmen whereby they are certainly as much entitled to all i mean all the english laws that were in being when these several colonies respectively were established and therefore though they used in the infant state of each colony only so much of the english law as was applicable to their own situation and it is absurd to suppose that they would use more whether entitled to it or not yet this does not affect their undoubted right to the whole which right descends to posterity and successors in the same manner as all other inheritances it being indeed their very best inheritance judge blackstone himself has called it in the the very same page the birthright of every subject    and equity surely entitles the increasing colonies continually as occasions may arise from their improvements to the use and benefit of all beneficial laws which were in force at the time of their ancestors emigration  that these however must be understood with some restrictions cannot be denied  as the laws of revenue for instance which the learned gentleman himself has mentioned for these were merely local and cannot therefore be legally enforced in any new dominions without the express assent or grant of the inhabitants in such new dominions the same being absolutely necessary to give them a local effect within the said dominions because nothing but the free grant and assent of the inhabitants and landholders gave them force originally even in the mother country and therefore nothing but the like authority that is the free grant of the inhabitants upon the spot wherever they are introduced can possibly render them legal just and binding in any other part of the world so that it must necessarily appear that no new acquired territories settled by british subjects can legally be taxed by english acts of parliament nor be bound thereby in their internal government without such manifest injustice and iniquity as must necessarily render null and void all such pretended acts for otherwise if they were admitted they would render all the temporal hereditary possessions and property of the subjects in the colonies entirely uncertain which is one of the most odious circumstances in the eye of the law that can be mentioned quod certum est retinendum est quod incertum est dimittendum nay quod incertum est nihil est this is the censure of law upon all the acts of men which fall under the judgment of the law if then the law so judge of the acts of men holding them for naught and void that are incertaine how much more then does the law require certainty in her own acts which are to bind all men the liberty of the subject against the pretended power of impositions by wm hakewil       i have been the more particular as well here as upon orurkes case beforementioned in expressing the necessity of restraining the power of parliament within the bounds of reason justice and natural equity because i find it is too common an error that an act of parliament is omnipotent and that whatever is ordained by parliament must be law without any exception of right or wrong white or black truth or falsehood which god be thanked is very far from being true though the learned commentator judge blackstone upon the very same point the omnipotence of parliament has unguardedly said true it is that what the parliament does no authority upon earth can undo   com p     but that worthy gentleman needs only to be reminded that if it should unfortunately happen from any oversight or misunderstanding that what the parliament does is in the least contrary either to the laws of reason nature pure morality natural equity and justice or to that benevolence this benevolence or due consideration for the natural rights of all mankind is properly called jus gentium the law of nations the law of nations seems to be almost banished at this time from europe the late felonious and arbitrary division of poland between three of the greatest powers in europe the late iniquitous attempts against the ancient republic of venice and the swiss cantons and the late unjust claims upon the free cities of dantzick hamburgh etc the robberies and horrid murders which for these ten years past have been committed by the french on the poor wretched inhabitants of the little island of corsica upon pretense of an unlawful cession of sovereignty from the genoese and the like abominable iniquity upon the like false pretense lately carried on even by the english themselves against the poor helpless charibbs at st vincents  are melancholy proofs either that the europeans in general are most profoundly ignorant of the law of nations or that they are fallen into a state of the must abandoned wiekedness and pofligacy   which universal law as likewise all the other heads abovementioned is necessarily included in what is commonly called natural religion consisting of the primary or eternal laws of god and whatsoever is contrary to any of these is malum in se which no authority on earth can make lawful see note in p     and     and men of all ranks and in all places that have common sense are naturally qualified to distinguish whether laws are deficient in any of these respects or are contrary to reason for the law of reason in an universal law  scribiturque haec lex in cord cujuslibet hominis docens cum quid aegendum et quid fugiendum for which the learned author quotes the epistle to the romans chap   and then proceeds et quod lex rationis in cord scribitur ideo deleri non potest nec etiam recipit mutationem ex loco nec tempore sed ubique et inter omnes homines servari debet nam jura naturalia immutabilia sunt et ratio immutationis est quod recipient naturam rei pro fundamento quae semper eadem est et ubique doct et stud cap   any acts of parliament therefore which are contrary either to nature to justice to morality or to benevolence etc are contrary to reason that ray of the divine nature and supreme law and consequently are null and void being mere corruptions corruptelae and not laws for contra eam

only to our brethren and countrymen but also to our brethren of the universe by the ties of nature or  dly if contrary to the written laws of god secundum fundamentum legis angliae est lex divina etc and if any act of parliament is in any degree contrary to the divine law it has no force in the laws of england suppose for instance an act of parliament should be made to prohibit or annul the marriages of any particular rank or order of men whatsoever the same must necessarily be esteemed null and void of itself because the principle attempted to be established by such an imaginary act is so directly contrary to the laws of god that we may safely rank it with the doctrines of devils see notes on pages     and     which indeed every act of parliament ought to be esteemed that is in any degree contrary to the holy scriptures the written laws of god or contrary to reason the eternal law of god  etiam si aliquod statutum esset editum contra cos nullius vigoris in legibus angliae

want of truth in the recitals see pages     to  00  et issint parliament puit misprender chose et statutes que misrecite chooses et sont refer a eux serront void et null serra conclude per eux issint en notre principal case le statut que recite le plaintiff fuit attaint et confirm ceo ou en fail il ne fuit attaint serra void   if in any of these points it should unfortunately happen i say that what the parliament does is really defective or made contrary thereto the same ought to be holden for none there needs no authority upon earth to undo what is so done for it is null and void of itself notwithstanding the united authority of king lords and commons and whenever any acts have been thus in advertently or too hastily made the most honorable method of getting rid of them is by the same authority to declare them null and void and not merely to repeal them because the latter is not a sufficient reparation to injured justice and truth for as all men are fallible it is disingenuous and highly dishonorable in any man or body of men whatsoever not to acknowledge a mistake or error when the same is fairly demonstrated  the power and jurisdiction of the parliament for making of laws etc is not therefore so transcendent and absolute that it cannot be confined either for causes or persons as supposed by lord coke   inst p    within any bounds since the just bounds and limits of it are so very clearly defined as well as the due bounds of regal power that they fall within the judgment of every man who has common sense to distinguish good from evil or right from wrong so that the imaginary omnipotence of parliament is not only as judge blackstone has declared a figure rather too bold but even totally false and unjust because the parliament is manifestly limited as all powers on earth must be and cannot do every thing that is not naturally impossible though judge blackstone supposes it can   com p     for the power  quia illa potestas potestas juris folius dei est potestas autem injuriae diaboli et non dei et cujus horum opera fecerit rex ejus minister erit cujus opera fecerit igitur dum facit justit am vicarius est regis aeterni minister autem diaboli dum declinet ad

same shall he be esteemed the servant know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness etc romans vi        so that the powers that be cannot bind the conscience when they exceed just limits any more than the threats of a lawless banditti and therefore we may truly say of all the branches of the legislature together i mean their united authority what the ingenious mr sadler said particularly concerning the house of commons viz when they are freeest they have limits for they be not infinite nay when they are most free they are most bound to good orders and to richtreason sadlers rights p      it would be happy for this kingdom if all members of parliament were sensible of these indispensible limitations and therefore though i have thought it my duty to oppose what judge blackstone has unfortunately allowed concerning the imaginary omnipotence of parliament yet i think myself bound most heartily to concur with him in what he has mentioned in the same page  that it is a matter most essential to the liberties of this kingdom that such members be delegated to this important trust as are most eminent for their probity their fortitude and their knowledge for it was a known apophthegm of the great lord treasurer burleigh that england could never be ruined but by a parliament etc  but before i conclude this  d part of my declaration it may perhaps be expected that i should apologize for the tedious length of it and yet when my readers consider that it was necessary for me to answer the assertions of some of the most eminent law writers that this nation perhaps ever produced they will not think their time ill spent i hope in following me through this minute examination of the said assertions especially as they relate to the most important points of the constitution and common law of england and ireland  and i hope also that my readers will not charge me with presumption for having in the course of this argument opposed the opinions of such very respectable writers as baron puffendorf on the civil law and the judges coke vaughan jenkins and blackstone and the hon mr barrington on the laws of england if my remarks should in any part be thought too severe i am sorry for it i can only assure my readers that the least personal disrespect is not intended for i am sufficiently sensible of my own unworthiness and too superficial knowledge in all things and have therefore most carefully avoided any doctrine which may seem to rest merely upon the weak foundation of my own opinion but wherever i have ventured to dissent from the opinions of these approved writers i have assigned plain reasons for it or other proper authorities and i desire to be trusted no farther than these plain reasons and authorities will fairly warrant i hope i may be permitted to use the same apology for pointing out mistakes in the opinions of these very learned writers which the hon mr justice barrington has applied particularly to the institutes and reports of sir edward coke which being says he the best lawchart and implicitly trusted to it is proper to
