richard plantagenet a ndary tale now first published  by mr hull         ho dedication the following legend having been read to a small circle of select friends one lady with great eagerness of manner asked the editor to whom he intended to dedicate it he replied with truth that he had not yet determined to whom added she can you so properly address it as to him whose image cleaves to us during the recital him to whom we owe a livelier idea of richard the third than either historian or painter ever gave him whose judge meant and powers of execution keep pace with the fine imagination of that poet whom he delights to honor these were nearly her exact words and the editor pleads them in excuse for the liberty he now takes of dedicating this poem with great respect and esteem to david garrick esquire  prefatory address the following poem fell into the editors hands by a peculiar means which he is not at present permitted to reveal he hopes the singularity of the story and the moral tendency which so obviously and strongly inculcates the duty of a patient submission to the destinations of providence in all vicissitudes and afflictions of life will justify his giving it to the world he judged it too curious to be utterly lost and his desire to preserve it induced him to collect and scatter in notes throughout the work such curious particulars as in his judgment prove the actual existence of such a person as richard plantagenet and the chief event of his life to have been incontestibly certain  richard plantagenet a legendary tale i the work is done the structure is complete  long may this produce of my humble toil uninjurd stand and echo long repeat round the dear walls benevolence and moyle sir thomas moyle possessor of eastwellplace in the county of kent in the year      gave richard plantagenet who for many years had been his chief bricklayer a piece of ground and permission to build himself a house thereon the poem opens just when richard is supposed to have finished this task eastwellplace has since been in the possession of the earls of winchelsea  ii so richard spoke as he surveyed the dwelling he had raised and in the fullness of his heart his generous patron praised iii him moyle oerheard whose wandering step chance guided had that way the workmans mien he eyed intent then earnest thus did say iv my mind i see misgave me not my doubtings now are clear thou ought not in poor attire have dwelt a menial here v to drudgery and servile toil thou could not be decreed by birth and blood but thereto wrought by hard oerruling need vi is it not so that crimson glow that flushes over thy cheek and downcast eye true answer give and thy tongue need not speak vii often have i marked thee when unseen thou thought thyself by all what time the workman from his task the evening bell did call viii have thou not shunned thy untaught mates and to some secret nook with drooping gait and musing eye thy lonely step betook ix there has not thy attention dwelt upon the lettered page lost as it seemed to all beside like some sequestered sage x and would thou not with eager haste the precious volume hide if sudden some intruders eye thy musings has descried xi often have i deemed thou could explore the greek and roman page and often have yearnd to view the theme that did thy hours engage xii but sorrow greedy grudging coy esteems of mighty price it is treasured cares and to the world the scantiest share denies xiii all as the misers heaped hoards to him alone confined they serve at once to soothe and pain the wretched owners mind xiv me had capricious fortune doomed thine equal in degree long long ere now i had desired to know thine history xv but who their worldly honors wear with meekness chaste and due decline to ask lest the request should bear commandments hue xvi yet now thy tongue has spoke aloud thy grateful piety no longer be thy story kept in painful secrecy xvii give me to know thy dawn of life unfold with simple truth not to thy master but thy friend the promise of thy youth xviii now late in life it is time i ween to give thy labors over thy wellworn implements lay by and drudge and toil no more xix here shall thou find a quiet rest for all thy days to come and every comfort that may serve tendear thy humble home xx have thou a wish a hope to frame beyond this neat abode is there a good a higher bliss by me may be bestowed xxi is there within thine aged breast  the smallest aching void give me to know thy longings all and see them all supplied xxii all i entreat in lieu is this unfold with simple truth not to thy master but thy friend the promise of thy youth xxiii so generous moyle intent bespake the longenduring man the time of richards service at eastwellplace was near sixty years  who raised at length his drooping head and sighing thus began richard plantagenet recites his tale i hard task to any but thyself to tell the story of my birth and treacherous fate or paint the tumults in my breast that swell at recollection of my infant state ii often have i labored to forget my birth and checked remembrance when in cruel wise from times abyss she would the tale draw forth and place my former self before my eyes iii yet i complain not though i feel anew all as i speak fell fortunes bitter spite who once set affluence grandeur in my view then churlish snatched them from my cheated sight iv and yet it may be  is  nay must be best whatever heavens righteous laws for man ordain weak man who lets one sigh invade his breast for earthly grandeur fugitive as vain v perchance contentment had not been my mate if in exalted life my feet had trod or my hands borne in transitory state the victors truncheon or the rulers rod vi my course perchance had been one dazzling glare of splendid pride and i in vain had sought the quiet comforts of this humble sphere rest undisturbed and reasons tranquil thought vii but whither roam i o forgive my kind my honored lord this undesignd delay forgive while in my newawakend mind a thousand vague ideas fondly play viii enough  they are flown  and now my tongue prepares thou source of every good by me possessed to pour a tale into thy wondering ears full at the time of this relation richard is supposed to be nigh fourscore years of age but he did not become acquainted with his own story till he was near twenty probably in his sixteenth or seventeenth year threescore years closelockd within my breast ix of those carewoven longprotracted years some sixteen summers passed obscurely on a stranger to the world its hopes and fears my name birth fortunes to myself unknown x placed in a rural soft serene retreat with a deeplearnd divine i held abode who sought by pious laws and conduct meet the way to immortality and god xi by him instructed i attained the sweet the precious blessings that from learning flow he fanned in my young breast the genial heat that bids the expanding mind with ardor glow xii he taught me with delighted eye to trace the comely beauties of the mantuan page enraptured mix with tullys polished grace or catch the flame of homers martial rage xiii nor stopped he there preceptor excellent nor deemed that wisdom lay in books alone but would explain what moral virtue meant and bid us make our neighbors woes our own xiv heavens genuine pity glistning in his eyes the sweets of charity he would instill and teach what blessedness of comfort lies in universal mercy and good will xv so taught this pious man so thought so did squaring his actions to his tenets true his counsel or relief to none denied a general good like heavens allchearing dew xvi thus guided thus informed thus practicedrawn in guileless peace my spring of life was spent my leisurehours i sported over the lawn nor knew what restless care or sorrow meant xvii a courteous stranger ever and anon my kind instructors due reward supplied but still my name my birth alike unknown wrapped in the gloom of secrecy lay hid xviii one autumnmorn the time i well recall that stranger drew me from my soft retreat and led my footsteps to a lofty hall where state and splendour seemed to hold their seat xix through a long range of spacious gilded rooms dubious i passed admiring as i went on the richwoven labors of the looms the sculptured arch or painted roof intent xx my guide at length withdrew wrapped in suspense and fear i stood yet knew not what i feared when straight to my appalled astounded sense a man of noble port and mien appeared xxi his form commanded and his visage awed my spirit sunk as he advanced nigh with stately step along the floor he trod fixed on my face his penetrating eye xxii the dancing plumage over his front waved high thickstudded ribs of gold adorned his vest in splendid folds his purple robe did ply and royal emblems glittered on his breast xxiii i sought to bend me but my limbs refused their wonted office motionless and chill yet somewhat as the figure i perused a dubious joy did in my mind instill xxiv while thus i cowrd beneath his piercing eye he saw and strove to mitigate my fear softening the frown of harsh austerity in his bold brow which nature grafted there xxv with speeches kind he cheered my sinking heart questioned me much and stroakd my drooping head yet his whole mind he seemed not to impart his looks implied more than his speeches said xxvi a broiderd purse which weighty seemed with gold he gave me then and kindly pressed my hand and thus awhile did stay me in his hold and on my face did meditating stand xxvii his soul worked hugely and his bosom swelled as though some mighty thing he yearnd to say but with indignant pride the thought repelled he started frowned and snatched himself away xxviii my guide returned and reconducted me towered the abode of my preceptor kind a man he seemed of carriage mild and free to whom i thought i might unload my mind xxix without reserve i told him all that passed striving by mine his confidence to gain then my enquiries frank before him cast hoping some knowledge of myself tattain xxx i asked what wondrous cause yet undiscryd urged him his time and zeal for me temploy and why that man of dignity and pride had deigned his notice to a strangerboy xxxi confused yet undispleasd my guide appeared naught he divulged though much he seemed to know save this which he with earnest look averd no obligation youth to me you owe xxxii i do but what my place and duty bid with me no kindreddrops of blood you share yet hard to tell your birth must still be hid enquire no farther  honor bids forbear xxxiii thus he reproved yet did it with a look as though he pitied my sensations keen patient i bowed me to his mild rebuke and pledged obedience with submissive mien xxxiv he left me at my tutors soft abode and parting blessed me by the holy cross my heart waxed sad as he retracd the road and seemed to have sustained some mighty loss xxxv but soon tumultuous thoughts began give way lulled by the voice of my preceptor sage unquiet bosoms he could well allay his looks could soften and his words assuage xxxvi unruly care from him was far removed griefs wildest murmurs at his breath would cease o in his blameless life how well he proved the house of goodness is the house of peace xxxvii here i again enjoyed my sweet repose and taught my heart with pious wisdom filled no more with anxious throb to seek disclose what stubborn fate had doomed to lie concealed xxxviii but long these fond delusions did not last some sterner power my rising life controlled my visionary hopes too swiftly past and left my prospects dreary dark and cold xxxix when rugged march oerrules the growing year have we not seen the morn with treacherous ray shine out awhile then instant disappear and leave to damp and gloom the future day xl so dawned my fate and so deceived my heart nor weaned me from my hopes but cruel tore in one unlookdfor moment bade me part from all my comforts to return no more xli my guide once more arrived though as of late of soft deportment he appeared not now but wild impatience fluttered in his gait and care and thought seemed busy on his brow xlii rise youth he said and mount this rapid steed  i argued not his bidding strait was done proudcrested was the beast of warlike breed armed at all points with rich caparison xliii we commund not  such heat was in our speed scantly would it allow me power of thought till eve deeppainted with a burning red to bosworth in leicestershire bosworth field our panting coursers brought xliv who has not heard of bosworths fatal plain where base adventrers did in compact join against chiefs of prowess high and noble strain and lowrd the crest of yorks imperial line xlv now verging on that memorable ground our course we stayed  yet we alighted not filled with astonishment i gazed around while in my glowing breast my heart grew hot xlvi thickstationd tents extended wide and far to the utmost stretch of sight could i behold and banners fluttering in the whistling air and archers trimly dight and prancers bold xlvii the sinking sun with richlyburnishd glow now to his western chamber made retire while pointed spears quickshifting to and fro seemed all as spiral flames of hottest fire xlviii promiscuous voices filled the floating gale the welkin echoed with the steeds proud neigh the bands often turned and eyed the western vale watching the closure of departing day xlix light vanished now apace and twilight gray with speed unusual mantled all the ground the chieftains to their tents had taken their way and sentinels thickposted watched around l as sable night advanced more and more the mingled voices lessened by degrees sounding at length as round some craggy shore decreasing murmurs of the ebbing seas li now towered the tents awhile we journeyd on with wary pace then lighted on the ground befriended by the stars that shimmring shone and fires that cast a trembling gleam around lii with hasty foot we pressed the dewy sod fit answer making to each stationd guard when full before us as we onward trod a martial form our further progress barred liii he seemed as though he there did listening stand his face deepmuffled in his folded cloak now threw it wide snatched quick my dubious hand and to a neighboring tent his speed betook live with glowing crimson the pavilion shone reflected by the lofty tapers ray the polished armor bright and deft to don beside the royal couch in order lay lv the crown imperial glittered in mine eye with various gems magnificently graced nigh which as meant to guard its dignity a weighty curtelax unsheathed was placed lvi the chief unbonnetted and drew me nigh wrapped in a deepend gloom his face appeared like the dark lowrings of the clouded sky ere the bigbursting tempests voice is heard lvii revenge impatience all that mads the soul all that despair and frenzys flame inspires shown by the tapers in his eyes did roll hot meteors they amid the lesser fires lviii though each dark line i could not truly scan yet through the veil of his distempered mien broke forth a likeness of that lofty man whom whilom at the palace i had seen lix to quell his feelings huge he sternly tried strong combat holding with his fighting soul cresting himself with more than earthly pride as though from power supreme he scorned control lx at length in part subdued his troubled breast on my impatient ear these accents broke i pale and trembling as the attentive priest who waits the inspirings of his mystic oak lxi wonder no more why thou art hither brought the secret of thy birth shall now be shown with glorious ardour be thy bosom fraught for know thou art imperial richards richard the third son lxii thy father i who fold thee in my arms thou royal issue of plantagenet it may not perhaps be unacceptable to some of our readers if we subjoin the etymology of this name which has been borne by several of our english kings george buck esquire compiler of the life of richard the third in kennets history of england says it rather should be called plantagenest being derived from the two words planta genesta or genista that is the plant broom it was first given to fulke earl of anjou who lived an hundred years before the norman conquest he having been guilty of some enormous crimes was enjoined by way of penance to go to the holy land and submit to a severe castigation he readily acquiesced dressed himself in lowly attire and as a mark of humility wore a piece of broom in his cap of which virtue this plant is a symbol in the hyeroglypick language and virgil seems to confirm it by calling it humilis genista the humble broom this expiation finished fulke in remembrance of it adopted the title of plantagenest and lived many years in honor and happiness his descendants accordingly inherited the name and many successive nobles of the line of anjou not only did the same but even distinguished themselves by wearing a sprig of broom in their bonnets  soon as my power has quelled these loud alarms thou shall be known be honored and be great lxiii rise from the ground and dry thy flowing tears to natures dues be other hours assigned beset with foes solicitude and cares far other thoughts must now possess the mind lxiv tomorrow this decisive battle which terminated the contentions between the houses of lancaster and york was fought on monday august   d      this interview consequently was on the preceding sabbathnight boy i combat for my crown to shield from soil my dignity and fame presumptuous richmond henry earl of richmond afterward king henry vii seeks to win renown and on my ruin raise his upstart name lxv he leads yon shallow renegado band strangers to war and hazardous emprize and against the mighty chieftains of the land vain and unskilled a desperate conflict tries lxvi yet since assurance is not given to man nor can even kings command the event of war since peevish chance can foil the subtlest plan of human skill and hurl our schemes in air lxvii tomorrows sun beholds me conqueror or sees me low among the slaughtered lie richard shall never grace a victors car but glorious win the field or glorious die lxviii but thou my son heed and obey my word seek not to mingle in the wild affray far from the winged shaft and gleaming sword patient await the issue of the day lxix north the encampment and action were three miles distant from the town of bosworth and the place obtained the name of bosworth field from that memorable battle camden in his account of leicestershire says the exact place is frequently more and more discovered by pieces of armor weapons and other warlike accoutrements dug up and especially a great many arrowheads were found there of a long large and big proportion far greater than any now in use of our camp there stands a rising mound thy guide awaits to lead thee on the way thence shall thou rule the prospect wide around and view each chance each movement of the fray lxx if righteous fate to me the conquest yield then shall thy noble birth to all be known then boldly seek the center of the field and midst my laurelld bands my son i will own lxxi but if blind chance that seld determines right rob me at once of empire and renown be sure thy fathers eyes are closed in night life were disgrace when chance had reft my crown lxxii no means are left thee then but instant flight in dark concealment must thou veil thy head on richards friends their fellest rage and spite his foes will wreak and fear even richard dead lxxiii begone my son this one embrace away some short reflections claims this awful night ere from the east peep forth the glimmering day my knights attend to arm me for the fight lxxiv once more i knelt he clasped my lifted hands blessed me and seemed to check a struggling tear then led me forth to follow his commands overwhelmed with tenderest grief suspense and fear lxxv what need of more who knows not the event of that dread day that the whole continuance of this action is said to have been but two hours during which the kings personal bravery was astonishingly great despratefoughten field where with his wondrous deeds and prowess spent by numbers overpowrd my sire was killed lxxvi a son no more what course was left to tread to whom apply or whither should i wend back to my tutors roof by instinct led my orphanfootsteps did i pensive bend lxxvii oerruling fate against my wishes wrought that pious man snatched from this frail abode had found the blessing he so long had sought the way to immortality and god lxxviii with flowing eyes i left the sacred door and with relying heart to heaven did bend to god my supplication did i pour to god the mourners best and surest friend lxxix that he would guide me to some safe retreat where daily toil my daily bread might earn where pious peace might soothe ambitions heat and my taught heart sublimer ardor learn lxxx he heard me  all i asked in thee was lent thou liberal proxy of my gracious god thou paidst my industry with rich content and givst my weary age this soft abode richard plantagenet died in december    0 the fourth year of edward the sixths reign aged    consequently he enjoyed his little comfortable retreat barely four years  the following is still to be found in the old register of the parish of eastwell  richard plantagenet was buried the   d day of december    0  this last piece of intelligence was transmitted to the editor by a very sensible and worthy clergyman now living who kindly went from wye to eastwell to collect as many circumstances as he could to confirm the authenticity of this singular story to the transcript of the register he subjoined as follows  it is observable that in the old register there is prefixed to the name of every person of noble blood such a mark as this at the name of richard plantagenet there is the same mark and it is the first that is so distinguished only with this difference that there is a line run across it thus  there is still remaining in eastwellpark the ruin of a building which they say was his house and a well near it which to this day is called plantagenets well  there is also a tomb in the wall of eastwellchurch under which he is said to be buried but it appears to me of much older date  the editor of this poem holds it incumbent on him to return his most grateful thanks to the gentleman who sent him these curious particulars for the trouble he took and the politeness of his letter the whole of which he should be proud to make public together with the name could he presume such a liberty to be warrantable  the editor conjectures the line which is mentioned to run across the mark of nobility to be what is styled in heraldry the bar of bastardy    lxxxi the work is done the structure is complete  long may the produce of my humble toil uninjurd stand and echo long repeat round the dear walls benevolence and moyle finis
