the conference a poem by c churchill  london printed for g kearsly opposite st martins church ludgate street j coote in paternoster row w flexney near graysinn gate holborn c henderson at the royal exchange j gardener in charlesstreet westminster and j almon in piccadilly mdcclxiii  the conference grace said in form which skeptics must agree when they are told that grace was said by me the servants gone to break the scurvy jest on the proud landlord and his threadbare guest the king gone round my lady too withdrawn my lord in usual taste began to yawn and lolling backward in his elbowchair with an insipid kind of stupid stare picking his teeth twirling his seals about  churchill you have a poem coming out you have my best wishes but i really fear your muse in general is too severe her spirit seems her interest to oppose and where she makes one friend makes twenty foes c your lordships fears are just i feel their force but only feel it as thing of course the man whose hardy spirit shall engage to lash the vices of a guilty age at his first setting forward ought to know that every rogue he meets must be his foe that the rude breath of satire will provoke many who feel and more who fear the stroke but shall the partial rage of selfish men from stubborn justice wrench the righteous pen or shall i not my settled course pursue because my foes are foes to virtue too l what is this boasted virtue taught in schools and idly drawn from antiquated rules what is her use point out one wholesome end will she hurt foes or can she make a friend when from long fasts fierce appetites arise can this same virtue stifle natures cries can she the pittance of a meal afford or bid thee welcome to one great mans board when northern winds the rough december arm with frost and snow can virtue keep thee warm can thou dismiss the hard unfeeling dun barely by saying thou art virtues son or by base blundring statesmen sent to jail will mansfield take this virtue for thy bail believe it not the name is in disgrace virtue and temple now are out of place quit then this meteor whose delusive ray from wealth and honor leads thee far astray true virtue means let reason use her eyes nothing with fools and interest with the wise would thou be great her patronage disclaim nor madly triumph in so mean a name let nobler wreaths thy happy brows adorn and leave to virtue poverty and scorn let prudence be thy guide who does not know how seldom prudence can with virtue go to be successful try thy utmost force and virtue follows as a thing of course hirco who knows not hirco stains the bed of that kind master who first gave him bread scatters the seeds of discord through the land breaks every public every private band beholds with joy a trusting friend undone betrays a brother and would cheat a son what mortal in his senses can endure the name of hirco for the wretch is poor let him hang drown starve on a dunghill rot by all detested live and die forgot let him a poor return in every breath feel all deaths pains yet be whole years in death is now the general cry we all pursue let fortune change and prudence changes too supple and pliant a new system feels throws up her cap and spaniels at his heels long live great hirco cries by interest taught and let his foes though i prove one be naught c peace to such men if such men can have peace let their possessions let their state increase let their base services in courts strike root and in the season bring forth golden fruit i envy not let those who have the will and with so little spirit so much skill with such vile instruments their fortunes carve rogues may grow fat an honest man dares starve l these stale conceits thrown off let us advance for once to real life and quit romance starve pretty talking but i fain would view that man that honest man would do it too hence to yon mountain which outbraves the sky and dart from pole to pole thy strengthened eye through all that space you shall not view one man not one who dares to act on such a plan cowards in calms will say what in a storm the brave will tremble at and not perform thine be the proof and spite of all you have said you would give your honor for a crust of bread c what proof might do what hunger might effect what famished nature looking with neglect on all she once held dear what fear at strife with fainting virtue for the means of life might make this coward flesh in love with breath shuddring at pain and shrinking back from death in treason to my soul descend to bear trusting to fate i neither know nor care once at this hour those wounds afresh i feel which nor prosperity nor time can heal those wounds which fate severely has decreed mentioned or thought of must for ever bleed those wounds which humbled all that pride of man which brings such mighty aid to virtues plan once awed by fortunes most oppressive frown by legal rapine to the earth bowed down my credit at last gasp my state undone trembling to meet the shock i could not shun virtue gave ground and blank despair prevailed sinking beneath the storm my spirits failed like peters faith till one a friend indeed may all distress find such in time of need one kind good man in act in word in thought by virtue guided and by wisdom taught image of him whom christians should adore stretched forth his hand and brought me safe to shore since by good fortune into notice raised and for some little merit largely praised indulged in swerving from prudential rules hated by rogues and not beloved by fools placed above want shall abject thirst of wealth so fiercely war against my souls dearest health that as a boon i should base shackles crave and born to freedom make myself a slave that i should in the train of those appear whom honor cannot love nor manhood fear that i no longer skulk from street to street afraid least duns assail and bailiffs meet that i from place to place this carcass bear walk forth at large and wander free as air that i no longer dread the awkward friend whose very obligations must offend nor all too froward with impatience burn at suffering favors which i cannot return that from dependence and from pride secure i am not placed so high to scorn the poor nor yet so low that i my lord should fear or hesitate to give him sneer for sneer that whilst sage prudence my pursuits confirms i can enjoy the world on equal terms that kind to others to myself most true feeling no want i comfort those who do and with the will have power to aid distress these and what other blessings i possess from the indulgence of the public rise all private patronage my soul defies by candor more inclined to save than damn a generous public made me what i am all that i have they gave just memory bears the grateful stamp and what i am is theirs l to feign a redhot zeal for freedoms cause to mouth aloud for liberties and laws for public good to bellow all abroad serves well the purposes of private fraud prudence by public good intends her own if you mean otherwise you stand alone what do we mean by country and by court what is it to oppose what to support mere words of course and what is more absurd than to pay homage to an empty word majors and minors differ but in name patriots and ministers are much the same the only difference after all their rout is that the one is in the other out explore the dark recesses of the mind in the souls honest volume read mankind and own in wise and simple great and small the same grand leading principle in all whatever we talk of wisdom to the wise of goodness to the good of public ties which to our country link of private bands which claim most dear attention at our hands for parent and for child for wife and friend our first great mover and our last great end is one and by whatever name we call the ruling tyrant self is all in all this which unwilling faction shall admit guided in different ways a bute and pit made tyrants break made kings observe the law and gave the world a stuart and nassau has nature strange and wild conceit of pride distinguished thee from all her sons beside does virtue in thy bosom brighter glow or from a spring more pure does action flow is not thy soul bound with those very chains which shackle us or is that self which reigns over kings and beggars which in all we see most strong and sovereign only weak in thee fond man believe it not experience tells it is not thy virtue but thy pride rebels think and for once lay by thy lawless pen think and confess thyself like other men think but one hour and to thy conscience led by reasons hand bow down and hang thy head think on thy private life recall thy youth view thyself now and own with strictest truth that self has drawn thee from fair virtues way farther than folly would have dared to stray and that the talents liberal nature gave to make thee free have made thee more a slave quit then in prudence quit that idle train of toys which have so long abused thy brain and captive led thy powers with boundless will let self maintain her state and empire still but let her with more worthy objects caught strain all the faculties and force of thought to things of higher daring let her range through better pastures and learn how to change let her no longer to weak faction tied wisely revolt and join our stronger side c ah what my lord has private life to do with things of public nature why to view would you thus cruelly those scenes unfold which without pain and horror to behold must speak me something more or less than man which friends may pardon but i never can look back a thought which borders on despair which human nature must yet cannot bear it is not the babbling of a busy world where praise and censure are at random hurled which can the meanest of my thoughts control or shake one settled purpose of my soul free and at large might their wild curses roam if all if all alas were well at home no  it is the tale which angry conscience tells when she with more than tragic horror swells each circumstance of guilt when stern but true she brings bad actions forth into review and like the dread handwriting on the wall bids late remorse awake at reasons call armed at all points bids scorpion vengeance pass and to the mind holds up reflexions glass the mind which starting heaves the heartfelt groan and hates that form she knows to be her own enough of this  let private sorrows rest  as to the public i dare stand the test dare proudly boast i feel no wish above the good of england and my countrys love stranger to partyrage by reasons voice unerring guide directed in my choice not all the tyrant powers of earth combined no nor of hell shall make me change my mind what herd with men my honest soul disdains men who with servile zeal are forging chains for freedoms neck and lend a helping hand to spread destruction over my native land what shall i not even to my latest breath in the full face of danger and of death exert that little strength which nature gave and boldy stem or perish in the wave l when i look backward for some fifty years and see protesting patriots turned to peers hear men most loose for decency declaim and talk of character without a name see infidels assert the cause of god and meek divines wield persecutions rod see men transformed to brutes and brutes to men see whitehead take a place ralph change his pen i mock the zeal and deem the men in sport who rail at ministers and curse a court thee haughty as thou art and proud in rhyme shall some preferment offered at a time when virtue sleeps some sacrifice to pride or some fair victim move to change thy side thee shall these eyes behold to health restored using as prudence bids bold satires sword galling thy present friends and praising those whom now thy frenzy holds thy greatest foes c may i can worse disgrace on manhood fall be born a whitehead and baptized a paul may i though to his service deeply tied by sacred oaths and now by will allied with false feigned zeal an injured god defend and use his name for some base private end may i that thought bids double horrors roll over my sick spirits and unmans my soul ruin the virtue which i held most dear and still must hold may i through abject fear betray my friend may to succeeding times engraved on plates of adamant my crimes stand blazing forth whilst marked with envious blot each little act of virtue is forgot of all those evils which to stamp men cursed hell keeps in store for vengeance may the worst light on my head and in my day of woe to make the cup of bitterness overflow may i be scorned by every man of worth wander like cain a vagabond on earth bearing about a hell in my own mind or be to scotland for my life confined if i am one amongst the many known whom shelburne fled and calcraft blushed to own l do you reflect what men you make your foes c i do and that is the reason i oppose friends i have made whom envy must commend but not one foe whom i would wish a friend what if ten thousand butes and foxes bawl one wilkes has made a large amends for all it is not the title whether handed down from age to age or flowing from the crown in copious streams on recent men who came from stems unknown and sires without a name it is not the star which our great edward gave to mark the virtuous and reward the brave blazing without whilst a base heart within is rotten to the core with filth and sin it is not the tinsel grandeur taught to wait at customs call to mark a fool of state from fools of lesser note that soul can awe whose pride is reason whose defense is law l suppose a thing scarce possible in art were it thy cue to play a common part suppose thy writings so well fenced in law that n   cannot find nor make a flaw have thou not heard that amongst our ancient tribes by party warpt or lulled asleep by bribes or trembling at the ruffian hand of force law has suspended stood or changed its course art thou assured that for destruction ripe thou may not smart beneath the selfsame gripe what sanction have thou frantic in thy rimes thy life thy freedom to secure c the times it is not on law a system great and good by wisdom penned and bought by noblest blood my faith relies by wicked men and vain law once abused may be abused again  no on our great lawgiver i depend who knows and guides them to their proper end whose royalty of nature blazes out so fierce twere sin to entertain a doubt  did tyrant stuarts now the laws dispense blessed be the hour and hand which sent them hence for something or for nothing for a word or thought i might be doomed to death unheard life we might all resign to lawless power nor think it worth the purchase of an hour but envy never shall fix so foul a stain on the fair annals of a brunswicks reign if slave to party to revenge or pride if by frail human error drawn aside i break the law strict rigor let her wear it is here is to punish and it is mine to bear nor by the voice of justice doomed to death would i ask mercy with my latest breath but anxious only for my countrys good in which my kings of course is understood formed on a plan with some few patriot friends whilst by just means i aim at noblest ends my spirits cannot sink though from the tomb stern jeffries should be placed in mansfields room though he should bring his base designs to aid some black attorney for his purpose made and shove whilst decency and law retreat the modest norton from his maiden seat though both in ill confedrates should agree in damned league to torture law and me whilst george is king i cannot fear endure not to be guilty is to be secure but when in aftertimes be far removed that day our monarch glorious and beloved sleeps with his fathers should imperious fate in vengeance with fresh stuarts curse our state should they oerleaping every fence of law butcher the brave to keep tame fools in awe should they by brutal and oppressive force divert sweet justice from her even course should they of every other means bereft make my right hand a witness against my left should they abroad by inquisitions taught search out my soul and damn me for a thought still would i keep my course still speak still write till death had plunged me in the shades of night thou god of truth thou great allsearching eye to whom our thoughts our spirits open lie grant me thy strength and in that needful hour should it ever come when law submits to power with firm resolves my steady bosom steel bravely to suffer though i deeply feel let me as hitherto still draw my breath in love with life but not in fear of death and if oppression brings me to the grave and marks him dead she never shall mark a slave let no unworthy marks of grief be heard no wild laments not one unseemly word let sober triumphs wait upon my bier i will not forgive that friend who drops one tear whether he is ravished in lifes early morn or in old age drops like an ear of corn full ripe he falls on natures noblest plan who lives to reason and who dies a man finis
