rosina a comic opera in two acts performed at the theater royal in covent garden  dublin printed by b smith for the company of booksellers mdcclxxxiii  advertisement the favorable reception this little piece has met with from the public demands my warmest acknowledgments nor can i say too much of the support it has received both from the music admirably adapted to the words and the spirited and judicious performance of the several characters which surpassed my most sanguine wishes  the decorations designed and executed in that style of elegant and characteristic simplicity which the subject required add greatly to the effect of the whole  the fable of this piece taken from the book of ruth a fable equally simple moral and interesting has already furnished a subject for the beautiful episode of palemon and lavinia in thomsons seasons and a pleasing opera of mons favart of both i have availed myself as far as the difference of my plan would allow but as we are not however extraordinary it may appear so easily satisfied with mere sentiment as our more sprightly neighbors the french i found it necessary to diversify the story by adding the comic characters of william and phoebe which i hoped might at once relieve and heighten the sentimental cast of the other personages of the drama  some of the songs and a few short passages of the dialogue printed with inverted commas though judiciously omitted in the representation from the apprehension of making the opera too long are here restored as tending to mark the characters with more precision  dramatis personae mr belville mr bannister captain belville mr brett william mrs kennedy rustic mr davies   st irishman mr mahon   d irishman mr egan reaper mr helm rosina mrs bannister dorcas mrs pit phoebe mrs martyr

and falls into a natural basin below on the right side a cottage at the door of which is a bench of stone at a distance a chain of mountains the manorhouse in view a field of corn fills up the scene in the first act the sky clears by degrees the morning vapor disperses the sun rises and at the end of the act is above the horizon at the beginning of the second he is past the height and declines till the end of the day this progressive motion should be made imperceptibly but its effect should be visible through the two acts act i scene   the day begins to break a few stars still appear after the trio the sun is seen to rise the door of the cottage is open a lamp burning just within dorcas seated on the bench is spinning rosina and phoebe just within the door are measuring a bushel of corn william comes from the top of the stage they sing the following trio william rosina phoebe when the rosy morn appearing paints with gold the verdant lawn bees on banks of thyme disporting sip the sweets and hail the dawn warbling birds the day proclaiming carol sweet the lively strain they forsake their leafy dwelling to secure the golden grain see content the humble gleaner take the scattered ears that fall nature all her children viewing kindly bounteous cares for all     william retires ros see my dear dorcas what we gleaned yesterday in mr belvilles fields  coming forward and showing

labor and toil whilst the moon plays yon branches among by her beams without blushing i hear him complain and believe every word of his song you know not how sweet it is to love the dear swain whilst the moon plays yon branches among   during the last stanza william appears at the end of the scene and makes signs to phoebe who when it is finished steals softly to him and they disappear ros how small a part of my evils is poverty and how little does phoebe know the heart she thinks insensible the heart which nourishes a hopeless passion i blessed like others belvilles gentle virtues and knew
