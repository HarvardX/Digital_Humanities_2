official letters messages and public papers continued     public papers continued john adams   november      paris to secretary livingston paris   november      sir— in one of your letters you suppose that i have an open avowed contempt of all rank give me leave to say you are much mistaken in my sentiments there are times and i have often seen such when a mans duty to his country demands of him the sacrifice of his rank as well as his fortune and life but this must be an epoch and for an object worthy of the sacrifice in ordinary times the same duty to his country obliges him to contend for his rank as the only means indeed sometimes by which he can do service and the sacrifice would injure his country more than himself when the world see a man reduced to the necessity of giving up his rank merely to serve the public they will respect him and his opinions will have the more weight for it but when the same world see a man yield his rank for the sake of holding a place he becomes ridiculous this you may depend upon it will not be my case ranks titles and etiquettes and every species of punctilios even down to the visits of cards are of infinitely more importance in europe than in america and therefore congress cannot be too tender of disgracing their ministers abroad in any of these things nor too determined not to disgrace themselves congress will sooner or later find it necessary to adjust the rank of all their servants with relation to one another as well as to the magistrates and officers of the separate governments   for example if when congress abolished my commission to the king of great britain and my commission for peace and issued a new commission for peace in which they associated four other gentlemen with me they had placed any other at the head of the commission they would have thrown a disgrace and ridicule upon me in europe that i could not have withstood it would have injured me in the minds of friends and enemies the french and dutch as well as the english it is the same thing with states if mr jay and i had yielded the punctilio of rank and taken the advice of the count de vergennes and dr franklin by treating with the english or spaniards before we were put upon the equal footing that our rank demanded we should have sunk in the minds of the english french spaniards dutch and all the neutral powers the count de vergennes certainly knows this if he does not he is not even a european statesman if he does know it what inference can we draw but that he means to keep us down if he can to keep his hand under our chin to prevent us from drowning but not to lift our heads out of water the injunctions upon us to communicate and to follow the advice that is given us seem to be too strong and too universal understood with reasonable limitations and restrictions they may do very well for example i wrote a speculation and caused it to be printed in the courier du bas rhin showing the interest policy and humanity of the neutral confederations acknowledging american independence and admitting the united states to subscribe to the principles of their marine treaty this was reprinted in the gazette of leyden the politique hollandais the courier de leurope and all the dutch gazettes at the same time i caused to be transmitted to england some pieces on the same subject and further showing the probability that the neutral powers might adopt this measure and the impolicy of great britain in permitting all the powers of europe to get the start of her and having more merit with america than she by acknowledging her independence first these pieces were printed in the english papers in the form of letters to the earl of shelburne and can never be controverted because they are in writing and in print with their dates these fears thus excited added to our refusal to treat on an unequal footing probably produced his lordships resolution to advise   the king to issue the commission under the great seal to mr oswald by which great britain has got the start and gone to the windward of the other european powers no man living but myself knew that all these speculations in various parts of europe came from me would it do for me to communicate all this to the french ministers is it possible for me to communicate all these things to congress believe me it is not and give me leave to say it will not do to communicate them to my friend the chevalier de la luzerne nor my friend m marbois if they should be long letters will lay all open to the count de vergennes who i assure you i do not believe will assist me or anybody else in such measures of serving our country when the french ministers in america or europe communicate every thing to us we may venture to be equally communicative with them but when every thing is concealed from us more cautiously than it is from england we shall do ourselves injustice if we are not upon our guard if we conduct ourselves with caution prudence moderation and firmness we shall succeed in every great point but if congress or their ministers abroad suffer themselves to be intimidated by threats slanders or insinuations we shall be duped out of the fishery the mississippi much of the western lands compensation to the tories and penobscot at least if not kennebec this is my solemn opinion and i will never be answerable to my country posterity or my own mind for the consequences that might happen from concealing it it is for the determinate purpose of carrying these points that one man who is submission itself is puffed up to the top of jacobs ladder in the clouds and every other man depressed to the bottom of it in the dust this is my opinion if it is a crime to hold this opinion let me be punished for it for assuredly i am guilty with great respect c john adams john adams    november      paris to secretary livingston paris    november      sir— on my first arrival at paris i found my colleagues engaged in conferences with mr oswald they had been   before chiefly conducted by mr jay dr franklin having been mostly confined for three months by a long and painful illness at this time however he was so much better although still weak and lame as to join us in most of the subsequent conferences and we were so constantly engaged forenoon afternoon and evening that i had not been out to versailles nor anywhere else on saturday last the marquis de lafayette called upon me and told me he had been to versailles and the count de vergennes had said to him that he had been informed by the returns of the police that i was in paris but not officially and he should take it well if i would come to see him i went out to dine with dr franklin the same day who had just returned from delivering his memorial and repeated to me the same message i said to both i would go the next morning and accordingly on sunday the  th i went to make my court to his excellency he received me politely and asked me questions about our progress i answered him that the english minister appeared to me to divide with us upon ostensible points that i still doubted his intentions to make a universal peace that the cry of the nation was for something to be done or said with the american ministers and to satisfy this the king of great britain had been advised to be the third power in europe to acknowledge our independence as this was a royal act under the great seal of his kingdom it could never be denied or revoked but still it did not render the nation unanimous and to avoid finally disgusting any great party the minister would still pursue his usual studied obscurity of policy points must be conceded to the americans before a complete agreement could be made with them even on terms to be inserted in the universal peace which would open the full cry of a powerful party upon him among which were the refugees it could not be supposed that the refugees and penobscot were such points with the nation or minister that they would continue the war for them only if they were ready to strike with france spain and holland the count then asked me some questions respecting sagadahoc which i answered by showing him the records which i had in my pocket particularly that of governor pownalls solemn   act of possession in      the grants and settlements of mount desert machias and all the other townships east of penobscot river the original grant of james i to sir william alexander of nova scotia in which it is bounded on st croix river this grant i had in latin french and english the dissertations of governor shirley and governor hutchinson and the authority of governor bernard all showing the right of massachusetts to this tract to be incontestable i added that i did not think any british minister would ever put his hand to a written claim of that tract of land their own national acts were so numerous and so clear against them the count said mr fitzherbert had told him that it was for the masts that a point was made of that tract but the count said canada was an immense resource for masts i said there were so few masts there that this could not be the motive that the refugees were still at the bottom of this several of them had pretensions to lands in sagadahoc and the rest hoped for grants there the count said it was not at all surprising that the british ministry should insist upon compensation to the tories for that all the precedents were in their favor in the case of the united provinces with spain all were restored to their possessions and that there never had been an example of such an affair terminated by treaty but all were restored he said it was a point well settled by precedents i begged his excellencys pardon for this and thought there was no precedent in point a restitution of an estate not alienated although confiscated to a crown or state could not be a precedent in point because in our case these estates had not only been confiscated but alienated by the state so that it was no longer in the power of the state to restore them and when you come to the question of compensation there is every argument of national honor dignity of the state public and private justice and humanity for us to insist upon a compensation for all the plate negroes rice and tobacco stolen and houses and substance consumed as there is for them to demand compensation to the tories and this was so much the stronger in our favor as our sufferers were innocent people and theirs guilty ones m rayneval who was present said something about the king and nation being bound to support their adherents i answered that i could not comprehend this doctrine here was   a set of people whose bad faith and misrepresentations had deceived the king and deluded the nation to follow their alldevouring ambition until they had totally failed of their object had brought an indelible reproach on the british name and almost irretrievable ruin on the nation and yet that nation is bound to support their deceivers and ruiners if the national honor was bound at all it was bound still to follow their ambition to conquer america and plant the refugees there in pomp and power and in such case we all know whose estates would be confiscated and what compensation would be obtained all this m rayneval said was very true the count asked me to dine which i accepted and was treated with more attention and complaisance than ever both by him and the countess as it is our duty to penetrate if we can the motives and views of our allies as well as our enemies it is worth while for congress to consider what may be the true motives of these intimations in favor of the tories history shows that nations have generally had as much difficulty to arrange their affairs with their allies as with their enemies france has had as much this war with spain as with england holland and england whenever they have been allies have always found many difficulties and from the nature of things it must ever be an intricate task to reconcile the notions prejudices principles c of two nations in one concert of counsels and operations we may well think that the french would be very glad to have the americans join with them in a future war suppose for example they should think the tories men of monarchical principles or men of more ambition than principle or men corrupted and of no principle and should therefore think them more easily seduced to their purposes than virtuous republicans is it not easy to see the policy of a french minister in wishing them amnesty and compensation suppose that a french minister foresees that the presence of the tories in america will keep up perpetually two parties a french and an english party and that this will compel the patriotic and independent men to join the french side is it not natural for him to wish them restored is it not easy too to see that a french minister cannot wish to have the english and americans perfectly agreed upon all points before they themselves the spanish and the   dutch are agreed too can they be sorry then to see us split upon such a point as the tories what can be their motives to become the advocates of the tories it seems the french minister at philadelphia has made some representations to congress in favor of a compensation to the royalists and that the count de vergenness conversation with me was much in favor of it the count probably knows that we are instructed against it and that congress are instructed against it or rather have not a constitutional authority to make it that we can only write about it to congress and they to the states who may and probably will deliberate upon it a year or eighteen months before they all decide and then every one of them will determine against it in this way there is an insuperable obstacle to any agreement between the english and americans even upon terms to be inserted in the general peace before all are ready and indeed after it has been upon former occasions the constant practice of the french to have some of their subjects in london and the english some of theirs in paris during conferences for peace in order to propagate such sentiments as they wished to prevail i doubt not such are there now m rayneval has certainly been there it is reported i know not how truly that m gerard has been there and probably others are there who can easily prompt the tories to clamor and to cry that the kings dignity and the nations honor are compromised to support their demands america has been long enough involved in the wars of europe she has been a football between contending nations from the beginning and it is easy to foresee that france and england both will endeavor to involve us in their future wars it is our interest and duty to avoid them as much as possible and to be completely independent and to have nothing to do with either of them but in commerce my poor thoughts and feeble efforts have been from the beginning constantly employed to arrange all our european connections to this end and will continue to be so employed whether they succeed or not my hopes of success are stronger now than they ever have been because i find mr jay precisely in the same sentiments after all the observations and reflections he has made in europe and dr franklin at last at least appears to coincide with us we are all three perfectly united in the affair of the tories and of sagadahoc  0 the only points in which the british minister pretends to differ from us the inclosed papers will show congress the substance of the negotiation the treaty as first projected between mr oswald on one side and dr franklin and mr jay on the other before my arrival the treaty as projected after my arrival between mr oswald and the three american ministers my lord shelburne having disagreed to the first mr oswalds letter and our answer mr stracheys letter and our answer mr strachey has gone to london with the whole and we are waiting his return or the arrival of some other with further instructions if congress should wish to know my conjecture it is that the ministry will still insist upon compensation to the tories and thus involve the nation every month of the war in an expense sufficient to make a full compensation to all the tories in question they would not do this however if they were ready with france and spain  i have the honor to be c john adams henry laurens    november      london john adams henry laurens to john adams london    november      dear sir— an untoward circumstance had hurried me from bath where i had been about a month in the progress of health i was waiting the determination of this court whether i might upon terms consistent with my honor return and continue in the same pursuit during the winter months or be obliged at all hazards to withdraw immediately from the kingdom in this dilemma i had this afternoon the honor of receiving your letter of the  th instant accompanied by an act of congress of the   th september my country enjoins and condescends to desire i must therefore also at all hazards to myself obey and comply diffident as i am of my own abilities i shall as speedily as possible proceed and join my colleagues for the rest the wound is deep but i apply to myself the consolation which i administered to the father of the brave    colonel parker—thank god i had a son who dared to die in defence of his country my dear friend adieu henry laurens john adams    november      paris to secretary livingston paris    november      the instruction from congress which directs us to pay so strict an attention to the french ministry and to follow their advice is conceived in terms so universal and unlimited as to give a great deal of anxiety to my mind there is no man more impressed with the obligation of obedience to instructions but in ordinary cases the principal is so near the deputy as to be able to attend to the whole progress of the business and to be informed of every new fact and every sudden thought ambassadors in europe can send expresses to their courts and give and receive intelligence in a few days with the utmost certainty in such cases there is no room for mistake misunderstanding or surprise but in our case it is very different we are at an immense distance despatches are liable to foul play and vessels are subject to accidents new scenes open the time presses various nations are in suspense and necessity forces us to act what can we do if a french minister advises us to cede to the spaniards the whole river of the mississippi and five hundred miles of territory to the eastward of it are we bound by our instruction to put our signature to the cession when the english themselves are willing we should extend to the river and enjoy our natural right to its navigation if we should be counselled to relinquish our right to the fishery on the grand bank of newfoundland when the british ministry are ready by treaty to acknowledge our right to it are we obliged to relinquish it if we are advised to restore and compensate the tories are we to comply if we know or have reason to believe that things which will have weight upon the minds of the british ministry against us upon some points will be communicated to them in some way or other secret or open if we communicate them to this court are we bound to do it i cannot think that a construction so literal and severe was ever intended to be put upon it and therefore i see no way of    doing my duty to congress but to interpret the instruction as we do all general precepts and maxims by such restrictions and limitations as reason necessity and the nature of things demand it may sometimes be known to a deputy that an instruction from his principal was given upon information of mistaken facts what is he to do when he knows that if the truth had been known his principal would have given a directly contrary order is he to follow that which issued upon mistake when he knows or has only good reason to believe that if his principal were on the spot and fully informed of the present state of facts he would give contrary directions is he bound by such as were given before it cannot be denied that instructions are binding that it is a duty to obey them and that a departure from them cannot be justified but i think it cannot be denied on the other hand that in our peculiar situation cases may happen in which it might become our duty to depend upon being excused or if you will pardoned for presuming that if congress were upon the spot they would judge as we do i presume not to dictate nor to advise but i may venture to give my opinion as i do freely and with much real concern for the public that it would be better if every instruction in being were totally repealed which enjoins upon any american minister to follow or ask the advice or even to communicate with any french or other minister or ambassador in the world it is an inextricable embarrassment everywhere advice would not be more seldom asked nor communication less frequent it would be more freely given a communication of information or a request of counsel would then be received as a compliment and a mark of respect it is now considered as a duty and a right your ministers would have more weight and be the more respected through the world congress cannot do too much to give weight to their own ministers for they may depend upon it great and unjustifiable pains are taken to prevent them from acquiring reputation and even to prevent an idea taking root in any part of europe that any thing has been or can be done by them and there is nothing that humbles and depresses nothing that shackles and confines in short nothing that renders totally useless all your ministers in europe so much as these positive instructions to consult and communicate    with french ministers upon all occasions and to follow their advice and i really think it would be better to constitute the count de vergennes our sole minister and give him full powers to make peace and treat with all europe than to continue any of us in the service under the instructions in being if they are to be understood in that unlimited sense which some persons contend for i hope that nothing indecent has escaped me upon this occasion if any expressions appear too strong the great importance of the subject and the deep impression it has made on my mind and heart must be my apology with great respect and esteem c john adams john adams    november      paris jan willink to messrs willink and others paris    november      gentlemen— your favor of   th instant is this moment come to hand m le couteulx and mr grand called upon me last evening upon the same subject i told them both what i now repeat to you—that i have no right power or authority whatsoever to give any orders directions or advice in this matter mr morris alone having the authority of congress to dispose of the money but if my opinion as a man and a private citizen would give them any satisfaction it was that m le couteulx should draw upon you at present only for one million of florins and leave the rest after mr grand shall have drawn out the four hundred thousand livres for the interest of the money borrowed by the king of france in holland to pay the drafts of mr morris as they may arrive or to be paid hereafter to m le couteulx or mr grand according as necessities may appear there was no copy of mr morriss letter inclosed in yours to me i should be glad if mr dumas would hasten in all the accounts of repairs to the house and let them be paid off i know not when the obstructions to trade will all be removed by a peace but if the nations of the armed neutrality should all follow the example of the king of great britain in acknowledging our independence and protect their own ships in going    and coming to and from our ports i think the impediments to trade between holland and america would be lessened i have the honor to be c john adams john adams    november      paris to secretary livingston paris    november      sir— we live in critical moments parliament is to meet and the kings speech will be delivered on the   th if the speech announces mr oswalds commission and the two houses in their answers thank him for issuing it and there should be no change in the ministry the prospect of peace will be flattering or if there should be a change in the ministry and the duke of portland with mr fox and mr burke should come in it will be still more so but if richmond camden keppel and townshend should retire and my lord north and company come in with or without the earl of shelburne the appearances of peace will be very unpromising my lord north indeed cannot revoke the acknowledgment of our independence and would not probably renounce the negotiations for peace but illwill to us is so habitual to him and his master that he would fall in earnestly with the wingclipping system join in attempts to deprive us of the fisheries and the mississippi and to fasten upon us the tories and in every other measure to cramp stint impoverish and enfeeble us shelburne is not so orthodox as he should be but north is a much greater heretic in american politics it deserves much consideration what course we should take in case the old ministry should come in wholly or in part it is certain at present that to be obnoxious to the americans and their ministers is a very formidable popular cry against any minister or candidate for the ministry in england for the nation is more generally for recovering the goodwill of the americans than they ever have been nothing would strike such a blow to any ministry as to break off the negotiations for peace if the old ministry come in they will demand terms of us at first probably that we can never agree to it is now eleven or twelve days since the last result of our conferences was laid before the ministry in london mr vaughan went off on sunday noon the   th so that he is    no doubt before this time with my lord shelburne he is possessed of an ample budget of arguments to convince his lordship that he ought to give up all the remaining points between us  mr oswalds letters will suggest the same arguments in a different light and mr strachey if he is disposed to do it is able to enlarge upon them all in conversation the fundamental point of the sovereignty of the united states being settled in england the only question now is whether they shall pursue a contracted or a liberal a goodnatured or an illnatured plan towards us if they are generous and allow us all we ask it will be the better for them if stingy the worse that france does not wish them to be very noble to us may be true but we should be dupes indeed if we did not make use of every argument with them to show them that it is their interest to be so and they will be the greatest bubbles of all if they should suffer themselves to be deceived by their passions or by any arts to adopt an opposite tenor of conduct i have the honor to be c john adams john adams   december      paris benjamin franklin to benjamin franklin paris   december      sir— the moments we live in are critical and may be improved perhaps to advantage for which purpose i beg leave to propose to your consideration whether it is not proper for us to write to mr dana at petersburg acquaint him with the signatures of the preliminaries inclose to him an authentic copy of them and advise him to communicate it to the ministers of the empress and to all the ministers of the neutral powers at her court together with a copy of his commission to subscribe to the principles of the armed neutrality the present seems to me the most proper time for this step the united states are as much interested in the marine treaty as any power and if we take this step we may with propriety    propose if not insist upon an article in the definitive treaty respecting this matter which will be as agreeable to france and spain as to the united provinces i have heretofore mentioned to mr jay a similar proposal who approved and i will propose it again today to him and mr laurens if you approve the measure you will be so good as to order an authentic copy to be made of the preliminary treaty that we may prepare a letter the first time we meet i have the honor to be c c john adams john adams   december      paris to secretary livingston paris   december      sir— it is with much pleasure that i transmit you the preliminary treaty between the king of great britain and the united states of america the mississippi the western lands sagadahoc and the fisheries are secured as well as we could and i hope what is done for the refugees will be pardoned  as the objects for which i ever consented to leave my family and country are thus far accomplished i now beg leave to resign all my employments in europe they are soon enumerated—the first is the commission to borrow money in holland and the second is my credence to their high mightinesses these two should be filled up immediately and as mr laurens was originally designed to that country and my mission there was merely owing to his misfortune i hope that congress will send him a full power for that court the commission for peace i hope will be fully executed before this reaches you but if it should not as the terms are fixed i should not choose to stay in europe merely for the honor of affixing my signature to the definitive treaty and i see no necessity of filling up my place but if congress should think otherwise i hope they will think mr dana the best entitled to it with great esteem i have the honor to be c john adams    john adams   december      paris francis dana to francis dana paris   december      dear sir— you may easily guess from your own feelings what mine may be in communicating to you the intelligence that the preliminary treaty to be inserted in the definitive treaty was signed the  0th november by the plenipotentiaries on each side we have tolerable satisfaction in the mississippi the boundaries and the fisheries and i hope not much to regret with regard to the tories or any thing else mr f mr j and mr laurens as well as myself are of opinion that this is the proper time for you to communicate to the ministry where you are your mission but i believe we shall write you a joint letter upon this subject meantime i have the honor to be c john adams john adams benjamin franklin john jay    december      paris francis dana the commissioners to francis dana paris    december      sir— we have the honor to congratulate you on the signature of the preliminary treaty of peace between his britannic majesty and the united states of america to be inserted in the definitive treaty when france and britain shall have agreed upon their terms the articles of which we do ourselves the honor to inclose you a copy were completed on the  0th of last month to us at this distance the present opportunity appears to be the most favorable for you to communicate your mission to the ministers of the empress of russia and to the ministers of all the other neutral powers residing at her court and if you have no objections we presume you will wish to be furnished with the inclosed paper to communicate at the same time we heartily wish you success and if you should inform us of a fair prospect of it we shall propose an article in the definitive treaty to secure the freedom of navigation according to the principles of the late marine treaty of the neutral powers we have the honor to be c c john adams b franklin john jay    john adams    december      paris the commissioners to secretary livingston  paris    december      sir— we have the honor to congratulate congress on the signature of the preliminaries of a peace between the crown of great britain and the united states of america to be inserted in a definitive treaty so soon as the terms between the crowns of france and great britain shall be agreed on a copy of the articles is here inclosed and we cannot but flatter ourselves that they will appear to congress as they do to all of us to be consistent with the honor and interest of the united states and we are persuaded congress would be more fully of that opinion if they were apprised of all the circumstances and reasons which have influenced the negotiation although it is impossible for us to go into that detail we think it necessary nevertheless to make a few remarks on such of the articles as appear most to require elucidation remarks on article  d relative to boundaries the court of great britain insisted on retaining all the territories comprehended within the province of quebec by the act of parliament respecting it they contended that nova scotia should extend to the river kennebec and they claimed not only all the lands in the western country and on the mississippi which were not expressly included in our charters and governments but also such lands within them as remained ungranted by the king of great britain it would be endless to enumerate all the discussions and arguments on the subject we knew this court and spain to be against our claims to the western country and having no reason to think that lines more favorable could ever have been obtained we finally agreed to those described in this article indeed they appear to leave us little to complain of and not much to desire congress will observe that although our northern line is in a certain part below the latitude of fortyfive yet in others it extends above it divides the lake superior and gives us access to its western    and southern waters from which a line in that latitude would have excluded us remarks on article  th respecting creditors we had been informed that some of the states had confiscated british debts but although each state has a right to bind its own citizens yet in our opinion it appertains solely to congress in whom exclusively are vested the rights of making war and peace to pass acts against the subjects of a power with which the confederacy may be at war it therefore only remained for us to consider whether this article is founded in justice and good policy in our opinion no acts of government could dissolve the obligations of good faith resulting from lawful contracts between individuals of the two countries prior to the war we knew that some of the british creditors were making common cause with the refugees and other adversaries of our independence besides sacrificing private justice to reasons of state and political convenience is always an odious measure and the purity of our reputation in this respect in all foreign commercial countries is of infinitely more importance to us than all the sums in question it may also be remarked that american and british creditors are placed on an equal footing remarks on articles  th and  th respecting refugees these articles were among the first discussed and the last agreed to and had not the conclusion of this business at the time of its date been particularly important to the british administration the respect which both in london and versailles is supposed to be due to the honor dignity and interest of royalty would probably have forever prevented our bringing this article so near to the views of congress and the sovereign rights of the states as it now stands when it is considered that it was utterly impossible to render this article perfectly consistent both with american and british ideas of honor we presume that the middle line adopted by this article is as little unfavorable to the former as any that could in reason be expected as to the separate article we beg leave to observe that it was our policy to render the navigation of the river mississippi so important to britain as that their views might correspond with  0 ours on that subject their possessing the country on the river north of the line from the lake of the woods affords a foundation for their claiming such navigation and as the importance of west florida to britain was for the same reason rather to be strengthened than otherwise we thought it advisable to allow them the extent contained in the separate article especially as before the war it had been annexed by britain to west florida and would operate as an additional inducement to their joining with us in agreeing that the navigation of the river should forever remain open to both the map used in the course of our negotiations was mitchells as we had reason to imagine that the articles respecting the boundaries the refugees and fisheries did not correspond with the policy of this court we did not communicate the preliminaries to the minister until after they were signed and not even then the separate article we hope that these considerations will excuse our having so far deviated from the spirit of our instructions the count de vergennes on perusing the articles appeared surprised but not displeased  at their being so favorable to us we beg leave to add our advice that copies be sent us of the accounts directed to be taken by the different states of the unnecessary devastations and sufferings sustained by them from the enemy in the course of the war should they arrive before the signature of the definitive treaty they might possibly answer very good purposes with great respect we have the

paris m dumas to m dumas paris   january      dear sir— returning this evening from versailles where i had been to make the compliments of the season i found your favors of the   th and   th of december the letters inclosed shall be forwarded as you desire the dutch ministers here have no occasion for my assistance non tali auxilio c i have the honor to be more particularly acquainted with m brantzen who is certainly a very able man and universally acknowledged to be so by all who know him the arguments which i know he has used with the british minister are such as can never be answered both upon the liberty of navigation and the compensation for damages he is an entire master of his subject and has urged it with a degree of perspicuity and eloquence that i know has much struck his antagonists unnecessary however as any exertions of mine have been i have not omitted any opportunity of throwing in any friendly suggestions in my power where there was a possibility of doing any good to our good friends the dutch i have made such suggestions to mr fitzherbert but with mr oswald i have had several very serious conversations upon the subject so i have also with mr vaughan and mr whitefoord to mr oswald i urged the necessity of great britains agreeing with the dutch upon the unlimited freedom of navigation from a variety of topics some of which i may explain to you more particularly hereafter thus much i may say at present that i told him it was impossible for great britain to avoid it it would probably be insisted upon by all the other powers france and spain as well as russia sweden denmark prussia the emperor and portugal as well as holland had already signed the armed neutrality the united states of america had declared themselves ready to sign and were ready the combination being thus powerful great britain could not resist it but if she should refuse to agree to it with holland and the other powers should acquiesce and holland should make peace without it which would never however be the case yet all would be ineffectual for holland would forever be able to    make use of other neutral bottoms and would thus enjoy the benefit of this liberty in reality though denied it by treaty and in appearance it would therefore be more for the honor and interest of great britain to agree to it with a good grace in the treaty with holland nay the wisest part she could act would be to set on foot a negotiation immediately for signing herself the treaty of armed neutrality and then admitting it into the treaty with holland would be a thing of course at one of these conversations dr franklin was present who supported me with all his weight at another mr jay seconded me with all his abilities and ingenuity mr oswald has several times assured me that he had written these arguments and his own opinion in conformity with them to the kings ministers in london and i doubt not they will be adopted with respect to the compensation for damages it is impossible to add any thing to the arguments m brantzen has urged to show the justice of it and if britain is really wise she will think it her policy to do every thing in her power to soften the resentment of the dutch and regain their good will and good humor the rage of great britain however has carried her to such extravagant lengths in a cause unjust from beginning to end that she is scarcely able to repair the injuries she has done america has a just claim to compensation for all her burnt towns and plundered property and indeed for all her slaughtered sons if that were possible i shall continue to embrace every opportunity that presents of doing all the little service in my power to our good friends the dutch whose friendship for us i shall not soon forget this must be communicated with great discretion if at all my best respects to all c john adams john adams   january      paris jean george holtzhey to j g holtzhey paris   january      sir— i have received the letter which you did me the honor to write me on the   d december together with the explication of your new medal in commemoration of the signature of the treaty of commerce which is equally ingenious with that which celebrates the acknowledgment of american independence    these events are worthy of your ingenuity sir and deserve to be remembered by posterity not only for the blessings which will be derived to the two nations but by the influence they have had in accelerating the disposition of great britain for a general peace for whether such a peace shall take place this year or not there is great reason to believe it will happen some years the sooner for those events which you are laboring to immortalize please to accept of my thanks for this fresh instance of your obliging attention to me and believe me to be with great respect c john adams m dumas    janvier      la haie john adams m dumas to john adams la haie    janvier      monsieur— lincluse pour philadelphie vous mettra au fait du courant ici lhonorée vôtre du  er janvier est pour moi une vraie et précieuse étrenne de nouvel an jai fait confidence verbale du contenu à messieurs de gyselaer van berckel et visscher sous le sceau du secret et à personne autre ils en ont été charmés du reste ils étoient bien sûrs davance de vos bonnes dispositions et de celles de messicurs vos collégues pour cette république ce qui leur tient à cœur cest que comme m brantzen écrit constamment dans ses dépêches ici de la part de m le comte de vergennes le soin quil a des intérêts de la république vous lautorisassiez de même ministériellement à apprendre à l h p que vous les avez également à cœur ces messieurs ici sappliquent à cet égard le vers de lécole scire tuum nihil est nisi te scire hoc sciat alter en un mot ils

de son côté na rien contre ce plan la poste qui va partir ne me laisse que le moment de finir avec mon respectueux attachement c dumas john adams    january      paris m dumas to m dumas paris    january      sir— i have yet to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the   th   th  0th and   st of december and  d of january your despatches are sent along as you desire i hope you are quite recovered from your indisposition i can give you no information concerning peace it is given out that the point will be decided here today or tomorrow others say that the duke de la vauguyon is to make the peace at the hague inclosed is a copy of our preliminaries but i must entreat you not to permit them to be published or copied without further information from me you may communicate them in confidence to our friends but it is thought best to let the british ministry lay them first before parliament and take their own time for it the great points of independence the fisheries the mississippi and the boundaries are settled to our satisfaction but in point of compensation for damages we must put our hands in our own pockets with great regard c john adams john adams    january      paris to secretary livingston paris    january      sir— upon a sudden notification from the count de vergennes dr franklin and myself in the absence of mr jay and mr laurens went to versailles and arrived at the counts office at ten oclock on monday the  0th of this month at    eleven arrived the count daranda and mr fitzherbert the ministers of the three crowns signed and sealed the preliminaries of peace and an armistice in presence of doctor franklin and myself who also signed and sealed a declaration of an armistice between the crown of great britain and the united states of america and received a counter declaration from mr fitzherbert copies of these declarations are inclosed the king of great britain has made a declaration concerning the terms that he will allow to the dutch but they are not such as will give satisfaction to that unfortunate nation for whom on account of their friendship for us and the important benefits we have received from it i feel very sensibly and sincerely yesterday we went to versailles again to make our court to the king and royal family upon the occasion and received the compliments of the foreign ministers the count daranda invited me to dine with him on sunday next and said he hoped that the affairs of spain and the united states would be soon adjusted à lamiable i answered that i wished it with all my heart the two floridas and minorca are more than a quantum meruit for what this power has done and the dutch unfortunately are to suffer for it it is not in my power to say when the definitive treaty will be signed i hope not before the dutch are ready in six weeks or two months at farthest i suppose it is no longer necessary for congress to appoint another person in my place in the commission for peace because it will be executed before this reaches america but i beg leave to renew the resignation of the credence to the statesgeneral and the commission for borrowing money in holland and to request that no time may be lost in transmitting the acceptance of this resignation and another person to take that station that i may be able to go home in the spring ships i have the honor to be c john adams john adams    january      paris to secretary livingston paris    january      sir— the letters you did me the honor to write on the  th and   th of november came safe to hand    you do me honor sir in applauding the judgment i have formed from time to time of the court of britain and future ages will give me credit for the judgment i have formed of some other courts the true designs of a minister of state are not difficult to be penetrated by an honest man of common sense who is in a situation to know any thing of the secret of affairs and to observe constantly the chain of public events for whatever ostensible appearances may be put on whatever obliquities may be imagined however the web may be woven or the thread doubled and twisted enough will be seen to unravel the whole my opinions as you observe sometimes run counter to those generally received but the reason of this has generally been that i have had earlier evidence than the generality and i have had the satisfaction to find that others have formed the same judgment when they have had the same intelligence i do not affect singularity nor love to be in a minority though truth and justice have sometimes obliged me to be so you say that nothing can be more conformable to your wishes than the instructions i transmitted i am not surprised at this it is very natural had i never been on this side of the atlantic i believe i should have been of your mind in this particular at present i cannot be and i believe by this time the dutch regret having given them you will hear enough of the reason of it i have lived long enough and had experience enough of the conduct of governments and people nations and courts to be convinced that gratitude friendship unsuspecting confidence and all the most amiable passions in human nature are the most dangerous guides in politics i assure you sir if we had not been more cautious than the dutch we should have been worse off than they and our country would have suffered much more mr laurens has been here and has behaved with great caution firmness and wisdom he arrived so late as only to attend the two last days of the conferences the   th and  0th of november but the short time he was with us he was of great service to the cause he has done great service to america in england where his conversation has been such as the purest and firmest american could wish it and has made many converts he is gone again to bath and his journey will do as much good to his country as to his health he will return to the signature of the definitive treaty    the ratifications of my contracts have been received the release of captain asgill was so exquisite a relief to my feelings that i have not much cared what interposition it was owing to it would have been a horrid damp to the joys of peace if we had received a disagreeable account of him the difference between denmark and holland is of no serious nature the clue to the whole is the queen dowager is sister to the duke of brunswick but there is nothing to fear from denmark as to the northern powers we have nothing to fear from any of them all of them and all the neutral powers would have acknowledged our independence before now by receiving mr dana to sign the principles of the armed neutrality if he had not been restrained from acting the unlimited confidence of congress has been grossly abused and we should have been irreparably injured if we had not been upon our guard as our liberties and most important interests are now secured as far as they can be against great britain it would be my wish to say as little as possible of the policy of any minister of our first ally which has not been as we could desire and to retain forever a grateful remembrance of the friendly assistance we have received but we have evidence enough to warn us against unlimited confidence in any european minister of state i have never drawn upon dr franklin for any money since the end of my two and a half years salary and he tells me he has made no use of the bills i had received money for my subsistence of messieurs willink and as it will be but a few months more at farthest that i shall have to subsist in europe i beg leave to proceed to the end in the same way i shall receive only the amount of my salary and settle the account with congress on my return i hope to be safely landed on my native shore in the month of june and to this end i beg that an appointment may be made to the dutch mission and the acceptance of my resignation be transmitted to me by the first ships i have the honor to be c john adams    m dumas    janvier      la haie john adams m dumas to john adams la haie    janvier      monsieur— la manière subite et imprévue dont on a reçu ici la nouvelle de la signature des préliminaires par toutes les autres puissances belligérantes sans que celui qui tient le plus à cœur ici ait été fixé a dabord consterné nos amis mais après être revenu de leur première surprise m van berckel à la réquisition et sur les instances de m le grand pensionnaire dans une conférence secrète a proposé un moyen sans doute le plus noble et le plus solide pour parvenir au but désiré et désirable à tous m le grand pensionnaire la saisi avec empressement et lon est convenu que m van berckel me prieroit de leur part de consulter votre excellence en toute diligence sur ce moyen que voici pour accélérer la négociation de la paix générale et pour prévenir les discussions ultérieures entre l h p et la grande bretagne sur le point de la navigation libre et illimitée on demande à m adams sil se trouve assez autorisé de la part du congrès pour accéder au traité de la neutralité armée déjà conclu entre quelques puissances belligérantes de leurope ou pour entrer dans une pareille négociation avec lespagne la france et les paysbas unis dans lun et lautre cas l h puissances pourroient faire la même proposition à la france et à lespagne afin de prévenir les discussions sur le point de la liberté des mers qui pourroient arrêter la paix générale et pour mettre la république en état de faire sa paix avec la grande bretagne qui pourroit être retardée par des difficultés que pourroient rencontrer des stipulations particulières ou des arrangemens à faire avec langleterre sur ce point le traité définitif entre langleterre et la république pourroit alors se faire sous la réserve du droit primitif de toutes les nations qui se trouvent dans lexercice de ce droit à moins quils ne sen soient départis par des traités particuliers au sujet de contrebandes reconnues pour telles par les contractans respectifs m adams est prié instamment de communiquer ses idées sur ce point le plutôt possible et dy ajouter ses réflexions sur les moyens davancer une telle négociation et dacheminer la paix  0 générale car il paroît quen attendant la république pourroit accéder à larmistice qui devra résulter de la signature des préliminaires de paix entre les autres puissances belligérantes et traiter avec langleterre sur tous les autres points en question vous êtes le maître monsieur si vous le jugez à propos de conférer aussi làdessus ministériellement avec m brantzen il ne me reste plus que de vous présenter les complimens et tout ce qui se peut penser de plus cordial de la part de m van berckel qui vient de me quitter pour me laisser écrire tout ce que dessus je suis c dumas john adams    january      paris m dumas to m dumas paris    january      sir— upon receiving the letter which you did me the honor to write me on the   th late last evening i went immediately to consult with my colleague mr jay and we agreed to go this morning to dr franklin accordingly today we went together to passy and communicated your letter to him and after recollecting the powers we have received we all agreed that i should make you the following answer you will readily recollect the resolutions of congress which i did myself the honor two years ago to communicate to the president of their high mightinesses and to the ministers of russia sweden and denmark at the hague the letter to the president was sent au greffe and there may perhaps be now found these resolutions contained the approbation of congress of the principles of the declaration of the empress of russia and authorized any of the american ministers in europe if invited thereto to pledge the faith of the united states to the observance of them some time after this congress sent mr dana a commission with full power to accede to the principles of the marine treaty between the neutral powers and he is now at petersburg vested with these powers and according to late intelligence received from him has wellfounded expectations of being soon admitted it is the opinion of my colleagues as well as my own that no commission of mine to their high mightinesses contains authority    to negotiate this business and we are all of opinion that it is most proper that mr dana should negotiate it but as there has been no express revocation of the power given to all or any of us by the first resolutions and if the case should happen that mr dana could not attend in season on account of the distance for the sake of accelerating the signature of the definitive treaty of peace we should not hesitate to pledge the faith of the united states to the observance of the principles of the armed neutrality i wish it were in my power to give you a more satisfactory answer but candor will warrant no other with great respect to the gentlemen as well as to you i have the honor to be sir c john adams m dumas  0 janvier      la haie john adams m dumas to john adams la haie  0 janvier      monsieur— les lettres que jai eu lhonneur de vous écrire vendredi   e et mardi   e ne sont que lexpression fidèle des sentimens de nos républicains je ny ai rien mis du mien au contraire jai adouci tant que jai pu si lon ne trouve à raccommoder la chose de la manière que je lai proposée cen est fait pour toujours du crédit ici de la france voici la copie promise de la lettre et dune autre de la même main reçue ce matin la france et nos républicains depuis tous ces jours sont lobjet des sarcasmes et des railleries amères des malintentionnés et nos républicains sans avoir perdu courage visàvis de leurs antagonistes internes sont outrés et nont plus aucune confiance en ce qui leur est dit ministériellement de la part de la france pour colorer ce qui vient de se passer ou pour leur faire faire quelque démarche ultérieure ils plaignent personnellement m le duc de la vauguyon et disent que m le comte de vergennes le sacrifie et lui fait perdre dun coup de plume tout le fruit de ses sages infatigables et brillans travaux ici du reste ils déclarent quils ne veulent être dominés ou influés ou menés à la lisière ni par langleterre ni par la france et que quoiquon leur propose de la part de la france ils ne le porteront plus devant leurs villes que moyennant des sûretés suffisantes en poche    si vous pouvez faire réussir monsieur ce que jai proposé je crois que ce sera une opération politique importante un coup de partie pour lhonneur et lavantage des états unis parcequelle établira leur crédit leur dignité et leur gloire ici pour toujours votre jugement profond et profonde pénétration monsieur na pas besoin que jentre dans de plus longs raisonnemens làdessus il suffit que cette affaire sera également avantageuse à tous puisque tous y participeront et se lassûreront m le comte de llano ma fait prier ce matin de lui communiquer les préliminaires dont m lambassadeur lui a dit que javois copie mais il sest contenté de mes raisons pour ne pouvoir lui donner quune idée verbale des dits préliminaires jai cru pouvoir et devoir faire le même plaisir à m dasp vous connoissez toute la vérité c dumas m dumas   fevrier      la haie john adams m dumas to john adams la haie   fevrier      monsieur— lhonorée vôtre du   e a pleinement satisfait ces messieurs et m van berckel au nom de tous ma chargé de vous en remercier et de vous assurer que cest précisément ce quil leur falloit ce quils espéroient pouvoir se faire de votre part et de celle de messieurs vos collègues et que vous pouvez compter sur eux comme ils comptent sur vous en allant agir conséquemment jai été la communiquer aussi à m le grand pensionnaire qui ma paru penser comme eux et que lon ma dit confidemment de plus dune bonne part avoir à désirer autant que la france que le parti anglais ne prédomine plus ici jai à vous présenter les respects de tous je suis charmé monsieur quil y ait eu moyen de les contenter à si bon marché car il me paroît que ce quils demandent nest autre chose que ce qui est stipulé dans les traités de lamérique tant avec cette république quavec la france du reste ils sont déterminés à ne signer que lorsque cet article de la navigation sera en règle de la manière proposée et à ne point perdre non plus négapatnam et lon craint que si m le comte de vergennes ne trouve pas quelque remède à cela la confiance et linclination de cette    nation pour la france ne soit étouffée dans sa renaissance elle importoit cependant plus à la france que tabago m de vergennes pour sexcuser de la précipitation avec laquelle on a signé a dit aux ministres de la république à paris entre autres que dun côté lamérique qui se disoit epuisée craignoit un soulèvement si lon devoit imposer de nouvelles taxes demandoit par m franklin vingt millions pour la campagne prochaine si elle avoit lieu enfin qui vouloit jouir de la paix et de son traité plutôt que de hazarder une prolongation de guerre qui pouvoit altérer laccomplissement et de lautre lespagne qui également epuisée réclamoit absolument cette conclusion—avoient mis la france dans la nécessité de signer si précipitamment mais que cela nempêchoit pas lintention ferme de sa majesté de ne point terminer sans que l h p soient comprises dans la paix générale et contentes dieu le veuille il paroît que m lambassadeur et m le grand pensionnaire ont reçu chacun par son courier les mêmes assurances ce dernier cependant na pas encore dit le même de sa dépêche à nos autres amis je suis persuadé que dans les lettres confidentielles que je vous ai écrites monsieur depuis lofficielle du   e vous avez gardé par devers vous seul ce qui contre mon intention qui est pure pourroit faire de la peine à dautres et me nuire quoiquà tort dans leur esprit jai voulu et dû être avec vous un historien fidèle daignez faire agréer mes respects à messrs franklin et jay et être assuré du bon aloi de celui c dumas john adams   february      paris to secretary livingston paris   february      sir— the resolution of congress of the   th of july      that the commission and instructions for negotiating a treaty of commerce between these united states and great britain given to the honorable john adams on the   th day of september      be and they are hereby revoked was duly received by me in holland but no explanation of the motives to it or the reasons on which it was founded was ever transmitted to    me by congress or the committee of foreign affairs or any individual member nor has anybody in europe or america ever once attempted that i know of to guess at the reason whether it was intended as a punishment to me or with a charitable design not to lead me into temptation whether it was intended as a punishment to the english for their insolence and barbarity whether it was intended to prevent or remove suspicions of allies or the envy and greeneyed jealousy of copatriots i know not of one thing however i am fully satisfied that congress had reasons and meant well but whether those reasons were founded on true or mistaken information i know not when i recollect the instructions which were given and revoked with that commission i can guess and only guess at some considerations which might or might not operate with congress in these instructions congress determined  st that the common right of fishing should in no case be given up  dly that it is essential to the welfare of all these united states that the inhabitants thereof at the expiration of the war should continue to enjoy the free and undisturbed exercise of their common right to fish on the banks of newfoundland and the other fishing banks and seas of north america preserving inviolate the treaties between france and the said states c  dly that our faith be pledged to the several states that without their unanimous consent no treaty of commerce shall be entered into nor any trade or commerce whatever carried on with great britain without the explicit stipulation hereinafter mentioned you are therefore not to consent to any treaty of commerce with great britain without an explicit stipulation on her part not to molest or disturb the inhabitants of the united states of america in taking fish on the banks of newfoundland and other fisheries in the american seas anywhere excepting within the distance of three leagues of the shores of the territories remaining to great britain at the close of the war if a nearer distance cannot be obtained by negotiation and in the negotiation you are to exert your most strenuous endeavors to obtain a nearer distance in the gulf of st lawrence and particularly along the shores of nova scotia as to which latter we are desirous that even the shores may be occasionally used    for the purpose of carrying on the fisheries by the inhabitants of these states these instructions are very decisive in favor of our indubitable right to the fisheries and it is possible that congress might be of opinion that commerce would be the strongest inducement to the english to make peace and at the same time that there was something so naval in the fisheries that the dread of acknowledging our right to them would be the strongest obstacle in the way of peace they might think too that peace was of more importance to the united states than a british acknowledgment of our right to the fisheries which to be sure would have been enjoyed by our people in a good degree without it reasonings like these might influence congress to revoke the commission and instructions in question but whatever probability there might appear in them at that time experience has since shown that they were not well founded on the contrary arguments have been found to convince the british ministers themselves that it was the interest of their king and country not only to acknowledge the american right to the fisheries but to encourage the unrestrained exercise of it these considerations therefore can be no longer of any weight against a treaty of commerce with great britain or against accrediting a minister to the court of st james nor can i conceive of any motive now existing against these measures on the contrary so many advantages present themselves to view that i think it my duty to recommend them to congress as proper to be adopted without loss of time if there are in congress any of those gentlemen with whom i had the honor to serve in the years      and      they may possibly remember that in arguing in favor of sending ministers to versailles to propose a connection with that court i laid it down as a first principle that we should calculate all our measures and foreign negotiations in such a manner as to avoid a too great dependence upon any one power of europe—to avoid all obligations and temptations to take any part in future european wars that the business of america with europe was commerce not politics or war and above all that it never could be our interest to ruin great britain or injure or weaken her any further than should be necessary to support our independence and our alliances and that as soon as great britain should be brought to a temper to acknowledge    our sovereignty and our alliances and consent that we should maintain the one and fulfil the others it would be our interest and duty to be her friends as well as the friends of all the other powers of europe and enemies to none we are now happily arrived through many tremendous tempests at that period great britain respects us as sovereign states and respects all our political engagements with foreign nations and as long as she continues in this temper of wisdom it is our duty to respect her we have accordingly made a treaty with her and mutually sworn to be friends through the whole period of our warfare and negotiations i confess i have never lost sight of the principles and the system with which i set out which appeared to me to be the sentiments of congress with great unanimity and i have no reason to believe that any change of opinion has taken place if there has not every one will agree with me that no measure we can pursue will have such a tendency to preserve the government and people of england in the right system for their own and our interest and the interest of our allies too well understood as sending a minister to reside at the court of london in the next place the court of london is the best station to collect intelligence from every part and by means of the freedom of the press to communicate information for the benefit of our country to every part of the world in time of peace there is so frequent travelling between paris london and the hague that the correspondence of our ministers at those courts may be carried on by private hands without hazarding any thing from the infidelity of the posts and congress may reasonably expect advantages from this circumstance in the third place a treaty of commerce with great britain is an affair of great importance to both countries upon this occasion i hope i shall be excused if i venture to advise that congress should instruct their minister not to conclude such a treaty without sending the project to them for their observations and fresh instructions and i think it would not be improper on this occasion to imitate the dutch method take the project ad referendum and transmit it to the legislatures of all the states for their remarks before congress finally resolve their minister may be authorized and instructed in the mean time to enter into a temporary convention for regulating the present trade for    a limited number of months or years or until the treaty of commerce shall be completed in the fourth place it is our part to be the first to send a minister to great britain which is the older and as yet the superior state it becomes us to send a minister first and i doubt not the king of great britain will very soon return the compliment whereas if we do not begin i believe there will be many delicacies at st jamess about being the first to send i confess i wish a british minister at philadelphia and think we should derive many benefits from his residence there while we have any foreign ministers among us i wish to have them from all the great powers with whom we are much connected the corps diplomatique at every court is or ought to be a system representing at least that part of the system of europe with which that court is most conversant in the same manner or at least for similar reasons as long as we have any one minister abroad at any european court i think we ought to have one at every one to which we are most essentially related whether in commerce or policy and therefore while we have any minister at versailles the hague or london i think it clear we ought to have one at each though i confess i have sometimes thought that after a very few years it will be the best thing we can do to recall every minister from europe and send embassies only on special occasions if however any members of congress should have any delicacies lest an american minister should not be received with a dignity becoming his rank and character at london they may send a commission to make a treaty of commerce with great britain to their minister at madrid or versailles or the hague or st petersburg and instruct him to carry on the negotiation from the court where he may be until he shall be invited to london or a letter of credence may be sent to one of these with instructions to go to london as soon as the king shall appoint a minister to go to philadelphia after all however my opinion is that none of these manœuvres are necessary but that the best way will be to send a minister directly to st jamess with a letter of credence to the king as a minister plenipotentiary and a commission to treat of a treaty of commerce but with instructions not to come to any irrevocable conclusion until congress and all the states have an    opportunity to consider of the project and suggest their amendments there is one more argument in favor of sending a minister forthwith it is this while this mission lies open it will be a source of jealousy among present ministers and such as are or may be candidates to be foreign ministers a source of intrigue and faction among their partisans and adherents and a source of animosity and division among the people of the states for this reason it is a pity that the first choice had not been such as congress could have continued to approve and the first measure such as congress could have constantly persevered in if this had been the case the door of faction would have been kept shut as this however was once my department by the voice of eleven states in twelve present and as i will be answerable at any hazard it will never be the department of any one by a greater majority there seems to be a propriety in my giving my advice concerning it on taking leave of it if such is the will of congress as i have before done in this letter according to the best of my judgment and if it should not be thought too presumptuous i would beg leave to add what is my idea of the qualifications necessary for an american foreign minister in general and particularly and above all to the court of st james in the first place he should have had an education in classical learning and in the knowledge of general history ancient and modern and particularly the history of france england holland and america he should be well versed in the principles of ethics of the law of nature and nations of legislation and government of the civil roman law of the laws of england and the united states of the public law of europe and in the letters memoirs and histories of those great men who have heretofore shone in the diplomatic order and conducted the affairs of nations and the world he should be of an age to possess a maturity of judgment arising from experience in business he should be active attentive and industrious and above all he should possess an upright heart and an independent spirit and should be one who decidedly makes the interest of his country not the policy of any other nation nor his own private ambition or interest or those of his family friends and connections the rule of his conduct    we hear so much said about a genteel address and a facility in speaking the french language that one would think a dancing master and a french master the only tutors necessary to educate a statesman be it remembered the present revolution neither in america nor europe has been accomplished by elegant bows nor by fluency in french nor will any great thing ever be effected by such accomplishments alone a man must have something in his head to say before he can speak to effect how ready soever he may be at utterance and if the knowledge is in his head and the virtues are in his heart he will never fail to find a way of communicating his sentiments to good purpose he will always have excellent translators ready if he wants them to turn his thoughts into any language he desires as to what is called a fine address it is seldom attended to after a first or second conversation and even in these it is regarded no more by men of sense of any country than another thing which i once heard disputed with great vivacity among the officers of the french frigate the sensible the question was what were the several departments of an ambassador and a secretary of legation after a long and shrewd discussion it was decided by a majority of votes that the secretarys part was to do the business and that of the ambassador to keep a mistress this decision produced a laugh among the company and no ideas of the kind will ever produce any thing else among men of understanding it is very true that it is possible that a case may happen that a man may serve his country by a bribe well placed or an intrigue of pleasure with a woman but it is equally true that a mans country will be sold and betrayed a thousand times by this infamous commerce where it will be once served it is very certain that we shall never be a match for european statesmen in such accomplishments for negotiation any more than i must and will add they will equal us in any solid abilities virtues and application to business if we choose wisely among the excellent characters with which our country abounds among the ministers who have already crossed the atlantic to europe there have been none exceeding mr jay and mr dana in all the qualifications i have presumed to enumerate and i must say that if i had the honor to give my vote in congress for a minister at the court of great britain provided that  0 injustice must be finally done to him who was the first object of his countrys choice such have been the activity intelligence address and fortitude of mr jay as well as his sufferings in his voyage journeys and past services that i should think of no other object of my choice than that gentleman if congress should neglect all their old ministers and send a fresh one from america they cannot be at a loss for there are in that country great numbers of men well qualified for the service these are most certainly better known by name to congress than to me and therefore i shall venture no further but conclude by wishing this arduous business well settled and by assurances to congress and to you sir of my warmest attachment and respect i have the honor to be c john adams john adams   february      paris m dumas to m dumas paris   february      sir— i received last night your favor of  0th of january with the copies of letters inclosed i am not at all surprised at the sentiments expressed in those copies nor am i able to give any satisfactory answer to the pungent questions which i read there i feel very sincerely afflicted for our friends without being now able and without having ever been able to do them any service i could tell you a very true story which would convince you that the united states run a great risk of as bad a peace as that of holland and that there is no thanks to the minister that your correspondent thinks hard of that we had not a worse unsuspecting confidence is ever dangerous in negotiations the statesgeneral should have had a minister in london as soon as m rayneval went there and instead of being instructed to trust so much to another they should have been instructed to conduct their affairs wholly themselves you know the situation i am in and therefore i rely upon your honor to communicate nothing of this to the duke de la vauguyon you know i never liked the french minister of foreign affairs i had great reasons to distrust him which you know not but the world may one day see as to the proposed negotiation for the freedom of navigation mr dana has full power to treat and if france and spain    will come into a treaty with holland upon the subject mr franklin mr jay mr laurens and myself will treat whilst waiting for mr dana but between you and me i doubt whether the french minister will be for such a treaty this is merely from conjecture not knowledge so that no dependence can be placed upon it if the english are cunning they will make a merit with holland of agreeing to the liberty of navigation and i suspect this is their intention if they get negapatnam with great esteem john adams john adams    february      paris richard oswald to richard oswald paris    february      sir— we have expected you here every day for a long time and begin to be apprehensive you do not design to return which will be a disappointment to me because i wish to have the pleasure of finishing the work of peace with a gentleman who has conducted it hitherto with so much advantage if this satisfaction is not to be obtained i wish the service in the hands of some one equally possessed of the only system which can ever conduct it to a right conclusion for the prosperity of your country or mine of one thing i am well persuaded—that no man will ever be found with better qualifications or dispositions if you should not return here it is not very probable we shall meet again but whether together or asunder i shall carry with me at all times the most entire esteem and respect for mr oswald i have the honor to be c john adams m dumas    février      la haie john adams m dumas to john adams la haie    février      monsieur— ce que vous me dites dans la vôtre du   ou plutôt ce que vous ne my dites pas me fait désirer avec impatience votre retour ici cest à dire la conclusion finale du traité définitif de paix générale car je ne vois pas dapparence à avoir cette satisfaction plutôt il me tarde extrêmement dapprendre ce quil peut y avoir de    pire que le tour joué à nos amis il regne un froid à glacer pas entre eux et moi au contraire mais entre eux et certain caractère dont ils plaignent pourtant la personne et sil en faut croire ce quon se dit ici à loreille il est à plaindre après toutes les peines quil sest données pour bien servir et tout le succès quont eu ses peines nous sommes fort curieux ici de savoir le rôle et les allures à paris et à versailles de m de h le chambellan du prince je suis c dumas m dumas    février      la haie john adams m dumas to john adams la haie    février      monsieur— nos amis sont très contents de la déclaration réitérée que je leur ai faite de votre part c et vont agir en conséquence auprès de la cour de france compris celle despagne et auprès de vos excellences ils me paroissent persuadés que la mesure peut et doit réussir cependant à tout événement ils me chargent de proposer encore la question suivante pour obtenir làdessus une réponse favorable sil se peut qui achèveroit de les mettre à laise et de les tranquilliser q lorsque l h p auront fait la proposition à la france de signer conjointement avec lespagne lamérique et les paysbas unis une convention fondée sur les principes de la neutralité armée pour le maintien de la liberté de la navigation au cas que la france et lespagne parussent vouloir reculer et différer une telle convention ou sy refuser avant la conclusion ou signature du traité définitif m dana et pendant son absence m adams soit seul et comme ministre des états unis auprès de cette république ou avec messieurs ses collègues seroient ils prêts à signer une telle convention provisionelle lorsquelle leur seroit proposée de la part de l h p entre les états unis et les paysbas unis on est persuadé ici que sans un traité pareil soit entre la france lespagne les états unis et les paysbas unis ou à défaut des deux premières au moins entre les deux dernières puissances rien ne sauroit prévenir ni excuser la honte du traité définitif pour cette république qui nest entrée en guerre que    pour la liberté des mers et qui en a fait une conditio sine quâ non dans ses préliminaires de paix il est fort à souhaiter que lun de ces deux arrangemens soit faisable à défaut de lautre parceque cela applaniroit tout dun coup le chemin au traité définitif il ne resteroit du moins dautre difficulté que celle de négapatnam et de la navigation par les moluques sur lesquelles je viens de lire le rapport des    directeurs de la compagnie qui opposent les raisons les plus fortes à la cession de lun et de lautre mon opinion est sauf toujours votre meilleur avis que votre acquiescement à la demande de ces messieurs peut se fonder sur ces trois choses  o sur la résolution des états unis du   octobre    0 communiquée par vousmême à l h p par lettre du   mars      et sur ce que vous mavez marqué que vos pouvoirs à cet égard nont point été révoqués  o sur ce que l h p sont une des parties de la neutralité armée à laquelle mr dana attend quil plaise à une autre des parties dadmettre les états unis  o sur ce quil ne sagit ce me semble que de se garantir réciproquement ce que vous avez déjà signé dans le traité damitié et de commerce conclu avec l h p je suis c dumas john adams    february      paris m dumas to m dumas paris    february      sir— in answer to the questions in yours of the   th i beg leave to inform you that in my opinion mr dana is the only proper person in europe to treat with anybody in europe about the armed neutrality and the liberty of navigation it is true our former power is not expressly revoked but i consider mr danas commissions in form to be an implicit and tacit revocation of ours so that i dare not take upon me and from friendship and delicacy to mr dana i ought not to enter into any conferences upon this subject alone in company with my colleagues in the commission for peace i would not refuse to enter into conferences waiting mr dana but whether my colleagues would enter into this negotiation without france and spain at least france i doubt and have not time now to consult them who are at a distance from me    i think the proper method for our friends to take is to open a negotiation with mr dana and with all the neutral powers and with france and spain at the same time we who are now in and about paris might negotiate with the ministers of france spain and holland or at least confer if they will admit us waiting mr dana mr d can enter into negotiation with holland and all the other powers who have signed the armed neutrality believe me your friend john adams john adams    february      paris to the trustees of dartmouth college paris    february      gentlemen— your favor of   th september recommending your worthy president dr wheelock and his designs gave me much pleasure and does me great honor it is to american seminaries of learning that america is indebted for her glory and prosperity and therefore no man can be more usefully employed than in affording them every countenance and assistance in his power dr wheelock after remaining a few days in paris set off with his brother for the hague and amsterdam i gave him letters to several persons of consideration in those cities such as will be most likely to forward his designs but what success he will have i am not able to say with the greatest respect john adams benjamin vaughan    february      london john adams b vaughan to john adams extract london    february      dear sir— mr laurens whom you inquire after i presume is just arrived in london and mr oswald was about to return to paris but what this distracted state of parties will produce i cannot yet inform you the event of the peace and the reception it meets in parliament will tell you who were americas best friends they were those who made least profession and had most understanding it is unnecessary to hint more to you all ranks are satisfied with peace but the great are not    satisfied with a minister who had so few of them in his train they therefore say we might have had a better peace you are one of those that know and i ask your opinion about the fact of a better peace being easy without more war or even with it i mean to put you up some pamphlets of the worst sort for our better are only preparing hereafter the peace will probably be well understood and then you shall have other pamphlets in another style i have the honor to be c benjamin vaughan p j van berckel   mars      la haie john adams p j van berckel to john adams la haie   mars

je nai pu me dispenser de vous en informer mais encore je me fais cette occasion de vous écrire à profit et je la saisis pour vous témoigner que lhonneur de cette commission me flatte extrêmement parceque jai toujours senti le désir le plus vif den être chargé afin de trouver les moyens de mettre au jour les sentimens destime et damour que mon cœur nourrit pour cette nouvelle république ce que je ferai dautant plus facilement parce que le service de ma patrie exige que je porte tous mes soins à serrer le plus étroitement ces noeuds qui doivent lier ces deux soeurs de façon quelles ne se séparent jamais permettez moi en même temps de solliciter votre amitié et votre bienveillance elles me sont chères et me peuvent être de très grande utilité jen conçois tout le prix et je ne manquerai

pour un    traité de garantie réciproque de la liberté des mers ces messieurs comptent à cet égard et principalement sur les promesses réitérées que vous mavez autorisé de leur faire sûrs que vous ne vous laisserez point influer ni diriger par shelburne  co qui sentendent disent ils comme larrons en foire vous naurez pas de peine à comprendre lallusion si cette convention pouvoit se faire avant la signature du traité définitif ce seroit le triomphe ici de nos républicains quelquun mayant objecté que langleterre pourroit en prendre ombrage si ce traité se faisoit avant lautre et depuis quand aije répliqué la france atelle recommencée à avoir peur de donner ombrage à langleterre je suis c dumas john adams    march      paris p j van berckel to p j van berckel paris    march      sir— i have received the letter which you did me the honor to write me on the  th of this month and am happy to receive this confirmation of the news of your appointment as minister plenipotentiary to the united states of america your name connections and character are sufficient pledges of your attachment to your own country as well as ours and cannot fail to be as pleasing in america as they seem to be in europe a friendship between our countries is so natural that i think you will have little difficulty in succeeding to your wishes m dumas desires me to inform you what furniture it will be proper to carry with you in my opinion you will be able to purchase at philadelphia whatever you may have occasion for as cheap and as good as you can have them in europe linens and other light articles you may carry with you but it is unnecessary to incumber yourself with heavy ones it will by no means be necessary to make a public entry there has as yet been no example of it and as such splendid ceremonies are much out of fashion in europe it will never be necessary to introduce them into america you will have no occasion therefore for any carriage but one of a common kind which may be made in philadelphia or boston with as much elegance and convenience as in paris amsterdam or london my advice would be to land at boston and take the journey    to philadelphia while you send your frigate round by sea to that city this will give you an opportunity of seeing a great part of the united states and of becoming acquainted with many principal characters i will be answerable for your cordial reception everywhere his excellency the governor of massachusetts mr hancock and his honor the president of the senate mr samuel adams will receive you at boston governor trumbull at connecticut general washington and governor clinton at new york governor livingston at new jersey i would by all means advise you to pass through new york and new jersey where you will find multitudes charmed at the sight of a dutch minister more than any other in the world i wish you a pleasant voyage and journey if you take your departure at any time before the middle of june your voyage can scarcely fail to be agreeable after that it may be long and tedious i have the honor to be c john adams benjamin vaughan    march      london john adams b vaughan to john adams london    march      dear sir— i do not learn that we have yet fixed our ministry which does not at all concern me provided we could fix our principles i am happy however to find notwithstanding the factions in parliament that the people of england are not at all averse to a proper footing with america provided they could be assured of americas disposition to be reciprocal in the matter of advance so far they are right that no public overtures from thence have yet arrived at their knowledge in which i think you gentlemen at paris might nevertheless assist us perhaps i may truly affirm that the boldness of my friend has done more towards advancing manly opinions than any thing i have yet experienced in this country happy i am to find notwithstanding this clamor that he retains all his old american sentiments and repents of nothing some of his friends only lament that he did not corrupt the votes of some who never vote but by corruption and in truth it would have secured the business i have the honor to be c benjamin vaughan    john adams    march      paris benjamin vaughan to benjamin vaughan paris    march      dear sir— i thank you for the pamphlets which are an amusement in this place how little soever there is in them of sense or candor the refugees however seem to judge right in their own affair—sensible that they have no claim at all upon america for compensation they demand it of great britain upon whom the pretensions of some of them may be very just but why has no man dared to mention tens of thousands of sufferers in america as innocent as meritorious at least as any of the refugees who is to make restitution and compensation to these those who say you might have had a better peace speak from conjecture not from knowledge they reason from a false comparison of the forces of the belligerent powers their imaginations magnify the finances and military power of great britain and diminish those of france spain holland and america and then they reason from this delusive comparison that the peace is inadequate to the relative situations i am afraid that the vote to this purpose will be an unhappy one for great britain will it not nourish a continual discontent in your nation and a continual jealousy in all the powers that have been at war with you i will answer you with great sincerity i do not believe you could possibly have obtained a better treaty with america on the contrary the least delay would have lost you some advantages which you now have what conditions might have been obtained from france and spain i know not france appears in the treaty with great moderation in the eyes of europe and her aversion to continue the war could arise from no other motive spain appears to have conquered her predilection for gibraltar if therefore instead of wasting the force of forty or fifty ships to guard that rock she had acted with france in the west indies or against new york or both with twentyfive twenty or even only fifteen dutch ships in the north seas or the channel where would have been your hopes surely only in the defensive admitting what is very extravagantly improbable that you could have defended all another year at an expense    of twenty millions would you have been then able to demand better terms or your adversaries disposed to grant them i trow not on the contrary their courage and pretensions would have advanced america did you a very kind turn you may depend upon it when she rapidly hastened on the signature of the provisional treaty think of it as you will you would have had no peace at this hour but for this able seizure of the moment of the tide in the affairs of men for which you are indebted to mr oswald and his principals without this the negotiations would have dreamed on until destaing had sailed from cadiz and then voilà une autre campagne i should be very glad to see the better sort of pamphlets you mention and particularly some to show the policy and the necessity of an immediate evacuation of new york and penobscot i have the honor to be c john adams john adams    march      paris henry laurens to henry laurens paris    march      dear sir— appearances on the side where you are do not please me more than you but i hope the weather will clear up and that we shall soon have the pleasure of seeing you and mr oswald here to put the last hand to the peace it is not worth while for any noble lord to boast of his art in obtaining the provisional treaty without the knowledge of our great and good ally it was not owing to his art but how does he know what knowledge was communicated to our ally as to getting john adams  co hanged this would be no more than a hillsborough germaine or sandwich would have done if they could this would be no feat for a whig minister to boast of   0 this same hanging is however a grave business and perhaps the aforesaid company may have reflected upon the nature of it more seriously than his lordship unless it has struck him lately but i cannot think our country will hang her ministers merely for their simplicity in being cheated into independence the fisheries and half the great lakes our countrymen love buckskins beaverskins tomcod and pine trees too well to hang their ministers for accepting them or even for purchasing them by a little too much reciprocity to the tories be it as it may if a french minister and an english minister should form a coalition as curious as that of the fox and the geese to get j a hanged he is pretty well prepared for this or to be recalled or censured or flattered or slandered just as they please i wish i could see more serious preparations for evacuating new york and penobscot our people will not feel like freemen in friendship with great britain till this is done if any one thinks that keeping possession of new york will help the refugees he deceives himself great britains misfortunes have arisen from the ignorance in her rulers of the american character if ministers are incapable of learning it they never will succeed in addressing themselves to it if they think that fear will work for the refugees they will find it operate against them but why is the definitive treaty delayed congress will not take the preliminaries into consideration till they have the definitive treaty there can be no ratification until congress have that and in my opinion the states after the ratification and recommendations will take none of them into consideration until the united states are evacuated by the troops in this i may be mistaken my respects to your good family and believe me c john adams    francis dana    march      st petersburg john adams francis dana to john adams st petersburg    march      sir— yours of the   d of february has come to hand this moment and has given me much satisfaction i always admired the noble and independent spirit of my friend but i now see cause to admire it still more you have conferred additional obligations upon or to express myself otherwise you have rendered additional services to your country by breaking to pieces chains forged to hold it in a state of subserviency to the interests of others god and your country will approve the measure but there is nothing gives me more real pleasure than your determination to return to america i have only one request to make to you—that you will not decline a moment taking a seat in congress after your arrival there they want only proper information to lead them into proper measures the turn of thinking there must be changed and i know no man better calculated on every account to bring this about than yourself i beseech you therefore never to decline such an occasion by my last letter you will find my intention is if not to accompany you at least to follow you soon to america as to your advice to me to communicate my mission to the minister of the emperor and the ministers of all the other courts which have acceded to the armed neutrality i think at present it is not advisable to make this communication on that occasion for first i have no authority to make any commercial treaty with the emperor and as to that part of my commission which respects the armed neutrality or neutral confederation i have long since upon consideration given it to congress as my opinion that america could not become a party in it or accede formally to the marine convention so long as she continued a belligerent power and also that that convention from its terms and nature was limited to the duration of the war but if i should be mistaken in this last point i think it is not worth while for america at this time to pay near five thousand pounds sterling to the ministers of this court for the liberty of acceding to the marine convention and if it were i have not the money at my disposal the communication you are sensible must be general to all the parties to that confederation and of course to    this court to make the communication which would amount to a proposition on my part to accede to the convention and not to be able to do it for want of what i know is essential to the end would be only to expose the honor of the united states without the prospect of any advantage it is quite enough to pay five thousand pounds sterling for a treaty of commerce with this empire i think it my duty therefore to keep the marine convention out of sight as long as possible and to confine myself to the treaty of commerce into which i have adopted the leading principles of the marine convention and shall endeavor to conclude both points in one treaty if i fail in this i must fail in both and shall immediately quit this court i must exercise my discretion in some things and as you have done submit my conduct to the judgment of those whose right it is to decide upon it if they furnish me not with the means they must not expect the accomplishment of my mission i pray you to give me your advice upon these matters with the utmost freedom and as soon as possible though i have ventured not to follow it in this particular case yet i give you my reasons for not doing it that you might judge upon them and i am not the less obliged to you for your advice i have not received an answer in form to my letter communicating my mission to the vicechancellor but only a verbal message in excuse of the delay for a time entirely past i do not like this delay the immediate assurances mentioned in my letter in which i informed you of this communication came from a member of her majestys private cabinet who sought an interview with me for that occasion but i refer you to a passage in my last letter—i am sick c—god send me speedily a happy deliverance from them adieu my dear sir yours francis dana henry laurens    march      london john adams henry laurens to john adams london    march      dear sir— i was yesterday honored by the receipt of your letter of the   th inst that the noble lord did boast is beyond all doubt but i    had the good fortune to give a check to his success by propounding a question almost in terms with that which you have put how does his lordship know whether we conferred with or what we communicated to our ally but admitting the fact which i do not admit what then be assured that a disappointed and mortified shelburne maugre all pretensions to whiggism has as good a stomach for such a feat as even a hillsborough a germaine or the other secretary sandwich had i coincide exactly in your opinion on the delay of the definitive treaty the evacuation of new york the tories recommendations c and it is probable i have given a damp to the third edition for the provisional establishment and regulation of trade c by framing a counterbill supposed to be pending in each of the united states for regulating the british trade which i held up as a mirror to a noble lord and a few of the most eminent commoners the picture alarmed them and if i judge right a lead will be laid upon their bill you cannot think our country will hang their ministers for being cheated into independence fisheries c c i fancy not but be as grave as you please upon the subject believe me his lordship boasted of having cheated us into those great benefits and flattered himself with hopes that upon the same ground he would be able to cheat us out of them again i hope his wings will be clipt if the proper ministry should succeed i have every reason to expect an honest and liberal proceeding with respect to us will immediately ensue my opinion is founded upon the most explicit assurances from the very best hands the tories nicknamed loyalists are execrated by the circle in which i sometimes move and yet they say they must make some provision for some of the poor devils for national honors sake i reply make what provision you will it would be impertinent in me to interfere in that business but you must not attempt to cram them down our throats it is time you should know that america will not be taxed without her own consent i have uniformly discouraged all attempts to trade with the united states until the definitive treaty shall be concluded and the british forces by land and sea effectually withdrawn the reasonings which i have urged particularly personating the state of new york have been acknowledged invincible but some of the merchants are nevertheless mad    and will send their ships let them be mad i trust the united states will be wise i am dear sir c henry laurens john adams    april      paris to secretary livingston paris    april      sir— you may easily imagine our anxiety to hear from america when you know that we have no news to this hour either of your reception of the news of peace or of that of the treaty with holland four copies of which i put on board different vessels at amsterdam in october we have been in equal uncertainty about the turn which affairs might take in england but by letters from mr laurens we expect him every day and mr david hartley with him in order to complete the definitive treaty it would have been more agreeable to have finished with mr oswald but the present ministry are so dissatisfied with what is past as they say though nobody believes them that they choose to change hands it will be proposed i believe to make a temporary arrangement of commercial matters as our powers are not competent to a durable one if to any congress will no doubt soon send a minister with full powers as the treaty of commerce with great britain is of great importance and our affairs in that country require an overseer it is confidently asserted in letters from holland that m markow the minister plenipotentiary from the empress of russia has received from his mistress a full power to come to paris to the assistance of the prince bariatinski at a congress for a general pacification there is as yet no answer received from the emperor if the two imperial courts accept of the mediation there will be a congress but i suppose it will relate chiefly to the affairs of holland which are not yet arranged and to the liberty of neutral navigation which is their principal point i wish success to that republic in this negotiation which will help to compose their interior disorders which are alarming i know not whether it will be insisted or expected that we should join in the congress nor do i know what we have to do in it unless it be to settle that point as far as it relates to    us there is nothing in difference between us and great britain which we cannot adjust ourselves without any mediation a spring passage to america is so great an object that i should be very sorry to have the negotiations spun out to such a length as to oblige me to lose it and i take it for granted i shall now receive the acceptance of my resignation by the first ships i have the honor to be c john adams john adams    april      paris m dumas to m dumas paris    april      sir— in answer to the inquiry of m fagel you will please to inform him that the letters of credence of m van berckel should be addressed—to the united states of america in congress assembled friends and allies the king of france indeed has added the word great great friends and allies but i think it would be much better to leave out the word great and all other epithets congress have never assumed any other style and i hope they never will assume or receive any other i have the honor to be c john adams w wopkens v cats    avril      leeuwarde john adams the society of leeuwarden to john adams leeuwarde    avril      monsieur— nous avons enfin la satisfaction de voir achevée la médaille que nous avions projeté et dédié aux nobles et puissants seigneurs les états de frise votre excellence est instruite du but et du contenu de cette médaille par notre requête du   mai de

votre excellence de nous permettre de lui présenter deux de ces médailles lune pour servir au cas que votre excellence pût trouver bon de la présenter au congrès des treize états unis de lamérique    nous sommes en attendant charmés de voir que les états des autres provinces et consequemment la république entière ont à lexemple des états de frise reconnu la liberté et lindépendance de lamérique

même une base de bienêtre et de prospérité réciproques nous avons lhonneur de féliciter votre excellence de cet événement et de souhaiter du fond de nos cœurs que les travaux importants de votre

dans peu pour prix de sa valeur et de sa constance une paix glorieuse et durable et quelle croisse ensuite tellement en gloire et en puissance quelle puisse être leffroi des usurpateurs et des tyrans et un refuge toujours assuré aux opprimés veuille le dieu tout puissant répandre sa bénédiction sur ces souhaits et sur ces prières nous prenons la liberté de nous recommander à la bienveillance de

adams   may      paris francis dana to francis dana paris   may      sir— i have received your favor of the   th of march and in answer to it i do assure you that i do not intend to decline taking a seat in congress if any state in the confederation should think it worth while to offer me one i am grown very ambitious of being a limb of that sovereign i had rather be master than servant on the same principle that men swear at highgate—never to kiss the maid when they can kiss the mistress    i should be very happy to sit alongside of you upon one of those seats and rise up now and then and tell stories of our peregrinations and of the robbers we have met with in the highway but you must not quit till you have made your treaty i beg you would consider what i write to you as hints not as advice the reasons that you give for not taking some i gave you are very conclusive and had not occurred to me the first vessel will i hope bring you elucidations upon those points mr hartley is to finish with us and we are making preparations but cannot say how much time will be necessary they talk of a congress and mediation and mr markow is coming but there is no need of either on our affairs yet we may be invited to join it and who would not be ambitious of sitting in such a council of the celestials or rather who would not be curious to know by what sort of men this world is governed with great esteem c john adams john adams   may      paris m dumas to m dumas paris   may      sir— in answer to yours of the   th ultimo i can only say that i have no information of the united states having acceded to the armed neutrality on the contrary i have reasons to doubt it is it not astonishing that we have no news from america i cannot say when i shall be able to see you because i know not when the definitive treaty will be signed if we should have a congress to attend it is impossible to foresee how long we shall be detained for the delicacies etiquette and ceremonies of so many diplomatic sages will not glide away with such rapidity as the provisional treaty with mr oswald did when men meet upon business forenoon afternoon and evening every day they do a great deal and do it well but when they meet only two hours in a morning once a week they forget what was done at one meeting before another occurs i find that making treaties is very easy work when one has full powers not too much shackled with instructions and when there is but one minister on each side if i were a king which    i would not be for a world or a congress a member of which i hope to be i would not send more than one minister upon any one piece of service nor confine him by any instructions which should not be absolutely necessary i have the honor to be c john adams john adams  0 may      paris to the members of the society established at leeuwarden under the device by liberty and zeal paris  0 may      gentlemen— i have received the letter which you did me the honor to write me on the   th day of last month and the friendly sentiments it contains towards the united states of america deserve my warmest acknowledgments the resolutions of the states of friesland taken in the assemblies of february and april      do honor to that province the acknowledgment of the sovereignty of the united states of america and the refusal of a separate peace by their high mightinesses the statesgeneral was one of those critical decisions which sometimes turn the tide of the affairs of men and produce the unravelling of great scenes among nations it seemed to open the eyes of the british nation and to determine the fluctuating opinions of the whole world and consequently contributed very much to accelerate the peace the medals you did me the honor to present me with this letter are struck in great perfection and express with a beautiful simplicity the two great events they were intended to commemorate you will please to accept of my thanks for them the first favorable opportunity shall be taken to present one of them to congress as you desire your republic i am persuaded will have no cause to repent of the part she has taken in favor of america and may the friendship correspondence and alliance between the two nations be perpetual permit me to add my best wishes for the prosperity of your society and the felicity of your persons and families with great esteem and respect c john adams    john adams    may      paris robert morris to robert morris paris    may      sir— i am just now honored with yours of the   th of january by the way of london we have not yet had the happiness to receive as we should be disposed to do with open arms our excellent old friend jefferson and begin to fear that the news of peace has determined him not to come i thank you sir for your polite congratulations when the tide turned it flowed with rapidity and carried the vessel as i hope into a safe harbor as to the loan in holland i have never troubled you nor any one else in america with details of the vexations of various kinds which i met with in the negotiation of it indeed i never thought it prudent or safe to do it if i had told the whole truth it could have done no good and it might have done infinite mischief in general it is now sufficient to say that private interest party spirit factions cabals and slanders have obstructed perplexed and tortured our loan in holland as well as all our other affairs foreign and domestic but as there has been a greater variety of clashing interests—english french stadtholderian republican and american—mixing in the affair of our loan in holland it has been more puzzled than any thing else if in the bitterness of my soul i had described the fermentation and mentioned names and drawn characters i might have transmitted a curious tale but it would have only served to inflame old animosities and excite new ones a great many things are said to me on purpose that they may be represented to you or to congress some of these i believe to be false more of them i suspect and some that are true would do no good i think it necessary therefore to employ a little discretion in such cases messrs willink  co will write you from time to time as they tell me they have done the state of the loan mr grand wants all the money but they wait your orders the loan has been and will be damped by transmitting the money to france but your necessities were so urgent that you could not avoid it in my opinion if you had a minister at st jamess and he were authorized to borrow money generally in england or elsewhere  0 it would serve you greatly by causing an emulation even in holland besides the money you would procure in london which would not be a trifling sum i wish i were in congress that i might assist you in persuading our countrymen to pay taxes and build ships with great esteem c john adams john adams    may      paris to secretary livingston paris    may      sir— i have the honor to inclose copies to be laid before congress of several papers  st mr hartleys full powers of may   th  dly the order of the king of great britain in council for regulating the american trade of may   th  dly articles proposed by the american ministers to mr hartley april   th  thly mr hartleys observations left with us may   st and  thly mr hartleys proposition of the same day this proposition however upon inquiry we find mr hartley does not incline to subscribe to before he sends it to his court for their orders so that we have not yet given him our opinion of it he has sent a courier to london before whose return we hope to have further intelligence from philadelphia the present british ministry discover an indecision and timidity which indicate instability some persons from england imagine that my lord shelburne will come in again the change would produce a longer delay but i think would be no disadvantage to america if he had continued in power i think we should have finished or been ready to finish before now with mr oswald mr hartleys dispositions however are very good and if left to his own judgment would be liberal and fair the idea of reviving the trade upon the plan of the laws of great britain before the war although those laws were calculated so much for the advantage of that country and so little for the advantage of ours might be admissible for a few months until ministers could be appointed on both sides to frame a treaty of commerce provided no advantage should be ceded by it in the negotiation of such treaty and provided that such a    temporary convention for trade should neither delay nor influence the definitive treaty it is much to be wished that the definitive treaty of peace and a permanent treaty of commerce could be signed at the same time this however seems now to be impossible and therefore some temporary regulation of commerce seems unavoidable but we are as yet too uncertain of the sentiments of the court of st james to be able to foresee whether we shall agree with them mr hartley has been here four weeks and nothing has been done although he was very sanguine before he left london that he should send home a convention in less than half of four days congress will see by mr hartleys commission that they are become the good friends of the king of great britain mr hartley on his first arrival here communicated to us in form an invitation from the ministers with the knowledge and consent of the king to all the american ministers to go to london with the assurance that we should be there presented at court and treated in all respects like the ministers of any other sovereign state he also communicated the desire of his court that the two powers should interchange ministers as soon as possible i hope that the first ship will bring a minister for that court or a commission to some one to go there because i think it would have been useful to us to have had one there three months ago and that it would not be less useful now the permanent treaty of commerce nevertheless should not be hastily concluded nor before congress shall have had an opportunity to judge of the project suggest their amendments and transmit their orders no preliminaries are yet signed with the dutch and i am very anxious for their lot with great respect i have the honor to be c john adams william ellery henry marchant robert stevens william channing    may      newport john adams william ellery and others to john adams newport rhode island    may      sir— permit us the committee of the second congregational church in newport to call your attention for a few moments from the weighty affairs of politics in which you are so honorably and so usefully engaged to a matter which respects    a religious society to whose constitution we consider you as a friend the early and active part which our congregation took in the opposition to the arbitrary and oppressive measures of great britain you may be acquainted with but you may not be acquainted with our consequential sufferings our spirited conduct made us the object of ministerial and parliamentary vengeance sensible of the danger to which we were exposed and finding that the british intended to take possession of rhode island to avoid their implacable fury and that we might be able to continue our exertions both the minister and a great part of this society quitted the island the british took possession of it in december      and held it until october      during which time our meetinghouse and ministryhouse were converted into barracks and hospitals and afterwards when the french army made a garrison of the town of newport those buildings were occupied in the same manner and of course were left in a state of ruin besides this many of our houses were demolished or greatly damaged by the british army at our return finding the town impoverished nearly a third of its buildings destroyed its commerce annihilated and ourselves unable to sustain the expense of repairing our religious houses and resettling the congregation we cast our eyes on our sister states but many of their towns and places of public worship having suffered like injuries no relief could be drawn from them in this deplorable situation we have been compelled to look to our foreign protestant brethren for assistance and among them have thought it would not be improper to address the reformed churches in france conscious of your attachment to religious liberty in which our society is founded and of your disposition and capacity to support that glorious cause as well as the civil liberties of mankind we have ventured to inclose that address to your patronage and care and we request that you will be pleased to place it in the hands of such of the principal pastors of the reformed as you shall think will be best disposed to circulate subscriptions and otherwise make collections for the purpose of repairing our ministry and meetinghouse and towards a ministerial fund we would also request that you appoint a proper person to receive the donations which may be made and to transmit them    to william channing and robert stevens esquires in newport and assign to him thereout such commission as you shall judge reasonable we should have made our address to the good people in france at large but we were not sure that such an address would be well received by them or by government but as our houses devoted to religion were used in the manner that hath been mentioned by the french as well as british troops and considering the kind reception the former met with in newport perhaps generals rochambeau chattelux count noailles and other french officers might countenance our address the marquis de lafayette who well deserved and hath obtained all the honors the united states could confer upon him who hath done service in rhode island and whose generous spirit and principles forever prompt him to benevolent actions we do not doubt would contribute to our relief we have ventured this hint as we have our address and leave it entirely with you to do as you judge proper we would only add here that the general assembly of this state at a late session repealed an old law which excluded roman catholics from the privileges of citizenship hoping to derive some assistance from our brethren in holland we have drawn an application to the ministers and churches of the reformed in holland which as we are not acquainted with the proper mode of address we have taken the liberty to send open to you and would be much obliged to you if you would cover it address and transmit it we would attempt an apology for thus intruding and interrupting a train of thinking employed upon more extensive subjects but we are sure we shall find a powerful apologist in your generous breast we most sincerely congratulate you on your successful negotiations in the united provinces of the netherlands and on the share you have had in procuring preliminaries of peace so agreeable and so advantageous to the united states of america and heartily wishing you may enjoy a long uninterrupted series of health and prosperity we are with the highest sentiments of respect c c william ellery henry marchant robert stevens william channing    john adams  0 may      paris to secretary livingston paris  0 may      sir— on the   th of this month i received the letter which you did me the honor to write me on the   th of february which arrived at the hague inclosed with the ratification of the treaty with their high mightinesses which will be exchanged by m dumas as the conferences here for the definitive treaty will not admit of my taking so long a journey at this time this arrival in season to exchange the ratifications before the departure of m van berckel which will be in three weeks is fortunate i hope that the first ships from america will bring my letter of recall from that republic and another minister or credence to some one now in europe to take my place i am happy to find that any letters of mine in september last contained information that you think of consequence although not having my letterbook here i am not able to recollect the subject the final completion of the negotiation with holland gives me a pleasure which will not be equalled but by that of the definitive treaty of peace which languishes at present for want of decisive instructions from mr hartley in such a manner as gives cause to suspect that the present ministry are not firm in their seats the presence of a minister in holland would encourage your loan of money there but it would be quickened still more by your sending a minister to london with power to borrow money there emulation is the best spring or call it rivalry or jealousy if you will it will get you money if you put it in motion i have received two ciphers from you sir—one beginning with no   and ending with no  0   the other beginning with amsterdam and ending with provinces i have the honor to be c john adams    francis dana   june      st petersburg john adams francis dana to john adams st petersburg   june      dear sir— by the last post i sent an open letter for mr livingston under cover to you to give you what further information i had received relative to the memorial the week is past and nothing more has yet taken place this considering how affairs are conducted here is not really unexpected patience much patience indeed is necessary if i was sure congress would support me in it i would take another step of the propriety of which i have personally no doubt but to support it congress must resolve not to send another minister here when i quit the ground if half a score of such geniuses as you were there i would infallibly take it at every hazard if i have not a satisfactory answer to my memorial touching the gentlemans  doubt whether the credit was necessary he may be assured i should not have written for it if i had not been certain of the custom it is a matter of too much consequence to be taken upon slight information the sum to be paid is six thousand roubles for each signature and there are generally four appointed on their part which sum falls short of the credit i asked for more or less as the exchange varies it will not go beyond it i thought it advisable to have enough as whatever remained might be carried by me to the credit of the united states this is so settled a custom that every power which has acceded to the neutral confederation has paid it thus much to clear up scruples we should not have heard so much about the armed neutrality in this quarter if the case had been otherwise i have a curious tale to tell of this matter it would be a very proper place to tell that and some other things in where you wish now and then to throw out some stories about our peregrinations robbers c neither you nor they know the real state of matters here nor will they till my return if then which will depend upon contingencies i fear only the effects of delusion it is a great satisfaction to me to find the reasons i have assigned for not making the communication you spoke of are thought by you to be conclusive yet for the weighty reason    above mentioned there is a design to keep the bubble up it appears to be absolutely necessary for us to concern ourselves about it this is my clear opinion and if i was in that same place i would give my reasons at large for it fear not i will never engage you in any affair on account of your advice given as a friend to me where i ask it officially and expressly so the case is different your hints are always serviceable if i do not follow them they put me upon reflecting on the subject of them with more deliberation mr hartley you say is to finish with you do you mean by this as i suppose to conclude the definitive treaty the world tells us and mr fox seems to support it that his business is a commercial treaty i am ignorant if you have such powers i doubt it from what you last wrote me upon that subject the west india trade as tendered by mr pitts bill at least must be secured in this quarter of the world i see the whole importance of it i wrote to mr livingston upon that subject early last winter and proposed the same plan to him with this difference that we should have full liberty to export the west india commodities to all parts of the world by which means we should gain a most important commerce with europe the same duties only must be paid as their own subjects pay upon exportation to great britain this is absolutely necessary to secure the advantage of a direct commerce with europe without it they might enhance the price of the commodities upon us ad libitum as to the congress and mediation which you say are talked of i agree fully with you that there is no need of either on our affairs but how are you to be invited to join it if there was when objections are raised here by one of the mediators against the reception of a minister from the united states it would be a curiosity indeed if it should happen and yet it would not surprise me if it should when we once depart from fixed principles there are no inconsistencies and absurdities we may not fall into besides i should not be surprised if the other part of the business than what you mention should be thrown into the hands of     for i know there is an extreme jealousy entertained by the         about the treaty i have in contemplation    i have been told more than once we can have nothing in particular here that would render a treaty worth the expense of it indeed there might be some advantage in a political connection but this will be general to all nations the only difference by having a treaty would be the paying of duties in the money of russia instead of rixdollars and the expense would far exceed this advantage i have constantly favored these ideas and answered congress are desirous of having a commercial treaty with this empire they must be gratified and it is my business to make it if it cost them more than it is worth it is none of my fault judge you my friend from this and the confidential intelligence which i communicated to you in my letter by your son upon some circumstances which may have fallen under your knowledge yours c francis dana francis dana   june      st petersburg john adams francis dana to john adams st petersburg   june      dear sir— i yesterday received a letter from your son dated hague may   th containing some account of his route from hence to stockholm the matter contained in my confidential letter which you will receive from him i pray you most earnestly to keep a secret even after your arrival in america or in congress i have most substantial reasons for making this request i have additional reasons for thinking that jealousy of which i have spoken towards the close of my last letter but one exists in full force yesterday i was there upon a previous appointment relative to my main matter yet the same kind of conversation which you will find in that letter was renewed almost word for word it was entered into indeed more minutely than ever nor is this all        who we had agreed should be invited to the consultation upon the main matter evidently supported the same sentiments with all his ingenuity however they have not yet had my real sentiments upon the subject nor shall they have them i know i flatter myself the interests of our country as well as they do at least i declare to you at the same time that very possibly the hare would not be worth hunting in the common course i have long had in contemplation    some special views in this business grounded in local knowledge whether i should be able to succeed in them is not certain if i should not to a certain degree it is always in my power to wave the whole business it is kind in our friends to take so serious a concern in our interests however i have not yet received any answer to my memorial but i was yesterday informed by my private friend that i should have it on monday or tuesday next by this delay i am inclined to think they wait only for the accounts of the conclusion of the definitive treaty when the idea of mediation will be done away this is daily expected the other objections may be then waved and thus the matter be compounded it would perhaps be thought to be too humiliating to give them all up a safe voyage to you c francis dana john adams  0 june      paris edward a holyoke to edward a holyoke paris  0 june      sir— upon an intimation from my friend dr tufts of weymouth that the medical society of which you are president desired to extend its connections in europe i ventured to apply to the chiefs of the royal society of medicine at paris and met with a more complaisant reception than i expected inclosed are copies of letters which have passed upon the occasion and of the diploma which is the result of them the originals i shall bring with me or send by a careful hand i hope the medical society will pardon my presumption in going so far without their authority but the proposition once hinted at was received with so much earnestness that i could not recede with great respect c john adams m vicq

vous prie de vouloir bien le faire parvenir aux membres illustres qui composent le collége de boston parmi le petit nombre dexemplaires du journal de médecine militaire dont elle peut disposer elle en a réservé un pour la bibliothèque du collége de boston elle a désiré que je vous ladresse pour cette compagnie et elle la prie de lagréer comme une marque de sa déférence et de son attachement je le

of the second volume of the journal of military medicine which you have addressed to me i have the honor to thank you for them i shall transmit both to the medical college of boston the members of which will feel highly flattered by an association with this celebrated society making them participate in its renown as well as in the benefits of its labors they will find in its works the aid of which they stand in need and the means of coöperating with its salutary purposes they will be very earnest the moment they know all that has been done for them to signify their gratitude and their respectful regard in the interval before they have the power of communicating their sentiments i pray you sir to beg permission for me to assure the society of the respect with which i am c c john adams m lassone   juin      paris john adams m lassone to john adams paris   juin      monsieur— je me suis trouvé à la séance de la société royale de médecine lorsque m vicq dazyr nous a fait part du désir que vous lui avez témoigné de voir établir une correspondance  0 entre le collége de médecine de boston et cette compagnie cette proposition étoit trop flatteuse pour la société pour quelle ne sempressa point de vous en témoigner sa reconnoissance par lintermède de son secrétaire comme japprends avec plaisir par votre lettre du  0 décembre dernier quil a eu soin de sen acquitter soyez persuadé monsieur que la société royale qui saisit toutes les occasions de rendre ses recherches plus généralement utiles par les liaisons quelle aime à contracter et à entretenir avec les différentes compagnies savantes nationales et étrangères ne laissera échapper aucune circonstance dans laquelle elle croira pouvoir donner au collège de médecine de boston des preuves de son amitié et de son dévouement jai lhonneur dêtre c lassone john adams    june      paris to secretary livingston paris    june      sir— yesterday afternoon the duplicate of your letter of the   th of april no    was brought in to me with the postmark brest upon it as soon as i had read it i went out to passy in hopes that other despatches had arrived there but i found none while i was there a packet of newspapers addressed to us all was brought in with the postmark of brest on it i still hope and believe that other despatches by the same conveyance will appear in a few days but whether they are still in the postoffice or whether the duc de lauzun intends to bring them in person is uncertain i think sir there is no room to doubt the justice of your opinion that the latitude of the canaries is meant and consequently that hostilities ceased on the whole coast of the united states on the  d of march i am well aware that a variety of questions may be started upon the provisional articles the great points of sovereignty limits and fisheries are sufficiently clear but there are too many other things in much obscurity no one of us alone would ever have put his hand to such a writing yet there is no one to blame it must be confessed that it was done in haste but that haste was inevitable the peace depended absolutely upon the critical moment when that treaty was    signed the meeting of parliament was so near and the state of the ministry so critical that if that opportunity had been lost there would have been at least another campaign there were never less than three of us and there were finally no less than three to be consulted on the other side these inaccuracies are much to be lamented but they were quite unavoidable we shall endeavor to explain them in the definitive treaty but i fear without success i hope sir you will excuse me if i think your expressions fall short of the real merit of the dutch if they had accepted the russian mediation for a separate peace we should have seen a very formidable difference the vast weight of the dutch in the east indies being added to that of france has influenced the minds of the natives in such a manner as to turn the scale against england the cape of good hope was indispensable to france and we are not yet informed what proportion of the expense of french operations in the east indies is to be borne by the dutch east india company at whose solicitations by their agents sent early to versailles they were undertaken from twelve to fifteen british ships of the line in the best condition with the best officers and men have been kept almost constantly in the north seas to watch the dutch a momentous diversion which made the balance more clear in favor of the allies in the east and west indies as well as in the channel and it may be added and that with strict truth the battle of doggerbank imprinted more terror on the imaginations of the british navy and nation than all the other sea engagements of the war your observations of their unfortunate situation are however very just and their exertions have not been such as they might and ought to have been but this was the fault of the enemies of france in holland not of her friends and unhappily those enemies are to be gratified by the terms of peace prescribed to that power and those friends mortified and this misfortune probably arises from the instructions in question by which they made themselves of no importance instead of acting the part of a sovereign independent and respectable power if they had held their own negotiation in their own hands they would probably have obtained better terms i could mention many facts and anecdotes of much importance but these have been communicated    to me in confidence and as this is a discussion that concerns us only indirectly and as our instructions were parallel to theirs although the execution of them was different and the event different i shall wave any further observations upon the subject we are happy to learn that congress have ratified the treaty imperfect as it is and that each side has released its prisoners mr hartley communicated to us officially two days ago that orders were gone to new york to evacuate the united states dr franklin has never made any use of the bills for my salary and i have never received any part of them i shall easily settle that matter when i get home which your letter encourages me to hope will be very soon the connections i have formed in holland may be of use to the public wherever i may be in america or elsewhere as well as even in that country itself those connections will readily become those of any minister congress may send there it cost me all my happiness and had very nearly cost me my life to form them it cost me more it has left me in an ill state of health which i never shall fully repair i shall carry holland in my veins to my grave it will cost no man any thing to go there now his mind will be at ease and he will have spirits necessary to take care to preserve his health to me it has become physically necessary as well as a moral and religious duty to join my family this can be done only by going to them or bringing them to me and to bring them to holland is what i cannot think of both because that on account of my own health as well as theirs and on other considerations i should not choose to live among those putrid lakes and because i think i can do my country more and better service at home than there i will not disguise another motive which would be altogether insurmountable if it were alone i do not think it consistent with the honor of the united states any more than with my own for me to stay in holland after the appointment of any other minister whatsoever to the mission upon which i came to europe and which has been taken from me without assigning any reasons congress are the sovereign judges for themselves and the public of the persons proper for all services excepting that every citizen is a sovereign judge for himself i have never adopted the principle that it is a citizens duty to accept of any    trust that is pointed out to him unless he approves of it on the contrary i think it a right and a duty that no law of society can take away for every man to judge for himself whether he can serve consistently with his own honor and the honor and interest of the public when the existence of our country and her essential interests were at stake it was a duty to run all risks to stifle every feeling to sacrifice every interest and this duty i have discharged with patience and perseverance and with a success that can be attributed only to providence but in time of peace the public in less danger abroad than at home knowing i can do more good at home i should do a very wrong thing to remove my family to stay in holland merely for the sake of holding an honorable commission making and receiving bows and compliments and eating splendid suppers at court there is one piece of advice i beg leave to offer to the minister who may go to holland respecting a future loan of money it is to inquire whether the house of hope would undertake a loan for us either in conjunction with the houses who have the present one or with any of them or alone in my private opinion which ought to be kept as secret as possible we might obtain a large loan in that way and that we cannot in any other the people in that interest have the money i am not personally known to that house nor any one of them to me but i know they are all powerful in money matters and i believe they would engage the happy turn given to the discontents of the army by the general is consistent with his character which as you observe is above all praise as every character is whose rule and object are duty not interest nor glory which i think has been strictly true with the general from the beginning and i trust will continue to the end may he long live and enjoy his own reflections and the confidence and affections of a free grateful and virtuous people i have the honor to be c john adams    john adams    june      paris to secretary livingston paris    june      sir— the british nation and ministry are in a very unsettled state they find themselves in a new situation and have not digested any plan ireland is in a new situation she is independent of parliament and the english know not how to manage her to what an extent she will claim a right of trading with the united states is unknown canada too and nova scotia are in a new situation the former they say must have a new government but what form to give them and indeed what kind of government they are capable of or would be agreeable to them is uncertain nothing is digested there is a party composed probably of refugees friends of the old hostile system and fomented by emissaries of several foreign nations who do not wish a cordial reconciliation and sincere friendship between great britain and the united states who clamor for the conservation of the navigation act and the carrying trade if these should succeed so far as to excite parliament or the ministry to adopt a contracted principle to exclude us from the west india trade and from trading with canada and nova scotia and from carrying freely in vessels belonging to any one of the thirteen states the production of any other to great britain the consequences may be to perplex us for a time may bind us closer to france spain holland germany italy and the northern nations and thus be fatal to great britain without being finally very hurtful to us the nations of europe who have islands in the west indies have at this moment a delicate part to take upon their present decisions great things will depend the commerce of the west india islands is a part of the american system of commerce they can neither do without us nor we without them the creator has placed us upon the globe in such a situation that we have occasion for each other we have the means of assisting each other and politicians and artful contrivances cannot separate us wise statesmen like able artists of every kind study nature and their works are perfect in proportion as they conform to her laws obstinate attempts to prevent the islands and the continent by force or policy from deriving from each    other those blessings which nature has enabled them to afford will only put both to thinking of means of coming together and an injudicious regulation at this time may lay a foundation for intimate combinations between the islands and the continent which otherwise would not be wished for or thought of by either if the french dutch and danes have common sense they will profit of any blunder great britain may commit upon this occasion the ideas of the british cabinet and merchants at present are so confused upon all these subjects that we can get them to agree to nothing i still think that the best policy of the united states is to send a minister to london to negotiate a treaty of commerce instructed to conclude nothing not the smallest article until he has sent it to congress and received their approbation in the mean time congress may admit any british or irish ships that have arrived or may arrive to trade as they please for my own part i confess i would not advise congress to bind themselves to any thing that is not reasonable and just if we should agree to revive the trade upon the old footing it is the utmost that can with a color of justice or modesty be requested of us this is not equal but might be borne rather than go further and deny ourselves the freight from the west indies to europe at least to great britain especially rather than give away our own carrying trade by agreeing that the ships of one state should not carry to great britain the produce of another i would be for entering into still closer connections with france spain and holland and purchase of them at the expense of great britain what she has not wisdom enough to allow us for her own good i have the honor to be c john adams john adams    june      paris to secretary livingston paris    june      sir— yesterday dr franklin mr jay and myself met to prepare the definitive treaty and made so much progress in it that tomorrow we shall be ready to communicate to mr hartley    the result but i have small hopes of obtaining any thing more by the definitive treaty the duke of manchester and count daranda have arranged every thing between england and spain and are ready to finish for their two courts france i presume waits only for holland or perhaps for some other negotiation with the imperial courts if all the other parties were now to declare themselves ready we should be puzzled in such a case however i am determined and i believe but do not know that my colleagues would join me to declare myself ready to sign the provisional treaty totidem verbis for a definitive treaty from all i can learn i am persuaded we shall gain nothing by any further negotiation if we obtain any thing by way of addition or explanation we shall be obliged to give more for it than it is worth if the british minister refuses to agree to such changes as we may think reasonable and refuses to sign the provisional articles as definitive ones i take it for granted france will not sign till we do if they should we are still safe for the provisional articles are to constitute the treaty as soon as france has made peace and i should rather leave it on that footing than make any material alteration i have put these several cases because i should be surprised at nothing from the present british ministry if they have any plan at all it is a much less generous one towards america than that of their immediate predecessors if shelburne townshend pitt c had continued we should have had every thing settled long ago to our entire satisfaction and to the infinite advantage of great britain and america in such a manner as would have restored good humor and affection as far as in the nature of things they can now be restored after the great point of acknowledging our independence was got over by issuing mr oswalds last commission the shelburne administration conducted themselves towards us like men of sense and honor the present administration has discovered neither understanding nor sincerity the present british administration is unpopular and it is in itself so heterogeneous a composition that it seems impossible it should last long their present design seems to be not to commit themselves by agreeing to any thing as soon as any thing is done somebody will clamor while nothing is done it is not known what to clamor    about if there should be a change in favor of the ministry that made the peace and a dissolution of this profligate league which they call the coalition it would be much for the good of all who speak the english language if fame says true the coalition was formed at gambling tables and is conducted as it was formed upon no other than gambling principles such is the fate of a nation which stands tottering on the brink of a precipice with a debt of two hundred and fiftysix millions sterling on its shoulders the interest of which added to the peace establishment only exceeds by above a million annually all their revenues enormously and intolerably as they are already taxed the only chance they have for salvation is in a reform and in recovering the affection of america the last ministry were sensible of this and acted accordingly the present ministry are so far from being sensible of it or caring about it that they seem to me to be throwing the last dice for the destruction of their country i have the honor to be c john adams john adams   july      paris to secretary livingston paris   july      sir— on the last ambassadors day which was last tuesday dr franklin mr jay and myself waited on m de vergennes who told us he thought he had agreed with the duke of manchester but that his grace had not yet received the positive approbation of his court the count advised us to make a visit all together to the ambassadors of the two imperial courts accordingly yesterday morning we went first to the count de mercy argenteau the ambassador of the emperor of germany and king of hungary and bohemia his excellency was not at home so we left a card we went next to the prince bariatinski minister plenipotentiary from the empress of russia our servant asked if the prince was at home and received for answer that he was we were shown into the princes apartment who received us very politely while we were here mr markow came in he is also a minister plenipotentiary adjoined to the prince in the affair of the mediation i told him we proposed to do ourselves the honor    of calling on him he answered as you are an old acquaintance i shall be very happy to see you whether this was a turn of politeness or whether it was a political distinction i know not we shall soon know by his returning or not returning the visit the prince asked me where i lodged and i told him this indicates an intention to return the visit we went next to the dutch ambassadors m lestevenon de berkenrode he was not at home or not visible next to the baron de blome envoy extraordinary of the king of denmark not at home next to m markow the porter answered that he was at home we alighted and were going to his apartment when we were told that he was not come in we left a card and went to the other dutch ambassadors m brantzen who was not at home en passant we left a card at the swedish ministers and returned home the heat being too excessive to pursue our visits any further thus we have made visits to all the ministers who are to be present at the signature of the definitive treaty whether the ministers of the imperial courts will be present i know not there are many appearances of a coldness between france and russia and the emperor seems to waver between two opinions whether to join in the war that threatens or to avoid it perhaps the ministers of the imperial courts will write for instructions whether to return our visit or not although in your latest letters you say nothing of my resignation or the acceptance of it i expect to receive it soon and then i shall have an opportunity to settle the affair of my salary at philadelphia after reading your letters to me i went out to passy to see those addressed to us all dr franklin mr jay and myself mr laurens being still in england read them all over together we shall do all in our power to procure the advantages in the definitive treaty to which we are instructed to attend the state of parties is such in england that it is impossible to foresee when there will be a ministry who will dare to take any step at all the coalition between lord north and his connections and mr fox and his is a rope of sand mr fox by pushing the vote in the house of commons disapproving the peace and by joining so many of the old ministers in the new administration has justly excited so many jealousies of his    sincerity that no confidence can be placed in him by us i am extremely sorry that the most amiable men in the nation—portland and the cavendishes—should have involved themselves in the same reproach in short at present shelburne pitt townshend and the administration of which they were members seem to have been the only ones who for a moment had just notions of their country and ours whether these men if now called to power would pursue their former ideas i know not the bible teaches us not to put our trust in princes and a fortiori in ministers of state the west india commerce now gives us most anxiety if the former british ministry had stood we might have secured it from england and in that case france would have been obliged to admit us to their islands se defendendo the first maxim of a statesman as well as that of a statuary or a painter should be to study nature to cast his eyes round about his country and see what advantages nature has given it this was well attended to in the boundary between the united states and canada and in the fisheries the commerce of the west india islands falls necessarily into the natural system of the commerce of the united states we are necessary to them and they to us and there will be a commerce between us if the governments forbid it it will be carried on clandestinely france can more easily connive at a contraband trade than england but we ought to wish to avoid the temptation to this i believe that neither france nor england will allow us to transport the productions of their islands to other parts of europe the utmost we may hope to obtain would be permission to import the productions of the french islands into france giving bond to land them in some port of that kingdom and the productions of the english islands into some port of great britain giving bonds to land them there it must however be the care of the minister who may have to negotiate a treaty of commerce with great britain to obtain as ample freedom in this trade as possible while i was writing the above my servant announced the imperial ambassador whom i rose to receive he said he was happy that the circumstances of the times afforded him an opportunity of forming an acquaintance with me which he hoped would be improved into a more intimate one i said  0 his excellency did me great honor and begged him to sit which he did and fell into a conversation of an hour we ran over a variety of subjects particularly the commerce which might take place between the united states and germany by the way of trieste and fiume and the austrian netherlands and the great disposition in germany to migration to america he says he knows the country round about trieste very well having an estate there that it is a very extensive and a very rich country which communicates with that maritime city and that the navigation of the adriatic sea though long is not dangerous i asked him what we should do with the barbary powers he said he thought all the powers of the world ought to unite in the suppression of such a detestable race of pirates and that the emperor had lately made an insinuation to the porte upon the subject i asked him if he thought france and england would agree to such a project observing that i had heard that some englishmen had said if there were no algiers england ought to build one he said he could not answer for england it is unnecessary to repeat any more of the conversation which turned upon the sober frugal and industrious character of the germans the best cultivators in europe and the dishonorable traffic of some of the german princes in men a subject he introduced and enlarged on himself i said nothing about it rising up to take leave he repeated several compliments he had made when he first came in and added the count de vergennes will do me the honor to dine with me one of these days and i hope to have that of your company we will then talk of an affair upon which the count de vergennes will speak to you beforehand this shows there is something in agitation but what it is i cannot conjecture whether it is to induce us to make the compliment to the two imperial courts to sign the definitive treaty as mediators whether there is any project of an association for the liberty of navigation or whether it is any other thing i cannot guess at present but i will write you as soon as i know whatever it is we must treat it with respect but we shall be very careful how we engage our country in measures of consequence without being clear of our powers and without the instructions of congress    i went out to passy and found from mr jay that he had made his visit there in the course of the day but had said nothing to dr franklin or him about the dinner with the count de vergennes in the course of the day i had visits from the prince bariatinski and m de markow the two ministers of the empress of russia the porter told these gentlemens servants that i was at home but they did not come up they only sent up their cards while i was gone to passy monsieur de blome envoy extraordinary from the king of denmark called and left his card thus the point of etiquette seems to be settled and we are to be treated in character by all the powers of europe i have the honor to be c john adams john adams   july      paris robert morris to robert morris paris   july      sir— your favors of the   th and   th of may were delivered to me on the  d of this month by captain barney every assistance in my power shall be given to mr barclay mr grand will write you the amount of all the bills which have been paid in holland which were accepted by me you may banish your fears of a double payment of any one bill i never accepted a bill without taking down in writing a very particular description of it nor without examining the book to see whether it had been accepted before i sent regularly in the time of it copies of these acceptances to dr franklin and i have now asked him to lend them to me that i may copy them and send them to you the doctor has promised to look up my letters and let me have them the originals are at the hague with multitudes of other papers which i want every day among the many disagreeable circumstances attending my duty in europe it is not the least that instead of being fixed to any one station i have been perpetually danced about from post to pillar unable to have my books and papers with me unable to have about me the conveniences of a housekeeper for health pleasure or business but yet subjected in many articles to double expenses    mr livingston has not informed me of any determination of congress upon my letter to you of the   th of november which distresses me much on mr thaxters account who certainly merits more than he has received or can receive without the favor of congress i thank you sir most affectionately for your kind congratulation on the peace our late enemies always clamor against a peace but this one is better for them than they had reason to expect after so mad a war our countrymen too i suppose are not quite satisfied this thing and that thing should have been otherwise no doubt if any man blames us i wish him no other punishment than to have if that were possible just such another peace to negotiate exactly in our situation i cannot look back upon this event without the most affecting sentiments when i consider the number of nations concerned the complication of interests extending all over the globe the characters of actors the difficulties which attended every step of the progress how every thing labored in england france spain and holland that the armament at cadiz was upon the point of sailing which would have rendered another campaign inevitable that another campaign would have probably involved france in a continental war as the emperor would in that case have joined russia against the porte that the british ministry was then in so critical a situation that its duration for a week or a day depended upon its making peace that if that ministry had been changed it could have been succeeded only either by north and company or by the coalition that it is certain that neither north and company nor the coalition would have made peace upon any terms that either we or the other powers would have agreed to and that all these difficulties were dissipated by one decided step of the british and american ministers i feel too strongly a gratitude to heaven for having been conducted safely through the storm to be very solicitous whether we have the approbation of mortals or not a delay of one day might and probably would have changed the ministry in england in which case all would have been lost if after we had agreed with mr oswald we had gone to versailles to show the result to the count de vergennes you would have been this moment at war and god knows how or when you would have got out what would have been the course    the count de vergennes would have sprinkled us with compliments the holy water of a court he would have told us you have done gentlemen very well for your country you have gained a great deal i congratulate you upon it but you must not sign till we are ready we must sign altogether here in this room what would have been our situation we must have signed against this advice as mr laurens says he would have done and as i believe mr jay and i should have done which would have been the most marked affront that could have been offered or we must have waited for france and spain which would have changed the ministry in england and lost the whole peace as certainly as there is a world in being when a few frail vessels are navigating among innumerable mountains of ice driven by various winds and drawn by various currents and a narrow crevice appears to one by which all may escape if that one improves the moment and sets the example it will not do to stand upon ceremonies and ask which shall go first or that all may go together i hope you will excuse this little excursion and believe me to be with great respect and esteem c john adams john adams   july      paris to secretary livingston paris   july      sir— we cannot as yet obtain from mr hartley or his principals an explicit consent to any one proposition whatever yet england and france and england and spain are probably agreed and holland i suppose must comply our last resource must be to say we are ready to sign the provisional treaty totidem verbis as the definitive treaty i think it is plain that the british ministry do not intend to sign any treaty till parliament rises there are such dissensions in the cabinet that they apprehend a treaty laid before parliament if it did not obtain advantages of which they have no hopes would furnish materials to overthrow them a new administration is talked of under lord temple the west india commerce is now the object that interests us the most nearly at dinner with the duc de la vauguyon    on saturday last he told me that he believed the commerce between the french west india islands and the united states would be confined to ships built in france and navigated by french seamen so then m le duc said i laughing you have adopted the ideas of the british navigation act but what if the united states should adopt them too and make a law that no commerce should be carried on with any west india islands—french english spanish dutch or danish—but in ships built in america and navigated with american seamen we can import sugar from europe but give me leave to tell you that this trade can never be carried on by the french their vessels are all large and navigated by a great number of seamen and your navigators are too slow the trade itself was only profitable to us as a system and little vessels with a few hands run away at any season of the year from any creek or river with a multitude of little articles collected in haste your merchants and mariners have neither the patience to content themselves with much and long labor and dangerous voyages for small profits nor have they the economy nor can they navigate vessels with so few hands ay but we think said the duke if we do not try we shall never learn to do these things as well and as cheap as you the duke told me he had had some days before a great deal of conversation with the count de vergennes and he found he had a great many good ideas of commerce the count himself told me a few weeks ago in our regulations of the commerce between our islands and you we must have regard to our shipping and our nurseries of seamen for our marine for said he smiling politely enough without a marine we cannot go to your succor in short france begins to grow for a moment avaricious of navigation and seamen but it is certain that neither the form of government nor the national character can possibly admit of great success in it navigation is so dangerous a business and requires so much patience and produces so little profit among nations who understand it best and have the best advantages for it where property is most secure lawsuits soonest and cheapest ended and by fixed certain laws that the french can never interfere much with the dutch or americans in ship building or carrying trade if any french merchants ever begin to carry on this commerce between america and the islands they will break    to pieces very soon and then some new plan must be adopted the english for aught i know will make a similar law that the communication between us and their islands shall be carried on in british built ships or ships built in canada or nova scotia and navigated by british seamen in this case we must try what we can do with the dutch and danes but the french and english will endeavor to persuade them to the same policy for the duc de la vauguyon told me that he thought it a common tie lien commun in this they will not succeed and we must make the most we can of the dutch friendship for luckily the merchants and regency of amsterdam had too much wit to exclude us from their islands by the treaty happily congress will have a dutch minister with whom they may consult upon this matter as well as many others but i should think it would not be convenient to invite an english or french minister to be present at the consultation i am at a loss sir to guess what propositions made to us congress have been informed of which they had not learned from us none have been made to us the dutch ambassadors did once propose a meeting to us and had it at my house dr franklin came but mr jay did not and mr laurens was absent the ambassadors desired to know whether we had power to enter into any engagements provided france spain and holland should agree to any in support of the armed neutrality we showed them the resolution of congress of the  th of october    0 and told them that mr dana had been since vested with a particular commission to the same effect we never heard any thing further about it not seeing at the time any probability that any thing would come of this nor intending to do any thing of any consequence in it if we should hear further of it without the further orders of congress we did not think it necessary to write any thing about it at least till it should put on a more serious appearance if the count de mercys dinner to which we are to be invited with the count de vergennes should produce any insinuations on this subject which i do not however expect we shall inform you and request the orders of congress i have the honor to be c john adams    john adams   july      paris to secretary livingston paris   july      sir— since the dangerous fever i had in amsterdam two years ago i have never enjoyed my health through the whole of the past winter and spring i have suffered under weaknesses and pains which have scarcely permitted me to do business the excessive heats of the last week or two have brought on me a fever again which exhausts one in such a manner as to be very discouraging and incapacitates one for every thing in short nothing but a return to america will ever restore my health if even that should do it in these circumstances however we have negotiations to go through and your despatches to answer the liberal sentiments in england respecting the trade are all lost for the present and we can get no answer to any thing it is the same thing with the dutch one of the dutch ambassadors told me yesterday at versailles that now for five weeks the english had never said one word to them nor given them any answer these things indicate that the ministry do not think themselves permanent the count de vergennes asked dr franklin and me yesterday if we had made our visits we answered that we had and that they had been promptly returned the thing in agitation said the count is for you to determine whether your definitive treaty shall be signed under the mediation of the two imperial courts or not ours and the spanish treaty with england are to be so finished and if you determine in favor of it you have only to write a letter to the ministers of the imperial courts who are here i told him in the present case i did not know what a mediation meant he smiled but did not seem to know any better than i at least he did not explain it we told him we would determine upon it soon how we shall determine i cannot say for my own part i see no harm in accepting the mediation nor any other good than a compliment to the two empires in europe it may be thought an honor to us and therefore i shall give my voice as at present informed in favor of it as it seems rather to be the inclination of the count de vergennes that we should    your late despatches sir are not well adapted to give spirits to a melancholy man or to cure one sick with a fever it is not possible for me at present to enter into a long detail in answer to them you will be answered i suppose by all the gentlemen jointly in the mean time i beg leave to say to you a few words upon two points  st the separate article never appeared to me of any consequence to conceal from this court it was an agreement we had a right to make it contained no injury to france or spain indeed i know not what france has or ever had to do with it if it had been communicated to this court it would probably have been by them communicated to spain and she might have thought more about it than it was worth but how you could conceive it possible for us to treat at all with the english upon supposition that we had communicated every the minutest thing to this court when this court were neither obliged nor thought proper to communicate any thing whatever to us i know not we were bound by treaty no more than they to communicate the instructions were found to be absolutely impracticable that they were too suddenly published is very true  dly a communication of the treaty to this court after it was agreed upon and before it was signed would have infallibly prevented the whole peace in the first place it was very doubtful or rather on the contrary it is certain the english minister never would have consented that we should communicate it we might it is true have done it without his consent or knowledge but what would have been the consequence the french minister would have said the terms were very good for us but we must not sign till they signed and this would have been a continuance of the war for another year at least it was not so much from an apprehension that the french would have exerted themselves to get away from us terms that were agreed on that they were withheld it was then too late and we have reason to apprehend that all of this kind had been done which could be done we knew they were often insinuating to the british ministers things against us respecting the fisheries tories c during the negotiation and mr fitzherbert told me that the count de vergennes had fifty times reproached him for ceding the fisheries and said it was ruining the english and french commerce both it was not    suspicion it was certain knowledge that they were against us on the points of the tories fisheries mississippi and the western country all this knowledge however did not influence us to conceal the treaty we did not in fact conceal it dr franklin communicated the substance of it to the count and m de rayneval so did i in a long conversation with the count and m de rayneval together i told them the substance of what was agreed upon and what we further insisted on and the english then disputed but the signing before them is the point this we could not have done if we had shown the treaty and told them we were ready the count would certainly have said to us you must not sign till we sign to have signed after this would have been more disagreeable to him and to us too yet we must have signed or lost the peace the peace depended on a day parliament had been waiting long and once prorogued the minister was so pressed he could not have met parliament and held his place without an agreement upon terms at least with america if we had not signed the ministry would have been changed and the coalition come in and the whole world knows the coalition would not have made peace upon the present terms and consequently not at all this year the iron was struck in the few critical moments when it was of a proper heat and has been moulded into a handsome vessel if it had been suffered to cool it would have flown in pieces like glass our countrymen have great reason to rejoice that they have obtained so good a peace when and as they did with the present threatening appearances of a northern war which will draw in france if our peace was still to be made we might find cause to tremble for many great advantages that are now secured i believe the count himself if he were now to speak his real sentiments would say he is very glad we signed when we did and that without asking his consent the duc de la vauguyon told me and m brantzen together last saturday if you had not signed when you did we should not have signed when we did if they had not signed when they did destaing would have sailed from cadiz and in that case nobody would have signed to this day it is not possible for men to be in more disagreeable circumstances than we were we are none of us men of principles or dispositions to take    pleasure in going against your sentiments sir much less those of congress but in this case if we had not done it our country would have lost advantages beyond computation on monday sir we pursued our visits and today we finish yesterday at court all the foreign ministers behaved to us without reserve as members of the corps diplomatique so that we shall no longer see those lowering countenances solemn looks distant bows and other peculiarities which have been sometimes diverting and sometimes provoking for so many years i have the honor to be c john adams john adams  0 july      paris to secretary livingston paris  0 july      sir— in the present violent heat of the weather and feverish state of my health i cannot pretend to sit long at my pen and must pray you to accept of a few short hints only to talk in a general style of confidence in the french court c is to use a general language which may mean almost any thing or almost nothing to a certain degree and as far as the treaties and engagements extend i have as much confidence in the french court as congress has or even as you sir appear to have but if by confidence in the french court is meant an opinion that the french office of foreign affairs would be advocates with the english for our rights to the fisheries or to the mississippi river or our western territory or advocates to persuade the british ministers to give up the cause of the refugees and make parliamentary provision for them i own i have no such confidence and never had seeing and hearing what i have seen and heard i must have been an idiot to have entertained such confidence i should be more of a machiavelian or a jesuit than i ever was or will be to counterfeit it to you or to congress m marbois letter is to me full proof of the principles of the count de vergènnes why because i know for it was personally communicated to me upon my passage home by m marbois himself the intimacy and confidence there is between these two and i know further that letter contains sentiments  0 concerning the fisheries diametrically opposite to those which m marbois repeatedly expressed to me upon the passage namely that the newfoundland fishery was our right and we ought to maintain it from whence i conclude m marbois sentiments have been changed by the instructions of the minister to what purpose is it where this letter came from is it less genuine whether it came from philadelphia versailles or london what if it came through english hands is there less weight less evidence in it for that are the sentiments more just or more friendly to us for that m de raynevals correspondence too with mr jay m de rayneval is a chef de bureau but we must be very ignorant of all courts not to know that an under secretary of state dares not carry on such a correspondence without the knowledge consent and orders of the principal there is another point now in agitation in which the french will never give us one good word on the contrary they will say every thing they can think of to persuade the english to deprive us of the trade of their west india islands they have already with their emissaries been the chief cause of the change of sentiments in london on this head against us in general they see with pain every appearance of returning real and cordial friendship such as may be permanent between us and great britain on the contrary they see with pleasure every seed of contention between us the tories are an excellent engine of mischief between us and are therefore very precious exclusion from the west india islands will be another i hold it to be the indispensable duty of my station not to conceal from congress these truths do not let us be dupes under the idea of being grateful innumerable anecdotes happen daily to show that these sentiments are general in conversation a few weeks ago with the duc de la vauguyon upon the subject of the west india trade i endeavored to convince him that france and england both ought to admit us freely to their islands he entered into a long argument to prove that both ought to exclude us at last i said the english were a parcel of sots to exclude us for the consequence would be that in fifteen or twenty years we should have another war with them tant mieux tant mieux je vous en félicite cried the duke with great pleasure tant mieux pour nous said i because    we shall conquer from the english in that case all their islands the inhabitants of which would now declare for us if they dared but it will not be the better for the english they will be the dupes if they lay a foundation for it yes said the duke i think you will have another war with the english and in this wish he expressed the vows of every frenchman upon the face of the earth if therefore we have it in contemplation to avoid a future war with the english do not let us have too much confidence in the french that they will favor us in this view i have the honor to be c john adams john adams  0 july      paris robert morris to robert morris paris  0 july      sir— upon the receipt of the despatches by barney i sent off your letters for messrs willink  co and i received last night an answer to the letter i wrote them upon the occasion they have engaged to remit mr grand a million and a half of livres in a month which has relieved mr grand from his anxiety this court has refused to dr franklin any more money they are apprehensive of being obliged to take a part in the northern war and their own financiers have not enough of the confidence of the public to obtain money for their own purposes your design of sending cargoes of tobacco and other things to amsterdam to messrs willink  co is the best possible to support our credit there the more you send the more money will be obtained send a minister too residing there he may promote it much it is a misfortune that i have not been able to be there but this post cannot be deserted instruct your minister to inquire whether the house of hope could be persuaded to engage with willink in a new loan this should be done with secrecy and discretion if that house would undertake it you would find money enough for your purpose for i rely upon it the states will adopt a plan immediately for the effectual payment of interest this is indispensable the foundation of a happy government can only be laid in justice and as soon as the public shall see that provision is made for this you will no longer want money    it is a maxim among merchants and moneyed men that every man has credit who does not want it it is equally true of states we shall want it but little longer if the states make provision for the payment of interest and therefore we shall have enough of it there is not a country in the world whose credit ought to be so good because there is none equally able to pay inclosed is a pamphlet of dr price for your comfort you will see by it that the only nation we have reason to fear wants credit so much that she is not likely to have it always and this is our security by some hints from mr hartley he will probably return to london and not be here again the present ministry is so undecided and feeble that it is at least doubtful whether they will make the definitive treaty of peace with great respect c john adams john adams    july      paris robert morris to robert morris paris    july      sir— in my letter to you of yesterday i hinted in confidence at an application to the house of hope this is a very delicate measure i was induced to think of it merely by a conversation which m van berckel who will soon be with you as he sailed the   th of june from the texel had with m dumas it would be better to be steady to the three houses already employed if that is possible you will now be able to converse freely with that minister upon the subject i should not advise you to take any decisive resolution at philadelphia but leave it to your minister to act as shall appear to him best upon the spot the houses now employed are well esteemed and i hope will do very well but no house in the republic has the force of that of hope all depends however upon the measures to be taken by congress and the states for ascertaining their debts and a regular discharge of the interest the ability of the people to make such an establishment cannot be doubted and the inclination of no man who has a proper sense of public honor can be called in question the thirteen states in relation to the discharge of the debts of congress must consider themselves as one body    animated by one soul the stability of our confederation at home our reputation abroad our power of defence the confidence and affection of the people of one state towards those of another all depend upon it without a sacred regard to public justice no society can exist it is the only tie which can unite mens minds and hearts in pursuit of the common interest the commerce of the world is now open to us and our exports and imports are of so large amount and our connections will be so large and extensive that the least stain upon our character in this respect will lose us in a very short time advantages of greater pecuniary value than all our debt amounts to the moral character of our people is of infinitely greater worth than all the sums in question every hesitation every uncertainty about paying or receiving a just debt diminishes that sense of the moral obligation of public justice which ought to be kept pure and carefully cultivated in every american mind creditors at home and abroad the army the navy every man who has a wellfounded claim upon the public have an unalienable right to be satisfied and this by the fundamental principles of society can there ever be content and satisfaction can there ever be peace and order can there ever be industry or decency without it to talk of a sponge to wipe out this debt or of reducing or diminishing it below its real value in a country so abundantly able to pay the last farthing would betray a total ignorance of the first principles of national duty and interest let us leave these odious speculations to countries that can plead a necessity for them and where corruption has arrived at its last stages where infamy is scarcely felt and wrong may as well assume one shape as another since it must prevail in some i have the honor to be c john adams john adams    july      paris to secretary livingston paris    july      sir— as there are certain particulars in which it has appeared to me that the friendship of a french minister has been problematical at least or rather has not existed at all i have freely mentioned    them to congress because i hold it to be the first duty of a public minister in my situation to conceal no important truth of this kind from his masters but ingratitude is an odious vice and ought to be held in detestation by every american citizen we ought to distinguish therefore between those points for which we are not obliged to our allies and those in which we are i think then we are under no particular obligations of gratitude to them for the fisheries the boundaries exemption from the tories or for the progress of our negotiations in europe we are under obligations of gratitude for making the treaty with us at the time when they did for those sums of money which they have generously given us and for those even which they have lent us which i hope we shall punctually pay and be thankful still for the loan for the fleet and army they sent to america and for all the important services they did by other mutual exertions a dangerous rival to them and i may be almost warranted in saying an imperious master both to them and us has been brought to reason and put out of the power to do harm to either in this respect however our allies are more secure than we the house of bourbon has acquired a great accession of strength while their hereditary enemy has been weakened one half and incurably crippled the french are besides a goodnatured and humane nation very respectable in arts letters arms and commerce and therefore motives of interest honor and convenience join themselves to those of friendship and gratitude to induce us to wish for the continuance of their friendship and alliance the provinces of canada and nova scotia in the hands of the english are a constant warning to us to have a care of ourselves and therefore a continuance of the friendship and alliance of france is of importance to our tranquillity and even to our safety there is nothing which will have a greater effect to overawe the english and induce them to respect us and our rights than the reputation of a good understanding with the french my voice and advice will therefore always be for discharging with the utmost fidelity gratitude and exactness every obligation we are under to france and for cultivating her friendship and alliance by all sorts of good offices but i am sure that to do this effectually we must reason with them at times enter into particulars    and be sure that we understand one another we must act a manly honest independent as well as a sensible part with great respect i have the honor to be c john adams john adams    july      paris to secretary livingston paris    july      sir— yesterday colonel ogden arrived with the originals of what we had before received in duplicates by captain barney the ratification of the dutch treaty had been before received and exchanged the ratification of their high mightinesses is in the safe custody of m dumas at present at the hague i believe we shall accept of the mediation of the two imperial courts at the definitive treaty as it is a mere formality a mere compliment consisting wholly in the imperial ministers putting their names and seals to the parchment and can have no ill effect the inclination of the count de vergennes seems to be that we should accept it and as he calls upon us to decide in the affirmative or negative i believe we shall give an answer in the affirmative the empress has promised to receive mr dana as soon as the definitive treaty shall be signed and he has prepared a treaty of commerce which will be valuable if he can obtain it the emperor of germany has caused to be intimated several ways his inclination to have a treaty of commerce with us but his rank is so high that his house never makes the first formal advance i should think it advisable that we should have a treaty with that power for several reasons  st because as emperor of germany and king of bohemia and hungary he is at the head of one of the greatest interests and most powerful connections in europe it is true it is the greatest weight in the scale which is and has been from age to age opposite to the house of bourbon but for this very reason if there were no other the united states ought to have a treaty of commerce with it in order to be in practice with their theory and to show to all the world that their system of commerce embraces equally and impartially all the commercial states and countries of europe     dly because the present emperor is one of the greatest men of this age the wisdom and virtue of the man as well as of the monarch his personal activity intelligence and accomplishments his large and liberal principles in matters of religion government and commerce are so much of kin to those of our states perhaps indeed so much borrowed from them and adopted in imitation of them that it seems peculiarly proper we should show this respect to them  dly because that if england should ever forget herself again so much as to attack us she may not be likely to obtain the alliance or assistance of this power against us a friendship once established in a treaty of commerce this power would never be likely to violate because she has no dominions near us and could have no interest to quarrel with us  thly because the countries belonging to this power upon the adriatic sea and in the austrian flanders are no inconsiderable sources of commerce for america and if the present negotiations between the two imperial courts and the porte should terminate in a free navigation of the danube the black sea and the archipelago the emperors hereditary dominions will become very respectable commercial countries  thly because although we have at present a pleasant and joyful prospect of friendship and uninterrupted alliance with the house of bourbon which i wish may never be obscured yet this friendship and alliance will be the more likely to continue unimpaired for our having the friendship and commerce of the house of austria and as in the vicissitudes of human affairs all things are possible if in future times however unlikely at present the house of bourbon should deal unjustly by us demand of us things we are not bound to perform or any way injure us we may find in the alliance of austria england and holland a resource against the storm supernumerary strings to our bow and provisions against possible inconveniences however improbable can do us no harm if we were not straitened for money i should advise congress to send a minister to vienna but as every mission abroad is a costly article and we find it difficult at present to procure money for the most necessary purposes i should think it proper for congress to send a commission to their minister at versailles london madrid petersburg or the hague who might communicate    it to the court of vienna by means of the imperial ambassador the emperor in such a case would authorize his ambassador at that court to prepare and conclude a treaty and in this way the business may be well done without any additional expense m favi chargé des affaires of the grand duke of tuscany the emperors brother has called upon me so often to converse with me upon this subject that i doubt not he has been employed or at least knows that it would be agreeable to his court and their connections although he has never made any official insinuations about it this gentleman has been employed by the republic of ragusa to consult american ministers upon the subject of commerce too i have told him that the american ports were open to the ragusan vessels as well as to all others and have given him the address by which they propose to write to congress i have the honor to be c john adams john adams    july      paris to secretary livingston paris    july      sir— a jealousy of american ships seamen carrying trade and naval power appears every day more and more conspicuous this jealousy which has been all along discovered by the french minister is at length communicated to the english the following proclamation  which will not increase british    ships and seamen in any proportion as it will diminish those of the united states will contribute effectually to make america afraid of england and attach herself more closely to france the english are the dupes and must take the consequences this proclamation is issued in full confidence that the united states have no confidence in one another that they cannot agree to act in a body as one nation that they cannot agree upon any navigation act which may be common to the thirteen states our proper remedy would be to confine our exports to american ships to make a law that no article should be exported from any of the states in british ships nor in the ships of any nation which will not allow us reciprocally to import their productions in our ships i am much afraid there is too good an understanding upon this subject between versailles and st jamess perhaps it may be proper for congress to be silent upon this head until new york penobscot c are evacuated but i should think that congress would never bind themselves by any treaty built upon such principles they should negotiate however without loss of time by a minister in london a few weeks delay may have unalterable effects one of the most remarkable things in this proclamation is the omission of salt fish an article which the islands want as much as any that is enumerated this is no doubt to encourage their own fishery and that of nova scotia as well as a blow aimed at ours there was in a former proclamation concerning    the trade between the united states and great britain an omission of the articles of potash and pearlash these omissions discover a choice love for new england france i am afraid will exclude fish too and imitate this proclamation but too closely if indeed this proclamation is not an imitation of their system adopted as i believe it is upon their advice and desire these however are important efforts without saying writing or resolving any thing suddenly let us see what remedies or equivalents we can obtain from holland portugal and denmark let us bind ourselves to nothing but reserve a right of making navigation acts when we please if we find them necessary or useful if we had been defeated of our fisheries we should have been wormed out of all our carrying trade too and should have been a mere society of cultivators without any but a passive trade the policy of france has succeeded and laid in these proclamations if persisted in the sure source of another war between us and great britain the english nation is not however unanimous in this new system as congress will see by the inclosed speculations  which i know to have been written by a confidential friend of my lord shelburne i mean mr benjamin vaughan this minister is very strong in the house of lords and mr pitt in the house of commons has attached to him many members in the course of this session if that set should come in again we shall have a chance of making an equitable treaty of commerce to this end a minister must be ready and i hope in mercy to our country that such an opportunity will not be lost by delays in compliance to our allies i have the honor to be c john adams john adams    july      paris to secretary livingston paris    july      sir— yesterday we waited on the count de vergennes at versailles and showed him the project of a letter to the ministers of the two imperial courts which he read and approved  00 we told him that we were at a loss what might be the effect of the mediation possibly we might be involved in difficulties by it possibly the british ministers might persuade the mediators to offer us their advice upon some points respecting the royalists for example which we could not comply with the count said that he had told them that as soon as he had fully agreed with england upon all points their mediation should be accepted and they should sign the treaty as such and we might agree to it in the same manner he said we were not obliged to this but as they were to be present and sign one treaty it would look better to sign both it would be a very notorious public and respectable acknowledgment of us as a power by those courts upon this footing we left the letter with him to be shown to the imperial ministers we asked the count if he had seen the british proclamation of the  d of july he answered that he had i asked him if the king had determined any thing on the subject of salt provisions and salt fish whether we might import them into his islands he said we might depend upon it they could not supply their islands with fish that we had two free ports in their islands—st lucia and a port in martinique by the thirtysecond article of the treaty of commerce these free ports are secured to us nothing he said was determined concerning salt beef and pork but the greatest difficulty would be about flour i told the count that i did not think it would be possible either for france or england to carry on this commerce between the islands and continent it was profitable to us only as it was a part of a system that it could not be carried on without loss in large vessels navigated by many seamen which could sail only at certain seasons of the year c upon the whole i was much pleased with this conversation and conclude from it that we shall do very well in the french west india islands perhaps the better in them the worse we are treated by the english the dutch and danes will i doubt not avail themselves of every error that may be committed by france or england it is good to have a variety of strings to our bow and therefore i wish we had a treaty of commerce with denmark by which a free admission of our ships into their ports in the west indies might be established by means of the dutch danes and pertuguese  0  i think we shall be able to obtain finally proper terms of france and england the british proclamation of the  d of this month is the result of refugee politics it is intended to encourage canada and nova scotia and their fisheries to support still the ruins of their navigation act and to take from us the carriage even of our own productions a system which has in it so little respect for us and is so obviously calculated to give a blow to our nurseries of ships and seamen could never have been adopted but from the opinion that we had no common legislature for the government of commerce all america from the chesapeake bay to st croix i know love ships and sailors and those ports to the southward of that bay have advantages for obtaining them when they will and therefore i hope the thirteen states will unite in some measures to counteract this policy of britain so evidently selfish unsocial and i had almost said hostile the question is what is to be done i answer perhaps it will be most prudent to say little about it at present and until the definitive treaty is signed and the states evacuated but after that i think in the negotiation of a treaty of commerce with great britain congress should tell them that they have the means of doing justice to themselves what are these means i answer let every state in the union lay on a duty of five percent on all west india articles imported in british ships and upon all their own productions exported in british ships let this impost be limited in duration until great britain shall allow our vessels to trade to their west indies this would effectually defeat their plan and encourage our own carrying trade more than they can discourage it another way of influencing england to a reasonable conduct is to take some measures for encouraging the growth in the united states of west india articles another is to encourage manufactures especially of wool and iron among ourselves as tilthammers are now not unlawful and wool may be waterborne much more may be done now than could have been done before the war but the most certain method is to lay duties on exports and imports by british ships the sense of a common interest and a common danger it is to be hoped will induce a perfect unanimity among the states in this respect there  0  are other ways of serving ourselves and making impressions upon the english to bring them to reason one is to send ships immediately to china this trade is as open to us as to any nation and if our natural advantages at home are envied us we should compensate ourselves in any honest way we can our natural share in the west india trade is all that is now wanting to complete the plan of happiness and prosperity of our country deprived of it we shall be straitened and shackled in some degree we cannot enjoy a free use of all our limits without this with it i see nothing to desire nothing to vex or chagrin our people nothing to interrupt our repose or keep up a dread of war i know not what permission may be expected from spain to trade to the havana but should think that this resource ought not to be neglected i confess i do not like the complexion of british politics they are mysterious and unintelligible mr hartley appears not to be in the secret of his court the things which happen appear as unexpected to him as to us political jealousies and speculations are endless it is possible the british ministers may be secretly employed in fomenting the quarrel between the two imperial courts and the porte and in secretly stirring up the french to join the turks in the war the prospect of seeing france engaged in a war may embolden them to adopt a system less favorable to us the possibility of these things should stimulate us i think to form as soon as possible treaties of commerce with the principal powers especially the imperial courts that all our questions may be decided this will be a great advantage to us even if we should afterwards be involved in a war i put this supposition with great reluctance but if england should in the course of a few years or months have the art to stir up a general war in europe and get france and spain seriously involved in it which is at least a possible case she may assume a tone and conduct towards us which will make it very difficult for us to avoid taking a part in it if such a deplorable circumstance should take place it will be still a great advantage to us to have our sovereignty explicitly acknowledged by those powers against whom we may be unfortunately obliged to act at present they are all disposed to it and seem desirous of forming connections with us that we may be out of the question  0  the politics of europe are such a labyrinth of profound mysteries that the more one sees of them the more causes of uncertainty and anxiety he discovers the united states will have occasion to brace up their confederation and act as one body with one spirit if they do not it is now very obvious that great britain will take advantage of it in such a manner as will endanger our peace our safety and even our very existence a change of ministry may but it is not certain that it will give us better prospects i have the honor to be c john adams john adams    july      paris to secretary livingston paris    july      sir— last evening mr hartley spent two hours with me and appeared much chagrined at the proclamation which had never been communicated to him by his principals he has too much contempt of the commercial abilities of the french and consequently said that the french could derive but little benefit from this step of his court but he thought the dutch would make a great advantage by it i endeavored to discover from him whether he suspected that his court had any hand in stirring up the two imperial courts to make war upon the turks i asked him what was the state of their mediterranean trade and levant trade he said it was dead and that their turkey company was dead and therefore he did not think his court cared much about either or would ever do any thing to prevent the empires he thought it possible that they might rather encourage them i am quite of mr hartleys mind that the dutch will profit by all the english blunders in regulating the west india trade and am happy that m van berckel will be soon with congress when its members and ministers may communicate through him any thing they wish to their high mightinesses they may inquire of him what are the rights of the east and west india companies to what an extent our vessels may be admitted to surinam curaçoa demerara essequibo berbice st eustatia what we may be allowed to carry there and what bring  0  from thence to the united states or to europe whether we may carry sugars c to amsterdam rotterdam c there are at rotterdam and amsterdam one hundred and twentyseven or eight refineries of sugar how far these may be affected c i lay it down for a rule that the nation which shall allow us the most perfect liberty to trade with her colonies whether it be france england spain or holland will see her colonies flourish above all others and will draw proportionally our trade to themselves and i rely upon it the dutch will have sagacity to see it and as they are more attentive to mercantile profit than to a military marine i have great hopes from their friendship as there will be an interval before the signature of the definitive treaty i propose a journey of three weeks to amsterdam and the hague in hopes of learning in more detail the intentions of the dutch in this respect i am in hopes too of encouraging the loan to assist our superintendent of finance the dutch may be a great resource to us in finance and commerce i wish that cargoes of produce may be hastened to amsterdam to messrs willink  co for this will give vigor to the loan and all the money we can prevent england and the two empires from obtaining in holland will not only be nerves for us but perhaps be useful too to france in her negotiations i have spent the whole forenoon in conversation with the duc de la vauguyon he thinks that england wishes to revive her trade to the levant to smyrna aleppo c and her carrying trade in italy and although she might be pleased to see france involved in a war with the emperor and empress yet he thinks her funds are not in a condition to afford subsidies to either and therefore that she will be perfectly neutral quære however whether if by a subsidy or a loan of a million or two a year she could make france spend eight or ten millions she would not strive hard to do it the duke thinks that france will proceed softly and endeavor if possible to avert the furious storm that threatens and to compose the disputes of the three empires if possible but she will never suffer such a usurpation as the conquest of the turkish provinces in europe france will certainly defend constantinople he thinks that the empress of russia has not revenues and cannot get cash to march and subsist vast armies and to transport great fleets and that the emperor has not revenues to support a long war  0  this is however a serious business and france lays it so much to heart and looks upon the chance of her being obliged to arm as so probable that i presume this to be the principal motive of her refusal to lend us two or three millions of livres more as to our west india questions the duke assures me that the french ministry particularly the count de vergennes are determined to do every thing they can consistent with their own essential interests to favor and promote the friendship and commerce between their country and ours that they especially the count are declared enemies of the french fiscal system which is certainly the most ruinous to their commerce and intend to do every thing they can to make alterations to favor commerce but no change can be made in this without affecting their revenues and making voids failures and deficiencies which they cannot fill up they must therefore proceed softly that france would favor the commerce between portugal and america because it would tend to draw off that kingdom from her dependence on england that england by her commercial treaty with the portuguese in   0  has turned them into an english colony made them entirely dependent and secured a commerce with them of three millions value france would be glad to see this or as much of it as possible turned to america the duke agrees fully with me in the maxim that those colonies will grow the most in wealth improvement population and every sort of prosperity which are allowed the freest communication with us and that we shall be allowed to carry lumber fish and live stock to their islands but that the export of their sugars to us he thinks must be in their own ships because they are afraid of our becoming the carriers of all their commerce because they know and say that we can do it cheaper than they can these sentiments are different from those which he mentioned to me a few days ago when he said the west india trade with us must be carried on in french bottoms the duke said the english had been trying to deceive us but were now developing their true sentiments they pretended for a while to abolish the navigation act and all distinctions to make one people with us again to be friends brothers c in hopes of drawing us off from france but not finding  0  success they were now showing their true plan as to the pretended system of shelburne of a universal free commerce although he thought it would be for the good of mankind in general yet for an english minister it was the plan of a madman for it would be the ruin of that nation he did not think shelburne was sincere in it he only meant an illusion to us here i differ from the duke and believe that the late ministry were very sincere towards us and would have made a treaty with us at least to revive the universal trade between us upon a liberal plan this doctrine of ruin from that plan to the english has been so much preached of late in england by the french and the american refugees who aim at establishments in canada and nova scotia and by the old butean administration and their partisans that i do not know whether any ministry could now support a generous plan but if temple thurlow shelburne pitt c should come in i should not despair of it it is true the shelburne administration did encourage the ideas of cordial perfect friendship of entire reconciliation of affections of making no distinction between their people and ours especially between the inhabitants of canada and nova scotia and us and this with the professed purpose of destroying all seeds of war between us these sentiments were freely uttered by fitzherbert oswald whitefoord vaughan and all who had the confidence of that ministry and in these sentiments they were i believe very sincere and they are indeed the only means of preventing a future war between us and them and so sure as they depart from that plan so sure in less than fifteen years perhaps less than seven there will break out another war quarrels will arise among fishermen between inhabitants of canada and nova scotia and us and between their people and ours in the west indies in our ports and in the ports of the three kingdoms which will breed a war in spite of all we can do to prevent it france sees this and rejoices in it and i know not whether we ought to be sorry yet i think we ought to make it a maxim to avoid all wars if possible and to take care that it is not our fault if we cannot we ought to do every thing which the english will concur in to remove all causes of jealousies and kill all the seeds of hostility as effectually as we can and to be upon our guard to prevent the french spaniards and dutch from sowing  0  the seeds of war between us for we may rely upon it they will do it if they can i have the honor to be c john adams john adams    july      paris to secretary livingston paris    july      sir— there is cause to be solicitous about the state of things in england the present ministry swerve more and more from the true system for the prosperity of their country and ours mr hartley whose sentiments are at bottom just is probably kept here if he was not sent at first merely to amuse us and to keep him out of the way of embarrassing the coalition we need not fear that france and england will make a common cause against us even in relation to the carrying trade to and from the west indies although they may mutually inspire into each other false notions of their interests at times yet there can never be a concert of operations between them mutual enmity is bred in the blood and bones of both and rivals and enemies at heart they eternally will be in order to induce both to allow us our natural right to the carrying trade we must negotiate with the dutch danes portuguese and even with the empires for the more friends and resources we have the more we shall be respected by the french and english and the more freedom of trade we enjoy with the dutch possessions in america the more will france and england find themselves necessitated to allow us the present ministers in england have very bad advisers the refugees and emissaries of various other sorts and we have nobody to watch to counteract to correct or prevent any thing the united states will soon see the necessity of uniting in measures to counteract their enemies and even their friends what powers congress should have for governing the trade of the whole for making or recommending prohibitions or imposts deserves the serious consideration of every man in america if a constitutional legislative authority cannot be given them a sense of common danger and necessity should give to their recommendations all the force upon the minds of the people which they had six years ago  0  if the union of the states is not preserved and even their unity in many great points instead of being the happiest people under the sun i do not know but we may be the most miserable we shall find our foreign affairs the most difficult to manage of any of our interests we shall see and feel them disturbed by invisible agents and causes by secret intrigues by dark and mysterious insinuations by concealed corruptions of a thousand sorts hypocrisy and simulation will assume a million of shapes we shall feel the evil without being able to prove the cause those whose penetration reaches the true source of the evil will be called suspicious envious disappointed ambitious in short if there is not an authority sufficiently decisive to draw together the minds affections and forces of the states in their common foreign concerns it appears to me we shall be the sport of transatlantic politicians of all denominations who hate liberty in every shape and every man who loves it and every country that enjoys it if there is no common authority nor any common sense to secure a revenue for the discharge of our engagements abroad for money what is to become of our honor our justice our faith our universal moral political and commercial character if there is no common power to fulfil engagements with our citizens to pay our soldiers and other creditors can we have any moral character at home our country will become the region of everlasting discontents reproaches and animosities and instead of finding our independence a blessing we shall soon become cappadocians enough to wish it done away i may be thought gloomy but this ought not to discourage me from laying before congress my apprehensions the dependence of those who have designs upon us upon our want of affection to each other and of authority over one another is so great that in my opinion if the united states do not soon show to the world a proof that they can command a common revenue to satisfy their creditors at home and abroad that they can act as one people as one nation as one man in their transactions with foreign nations we shall be soon so far despised that it will be but a few years perhaps but a few months only before we are involved in another war what can i say in holland if a doubt is started whether we can repay the money we wish to borrow i must assure them  0  in a tone that will exclude all doubt that the money will be repaid am i to be hereafter reproached with deceiving the moneylenders i cannot believe there is a man in america who would not disdain the supposition and therefore i shall not scruple to give the strongest assurances in my power but if there is a doubt in congress they ought to recall their borrowers of money i shall set off tomorrow for holland in hopes of improving my health at the same time that i shall endeavor to assist the loan and to turn the speculations of the dutch merchants capitalists and statesmen towards america it is of vast importance that the dutch should form just ideas of their interests respecting the communication between us and their islands and other colonies in america i beg that no time may be lost in commencing conferences with m van berckel upon this subject as well as that of money but this should not be communicated to the french nor the english because we may depend upon it both will endeavor to persuade the dutch to adopt the same plan with themselves there are jealousies on both sides the pas de calais of our connections and negotiations with the dutch but while we avoid as much as we can to inflame this jealousy we must have sense and firmness and independence enough not to be intimidated by it from availing ourselves of advantages that providence has placed in our power there ever have been and ever will be suspicions of every honest active and intelligent american and there will be as there have been insidious attempts to destroy or lessen your confidence in every such character but if our country does not support her own interests and her own servants she will assuredly fall persons who study to preserve or obtain the confidence of america by the favor of european statesmen or courts must betray their country to preserve their places for my own part i wish mr jay and myself almost anywhere else but here there is scarce any other place where we might not do some good here we are in a state of annihilation i have the honor to be c john adams   0 john adams    july      the hague to secretary livingston the hague    july      sir— on saturday last i left paris and arrived here last night this morning i sent m dumas to m van berckel and m gyselaer to inform them of my arrival and to desire a conversation with them upon the subject of the commerce between the united states and the dutch establishments in the west indies m van berckel told m dumas that st eustatia and curaçao were open to the vessels of all nations and to the commerce of all the world but that it was not the interest of the west india company alone but that of the whole state that obliged them to confine the commerce of their sugars to themselves because of the great number of their refineries of sugar that all their own sugars were not half enough to employ their sugarhouses and that at least one half of the sugars refined in holland were the production of the french west india islands i suppose that some of these sugars may have been carried first to st eustatia and brought from thence to holland and some others may have been purchased in the ports of france and imported raw from thence i do not know that dutch vessels are permitted to purchase sugars in the french islands and export them from thence this matter deserves to be examined to the bottom if france has not sugarhouses for the refinement of her own sugars but is obliged to carry them or to permit their being carried to amsterdam and rotterdam for manufacture why should she not be willing that the same sugars should be carried by americans to boston new york and philadelphia surely france has no predilection for holland rather than america but what is of more weight all the sugars which america takes will be paid for in articles more advantageous to the islands and to france than the pay that is made by the dutch if any sugars refined in holland are afterwards sold in france surely it would be more for the interest of france or rather less against her interests to have the same sugars refined in america and afterwards sold in france because the price of them would be laid out by us in france     there is this difference between us and the dutch and all other nations—we spend in europe all the profits we make and more the others do not but if the french sugars refined in holland are afterwards sold in other parts of europe it would be just as well that we should sell them we have sugarhouses as well as the dutch and ours ought not to be more obnoxious to french policy or commerce than theirs sugars are a great article there is a great consumption in america it is not the interest of any nation that has sugars to sell to lessen the consumption there all such nations should favor that consumption in order to multiply purchasers and quicken the competition by which the price is raised none of these nations then will wish to prevent our having sugar provided we offer as high or a higher price how they will be able to arrange their plans so that we may have enough for our own consumption without having more without having some for exportation i do not know we have now st eustatia and curaçao st lucia and martinique st thomas and st martins no less than six free ports in the west indies and perhaps england may be induced necessitated indeed to add two more to the number and make eight at these free ports it will be hard if we cannot find sugars when we carry thither all our own productions in our own ships and if the worst should happen and all the nations who have sugar islands should forbid sugars to be carried to america in any other than their own bottoms we might depend upon having enough of this article at the free ports to be brought away in our own ships if we should lay a prohibition or a duty upon it in foreign ships to do either the states must be united which the english think cannot be perhaps the french think so too and in time they may persuade the dutch to be of the same opinion it is to be hoped we shall disappoint them all in a point so just and reasonable when we are contending only for an equal chance for the carriage of our own productions and the articles of our own consumption when we are willing to allow to all other nations even a free competition with us in this carriage if we cannot unite it will discover an imperfection and weakness in our constitution which will deserve a serious consideration m visscher pensionary of amsterdam who came in to visit     me when i had written thus far showed me a list of the directors of the west india company and referred me to m bicker of amsterdam as one of the most intelligent of them he says that the colonists of surinam berbice essequibo and demerara have been in decay and obliged to borrow money of the merchants at home and have entered into contracts with those merchants to send them annually all the productions of their plantations to pay the interest and principal of their debts that this will make it difficult to open the trade soon after m visscher went out m van berckel came in i entered into a like conversation with him and told him that i thought the decay of their plantations in the west indies had been owing to the rivalry of other nations especially the english whose islands had greater advantages from a freer communication with north america and i thought it might be laid down as a rule that those islands would flourish most in population culture commerce and wealth which had the freest intercourse with us and that this intercourse would be a natural means of attracting the american commerce to the metropolis he thought so too i then mentioned to him the loan and asked him if he thought that the statesgeneral the states of holland or the regency of amsterdam would be likely in any way to aid us he said no that the country was still so much divided that he could not depend upon any assistance in that way that the council of amsterdam was well enough disposed but that the burgomasters were not so that m temminck m huygens and m rendorp were not to be depended on in such an affair that therefore our only resource was to endeavor to gain upon the public opinion and the spirit of the nation and that in this respect he would do me all the service in his power he thought that the present uncertainty about the definitive treaty and the fate of the republic would be an obstacle but the definitive treaty once signed he thought our loan would succeed very well i asked him whether he thought that the junction of three houses in my loan was any obstruction to it and whether any one of them or whether any other house would do better i told him what his brother now i hope in philadelphia had said to m dumas namely—that the house of wilhem and jan willink alone would succeed sooner than the three i     asked him whether he thought the house of hope either alone or in conjunction with that of the willinks or any other would undertake it he said this might well be and that if they saw their interest in it they would for those mercantile houses had no other object in view he promised me to make inquiry into this matter and let me know the result upon this occasion i must inform congress that it is absolutely necessary they should send another minister to this republic without loss of time because our three present houses before they would undertake the loan extorted a promise from me not to open another with any other house until the five millions should be full this engagement i took for myself alone however and expressly premised that congress should not be bound by it that congress should be perfectly free and that any other minister they might send here should be perfectly free to open another loan when and with whom they pleased a new minister therefore may open a loan when he will with hope willink or whom he will and i am persuaded it would succeed to a good amount i made visits today the   th of july to the grand pensionary the secretary fagel the president of the week and m gyselaer and returned visits to m van berckel and m visscher m gyselaer says that at present there is no ready money argent comptant in the republic but in two months there will be and the loan will go very well at noon i went to the house in the grove to make my court to the prince and princess of orange the prince either happened to be in a social humor or has had some political speculations lately for he thought fit to be uncommonly gracious and agreeable he made me sit and sat down by me and entered into familiar conversation about the negotiations of peace he asked many questions about it and the probability of a speedy conclusion of the definitive treaty at length he asked me if dr franklin was left alone i answered that mr jay was with him he asked if i returned before the signature i answered that such was my intention he asked whether dr franklin was an ambassador i answered that he was a minister plenipotentiary only he asked if none of us were ambassadors i answered that we all had the same rank of ministers plenipotentiary and that congress     had never yet made an ambassador he said he was astonished at that that he had a long time expected to hear that we had displayed the character of ambassadors i asked his highness what reason he had for this and what advantage there was in it why said he i expected that your republic would early assert her right to appoint ambassadors republics have been generally fond of appointing ambassadors in order to be upon a footing with crowned heads our republic began very early we had eight ambassadors at the peace of munster one for each province and one supernumerary and we always choose to appoint ambassadors for the sake of being upon an equality with crowned heads there are only crowned heads republics and the electors of the empire who have a right to send ambassadors all others can only send envoys and ministers plenipotentiary princes cannot send ambassadors i cannot as stadtholder nor as prince nor in any other quality send a minister of any higher order than an envoy or minister plenipotentiary he asked me what was the reason the congress had not made use of their right i answered his highness that really i did not know it was a subject i had never much reflected on perhaps congress had not or they might think it a matter of ceremony and of show rather than substance or might think the expense greater than the advantage he said it was very true the dignity of the rank must be supported but he thought the advantage worth more than the expense i am utterly at a loss for his highnesss motives for entering so minutely into this subject whether m van berckel before his departure had mentioned it whether he thought he should please me by it whether he thought to please congress by it whether he affected to interest himself in the honor of the united states or whether any of the politicians of this or any other country have put him upon it or whether it is mere accident i know not they are the words of a prince and i have reported them very exactly i have the honor to be c john adams     john adams    july      the hague to secretary livingston the hague    july      sir— it is the general opinion here both among the members of the states and at the hôtel de france that the delays of the definitive pacification are contrived by the court of london in order to set all their instruments at work in this republic to induce it to renew its ancient connections with great britain particularly their alliance offensive and defensive by which each power was bound to furnish the other if attacked a certain number of ships and troops against this the patriotic party is decided and they are now very well satisfied with the grand pensionary bleiswyck because he openly and roundly takes their side and the court is said to be discontented with him for the same reason there is no doubt an intelligence and correspondence between the two courts of london and the hague to bring about this point the grand pensionary told me yesterday that the court of london desired it and there were persons here who desired it and he knew very well who they were but that most certainly they would not carry their point van berckel visscher and gyselaer all assured me of the same and added that the fear of this had determined them not to send a minister to london but to go through with the negotiation at paris although they were all highly dissatisfied with the conduct of france and particularly with that of the count de vergennes they all say he has betrayed and deserted them played them a very bad trick tour and violated his repeated promises to them they do not in the least spare m berenger and m merchant who conduct the french affairs here in the absence of the duc de la vauguyon but hold this language openly and freely to them these gentlemen have sometimes found it hard to bear and have winced and sometimes even threatened but their answer has been more mortifying still do as you please drive the republic back into the arms of england if you will suppress all the friends of france if you choose it and some of them have said we will go to america they all say that france had the power to have saved them that the acquisition of tobago was no equivalent to france for the loss     of the republic c c c they are all highly pleased with the conduct of their own ambassador brantzen with his activity intelligence and fidelity they all say that they would send a minister to london to negotiate there if they were sure of being able to carry an election for a man they could depend upon but the court here would have so much influence in the choice that they would run a risk of sending a man who would insensibly lead them into a revival of the old ties with england which they say is enslaving the republic to that kingdom i learn here from all quarters a confirmation of what i had learned before at paris from m brantzen and the duc de la vauguyon namely—that the duke of manchester had given them no answer nor said a word to them for six weeks in answer to the propositions they had made among which was an offer of an equivalent for negapatnam they offered some establishments in sumatra and surat lately the duke of manchester has received a courier and has given an answer that a real equivalent might be accepted no answer is given to any other point and this is vague so that another courier must go to london and return parliament is now up and perhaps the ministers may now be more attentive and less timorous i have the honor to be c john adams john adams    july      amsterdam to secretary livingston amsterdam    july      sir— i find upon inquiry that there are in this republic at amsterdam rotterdam and dort near one hundred and thirty sugarhouses the whole of the raw sugars produced in surinam berbice essequibo and demerara are wrought in these houses and besides raw sugars were purchased in bordeaux and nantes after being imported from the french islands in french bottoms raw sugars were also purchased in london which went under the general name of barbadoes sugars although they were the growth of all the english islands and imported to london in british bottoms i have learnt further that great quantities of raw brazil sugars were purchased in lisbon and that these were cheaper than any of the others all these raw sugars were imported into amsterdam rotterdam and dort     and there manufactured for exportation we must endeavor to obtain a share in this trade especially with lisbon or the western islands since it is certain that neither portugal france nor england has been able to manufacture all its raw sugars but each of them sold considerable quantities to the dutch i suppose that we may undoubtedly purchase such sugars in future in lisbon bordeaux nantes london and perhaps ireland and carry them where we please either home to america or to amsterdam or to any part of europe and there sell them and in this way promote our own carrying trade as well as enable ourselves to make remittances i cannot see why the english or french should be averse to their sugars going to america directly and if they insist upon carrying them in their own ships we may still have enough of them the dutch have the most pressing commercial motives to bring home their west india produce yet they would really gain the most by opening a free communication with us because they would the most suddenly make their colonies flourish by it molasses and rum we shall have probably from all the islands—english french and dutch—in our own bottoms unless the three nations should agree together to keep the whole trade of their islands in their own ships which is not likely i have made all the inquiries i could and have sown all the seeds i could in order to give a spur to our loan three thousand obligations have been sold and the other two thousand are signed but at this time there is a greater scarcity of money than ever was known the scarcity is so great that the agio of the bank which is commonly at four or five per cent fell to one and a half the directors at length shut up the bank and it continues shut the english omnium which at first was sold for eight or ten per cent profit fell to one and a half the scarcity of money will continue until the arrival of the spanish flotilla at cadiz seven eighths of the treasures of that flotilla will come here and make money plenty then we may expect that my obligations will sell in the mean time i have great pleasure in assuring you that there is not one foreign loan open in this republic which is in so good credit or goes so quick as mine the empress of russia opened a loan of five millions about the same time that i     opened mine she is far from having obtained three millions of it spain opened a loan with the house of hope at the same time for two millions only and you may depend upon it it is very far from being full not one quarter part of the loan of france upon liferents advantageous as it is to the lender is full in short there is not one power in europe whose credit is so good here as ours russia and spain too allow of facilities to undertakers and others in disposing of their obligations much more considerable than ours yet all does not succeed you will see persons and letters in america that will affirm that the spanish loan is full and that france and spain can have what money they please here believe me this is all stockjobbing gasconade i have made very particular inquiries and find the foregoing account to be the truth of all the sons of men i believe the stockjobbers are the greatest liars i know it has been given out that the spanish loan which was opened at hopes was full the first day this i know has been affirmed in the hearing of americans with a confidence peculiar and with a design i suppose that it should be written or reported to congress but i am now assured that it is so far from being true that it is not near full to this hour let me beg of you sir to give mr morris an extract of this because i am so pressed for time that i cannot write to him upon further inquiry concerning sugars i find that the dutch were used to purchase annually considerable quantities of the raw sugars of spain as well as of france england and portugal some of these they obtained by a clandestine trade between curaçao and havana and st domingo but the greater part were purchased at cadiz i suppose our merchants and masters of vessels will be as adroit at inventing and executing projects of illicit trade as others but this is a resource that congress and the states cannot depend on nor take into their calculations illicit trade will ever bear but a small proportion to that which is permitted and our governments should take their measures for obtaining by legal and honorable means from spain portugal france england holland and denmark all the productions which our people may want for consumption for manufacture and for exportation i have the honor to be c john adams     john adams    july      amsterdam robert morris to robert morris amsterdam    july      sir— upon inquiry of those who best know i see no probability of success from any application to authority in this country for reasons which i have explained to our minister of foreign affairs our only resource is in the public opinion and the favor of the nation i know of nothing which would operate so favorably upon the public as the arrival of a few vessels with cargoes of american produce addressed to your bankers and appropriated to the payment of interest the report of such an event would greatly augment our credit by spreading the opinion of our ability and disposition to pay it would be presumption in me at this distance to undertake to advise you who are upon the spot and much better informed but i beg leave to suggest the question whether an application of congress to the states would not succeed suppose congress should represent to the states the necessity of an exertion in order to obtain a loan at present to enable you to satisfy the most urgent demands of the army and other public creditors until the states can agree upon some permanent establishment and should recommend to each state to furnish a cargo of its produce in proportion to its rate upon the list for example south carolina and georgia a quantity of rice or indigo virginia and maryland of tobacco pennsylvania of wheat or flour and the northern states of fish or any other thing suppose these cargoes which need not be expensive for the thirteen states should be sent to amsterdam or anywhere else in europe the proceeds of sale to be remitted to amsterdam to your bankers the reputation of this if well planned adopted and executed would give a strong impulsion to your loan here i am but just arrived and have not yet seen our bankers saturday and sunday are usually spent at country seats but before i leave this place i shall be able to inform you more precisely whether you may depend on any thing from hence no pains of mine shall be spared the british stocks are so low that we may hope for something if a minister is sent to london you should give him a commission to borrow money if   0 he conducts the matter with secrecy and caution he may probably obtain a considerable sum there there are moneyed men in that country who wish us well there are others who may easily be inspired with more faith in our funds than they can rationally have in their own if upon advising with proper persons he should not judge it prudent to open a loan there he might easily put things in a train for some individuals to purchase obligations in your loan in amsterdam so dismal are the prospects in england that many men are on the wing to fly and some would be willing to transfer their property across the atlantic i have the honor to be c john adams francis dana    july      st petersburg john adams francis dana to john adams st petersburg    july      my dear sir— tis done the bolt of your vulcan has hit its aim the idea you mentioned to me some time since relative to the use of the credit i had asked for and which in reply i told you was not new to me that the same had been repeatedly thrown out here by persons whom to suspect of sinister or interested views would be deemed by some a most damnable political heresy has crossed the atlantic and gotten possession of congress i am told they will not buy a treaty at this day but pray remark what i have said in my letter to you of the   st of last may relative to this subject particularly in the last paragraph of it beginning thus—besides i should not be surprised  you may turn also to my letter of the   th of the same month but contemptible beyond all contempt pardon the expression is the construction upon my instructions would it not put a pettifogger out of countenance to be detected in such a miserable thing pray my friend are you sufficiently versed in the diplomatic science to develop the whole meaning of the term communicate and of the double c these lord coke observes are very pregnant oftentimes and that gentleman has read lord coke and must therefore be an excellent commentator but lest he should     not have read the text through when he made his comment i have laid it out at its full length before him he may now comment upon it at leisure i have thought it too plain to need any of mine do not imagine my friend that i am angry shall i say at this dutch commentator no i have other feelings respecting him and our much abused country i recollect the cause of the instruction we received relative to the fishery at our departure i recollect the fatal revocation of your power to conclude a commercial treaty with great britain i call it fatal because if i am not deceived we have lost forever the most important advantages of a free commerce with the british west indies by that measure we might have obtained every thing at the conclusion of our preliminary treaty if our commissioners had had that power this is evident from the bill of mr pitt the chancellor of the exchequer this last stroke i think tops the system a more favorable moment for negotiating a commercial treaty here will in all probability never happen the present views of great britain give us many advantages to draw forth convenient concessions can russia see with indifference great britain holding out special favors for the encouragement of our naval stores but i need not enter into particulars with you on these subjects who have surveyed them on all sides i send you inclosed my letter to mr livingston i have several times acquainted congress of my wish and intention to return to america as soon as i had concluded a commercial treaty with her imperial majesty in consequence of this they have by resolution approved of my returning provided i should not be engaged in a negotiation with this court at the time of receiving the resolution in which case it is the desire of congress that i should finish such negotiation before i return i am not engaged in any as i have not yet had my audience and to communicate but not to sign is beyond my comprehension and i believe would surpass theirs also  if i should break through this cobweb i should find myself stopped short by the other matter which is essential     what is to be done in such circumstances i answer the wisest part it appears to me is to get out of them as soon as possible but for this last difficulty i would demand my audience as soon as the definitive treaty is concluded enter immediately upon the negotiation of a treaty of commerce and maugre all comments sign ah and seal too the form and terms of a treaty i should agree upon with her majestys ministers as it is i say to myself begone i will be gone and god grant i may soon have the pleasure of meeting you in our country and all friends well yours c francis dana john adams    july      the hague to secretary livingston the hague    july      sir— the last evening at court in the house in the grove where all the foreign ministers supped the count montagnini de mirabel the minister plenipotentiary from the king of sardinia took an opportunity to enter largely into conversation with me as he and i were at a party of politics while the greatest part of the company were at cards for two or three hours we ran over all the world but nothing occurred worth repeating except what follows the count said that his advice to congress would be to write a circular letter to every power in europe as soon as the definitive treaty should be signed and transmit with it a printed copy of the treaty in the letter congress should announce that on the  th of july      the united states had declared themselves a sovereign state under the style and title of the united states of america that france on the  th of february      had acknowledged them that the statesgeneral had done the same on the  0th of april      that great britain on the  0th of november      had signed with them a treaty of peace in which she had fully acknowledged their sovereignty that sweden had entered into a treaty with them on the  th of february      and that great britain had concluded the definitive treaty under the mediation of the two empires if that should be the fact c such a notification to all the other powers would be a regular procedure a piece of politeness which would be very well received and the letter would be     respectfully answered by every power in the world and these written answers would be explicit and undeniable acknowledgments of our sovereignty it might have been proper to make this communication in form immediately after the declaration of independence it might have been more proper to do it after the signature of the provisional treaty but that it was expected it would be done after the definitive treaty that these circular letters might be transmitted to your ministers for peace or such of them as may remain or to any of your ministers in europe to be by them delivered to the ministers at the court where they are or transmitted any other way that congress must be very exact in the etiquette of titles as this was indispensable and the letters could not be answered nor received without it that we might have these titles at the count de vergenness office with precision c the count then proceeded to commerce and said that all the cabinets of europe had lately turned their views to commerce so that we should be attended to and respected by all of them he thought we should find our account in a large trade in italy every part of which had a constant demand for our tobacco and salt fish at least the dominions of the king his master could furnish us in exchange oranges citrons olives oil raisins figs anchovies coral lead sulphur alum salt marble of the finest quality and gayest colors manufactures of silk especially silk stockings twenty per cent cheaper than france hemp and cordage he said we might have great advantages in italy in another respect we had it in our power to become the principal carriers for the people of italy who have little skill or inclination for navigation or commerce the cabotage carrying trade of italy had been carried on by the english french and dutch the english had now lost it the french had some of it but the dutch the most who made an immense profit of it for to his knowledge they sold in the baltic and even in holland many italian productions at a profit of five or six for one that we should have the advantage of them all by bringing our tobacco and fish to italy we might unload at some of their ports take in cargoes upon freight for other ports of italy and thus make coasting voyages until we had made up our cargoes for return or we might take in cargoes on freight for     germany or the baltic the dutch he said would be the greatest losers by this rivalry but as long as the italians and americans would be honestly gainers neither need be anxious for that that there was a very good port in his masters dominions which was perfectly free where we might go in and out at pleasure without being subject to duties searches or visits we then made a transition to turkey the count could not for his part blame the emperor for wishing to open the navigation of the danube his kingdom of hungary was one of the finest countries in the world it was one of the most fertile producing in great abundance wines of various sorts all excellent though tokay was the best grains of every sort in great quantities metals of all sorts—gold silver copper iron quicksilver yet all these blessings of nature were rendered in a manner useless by the slavery of the danube the emperor was very unfortunate in having the danube enslaved on one side and the scheldt on the other and in this age when the liberty of navigation and commerce was the universal cry he did not wonder at his impatience under it he did not think that england would meddle in the dispute as her trade to the levant had declined the dutch had some still but france had now the greatest part of it to smyrna alexandria aleppo in short to all the trading towns of turkey in asia for this is what is understood by the levant trade france he thought could not venture to engage in the war in earnest in the present state of her finances i have learned since i came here that france is desirous that this republic should declare herself concerning this turkish war but she will avoid it unhappily france has lost much of her influence here her friends fear that the odium of losing negapatnam will fall upon them among the people the english and the stadtholderians are endeavoring to detach the republic entirely from france and to revive the ancient connections particularly the ancient alliance offensive and defensive in the treaty of      a mr shirley at paris has lately proposed to m boers and m van der pere two agents of the dutch east india company who have been a year or two at paris and are reputed to be in the stadtholders interest that england had the best dispositions towards the republic and would give them ample satisfaction if they would treat distinctly     from france and renew the ancient cordial friendship and proposed an interview with the dutch ambassadors upon this subject the agents proposed it but brantzen refused to the great satisfaction of the principal republicans yet m berenger tells me that some of the republican members begin to be afraid and to think they shall be obliged to fall in with the english upon conversing with many people in government and out of it in amsterdam as well as the hague they all complain to me of the conduct of france they all confess that the republic has not done so much in the war as she ought but this is the fault of the friends of england they say not those of france and the worst evils of all that befall the latter are the reproaches of the former who now say insultingly this comes of confiding in france we always told you that you would be cheated c france ought they say to have considered this and not have imputed to the republic the faults of her enemies because the punishment falls wholly on her friends i mention these things to you because although we are not immediately interested in them they may have consequences which may affect us and therefore you ought to know them i think however upon the whole the republic will stand firm and refuse to revive the alliance though they sacrifice negapatnam france wishes to win the republic into an alliance but feels an awkwardness about proposing it and indeed i doubt whether she would now succeed she might have succeeded heretofore but in plain english sir the count de vergennes has no conception of the right way of negotiating with any free people or with any assembly aristocratical or democratical he cannot enter into the motives which govern them he never penetrates their real system and never appears to comprehend their constitution with empires and monarchs and their ministers of state he negotiates aptly enough i have the honor to be c john adams     john adams   august      the hague to secretary livingston the hague   august      sir— i had last evening some conversation with d joas theolonico de almeida the envoy extraordinary of portugal who desired to meet me today at any hour at his house or mine i promised to visit him at twelve which i did he said he had heard that the french minister had proposed to the duke of manchester at versailles to reduce the duties upon french wines in england to the level of those upon portugal wines and begged of me to inform him if it were true because if it were portugal must endeavor to indemnify herself by opening a trade with america or some other way for such a project would be ruinous to the sale of their wines in england which was their only market i answered that i had heard of such a project among multitudes of others in private conversation but knew no authenticity for it we have a treaty said he made in   0  by which we have stipulated with the english to permit the importation of their cloths upon condition that they allow the importation of portugal wines upon paying one third of the duty upon french wines if they violate the treaty we shall be rid of it i asked him if his court permitted the english or any other nation to go to the brazils in the last century said he between    0 and    0 we did agree with charles ii who married a daughter of portugal that the english should go to the brazils and after that the dutch sued for permission to go there too and we granted it but we found it inconvenient and in      or      at the treaty of utrecht we agreed upon an article with spain to exclude all nations from the brazils and as the english ambassadors were there we have since held that nation bound and have confiscated their vessels as well as the dutch which ventured there the english have sometimes made strong remonstrances but we have always told them if we admit you we must admit the dutch too and such has been their jealousy of the dutch and dread of their rivalry that this has always quieted them choosing rather to be excluded themselves than that the dutch should be admitted so that this commerce has been a long time carried on in portuguese ships only and directly between the brazils and lisbon     i asked him whether we might not have free communication with all their western islands and whether one or all of them might not be made a depot for the produce of the brazils so that portuguese ships might stop and deposit cargoes there and american vessels take them he said he would write about it to his court by the next post at present brazil communicated only with lisbon and perhaps it might be difficult for government to secure the duties at the western islands i asked if there were any refineries of sugar at lisbon he said none their sugars had all been brought here by the dutch for refining that all their carrying trade with other parts of europe had been carried on by the english and dutch that their mercantile navigation marine marchande before this war had been upon a very poor footing but it was now much changed and they began to carry on their trade in their own vessels i observed if their trade should continue to be carried on by others it must be indifferent to them whether it were done in english dutch or american vessels provided it was done to their equal advantage but if they should persist in the desire to conduct it in their own vessels they might purchase ships ready built in america cheaper than they could build them or buy them elsewhere all this he said was true that they could supply us with sugars coffee cocoa brazil wood and even with tea for they had an island called macao near china which was a flourishing establishment and sent them annually a good deal of tea which the dutch usually bought very cheap at lisbon to sell again he asked whether portugal wines had been much used in america i answered that port wines common lisbon and carcavallos had been before the war frequently used and that madeira was esteemed above all other wine that it was found equally wholesome and agreeable in the heats of summer and the colds of winter so that it would probably continue to be preferred though there was no doubt that a variety of french wines would now be more commonly used than heretofore he said they should have occasion for a great deal of our fish grain and perhaps ships or shiptimber and naval stores and other things and he thought there was a prospect of a very beneficial trade with us and he would write largely to his court upon it i replied that i wondered his court had not     sent a minister to philadelphia where the members and ministers of congress and even the merchants of the city might throw much light upon the subject and assist in framing a treaty to the greatest possible advantage for both countries he said he would write for a commission and instructions to negotiate a treaty with me i told him that i believed his court had already instructed their ambassador at versailles to treat with dr franklin but that i thought that philadelphia or lisbon was the most proper place to treat and that i feared mutual advantages might be lost by this method of striking up a bargain in haste in a distant country between ministers who could not be supposed to have made of commerce a study in a letter from paris yesterday i am informed that a project of a treaty with portugal and another with denmark are to go home by captain barney these projects have never been communicated to me nor to mr jay i hope that congress will not be in haste to conclude them but take time to inform themselves of every thing which may be added to the mutual advantage of the nations and countries concerned i am much mistaken if we have not lost advantages by a similar piece of cunning in the case of sweden with great respect and esteem c john adams john adams   august      the hague to secretary livingston the hague   august      sir— m berenger the secretary of the french legation has this moment left me he came in to inform me of the news the empress of russia has communicated to the king of prussia a treaty of alliance between the emperor of germany and her defensive against the christian powers and offensive against the turk the king of prussia has answered her that he is very sensible upon this communication as one is upon the communication of things of great importance thus wrapped up in an impenetrable reserve is this great warrior and statesman we may discern by this answer what all the world would know without it namely—that his majesty has no joy in this new alliance still he expresses no sorrow and maintains a     perfect liberty to take which side he will or neither at his pleasure and the same reserve he will probably hold to the end of the war m berenger says if prussia is neutral france must be so too for she cannot cope by land with the two empires that this republic is desired to declare but does not choose it that they are dissatisfied and the republicans murmur a good deal and are wavering and that the other party will do nothing that england hitherto has favored an accommodation between russia and the turk that the british ambassador at constantinople has coöperated with the french to bring about an accommodation that the turks have offered russia the free navigation of the black sea and passage of the dardanelles and the same with a free navigation of the danube to the emperor but they will not accept it but are determined to drive the turks from europe that france has determined to put her army upon a war footing because it has been much neglected during the late war that he believes france and spain will shut the mediterranean against a turkish fleet as russia sweden and denmark excluded warlike vessels from the baltic in the last war that this state of things gives him great pain and must embarrass the count de vergennes it is a great and difficult question whether france should take a side if she does not and the empires should prevail it will be an immense aggrandizement of the house of austria which with russia will become two great maritime powers that england will act an insidious part pretend to favor peace secretly foment war and join in at the end if she sees a favorable opportunity to crush france these are sensible observations of m berenger who added that a new difficulty in the way of the definitive treaty had arisen between england and spain respecting the musquito shore so that more couriers must go and return i confess myself as much in pain at this state of things as m berenger and therefore i wish most ardently that we may omit no proper means of settling our question with every court in europe and especially our plan of commerce with great britain if this is too long left in uncertainty the face of things may soon change so as to involve us in the complicated extensive and long war which seems to be now opening   0 my advices from england are that lord sheffield with his friends—deane arnold skene and p wentworth—are making a party unfriendly to us that the ministry adopt their sentiments and measures that fox has lost his popularity and devoted himself to north who has the kings ear and disposes of places that burke is mad with rage and passion that the honest men are much disgusted that there is no parliamentary reform the merchants that commerce does not revive the moneyed men at their wits end on account of the conduct of the bank and the army and navy disbanding in a spirit of revolt that it is much to be feared that in a year there will be a convulsion in the state and public credit ruined that the present ministry cannot stand to the meeting of parliament for that nothing has been or can be done by them the prospect of returning to paris and living there without my family in absolute idleness at a time when so many and so great things want to be done for our country elsewhere is very disagreeable if we must live there waiting for the moving of many waters and treaties are to be there negotiated with the powers of europe or only with denmark and portugal i pray that we may all be joined in the business as we are in the commission for peace that at least we may have the satisfaction of knowing what is done and of giving a hint for the public good if any one occurs to us and that we may not be made the sport and ridicule of all europe as well as of those who contrive such humiliations for us i declare i had rather be doorkeeper to congress than live at paris as i have done for the last six months with the greatest respect c john adams john adams   august      the hague to secretary livingston the hague   august      sir— the fiscal systems of the powers of europe have such an ill influence on commerce that they deserve the serious attention of congress and their ministers whenever they have under consideration a treaty with any foreign power in conversation yesterday with m dasp the chargé des affaires of sweden i inquired of him what imposts were payable in their ports upon the importation and exportation of merchandises and     observed to him that i had lately seen in the gazettes that the king had taken off certain duties upon the importation of merchandises from america in swedish ships he agreed that such a thing had been done this ought to alarm us all the powers of europe who are called neutral have felt a sudden increase of their navigation in the course of the late war and the profits they have made have excited a desire to augment it still further if they should generally exact duties of our ships and none of their own upon the importation of our produce this will be as great a discouragement to our navigation as it will be an encouragement to theirs whether this has been attended to in the treaty with sweden i know not for i have not seen it but it ought to be carefully considered by those who negotiate the treaties with denmark and portugal the emperor and empress and all other powers we have a good right to insist that no distinction shall be made in their ports between their ships and ours that we should pay in their ports no higher duties than they pay in ours i should think it therefore advisable for congress to instruct their negotiators to endeavor to obtain equity in this respect this is the time for it if ever if we cannot obtain it by negotiation we must think and talk of doing ourselves justice by making similar distinctions in our own ports between our vessels and theirs but here again comes in the difficulty of uniting our states in such measures a difficulty which must be surmounted or our commerce navigation and marine will still be ruined notwithstanding the conservation of the fisheries it deserves to be considered by whom this new method of huddling up treaties at paris is contrived and for what purposes it may well be conjectured that it is done with the secret intention of preventing these things from being attended to for there are persons who had rather that any other people should have navigation than the americans i have good reasons to believe that it was known at versailles that mr dana had well digested his thoughts upon this subject which was reason enough for some people to endeavor to take sweden out of his hands in whose department it was their success is much to be lamented i had yesterday and the day before long conversations with the baron van der capellen de pol and m gyselaer they both complain to me in the most pathetic terms of the cruel situation     of the friends of america and france in this republic they both say that they are looking round every way like drowning men for support the province of friesland their great dependence wavers and many of their fellowlaborers are discouraged they both inquired of me very earnestly if closer connections could not be formed with us if we could not agree to warrant to each other the liberty of navigation or enter into an alliance offensive and defensive they see they shall be obliged to make a shameful peace and that the blame of it will fall upon them which will give a triumph to the court and put their persons even in danger they say the king of france by his ambassador in july      gave them a positive assurance that he would never separate his cause from theirs in consequence of this they had instructed their ambassadors never to separate their cause from his on their part the agreement had been sacredly observed but not on the other with great britain enraged against them with a formidable party in the republic furious against them with the king of prussia threatening them and abandoned by france their prospects are they say as disagreeable as can be conceived there are many appearances of designs to excite the people to seditions and i think it probable that the court of london studies delays of the definitive treaty in this hope i still believe however that the people will be wise and the republic firm and submit to the immense losses of the war and that of negapatnam rather than renew their old submission to the court and to england i have the honor to be c john adams john adams  0 august      paris to secretary livingston paris  0 august      sir— on the  th i left the hague and last night arrived here i had several interviews on some of the last days at the hague which i had not time to give you an account of as a great part of my time was taken up with visits to take leave of the court the president the grand pensionary greffier c ceremonies which must be repeated at every coming and going and upon many other occasions to the no small interruption of business of more importance     i asked the count de sanafée the spanish minister with whom i have always lived upon very good terms whether it might not be possible to persuade his court that it would be good policy for them to allow to the citizens of the united states of america a free port in some of their islands at least if not upon the continent of south america he said he did not know that he thought however his court would be afraid of the measure as free ports were nests of smugglers and afforded many facilities of illicit trade le commerce interlope i asked him further whether measures might not be taken at madrid to the end that the sugars coffee cocoa c of their colonies might be carried to the free ports of france holland and denmark in the west indies or one of them in spanish vessels that they might be there purchased by americans he said he was not able to foresee any objection against this i asked him again what objections there could be to admitting american vessels to the spanish islands of cuba and hispaniola to carry their produce and purchase molasses as they did in the french and dutch colonies such a commerce would be useful and profitable both to them and to us he said that he could not pretend to give any opinion upon any of these points but that we must negotiate them at madrid i hope congress will instruct their minister at the court of madrid to propose all these things and endeavor to obtain them the portuguese envoy don almeida returned my visit and brought with him a copy of the treaty between spain and portugal made at utrecht in      this treaty was signed under the warranty of great britain and one article of it is that each nation shall confine the commerce with its possessions in america to its own subjects i had much satisfaction in the conversation of this minister who though a young man appears possessed of more than common intelligence and a desire to inform himself of every thing which can affect his nation he is as he told me a nephew of the present prime minister at the court of lisbon he says that the king his master a style which they continue to use although the queen is the sovereign and her husband is but her subject allows but sixty thousand dutch guilders a year to his ambassador at versailles which not being sufficient for his expenses at that court he is continued there because he is very rich but that he is not a man of business     he again enlarged upon the subject of portuguese navigation which has been prettily increased très joliment augmentée during the late war and would have been still doubled if the war had continued another year that their merchants and mariners had pushed their navigation with more spirit than skill had sent their wines and other things in prize vessels purchased in france and spain all over europe but that their seamen not being experienced many vessels had been lost so that the price of insurance was ten per cent with them when it was not more than three or four with other neutral nations that the profits had nevertheless been so considerable as to excite a strong inclination still to increase their shipping and carrying trade these observations are worth repeating to congress because all the other neutral powers have felt a like advantage the commerce of the northern powers was so increased and had turned the course of business that way to such a degree as occasioned to the danish minister at versailles for example a loss of forty per cent upon his salary so much was exchange affected the late belligerent powers having observed this sudden increase of the commerce of the neutrals and that it was owing to the sudden growth of their navigation are alarmed so that the attention of all the commercial nations is now turned to navigation carrying trade coasting trade c more than ever we should be apprised of this and upon our guard our navigation and carrying trade is not to be neglected we have great advantages for many branches of it and have a right to claim our natural share in it this morning i went out to passy and found from dr franklin and mr jay that nothing farther had been done since my departure but to deliver to mr hartley a fair copy of the project of a definitive treaty which i had left with my colleagues that mr laurens had been here in my absence and returned to england that he was of opinion the present british ministry would not remain a fortnight that mr hartley had been seven weeks without a letter from his principals and then received only an apology for not having written a promise to write soon and authority to assure the american ministers that all would go well these last are words of course there are but three ways in which i can account for this conduct of the british ministry   the fact is that they foresee a change     and do not choose to commit themselves but wish to reserve every thing for the foundation of a future opposition that they may attack the definitive treaty which may be made by a future ministry as they attacked the provisional and preliminary one made by the last   that they are exciting secretly and insidiously the troubles in the north in hopes of involving france and then assuming a higher tone   that they are in expectation that seditions may be excited in holland and the dutch induced to renounce france and renew the ancient alliance with england i see no more appearance of the definitive treaty than i have done these six months mr hartley i am told by mr jay thinks that the french court wish to delay the signature that they do not wish to see the peace finished between england and america while matters are uncertain in the north there are so many considerations on both sides of the question whether the french minister wishes to finish soon or not that it is hard to decide it neither court possibly is very zealous to finish while so great a scene as the northern war lies under so much obscurity i have the honor to be c john adams john adams    august      paris to secretary livingston paris    august      sir— yesterday i went to court with dr franklin and presented to the count de vergennes our project of a definitive treaty who told us he would examine it and give us his sentiments upon it it was ambassadors day and i had conversations with a number of ministers of which it is proper i should give you an account the dutch ambassador berkenrode told me that last saturday the count de vergennes went to paris and dined with the imperial ambassador the count de mercy in company with the duke of manchester the count daranda the prince bariatinski and m markow with their secretaries that after dinner the secretaries in presence of all the ministers read over compared and corrected the definitive treaties between france and great britain and between spain and great britain and finally     agreed upon both so that they are now ready for signature by the ministers of great britain france and spain as principals and by those of the two imperial courts as mediators the duke of manchester told me that mr hartleys courier who carried our project of a treaty arrived in london last saturday and might be expected here next saturday on his return in the evening on my return from versailles mr hartley called upon me at my house and informed me that he had just received a courier from westminster who had brought him the ratification of our provisional treaty under the kings own hand and under the great seal of the kingdom inclosed in a silver box ornamented with golden tassels as usual which he was ready to exchange tomorrow morning he informed me farther that he had received very satisfactory letters from the duke of portland and mr fox and the strongest assurances that the dispositions of his court were very good to finish immediately and to arrange all things upon the best footing that he had farther received plenary authority to sign the definitive treaty tomorrow or tonight if we pleased that he had received a draft ready formed which he would show us we agreed to go together in the morning to my colleagues and this morning we went out in mr hartleys carriage exchanged the ratifications and he produced to us his project of a definitive treaty it is the provisional treaty in so many words without addition or diminution it is only preceded with a preamble which makes it a definitive treaty and he proposed to us that all matters of discussion respecting commerce or other things should be left to be discussed by ministers to be mutually appointed to reside in london and philadelphia we told him that it had been proposed to us that the ministers of the two imperial courts should sign the treaty as mediators and that we had answered that we had no objection to it he said he had unanswerable ones first he had no authority and could not obtain any certainly under ten days nor probably ever for secondly it would he thought give great offence to his court and they never would agree that any nation should interfere between them and america thirdly for his part he was fully against it and should write his opinion     to his court if he was about to marry his daughter or set up a son in the world after he was of age he would never admit any of his neighbors to intervene and sign any contract he might make as mediators there was no need of it we told him there was no need of warmth upon the occasion or any pretence for his court to take offence that it had been proposed to us that the imperial ministers should sign as mediators our answer had been that we had no objections that we were willing and ready to consent to it or even to request it his court had a right to consent or dissent as it thought proper to be sure the mediation could not take place without their consent that he might write to his court the proposition and if he received orders to consent or dissent it would be equally well in the mean time we were ready to sign the definitive treaty either with or without the mediation whenever the other parties were ready to sign according to his project just received from his court that is simply a repetition of the provisional treaty we have agreed to this because it is plain that all propositions for alterations in the provisional articles will be an endless discussion and that we must give more than we can hope to receive the critical state of things in england and at the court of versailles and in all the rest of europe affords pressing motives to get this business finished mr hartley told us from his court that they had expected an american minister at st jamess these three months and that all further matters might be there discussed he also announced to us the birth of another princess the fifteenth child of the queen upon which event he received our congratulations which i hope congress will approve and repeat by their minister in london for these personal and family compliments are more attended to in courts and have greater effects than may be imagined i lament very much that we cannot obtain an explanation of the article respecting the refugees and that respecting debts but it is plain we must give more than they are worth for such explanations and what is of more decisive importance we must make a long delay and put infinitely greater things at hazard by this means i have the honor to be c john adams     john adams    august      paris to secretary livingston paris    august      sir— yesterday at versailles the baron de walterstorff came to me and told me he had delivered to dr franklin a project of a treaty between the court of denmark and the united states and asked me if dr franklin had shown it to me i answered him that i knew nothing of it he said he wondered at that he presumed it was because of my absence at the hague for that it had been shown to mr jay there by the way he was misinformed for upon my return from versailles i called upon mr jay on purpose to ask him and he assured me he had not seen it i asked walterstorff if his orders were to propose his project to us all he said no this court had been informed that dr franklin was the minister authorized and empowered by congress to treat with all the powers of europe and they had for this reason sent him orders to deliver the project to dr franklin but he supposed dr franklin would consult his colleagues the same information i doubt not has been given to the court of portugal and every other court in europe namely—that dr franklin is alone empowered to treat with them and in consequence of it very probably propositions have been or will be made to him from all of them and he will keep the whole as secret as he can from mr jay mr laurens mr dana and me now i beg to be informed by congress whether he has such authority or not having never been informed of such powers i do not believe he has them i remember there was seven years ago a resolution of congress that their commissioners at versailles should have power to treat with the other powers of europe but upon the dissolution of that commission this authority was dissolved with it or if not it still resides in mr deane mr lee and myself who were once in that commission as well as dr franklin and if it is by virtue of this power he acts he ought at least to communicate with me who alone am present i think however that neither he nor i have any legal authority and therefore that he ought to communicate every thing of this kind to all the ministers here or hereabout mr jay mr laurens and myself at least     it is not from the vain wish of seeing my poor name upon a treaty that i write this if the business is well done it is not of much importance in itself who does it but my duty to my country obliges me to say that i seriously believe this clandestine manner of smuggling treaties is contrived by european politicians on purpose that mr jay and i may not have an opportunity of suggesting ideas for the preservation of american navigation transport trade and nurseries of seamen but in another point of view it is of equal importance this method reflects contempt and ridicule upon your other ministers when all europe sees that a number of your ministers are kept here as a kind of satellites to dr franklin in the affair of peace but that they are not to be consulted or asked a question or even permitted to know the important negotiations which are here going on with all europe they fall into contempt it cannot be supposed that congress mean to cast this contempt upon us because it cannot be supposed they mean to destroy the reputation character influence and usefulness of those to whom in other respects they intrust powers of so much consequence and therefore i am persuaded that congress is as much imposed on by it as the courts of europe are i asked the baron what was the substance of the treaty he said his court had taken for a model my treaty with holland i said nothing to him in answer to this but i beg leave to say to congress that the negotiation with holland was in very different circumstances we were then in the fiercest rage of the war a treaty with that republic was at that time of as much weight in the war as the captivity of burgoyne or cornwallis a treaty with any power was worth a battle or a siege and no moments of time were to be lost especially in a country so divided that unanimity being necessary every proposition was dangerous at present the case is altered and we may take time to weigh and inquire the baron tells me that st thomas and st john two of their islands are free ports but that st croix which is of more importance than both is not that foreign vessels our vessels are permitted to bring our produce and carry away half the value in sugar c the island produces communibus annis twenty thousand hogsheads of sugar and their molasses is better than that of the french because   0 they make only sucres brutes he says they have some sugarhouses at copenhagen but notwithstanding this i think it is worth while for congress to try if they cannot by the treaty obtain a right to take away cargoes to the full value of those they bring it is worth while to try too if we cannot obtain a tariff to ascertain the duties to be paid on exportation and importation it is worth while too to endeavor to get the duties ascertained in the danish ports in europe at least that we may not pay in their ports more than they pay in ours or that our vessels may not be obliged to pay more than theirs especially when we import our own produce i pretend not to be a master of these commercial subjects but i think that dr franklin has not studied the subject more than myself that both of us need the advice of mr laurens and mr jay and that all of us want that of american merchants and especially of congress i am therefore against this secret and hasty method of concluding treaties at this time when they may be more maturely reflected on i know very well to what illnatured remarks these reflections are liable but they shall not hinder me from doing my duty i do seriously believe there are clandestine insinuations going about to every commercial nation in the world to excite them to increase their own navigation and seamen at the expense of ours and that this smuggling of treaties is one means of accomplishing the design although dr franklin may not be let into the secret of it for from long experience and observation i am persuaded that one minister at least and his dependents would prefer that the navigation of any nation in the world even that of the english should grow rather than ours in the last courier de leurope it is said that all the commercial powers are concerting measures to clip the wings of the eagle and to prevent us from having a navy i believe it that is to say i believe measures are taken with them all to bring them into this system although they are not let into the secret design and do not know from whom the measures come nor with what views promoted with great regard i have the honor to be c john adams     john adams    august      paris to secretary livingston paris    august      sir— france england spain and america are all agreed but mr hartley is sanguine that the treaty will not be signed because he says the count de vergennes does not mean to sign it his reasons for this opinion i know not and i think he is mistaken it is very certain however that the french minister is embarrassed and would not perhaps be sorry to find good reasons for postponing the signature for some time congress may judge in some degree of the situation of things by the following conversation which i had this morning with m brantzen the ambassador extraordinary from the statesgeneral to whom i returned the visit he made me yesterday when i was abroad he told me that he was as far and indeed farther than ever from an agreement with the duke of manchester he had given up he said all pretensions to a compensation for the unjust damages of the war and he had in a manner waved his claim of the restitution of negapatnam but the duke of manchester now insisted peremptorily upon not only all the ancient salutations from the dutch flag to the english but an unlimited liberty of navigation in all the seas of the east indies he had despatched an express to the hague the day before yesterday who would arrive today but the grand pensionary was sick and the states of holland not sitting so that there must be some time before he could have an answer concerning the salutes to the flag there would be different opinions but they would be all of a mind against the liberty of navigation in the indies he could not therefore expect from their high mightinesses permission to sign and the count de vergennes would be embarrassed all the other powers were ready and to make them wait would raise a cry to sign without holland would raise a terrible storm in holland against the count and no small one in france and even if the states should authorize him to sign a shameful peace this would raise no less clamor in holland and france against the count he will therefore not know what to do and will seek to postpone for the parties of the marquis de     castries and of m de breteuil will take advantage of every clamor against the count as these parties wish m de breteuil in his place i am persuaded therefore that the count himself looks upon his own situation as very hazardous it has been so a long time it was his instability in his place that made him sign the preliminaries for money to carry on the war could not be obtained without m necker and m necker would not come in with the count as they were and are sworn enemies to each other he was therefore reduced to the dilemma to make peace or go out i have good reasons to believe that the maréchal de castries disapproves of the counts conduct towards our republic he certainly deceived me the statesgeneral did very wrong to bind me to leave so much to the french minister but i thought him an honest man and that i could trust him so i left things to him according to my instructions depending on his word and at last i found myself the dupe no not a dupe for i am always upon my guard not to be a dupe but he deceived me and when one whom i have reason to believe an honest man deceives me i cannot call myself a dupe for i can do no other than believe an honest man when he gives me his word in several of your letters sir you have insisted on my reciting to you my conversations with foreign ministers you must not esteem them infallible oracles they are often mistaken in their facts and sometimes wrong in their reasonings but these sentiments of m brantzen are of so much importance that i thought proper to recite them it will indeed be necessary for your foreign ministers to be more inquisitive than we have been and to transmit to congress more information concerning the intrigues of courts than we have done if the maréchal de castries and m de breteuil who is now in the council and m necker are not friends to the count de vergennes and all the world here agree they are not congress ought to know it although i would have so much respect to the queen as not to name her majesty upon unnecessary occasions yet upon this when she is sister to the emperor and the question at court is whether there shall be a war with her brother it is obviously a matter of so much importance as to make it a duty to communicate to congress her sentiments which all men here agree are favorable to de castries and breteuil but     not partial to the present minister of foreign affairs i said in a former letter if this minister continues there will be war but i am told by some if there is war he cannot continue for neither he nor his friends can raise the money m de rayneval however affirmed positively to mr hartley that nothing but death could remove the count  all these things show the critical and uncertain constitution of this court and the uncertainty when the definitive treaty will be signed notwithstanding that four powers are agreed and therefore i can give congress no clear information upon that head this is a great chagrin to me both on account of the public and myself because i am as uncertain about my own destiny as that of the public with great respect i have the honor to be c john adams john adams   september      paris to the president of congress paris   september      sir— on wednesday the  d day of this month the american ministers met the british minister at his lodgings at the hôtel de york and signed sealed and delivered the definitive treaty of peace between the united states of america and the king of great britain although it is but a confirmation or repetition of the provisional articles i have the honor to congratulate congress upon it as it is a completion of the work of peace and the best that we could obtain nothing remains now to be done but a treaty of commerce but this in my opinion cannot be negotiated without a new commission from congress to some one or more persons time it is easy to foresee will not be likely to render the british nation more disposed to a regulation of commerce favorable to us and therefore my advice is to issue a commission as soon as may be there is another subject on which i beg leave to represent to congress my sentiments because they seem to me of importance     and because they differ from many sanguine opinions which will be communicated to the members of that assembly from partisans both of england and france in the late deliberations concerning an acceptance of the mediation of the imperial courts the british minister refused it and in the conferences we had with the count de vergennes upon this subject it was manifest enough to me that he was not fond of our accepting it for although he maintained a perfect impartiality of language neither advising us for nor against the measure yet at last when it was observed that mr hartley was averse to it he turned to dr franklin and said that we must agree with mr hartley about it with such a countenance air and tone of voice for from these you must often collect the sentiments of ministers as convinced me he did not wish the mediation should take place it was not a subject which would bear insisting on either way i therefore made no difficulty but i am upon recollection fully of opinion that we should have done wisely to have sent our letter to the imperial ministers accepting the mediation on our part the signature of these ministers would have given us reputation in europe and among our own citizens i mention these because i humbly conceive that congress ought in all their proceedings to consider the opinion that the united states or the people of america will entertain of themselves we may call this national vanity or national pride but it is the main principle of the national sense of its own dignity and a passion in human nature without which nations cannot preserve the character of man let the people lose this sentiment as in poland and a partition of their country will soon take place our country has but lately been a dependent one and our people although enlightened and virtuous have had their minds and hearts habitually filled with all the passions of a dependent and subordinate people that is to say with fear with diffidence and distrust of themselves with admiration of foreigners c now i say that it is one of the most necessary and one of the most difficult branches of the policy of congress to eradicate from the american mind every remaining fibre of this fear and selfdiffidence on one hand and of this excessive admiration of foreigners on the other it cannot be doubted one moment that a solemn acknowledgment     of us by the signature of the two imperial courts would have had such a tendency in the minds of our countrymen but we should also consider upon every occasion how our reputation will be affected in europe we shall not find it easy to keep up the respect for us that has been excited by the continual publication of the exploits of the war in the calm of peace little will be said about us in europe unless we prepare for it but by those who have designs upon us we may depend upon it every thing will be said in europe and in the gazettes which anybody in europe wants to have repeated in america to make such impressions upon the minds of our citizens as he desires it will become us therefore to do every thing in our power to make reasonable and just impressions upon the public opinion in europe the signature of the two imperial courts would have made a deep and important impression in our favor upon full one half of europe as friends to those courts and upon all the other half as enemies i need not explain myself further i may however add that americans can scarcely conceive the decisive influence of the governments of europe upon their people every nation is a piece of clockwork every wheel is under the absolute direction of the sovereign as its weight or spring in consequence of this all that moiety of mankind that are subject to the two imperial courts and their allies would in consequence of their mediation have been openly and decidedly our friends at this hour and the other half of europe would certainly have respected us the more for this but at present the two imperial courts not having signed the treaty all their friends are left in a state of doubt and timidity concerning us from all the conversations i have had with the count de mercy and m markow it is certain that the two courts wished as these ministers certainly were ambitious to sign our treaty they and their sovereigns wished that their names might be read in america and there respected as our friends but this is now past england and france will be most perfectly united in all artifices and endeavors to keep down our reputation at home and abroad to mortify our selfconceit and to lessen us in the opinion of the world if we will not see we must be the dupes we need not for we have in our own power with the common blessing the means of every thing we want there is but one     course now left to retrieve the error and that is to send a minister to vienna with power to make a treaty with both the imperial courts congress must send a minister first or it will never be done the emperor never sends first nor will england ever send a minister to america until congress shall have sent one to london to form immediate commercial connections with that half of europe which ever has been and with little variations ever will be opposite to the house of bourbon is a fundamental maxim of that system of american politics which i have pursued invariably from the beginning of this war it is the only means of preserving the respect of the house of bourbon itself it is the only means in conjunction with our connections with the house of bourbon already formed to secure us the respect of england for any length of time and to keep us out of another war with that kingdom it is in short the only possible means of securing to our country that peace neutrality impartiality and indifference in european wars which in my opinion we shall be unwise in the last degree if we do not maintain it is besides the only way in which we can improve and extend our commercial connections to the best advantage with great respect i am john adams john adams   september      paris to the president of congress paris   september      sir— yesterday morning mr jay informed me that dr franklin had received and soon after the doctor put into my hands the resolution of congress of the  st of may  ordering a commission and instructions to be prepared to those gentlemen and myself for making a treaty of commerce with great britain this resolution with your excellencys letter arrived     very seasonably as mr hartley was setting off for london with information from us that our powers were executed i am very sensible of the honor that is done me by this resolution of congress and of the great importance of the business committed to our care and shall not therefore hesitate to take a part in it i can attend to this business and at the same time have some care of your affairs in holland and in case the present loan should be full in the course of the next winter i can open a new one either by going to amsterdam or by having the obligations sent to me in paris to be signed in this way there will be no additional expense to the public as i have informed m dumas that there must be no expense made at the hague on my account or on account of congress but that all his expenses must be borne by himself or he must at least settle them with congress i have so much regard for this gentleman and such an opinion of his worth and merit that i cannot but recommend him upon this occasion to congress for the commission of secretary of that legation but as economy is and ought to be carefully attended to i presume not to point out the salary which will be proper there are so many ways of pillaging public men in europe that it will be difficult for congress to conceive the expenses which are unavoidable in these countries if the principle of economy should restrain congress from sending ministers to vienna petersburg copenhagen and lisbon they will probably send a commission to paris to negotiate treaties there because i think it will appear to be of great importance both in a political and commercial light to have treaties with those powers if this should be the case as three of us will be now obliged to attend at paris the tedious negotiation with england we can all at the same time and with the same expense attend to the negotiations with the other powers which will afford to all an opportunity of throwing in any hints which may occur for the public good and will have a much better appearance in the eyes of europe and america i do not hesitate therefore to request that if such a commission or commissions should be sent all your ministers in europe may be inserted in it if the arrangement should make any difficulty in america it will make none with me for although i think there was good reason for the order     in which the names stand in the new commission for peace and in the resolution for a new commission for a treaty of commerce that reason will not exist in any future commission mr hartleys powers are sufficient to go through the negotiation with us and i suppose it will be chiefly conducted at paris yet we may all think it proper to make a tour to london for a few weeks especially in case any material obstacle should arise we are told that such a visit would have a good effect at court and with the nation at least it seems clear it would do no harm with the greatest respect and esteem c john adams john adams   september      paris to the president of congress paris   september      sir— as the resolution of congress of the  st of may has determined it to be my duty to remain in europe at least another winter i shall be obliged to say many things to your excellency by letter which i hoped to have had the honor of saying upon the floor of your house some of these things may be thought at first of little consequence but time and inquiry and consideration will show them to have weight of this sort is the subject of this letter the views and designs the intrigues and projects of courts are let out by insensible degrees and with infinite art and delicacy in the gazettes these channels of communication are very numerous and they are artificially complicated in such a manner that very few persons are able to trace the sources from whence insinuations and projects flow the english papers are an engine by which every thing is scattered all over the world they are open and free the eyes of mankind are fixed upon them they are taken by all courts and all politicians and by almost all gazetteers of these papers the french emissaries in london even in time of war but especially in time of peace make a very great use they insert in them things which they wish to have circulated far and wide some of the paragraphs inserted in them will do to circulate through all europe and some will not     do in the courier de leurope this is the most artful paper in the world it is continually accommodating between the french and english ministry if it should offend the english essentially the ministry would prevent its publication if it should sin against the french unpardonably the ministry would instantly stop its circulation it is therefore continually under the influence of the french ministers whose underworkers have many things translated into it from the english papers and many others inserted in it originally both to the end that they may be circulated over the world and particularly that they may be seen by the king of france who reads this paper constantly from the english papers and the courier de leurope many things are transferred into various other gazettes—the courier du bas rhin the gazette de deux ponts the courier davignon and the gazette des pays bas the gazettes of leyden and amsterdam are sometimes used for the more grave and solid objects those of deux ponts and avignon for popular topics the small talk of coffeehouses and still smaller and lower circles all these papers and many others discover a perpetual complaisance for the french ministry because they are always in their power so entirely that if an offensive paragraph appears the entrance and distribution of the gazette may be stopped by an order from court by which the gazetteer loses the sale of his paper in france which is a great pecuniary object whoever shall hereafter come to europe in any public employment and take in the papers above enumerated will acknowledge his obligations to me for mentioning them he will find them a constant source of amusement and sometimes of useful discoveries i may hereafter possibly entertain congress with some curious speculations from these gazettes which all have their attention fixed upon us and very often honor us with their animadversions sometimes with their grave counsels but oftener still with very subtle and sly insinuations with great respect i have the honor to be c john adams   0 john adams  0 september      paris to the president of congress paris  0 september      sir— as i am to remain in europe for some time longer i beg leave to take a cursory view of what appears necessary or expedient to be further done in europe for i conceive it to be not only the right but the duty of a foreign minister to advise his sovereign according to his lights and judgment although the more extensive information and superior wisdom of the sovereign may frequently see cause to pursue a different conduct with spain no doubt congress will negotiate by a particular minister either the present one or another and perhaps it would be proper that the same should treat with naples with the two empires prussia denmark portugal sardinia and tuscany i humbly conceive it might be proper to negotiate and perhaps with hamburg but there are other powers with whom it is more necessary to have treaties than it ought to be i mean morocco algiers tunis and tripoli i presume that congress will not think it expedient to be at the expense of sending ministers to all these powers if to any perhaps in the present state of our finances it may not be worth while to send any yet the present time is the best to negotiate with all i submit it to consideration then whether it is not advisable to send a commission to such ministers as you judge proper with full powers to treat with all to the ministers now in paris or to any others but i humbly conceive that if powers to treat with all or any of these states are sent to any of your ministers now here it would be for the public good that they should be sent to all if congress can find funds to treat with the barbary powers the ministers here are the best situated for they should apply to the court of versailles and their high mightinesses in the first place that orders should be sent to their consuls according to treaties to assist us ministers here may carry on this negotiation by letters or may be empowered to send an agent if necessary i have no private interest in this business my salary will be the same my expenses more and labor much increased by such a measure but as it is of public importance i think that no unnecessary     delicacies should restrain me from suggesting these hints to congress whatever their determination may be it will be satisfactory to me i have the honor to be with the greatest respect your excellencys c john adams robert morris  0 september      john adams robert morris to john adams office of finance  0 september      sir— i have been duly honored with your excellencys favors of the  th  0th and   th of july  i have taken the liberty to make some extracts from the two latter which are transmitted in a letter to the governor of massachusetts a copy whereof is inclosed permit me sir to give my feeble approbation and applause to those sentiments of wisdom and integrity which are as happily expressed as they are forcibly conceived the necessity of strengthening our confederation providing for our debts and forming some federal constitution begins to be most seriously felt but unfortunately for america the narrow and illiberal prejudices of some have taken such deep root that it must be difficult and may prove impracticable to remove them i agree with you sir in opinion that the late peace was not all circumstances considered a bad one for england it is undoubtedly a peace equally glorious to and necessary for america all ranks of men in this country feel as well as perceive the benefits of it and the faultfinders for such men there always will be are borne down by the general torrent of applause i was happy to learn by the washington packet that you intended a short trip to amsterdam for the purpose of urging on the loan i hope you may have met with the success due to your zeal and abilities i shall ask no greater with perfect respect i have the honor to be c robert morris     robert morris  0 september      inclosed robert morris to the governor of massachusetts office of finance  0 september      sir— i should do injustice to my own feelings if i did not inclose you the extracts of letters i have lately received under date of the  0th and   th july from a wise and virtuous citizen of your state the sentiments on public credit contained in these letters so just and forcible in themselves must receive a double weight from the consideration that mr adams during his late important negotiations has been in a situation to see feel and know the importance of the subject on which he writes and to search scrutinize and examine it to the bottom i am sir c robert morris jan willink    october      amsterdam john adams messrs willink and others to john adams amsterdam    october      sir— some time having elapsed since we had the honor of addressing your excellency we now take the liberty of informing you sir of our having received letters from mr morris giving us intelligence of certain drafts which he had partly already made on us and which he should yet make though the total amount together was much more than we now have in cash for the united states of america his excellency is in the idea that before this time we should have provided that for which m grand may have occasion though not exactly knowing what that may be we have given the necessary advice to m grand that he must place no reliance upon being furnished by us and we thought it advisable also to give your excellency the same notice it is exceedingly painful for us to be obliged to say that the success of the loan since the month of august is not such as we had reason to expect when in the summer we had the honor of conversing with your excellency besides the uncommon scarcity of money a principal cause of the loan not succeeding     is the great number of accounts received of disputes in america between the particular states and congress it is true this intelligence is mostly communicated by the english newspapers and is worthy of little or no credit even as we ourselves look upon it but it makes more impression upon the moneylenders who always incline to mistrust without cause especially at a time when through a great concurrence of loans they are not at a loss with their money we are constantly hoping we shall be able by receiving direct intelligence from america to evince the falsehood of the english accounts or that your excellency or the other ministers would do it but to this time is this hope not realized if your excellency was in possession of authentic intelligence upon this matter we think the publication of it would do much service in procuring a better success to our continual endeavors for selling of the bonds in sentiments of the greatest respect c wilhem and jan willink nich and jacob van staphorst de la lande and fynje elias boudinot   november      princeton john adams the president of congress to john adams princeton   november      sir— i have the honor of acknowledging the receipt of your several public letters under the dates of june the   d to july the   th inclusive by captain barney nothing is done in consequence of these letters but what is contained in the instructions inclosed in my official letter by this opportunity to the commissioners jointly congress have not come to any further determination on your last letters relative to your resignation on account of the peace arrangement not being yet settled perhaps there will be but very few ministers employed in europe and these in the character of residents or simply ministers the conduct of great britain does not appear yet very conciliating and her measures on this side the water have rather tended to irritate than otherwise congress will not be in a hurry to send a minister to the court of london till they see     how the definitive treaty will end we have an account this day from colonel ogden that it was signed on the  d of september and that mr thaxter is on his way with it whom we long to see your letters on the subject of our credit abroad and the strengthening and cementing the union at home came at a happy moment and have had a very good effect your countrymen were running wild on this subject but your observations and opinion have helped to check them and the legislature of massachusetts have passed the five per cent impost recommended by congress m van berckel is arrived and yesterday received his first public audience of congress his address and our answer i send to the commissioners jointly he appears to justify the high opinion we had formed of the wisdom of the states of the united netherlands their choice of a minister so consonant to the temper and manners of the citizens of these states shows their judgment and prudence we are much pleased with this gentleman and as far as i can judge from present appearances i may venture to predict that he will cement the union of the two republics i shall leave the chair of congress on monday and return to private life at elizabethtown after almost eight years spent in the service of my country i rejoice to have seen the end of all our labors so happily accomplished and shall ever revere those great men who have lent a helping hand to the glorious work in private or public life i shall be always glad of the honor of a line from you sir if but to announce your health and welfare i have the honor to be c elias boudinot robert morris   november      john adams robert morris to john adams office of finance   november      sir— i am honored with your excellencys favor of the   th of july from amsterdam for which i pray you to accept my acknowledgments i am perfectly in sentiment with you that it is best to avoid government interference in the affair of our loan if there were no other reason i should not like the demand of grateful acknowledgment which would be erected     on that foundation we hear enough already of our national obligations and i most heartily wish for my own part that we could at once acquit them all even to the uttermost farthing for i seriously believe that both nations and individuals generally prove better friends when no obligations can be charged nor acknowledgments and retributions claimed on either side i am also very strongly in opinion with you that remittances from this country would greatly uphold our credit in europe for in mercantile life nothing vivifies credit like punctuality and plenteousness of remittance the plan you propose to obtain them might also be attended with some good consequences but there are impediments in the way of its success which it would be tedious to detail and which indeed you could not be so perfectly master of without being on the spot i shall not therefore go into that matter at present and the more especially as we have now good hopes that the plan of congress will be adopted by the states last evening i received advice that massachusetts had acceded and i have a double pleasure in announcing this to you as they certainly would not have come in but for the sentiments contained in your letters let me then my dear sir most heartily congratulate you on those virtuous emotions which must swell your bosom at the reflection that you have been the able the useful and what is above all other things the honest servant of a republic indebted to you in a great degree for her first efforts at independent existence that you may long live to enjoy those pleasing reflections which flow from the memory of an active and beneficial exercise of time and talents is the sincere wish of your most obedient and humble servant robert morris edward a holyoke   november      salem john adams e a holyoke to john adams salem   november      sir— your excellencys favors done to the massachusetts medical society call for their most grateful acknowledgments  and it is at their desire i now inclose to your excellency the copy of a vote from their records expressive of the gratitude     they feel and the obligations they are under to your excellency for your kind attention to their interests and for the honor done them by introducing them to an acquaintance with so respectable a body as the société royale de médecine at paris to which permit me sir to add my own personal thanks and as while we continue to prosecute the ends of our institution we are promoting the cause of science and humanity so we shall still hope for the continuance of your excellencys good offices i have the honor to be c e a holyoke n w appleton october         boston inclosure at a meeting of the massachusetts medical society in boston october        — voted unanimously that the thanks of this society be returned to his excellency john adams minister plenipotentiary for the united states of america for his early attention to the interests and honor of the massachusetts medical society and for his assiduous endeavors to introduce the institution to the notice of the royal society of medicine at paris a true copy from the records n w appleton secretary john adams   november      london to the president of congress london   november      sir— about the   th of september i was seized at paris with a fever which proved to be a dangerous one and brought me very low so that i was unable to attend to any business for some time on the  0th of october in pursuance of the advice of my friends i set out from auteuil a village in the neighborhood of passy for london which city i reached by slow journeys the   th i found my strength increase as i advanced and my health is so much improved that i am persuaded the last sickness has been of service to me having never enjoyed since my great sickness at amsterdam so good health as at present mr jay had set off for london about ten days before me and since my arrival we have been much together and have found every thing agreeable notwithstanding the     innumerable and incessant lies and nonsense of the newspapers as i came here in a private capacity altogether i have not visited any one of the ministers nor any one of the foreign ambassadors and i am inclined to think upon the whole that i shall not unless we should receive the commission to treat of commerce which congress resolved on the  st of last may while i stay here the whig part of the present administration are much embarrassed with the tory part and their refugees so that the spirit of the present administration i must in duty say is not so friendly to the united states as it ought to be for want of powers however we can reduce nothing to a certainty we expect every day to receive our commission and instructions mr hartley thinks himself empowered to finish the business with us by his former commission the ministry are of the same opinion and it is no doubt true so that as soon as our commission and instructions arrive we shall enter upon the conferences but whether we shall go to paris or dr franklin will come here at present i know not the negotiation i am persuaded would succeed better here than at paris i have the honor to be c john adams john adams    november      london william ellery to william ellery and others london    november      gentlemen— i duly received the letter you did me the honor to write me on the   th of may  with two addresses inclosed—one to the ministers and churches of the reformed in holland the other to those in france—and it should have been answered sooner had not a long sickness prevented i am duly sensible of the honor you do me gentlemen by confiding this benevolent office to my care and it would give me great pleasure to be able to give you encouragement to hope for success but solicitations of this kind are considered so differently in america and in europe that an appointment which would be     considered as very honorable in the former is regarded in the latter in a different light this diversity of sentiment is so real and so serious that in the opinion of others as well as in my own it is inconsistent with the public character i have at present the honor to hold under the united states for me to accept of this it is agreed on all hands that my name appearing in this business would do a great injury to the loan of which i have the care in holland so that i must beg the favor of you gentlemen to make my apology to the second congregational church in newport for declining a trust which my regard to their constitution as well as their welfare and my personal respect for you would have induced me to accept with pleasure had it been compatible with my duty on occasion of a great fire in charlestown formerly and of the application of dartmouth college lately i have seen that there is such a degree of ridicule attends such solicitations of benevolence in europe that i cannot advise you to expect any relief this way if you were to send an agent on purpose in my opinion he would not obtain enough to pay his expenses with great respect and esteem john adams john adams    november      london to the president of congress london    november      sir— if any one should ask me what is the system of the present administration i should answer to keep their places every thing they say or do appears evidently calculated to that end and no ideas of public good no national object is suffered to interfere with it in order to drive out shelburne they condemned his peace which all the whig part of them would have been very glad to have made and have gloried in the advantages of it in order to avail themselves of the old habits and prejudices of the nation they now pretend to cherish the principles of the navigation act and the king has been advised to recommend this in his speech and the lords have echoed it in very strong terms the coalition appears to stand on very strong ground the lords and great commoners who compose it count a great majority of members of the house of commons who are     returned by themselves every one of whom is a dead vote they are endeavoring to engage the bedford interest with them in order to strengthen themselves still more by persuading thurlow to be again chancellor and mr pitt whose personal popularity and family weight with the nation are very desirable for them is tempted with the place of chancellor of the exchequer which lord john cavendish from mere aversion to business wishes to resign while they are using such means to augment their strength they are manifestly intimidated at the sight of those great national objects which they know not how to manage ireland is still in a state of fermentation throwing off the admiralty postoffice and every other relic of british parliamentary authority and contending for a free importation of their woolen manufactures into portugal for the trade to the east indies to the united states of america and all the rest of the world in as ample manner as the english enjoy these blessings the irish volunteers are also contending for a parliamentary reform and a more equal representation in their house of commons and are assembling by their delegates in a congress at dublin to accomplish it this rivalry of ireland is terrible to the ministry they are supposed to be at work to sow jealousies and divisions between the protestants and catholics in ireland the east indies exhibit another scene which will be formidable to the ministers here centre the hopes of england and it is certain that no system can be pursued which will give universal satisfaction some require the government to take that whole country into their own hands others demand aids in cash and troops to the company opposition will be first formed probably upon indian affairs public credit is the greatest object of all the necessary annual expense comprehending the interest of the whole national debt funded and unfunded and the peace establishment will amount to near seventeen millions the annual receipts of taxes have never yet amounted to thirteen millions here will be a deficiency then of near four millions a year which will render an annual loan necessary until the debt will be so increased and the stocks so sunk that no man will lend his money the judicious will call upon ministers for a remedy and will embarrass them with their reproaches but the stockjobbers are   0 more numerous than the judicious and more noisy these live upon loans and as long as ministers borrow twelve millions a year and employ the stockjobbers to raise it however certainly the measure tends to ruin their clamors will be for ministers an enormous loan is the most popular thing a statesman can undertake so certain is the bankruptcy of this country opposition will declaim upon this topic but will make no impression the united states of america are another object of debate if an opposition should be formed and concerted i presume that one fundamental of it will be a liberal conduct towards us they will be very profuse in professions of respect and esteem and affection for us will pretend to wish for measures which may throw a veil over the past and restore as much as possible the ancient good will they will be advocates for some freedom of communication with the west indies and for our having an equitable share of that carrying trade c administration on the other hand i am confident will with great difficulty be persuaded to abandon the mean contemptible policy which their proclamations exhibit in my humble opinion the only suitable place for us to negotiate the treaty in is london here with the most perfect politeness to the ministry we may keep them in awe a visit to a distinguished member of the opposition even if nothing should be said at it about public affairs would have more weight with ministers than all our arguments mr jay is i believe of the same opinion but we shall not conduct the negotiation here unless dr franklin should come over indeed if congress should join us in a commission to treat with other powers in my opinion we might conduct the business better here than in paris i shall however cheerfully conform to the sentiments of my colleagues the delay of the commission is to me a great embarrassment i know not whether to stay here return to paris or the hague i hope every moment to receive advices from congress which will resolve me i received yesterday a letter from mr hartley with the compliments of mr fox and that he should be glad to see me proposing the hour of eleven today which i agreed to mr jay saw him one day this week mr jay made him and the     duke of portland a visit on his first arrival they were not at home but he never heard from them until my arrival ten days or a fortnight after informed of this i concluded not to visit them and did not but after a very long time and indeed after mr hartleys return from bath messages have been sent to mr jay and me that mr fox would be glad to see us it is merely for form and to prevent a cry against him in parliament for not having seen us for not one word was said to mr jay of public affairs nor will a word be said to me the real friendship of america seems to me the only thing which can redeem this country from total destruction there are a few who think so here and but a few and the present ministers are not among them or at least if they are of this opinion they conceal it and behave as if they thought america of small importance the consequence will be that little jealousies and rivalries and resentments will be indulged which will do essential injury to this country as they happen and they will end in another war in which will be torn from this island all her possessions in canada nova scotia and the east and west indies with great respect c john adams jan willink   december      amsterdam john adams messrs willink and others to john adams amsterdam   december      sir— the relation in which we have the honor to stand with your excellency concerning the american loan makes it our duty to inform your excellency of the following circumstances we received some time since a letter from mr morris dated  th august by which he advised us that he had determined to value upon us by his drafts till the amount of half a million florins we calculated at that time that the balance we had in hands with the net proceeds of the cargo of tobacco of the ship sally would not be sufficient to pay those drafts and that in case we should have no opportunity to sell one or two hundred bonds at least we were exposed to a disbursement of about the amount of that value notwithstanding this we took the resolution to honor the mentioned drafts and determined that we should advance the deficient money if at the time of their payment     we should not have so much cash we did not hesitate to give assurances of this in our answer to mr morris exposing however at the same time the very disagreeable circumstances in the business of the loan this our letter to mr morris was dated    july and we hope he will have received the same speedily our next and following letters were no less discouraging because notwithstanding our repeated endeavors we could not make an engagement nor dispose of any quantity of bonds when this happened in europe mr morris must at the same time have been in the best expectation about the business since he advises us by his letter of the  st october that he was informed though through an indirect channel that your excellencys journey to holland had given a new spring to the american credit and that the loan was going on well this being the case he determined to value on us to the amount of half a million more which together with the other half million makes a whole million of florins for payment of which we have only in cash the net proceeds of the sold tobacco included near four hundred thousand florins we received this advice last sunday and assembled in the afternoon to agree with one another what we should do in those circumstances we were very much mortified about it apprehending that those drafts might soon be offered for acceptance and knowing the very little appearance or almost impossibility of a better success in the loan within the time when the drafts will become due and we are sorry to inform your excellency that our apprehensions were but too well founded since already the next day about two hundred thousand florins were offered in this disagreeable position we determined to send immediately an express to his excellency b franklin at paris with a letter whereby we informed him of what was going on and desired that he should inform whether perhaps m grand had a balance in favor of the united states and that he should order that balance kept at our disposal but if there should be no balance in the hands of m grand or if the balance should not be of such a large sum then we desired that mr franklin should give his ministerial word to provide us or to do honor to our drafts to the amount of half a million of florins in case we     should come into the necessity to make use of such an operation which will very likely or almost certainly be unavoidable the express went the same evening and we take the liberty to send your excellency here inclosed a copy of our letter to mr franklin for your perusal we are very sorry that mr morris gives so much credit to an indirect advice the authenticity of which we are ignorant of because it is certain that thereby he exposes the whole american credit in europe for in case the answer of mr franklin should not be quite satisfactory and that by consequence we should be put to the necessity of declining the acceptance of the drafts we fear it will cause a great cry and give a discredit to america we hope it will not happen and that in the mean time your excellency and congress will look upon our offer to mr franklin to honor mr morriss drafts upon his promise and guaranty and also upon the expediting of the express as proofs of our zeal and endeavors to remove every thing that might do any mischief to the american credit we have the honor to remain c wilhem and jan willink nic and jacob van staphorst de la lande and fynje p s after having written our letter to your excellency the greatest part of the holders of mr morriss drafts being jews whom it doth not suit to wait for the acceptance of their remittances have determined to make them protested which we could not prevent we have given for answer that we had not received the advice and that we desired the bills should be offered again for payment when due which we thought to be the best answer to preserve the credit of the drafts as much as we possibly could the amount of those protested bills is about one hundred and seventy thousand florins we are sorry to observe a second time that mr morris promised not to distribute his drafts till some time after the advice and that a few days after they come up the first time was by his letter of   august when he had determined to draw two hundred thousand florins or perhaps till five hundred thousand but he would only dispose of the bills as occasion might require which must have been soon after as we observed by the appearance     of the bills now by his letter of   october the bills for the amount of the second half million of that date were lying in his hands to be disposed of during that month and the succeeding or even perhaps in december and by the numbers of the bills we presume that almost the whole sum must have been disposed of before the    of october which as far as we know is the date of the last letters from philadelphia this is very disagreeable to us and it seems but reasonable that mr morris should have waited some time longer after his advice with the distribution of his drafts by which means it might have been possible to make some arrangement here in europe and to prevent the misfortune to which he has now exposed his drafts we have again the honor c john adams   december      london benjamin franklin to benjamin franklin london   december      sir— commodore jones is just arrived from philadelphia with despatches those directed to the ministers i opened one contained nothing but newspapers and proclamations the other contained a letter to the commissioners and a set of instructions the letter bears date the  st of november the instructions the   th of october a remaining packet is directed to you alone but probably contains a commission to us all to treat of commerce with great britain mr jay and mr laurens are at bath and the bearer is inclined to go on to paris i shall send on the despatches and depend upon your sending us the earliest intelligence if you find a commission in the packet to you in pursuance of the resolution of the  st of may last because that parliament must do something before they rise respecting the trade and their proceedings may probably be somewhat the less evil for knowing beforehand that there is in europe a power to treat i shall wait with some impatience to hear from you because if there is no commission under cover to you in which i am named i shall go to the hague and there take up my abode for some time i have just received a letter from willink  co which shows that money is exhausted and credit too he     incloses me his letter to you but i fear you will not be able to assist him with great respect c john adams john adams   december      london john jay to john jay london   december      dear sir— the night before last commodore jones arrived with despatches from congress two packets were directed to the ministers and one larger one to dr franklin the two first i opened one of them contained nothing but newspapers the other contained a private letter from the president and a set of instructions to the ministers for peace these i copied and sent on the originals to passy together with the packet to franklin unopened if it is found to contain a commission to us in conformity to the resolution of the  st of last may the doctor will inform us by the first post if not by express in the mean time i wish to consult with you if it were possible upon our new instructions which chalk out some new business for us i would send you a copy of them if i were not afraid of ministerial curiosity mr bingham makes me think you will soon be here i inclose herewith a letter from the president to you and another to mr laurens which i must beg the favor of you to deliver to him as i do not know his address mifflin is the new president and congress have adjourned to annapolis and are to sit after some time one year at georgetown on potomac and one year on the delaware colonel ogden had arrived with the news of the signature of the definitive treaty but thaxter had not in the first week in november barneys destination is havredegrace and his orders are positive to sail in three weeks for philadelphia mr morris has drawn so many bills upon my bankers in amsterdam that a number have been protested for nonacceptance so that if mr grand cannot assist in preventing the protest for nonpayment the catastrophe must now come on this you will not mention at present with great esteem c john adams     john adams    december      london jan willink to messrs willink and others london    december      gentlemen— i have received your letter of the  d of december and am extremely sorry to learn that a number of mr morriss bills have been protested you did very prudently in writing immediately to mr franklin to inquire if m grand could afford you any assistance i hope you have received a favorable answer i am waiting for answers from mr franklin to letters written to him to determine whether i am to return to paris or the hague but i do not know that i could be of any service to you if i were in holland with much esteem c john adams jan willink    december      amsterdam john adams messrs willink and others to john adams amsterdam    december      sir— we do ourselves the honor in answer to your excellencys esteemed favor of    december to hand you copies inclosed of the letters both of dr franklin and m grand by which you will be pleased to observe that the contents are by no means favorable to our purpose by the washington packet we have again been favored with his excellency robert morriss letters with advice of new drafts to the amount of seven hundred and fifty thousand florins which is nothing less than an augmentation of the difficulties we labor under to dispose the undertakers and moneylenders to take obligations which is all to no purpose since they seem informed that the emperor and russia after the example of sweden will augment the interest which expedient france actually sets on foot with its loan to open in january of one hundred million of livres this has already induced us to offer them some higher premium to which we thought ourselves fully authorized by the circumstances and the drafts of mr morris to prevent their being protested when due for nonpayment which his excellency writes us to prevent at all events we have taken into consideration whether it was not proper to apply to the regency of our city to obtain for     the undertakers some facilities by which means we might move them to take obligations enough to enable us to do due honor to all the drafts of the superintendent of finance we are therefore sorry to see your excellency is uncertain whether you will come to holland since we suppose that a proper application made in your especial quality to our regency might prove not unsuccessful however as no time can be lost to leave space to our regency for deliberating on this subject and to have their resolution before the bills become due we take the liberty to pray your excellency in case you are not to come here very soon to favor us with a letter in your public capacity for our pensionary van berckel by which you pray him to dispose favorably of the request we present to the regency to promote the course of the loan which condescension will be looked upon by congress as a real proof of our city of their friendship to the united states who will not fail to put the right value on the same if this expedient should not prove successful by this application to the magistrate there remains one way left and the only one that your excellency be pleased to authorize us to make a new loan of four millions of florins of which the interest comes out to six per cent per annum in which case we should not be destitute of hopes of succeeding but without doubt we fear to be obliged to allow to the undertakers some more premium which we shall not do except from the greatest necessity and with particular economy and as mr morris mentions to us that he pays said interest in america we venture to suppose that he can have no objection to allow us the same here and the more as not only all his drafts would be honored by it and a considerable sum over become at his disposal whilst there is no prejudice to credit in augmenting the interest this is only following the example other powers have given and to which our state admiralties east india company will be obliged to come to find money for the large loans they stand in need to make hence we conclude that those powers who resolve the first to augment the interest will succeed and leave it very uncertain for those who follow to be equally happy in case your excellency approve of our ideas and judge it proper to send us at all events an authorization we pray to add     an assurance to it that the loan done in consequence will be duly approved and ratified by congress we shall inform his excellency mr morris of this our application to your excellency and hope to convince hereby both you and him of our uninterrupted endeavors for the interest of congress we have the honor to be c wilhem and jan willink nic and jacob van staphorst de la lande and fynje jacob van staphorst    december      amsterdam john adams messrs van staphorst to john adams amsterdam    december      sir— at the beginning of this week having many letters to despatch relating to the business of the united states we agreed together upon their contents and every one of us charged himself with part of the work mr willink promised to write a letter to your excellency and a short time before the departure of the mail he sent it to the other houses for signing we observed he had not been very fortunate in the expression of our common ideas however there being no time for composing another letter we put our names under his composition but being in doubt whether your excellency will sufficiently understand the meaning and the matter being very interesting for the united states we hope your excellency will excuse us if we endeavor to supply the defect of that letter if the matter was of less importance we would not do it for reasons which will be very apparent to your excellency but we presume that those reasons ought to be postponed when there is danger that by too much delicacy the interests of the united states might suffer we venture this step without the knowledge of our companions in the intent only to serve your excellency we depend therefore upon your friendship that you will do us the favor not to mention any thing about this address in your letters to the three houses your excellency is informed that by the present situation concerning the loan and the dispositions of the treasurer we have been in the very disagreeable necessity to decline the acceptance of half a million guilders and again of seven hundred     and fifty thousand guilders we are informed that if the last mentioned sum should return through want of payment congress is not to pay any charges upon the return in consequence of an agreement made with the houses who took the bills but we presume that notwithstanding this it will be a great advantage to the states if we are able to pay them and we know that the expenses attending the return of the half million and the disappointment resulting from it will be of such consequences that we do not doubt but we are not only authorized to exert our utmost endeavors to dispose of a quantity of bonds but even to allow some more remedium to the undertakers than we stipulated at the beginning with your excellency it is almost impossible at this time to obtain an engagement with these gentlemen unless we should make such stipulations which however we look upon as very prejudicial considering this and besides that the not paying of the drafts would occasion a stagnation of commerce in the spring because several bills are remitted to certain people who are to send out goods for their amount we thought it merited the attention of our government and we have therefore mentioned the matter to a couple of very patriotic members of our magistracy and desired their assistance for such encouragements as might facilitate the business we had the satisfaction to find that they were fully convinced of the fatal consequences of the return of the bills and that they promised to assist us in a further application which on this assurance we have determined to make we are in hopes it will be effectual but we believe at the same time that your excellency being present and approving of our idea would give a great weight to our address and therefore we should wish that in case your other important business would permit that step your excellency would make a trip to this country however considering the present season and that perhaps other important things concerning the united states may make it impossible for your excellency to comply with our desire we request you will write a letter to m van berckel pensionary of this city to recommend the business and we have reason to think this will do very well mr willink has added another scheme of a new loan for four millions at six per cent it is true that the interests of loans   0 are rather augmented since the time you opened the loan for the united states and we do not decline that plan in case we should have the misfortune of a disappointment from the magistracy however we for our private opinion should prefer first to complete the former loan at five per cent besides we think it necessary to inform your excellency that whenever you shall give the preference to this scheme and authorize us to put it in execution it will not be done without granting a remedium to the undertakers we have the honor to be c nic and jacob van staphorst john adams    january      the hague benjamin franklin to benjamin franklin the hague    january      sir— desirous of doing all in my power to save mr morriss bills i determined to go to amsterdam and accordingly set off the beginning of this month from london in a season too rigorous for pleasure at harwich we were obliged to wait several days for fair weather which when it arrived brought us little comfort as it was very cold and the wind exactly against us the packets were obliged to put to sea and i embarked in one of them we were more than three days in advancing thirtythree leagues with so unsteady a course and such a tossing vessel that we could not keep a fire the weather very cold and the passengers all very seasick as we could not on account of the great quantities of ice upon the coast reach helvoet we were put on shore on the island of goree whence we got a boors wagon to carry our baggage and we walked about six miles to the town of goree not finding iceboats here we were obliged to go in open boors wagons across the island to midelharnis here we were detained several days in very bad lodgings unable to find boats to carry us over the arm of the sea to helvoet at length iceboats appeared and we embarked amidst a waste of ice which passed in and out every day with the tide and by the force of oars and boathooks sometimes rowing in the water and sometimes dragging on the ice which would now and then break and let us down in the course of the day we got over and we thought ourselves     lucky as the last boat which passed got stuck in the ice and was carried out with the tide and brought in again so that it was out from nine in the morning to one oclock the next night before it reached the opposite shore we could not reach helvoet but landed on the dike about two miles from it and took boors wagons again for the brille which we reached at night next morning we took iceboats again to cross another water obstructed by ice as before and then a third the maese which we found sufficiently frozen to walk over another boors wagon carried us to delft and from thence a coach to the hague after the rest of a day or two i went to amsterdam our bankers had applied to the regency and i offered to enter into any reasonable contract and to pledge the faith of the united states for the performance of it but all in vain the gentlemen of the regency seemed very desirous of doing something for us if they could but as usual they are so afraid of making a precedent and that other powers as much distressed for money as we should take advantage and demand the same favor that they dare not and our bankers were advised to take back their application to avoid a certain decision against us yesterday i returned to the hague i should look back with less chagrin upon the disagreeable passage from london if we had succeeded in obtaining the object of it but i find i am here only to be a witness that american credit in this republic is dead never to rise again at least until the united states shall all agree upon some plan of revenue and make it certain that interest and principal will be paid there has scarce an obligation been sold since the news of the mutiny of soldiers in philadelphia and the diversity of sentiments among the states about the plan of impost i have no information from congress or mr morris but i am told by our bankers there are bills to the amount of thirteen hundred thousand guilders which must be sent back a terrible disappointment to great numbers of people some of the bills become payable the beginning of march and the rest being much the greatest part in may at amsterdam i received the honor of yours of  d of this month john adams     john adams    january      the hague jan willink to messrs willink and others the hague    january      gentlemen— when i left amsterdam i despaired of doing any thing to prevent the bills of exchange from being sent back it is possible however that something may have since happened to give us better hopes i should be obliged to you if you would inform me whether there is yet any ground to expect aid from the venerable regency of your city or not the commerce of the city is much interested in it and the city has a right to do what it will with its own and therefore no other power can take advantage of the precedent since we are not demanding a right but requesting a favor surely if the city sees that without hurting itself it can confer a favor on a friend and thereby greatly promote its own commerce it has a right to do it without fearing that other powers differently circumstanced should claim a like indulgence since my return to the hague i have reflected as maturely as i can upon the proposition of a new loan on a different plan suggested in one of your letters to me in london it would be with great reluctance that i should consent to raise the interest but yet i would do it rather than the bills should go back i therefore request of you gentlemen to consider of this matter and consult with the undertakers and if you can be sure of obtaining the cash to save the bills by a new plan i would agree to it but yet i could not i think go beyond six per cent including your commissions the two per cent to the undertakers and in short including interest and all charges it is neither your fault nor mine if we cannot succeed yet i should wish to do every thing in our power and i request your sentiments upon the subject it would be imprudent to talk of a new plan if we were not previously certain of success in obtaining the money i have the honor to be c john adams     jan willink    january      amsterdam john adams messrs willink and others to john adams amsterdam    january      sir— we are favored with the honor of your excellencys letter of the   th of this month which should have appeared yesterday with us mr w willink did himself the honor to wait on your excellency the night before your departure to inform you of the unsuccessfulness of all our repeated endeavors notwithstanding the favorable dispositions of our regency considerations of so much importance with them opposed their good intentions that they could not be prevailed upon to dispose favorably of our request we have however not been quiet since but are daily occupied in conference with the undertakers and offer them an extraordinary premium on the remainder of the two millions as they will meet with us monday morning to make some demands we should wish to receive in answer to this your excellencys orders as to whether we should conclude with them in case we could succeed by a sacrifice of four to five per cent on that amount for all the extraordinary gratifications and allowances we suppose this course preferable in this juncture to an attempt to negotiate a new loan against six per cent interest which last however your excellency seems to consider as we surely have always done preferable to the return of the bills should we however after receiving your excellencys authority for the first mentioned proposals not succeed with them it would be well that you consent to our consulting with the undertakers about a new loan with whom we shall by no means do any thing except on security of getting the money but we wish to observe to your excellency that the interest of six per cent is in favor of the moneylenders and can by no means bear the charges on the loan and not only these must be paid besides the interest but we are in real apprehension that instead of being four and a half per cent in all they would by reason of this juncture of time amount to six per cent altogether to which it would be necessary to submit hence we should rather allow the extraordinary premium of four to five per cent on the remaining obligations in our hands but we     submit with respect our judgment to your excellencys more enlightened understanding we press the undertakers the more seriously because we have got information that the bank of philadelphia stopped payment on account of false bank notes put in circulation which circumstance occasioned confusion there and if it should become public before we are able to conclude the matter we are really fearful all our endeavors will entirely miscarry we therefore consider on account of this fatal event the sooner we can conclude the better without standing on a trifle of a per cent more or less all which we submit to your excellencys consideration and beg the favor of your advice if any thing of this circumstance should be known to you as we may yet doubt the correctness of this advice dated   december we have the honor c wilhem and jan willink nic and jacob van staphorst de la lande and fynje john adams   february      the hague jan willink to messrs willink and others the hague   february      gentlemen— i have just received your favor of yesterday and thank you for the promptitude with which you answered mine of the   th ult i have been informed particularly by the two worthy pensionaries van berckel and visscher as well as by your letter of the difficulties of succeeding with your venerable regency and therefore see no hopes of saving the bills but in the plan of a new loan or in that which you propose which i fully agree with you is much better for many reasons your judgment in these things is much better than mine and therefore if we cannot do better in your opinion i will agree with you to the sacrifice of four to five per cent for all the extraordinary gratifications and allowances i have not yet received from any quarter before i received your letter the least intimation that the bank of philadelphia had stopped payment on account of false notes in circulation and i cannot credit such a report because if it were true it     would have been most industriously spread in europe with all its details and evidence by the many enemies we have among the stockjobbers in england and elsewhere with esteem c john adams jan willink   february      amsterdam john adams messrs willink and others to john adams amsterdam   february      sir— we have received your excellencys esteemed favor of  st february by which we see you are pleased to consent to an extraordinary sacrifice on which we pleaded with the undertakers but could by no means prevail on them and at last they declared against it finally these displeasing circumstances brought us into the necessity to take their opinions on a new loan against six per cent interest as your excellency judged perfectly right that it was much preferable to do it than to get the bills protested we in consequence have proposed to them the inclosed scheme on which sunday or monday next they jointly have promised an answer in case we can offer to them a reasonable premium and gratification some of them seem inclined to hearken to the proposal and we stipulate the ready payment of so many hundred thousand guilders this month that the bills falling due at the end to such an amount should all be paid we want therefore to pray your excellency to authorize us to conclude on this footing with six per cent allowance for all the premiums brokerage gratifications notary seals obligations commission and every expense besides in case we can be happy enough to bring it to consistency we shall directly draw up the obligation for your excellency to sign and direct further matters in the most regular way and order  desiring your answer hereon for our government we remain c wilhem and jan willink nic and jacob van staphorst de la lande and fynje     john adams   february      the hague jan willink to messrs willink and others the hague   february      gentlemen— i have received your favor of the  th and considered its contents i am very sorry to find there is no hope of obtaining the money upon the old obligations with an additional gratification the credit of the united states must be very low indeed in this republic if we must agree to terms so exorbitant as those in the plan you have inclosed to me in order to obtain about two hundred thousand pounds sterling the news of it will cause such an alarm and give such disgust in america that the effect of it will be positive orders to borrow no more this indeed would be no evil in america however since the bills are drawn to avoid the mischiefs which would follow the final protest of them i will agree to the new plan you propose provided you cannot obtain the money upon more moderate and reasonable terms but i must entreat you gentlemen to use your utmost endeavors to obtain some diminution of the gratification if it is possible i am well persuaded of your disposition to do this business as advantageously for the united states as you can and therefore it is unnecessary for me to use any arguments with you upon the occasion i beg leave to recommend to you that the subscription should be opened at only one house messrs willinks for example as this method is more convenient for the subscribers and not less beneficial for the other houses you will be pleased to make it an indispensable condition that the money be furnished for the payment of all the bills for i am determined if any of them go back protested they shall all share the same fate with great esteem c john adams benjamin franklin   february      passy john adams benjamin franklin to john adams passy   february      sir— i received the letter you did me the honor of writing to me the   th past you have had a terrible passage indeed taking it altogether from london to amsterdam the season     has been and continues uncommonly severe and you must have suffered much it is a pity that the good purpose of your voyage to save if possible the credit of mr morriss bills could not be accomplished by your obtaining a loan from the regency i do not wonder at their declining it nor at the stop you mention as put to the general loan by the news of the diversity of sentiments among the states about the plan of impost i hope these mischievous events will at length convince our people of the truth of what i long since wrote to them that the foundation of credit abroad must be laid at home when the states have not faith enough in a congress of their own choosing to trust it with money for the payment of their common debt how can they expect that that congress should meet with credit when it wants to borrow more money for their use from strangers your excellency saw in england the instructions brought to us by captain jones from the congress and which you forwarded to me expecting your and mr jays speedy return hither i took no step in consequence of them mr jay is now returned and we are both desirous of knowing whether it is your intention to join us again here in order to execute these instructions because in that case we should wait your arrival i have the honor to be c b franklin john adams  0 february      the hague to the president of congress the hague  0 february      sir— i had scarcely finished my despatches to go by mr thaxter with the definitive treaty when i was taken down with a fever at paris and reduced so low as to be totally unable to attend to any business for a long time when i grew so much better as to be able to ride i was advised to go to england as i had nothing to do at paris and an attempt to reside in holland would probably have thrown me into a relapse i took the advice and after a few weeks of gentle exercise and relaxation from care with a change of air and of diet i found myself so much better as to venture over to holland though in a very rigorous season to see if i could do any thing to save the public credit i have done my utmost to no purpose     mr van berckel and mr visscher who are very well disposed to serve us have frankly told me that there was no hope of obtaining the least assistance from the regency i went to amsterdam and spent eight or ten days there but could do nothing the bills of exchange must for any thing i see go back and the credit of the united states will never revive until they have established a certain revenue for the payment of interest a long course of journeys and voyages a variety of climates and continued application of mind have so wrecked my constitution which was never very firm and produced these repeated attacks of the fever that it is high time for me to take a little repose and as mr jay will be with dr franklin at paris it will be unnecessary for me to go thither to execute the last instructions of congress and i shall accordingly remain here until further orders peace is made between russia and the porte and the definitive treaty between england and holland is expected to be soon signed may the world continue at peace but if it should not i hope we shall have wisdom enough to keep ourselves out of any broil as i am quite in sentiment with the baron de nolken the swedish ambassador at st jamess who did me the honor to visit me although i had not visited him sir said he i take it for granted that you will have sense enough to see us in europe cut each others throats with a philosophical tranquillity this minister requested governor pownall to introduce him to me he did so the ambassador told me he had been twenty years at that court and had seen the rise progress and end of the dispute with america that he had lived much with the british ministers and had often ventured to give them his sentiments that he had constantly foretold the issue but said he although i was upon good terms with them they had no confidence in me and in this they were right for no court ought ever to have confidence in a foreign minister i mention this because it is a maxim with all old nations and i think it high time it should become the maxim of our young one governor pownall told me that he meditated a voyage to america but was afraid of jealousies and suspicions and asked if i thought he might be well received i told him i did     not doubt he would be received respectfully in every part of america that he had always been considered so far as i knew as friendly to america and that his writings had been useful to our cause with great respect c john adams john adams    february      the hague benjamin franklin to benjamin franklin the hague    february      sir— last night i received your obliging favor of the  th of this month your excellencys sentiment that the foundation of credit abroad must be laid at home is perfectly just and accords with the general sentiment of the moneylenders undertakers and brokers in this country whose universal cry is we should choose to see some certain method agreed on and established for the payment of interest before we adventure farther in the american loan i am glad to hear of mr jays safe return to paris and hope his health is confirmed as the instructions may be executed by any one or more of the ministers for the peace residing at the court of versailles it seems to me to be more for the benefit of the public service that i should remain here for some time rather than go to paris i have not given over all endeavors to obtain the money for the bills although the best friends we have inform me there is no hope at all from the public we are endeavoring to discover if it is possible by any new plan of a loan to obtain the money of the undertakers yet by all i can learn i despair of obtaining it without agreeing to terms so disadvantageous as to be little better than the final protest of the bills indeed it is still improbable that i can obtain it upon any terms at all money is scarce as well as our credit feeble the loan of the east india company warranted by the states of holland does not fill a case unknown in this country your excellency with mr jay may proceed to execute these instructions without me and i hereby entreat that you would without waiting at all for me it is not likely there will be any difference of opinion between your excellencies concerning any   0 of those instructions in which case alone it would be necessary for me to attend if mr laurens does not it is probable we may soon learn something from congress in answer to our letter with the definitive treaty which will determine whether it is necessary i should join you at paris or not it would be very inconvenient to me in the present tender state of my health to make a journey to paris without a necessity at least until this formidable winter breaks up although i should be ambitious enough of the honor of joining in the execution of those orders i wish your excellencies a happy year and much pleasure in the enjoyment of peace as well as success in your negotiations whether joined or not by your most obedient and most humble servant john adams john adams    february      the hague john jay to john jay the hague    february      dear sir— i have received a letter from mr gerry at philadelphia    november thaxter arrived there the night before i presume he has written by mr reed and that his letter is gone to you as he probably addressed his letter to us all mr morris has drawn afresh by this vessel let me beg of you and the doctor to advise him to stop his hand if i can possibly save those already drawn which however i still despair of it will be upon terms so enormously avaricious that it will raise a tremendous clamor in america it is ruinous to borrow money in europe upon such terms but it will be more ruinous to let the bills go back my situation is very disagreeable it is not for me to judge of the propriety of the drafts i am only in a ministerial capacity and ought to procure the money if possible upon any terms within my instructions but to be obliged to go to the utmost extent of them when i know that such numbers will blame me for it because they will not believe the necessity of it is unpleasant there is a despotism in this country in the government of loans as absolute as that of the grand signior five or six people     have all the money under their command and they are as avaricious as any jews in jews quarter this country revenges itself in this way upon the powers of europe for the insults it receives from them in wars and negotiations i think i could not justify going to paris while the fate of these bills is depending you will be so good as to go on with the doctor in execution of the last instructions if there is any point upon which you wish for my opinion i will give it you with pleasure at any time by letter has mr laurens declined acting how is the doctors health and how is mrs ridley if a commission should come to us all to treat with england as it will be a thorny work and likely to produce discontent and clamors it is not my intention to withdraw my shoulders from any part of the burden you will pardon me for suggesting that we ought to obtain if we can from every power we treat with an article that american produce imported into their ports in american bottoms shall pay no more duties than if imported in vessels of the subjects of those powers mr gerry desires his respects and affections to you in very strong and high terms thinks the removal of congress has strengthened the union and that the british proclamations have had the same effect will denmark stipulate that both her islands in the west indies shall be free ports to us yours c john adams jan willink john adams messrs willink and others to john adams without date sir— we have had the honor to receive your most esteemed favor of the day before yesterday and observe with pleasure that your excellency agrees to the alteration which we have proposed by our last in the plan of a new loan we had this morning a conference with the brokers which was proposed for to have the answer of the undertakers and in which we expected the matter should be quite regulated but it is with a great displeasure that we were obliged to remit the conclusion till next monday and that we are in the necessity to     give you again such a disagreeable account the undertakers agree with us in the opinion that the loan will have a very good success by a public subscription but they do not incline to run the risk of it for the whole amount they only offer to engage to a million or something more but we could not possibly succeed to determine them to double the sum and because it is your absolute order that either all the bills must be paid or all return we could not accept their offers and in case your excellency do not incline in this situation to accommodate yourself to the circumstance we fear all our endeavors will tend to no purpose we feel how disagreeable it is to your excellency but we beg to submit to your consideration that the engagement for a million will furnish us the money to pay the first drafts and that we have a good prospect that the loan will be carried to the whole capital of two millions or at least to such an amount that before the other drafts become due we shall have money to pay them all however in case this should not answer our wishes you will please to consider that for a sum of seven hundred and fifty thousand guilders which were drawn at one hundred and fifty days sight and which by consequence must be paid in the month of may mr morris took an arrangement that in case they might return unpaid congress should not pay any charges attending the return and that by consequence whenever this should be the case which we flatter ourselves will not happen the disappointment will be less fatal in these circumstances we venture to advise your excellency to give us orders by your answer to this that we may monday accept the offer of the undertakers for a million or so much more as they then will engage and to open the loan for two millions upon the plan which you have approved and then we will be certain to pay the first drafts and have a good prospect likewise to pay the following notwithstanding we have not the satisfaction to have the same certitude about it we beg to give us your answer upon these proposals by the morrow evening post and have the honor to remain very respectfully sir your most humble c wilhem and jan willink nic and jacob van staphorst de la lande and fynje     john adams    february      the hague jan willink to messrs willink and others the hague    february      gentlemen— i have just received your letter of yesterday as i suppose though without a date and have maturely considered its contents i have weighed your reasons and considered your advice and upon the whole i think it most prudent to agree upon the terms you propose the undertakers engaging for a million but yet i would pray you to endeavor to persuade them to engage for at least fourteen hundred thousand guilders as this will cover all the bills already drawn which you have received advice of i will not insist finally however for more than a million if you cannot obtain an engagement for more it is painful to me to agree to such high terms i own because i know that great numbers of people in america will blame me for it and think that i had better have suffered the bills to go back protested it is my duty however to do the best i can and between two evils to choose the least upon which principle it is that i agree with you in sentiment and follow your advice upon this occasion with esteem c john adams benjamin franklin john jay    february      passy john adams benjamin franklin and john jay to john adams passy    february      sir— we had the honor of receiving your favor of the  0th instant  and are persuaded that the communication of the friendly disposition of his prussian majesty made to you by the baron de thulemeier will give great pleasure to congress the respect with which the reputation of that great prince has impressed the united states early induced them to consider his friendship as a desirable object and we are happy in being authorized to assure his majesty that they will most cheerfully enter into such a commercial treaty with him as being founded     on principles of reciprocity may be productive of equal benefits to both countries although we have no commission to conclude such a treaty yet our instructions from congress enable us to join with the kings minister in preparing a draft of such treaty which being sent to congress they would together with a commission to conclude the treaty give us pointed instructions on the subject and much time might be thereby saved if you are of this opinion and his majesty should be pleased to approve such a measure we think the articles may be discussed between you and the baron in the first instance on the principles which govern in the treaties you mention both of which have been approved and ratified that being done we might confer together and write a joint letter to congress on the subject we shall nevertheless make this communication a part of our next despatch to congress we have the honor to be c b franklin john jay mason weems john adams mason weems to john adams without date though i have not the honor of being personally acquainted with you i flatter myself this will not be deemed an intrusion as it is a measure which necessity and the advice of my friends messrs johnson and chase have recommended the particulars of my case mr johnson informs me he communicated to you during your short stay in london but as i have not the vanity to imagine they were of consequence enough to merit a place among the infinitely more important matters which engage your attention i beg leave to recapitulate them i am a native of america and a student of divinity two years ago i came over to complete my studies and take orders my first application was to the great lowth bishop of london who flatly refused because i intended to return to america a thing unprecedented in the annals of sacred history watson bishop of landaff gave me a gentler reception condescended to sympathize with me on the distressed situation of     our church and even gave me to hope that a letter from his excellency the governor of maryland my native state would gain me admission into the sacred vineyard his excellency wrote me a very polite letter which i immediately carried to the bishop his lordship received me very courteously but told me that he could do nothing without the permission of the archbishop to the archbishop i went and have had three conferences with him on the subject the result of which is that his grace though very willing cannot ordain me parliament it seems must take it in hand a law must be passed to enable him to ordain young americans without putting them to the pain of swallowing the oaths of supremacy and allegiance thus sir you see the condition i am in after a loss of time money and patience sufficient to distract a stoic i was with mr chase this morning he thinks it probable that the bishops in holland sweden or germany would ordain me without requiring the oath of allegiance he is of opinion i cannot take it with safety i have no decided opinion of my own on the subject but i know many ingenuous people who differ from mr chase if you will be so very kind as to give me your opinion on the subject and to let me know by the first post or opportunity whether i can be ordained on the continent i will repair there immediately and consider it as an everlasting obligation conferred on your excellencys most obedient servant mason weems john adams   march      the hague mason weems to mason weems the hague   march      sir— i have received the letter you did me the honor to write me under the cover of my friend mr johnson and however dangerous it may be for an american minister of state to intermeddle in a matter of religion especially without orders from his superiors i think i can neither transgress nor give offence by rendering you any service in my power as a private citizen in a matter of so serious concern in the united provinces of the low countries there are no diocesan bishops nor any higher order of clergy than presbyters the dutch church is wholly presbyterian and therefore you     cannot obtain ordination by coming here in sweden and denmark there are lutheran bishops but what articles of faith it may be necessary to subscribe or what liturgy to adopt i am not informed i believe that consubstantiation at least is among their creeds by what laws or usages of their country these protestant bishops may be bound i know not his excellency the baron de nolken ambassador of the king of sweden to the court of st james i believe would very readily inform you and governor pównall who is well acquainted with that minister has so much humanity and friendship for america as to introduce you to him if you desire it i believe i may venture to give you leave to make use of my name to either of those personages if you were here i would introduce you to the baron schultz von ascheraden the envoy of his swedish majesty to their high mightinesses but i think it would save you the expense and trouble of travelling to apply to the swedish ambassador in london for information it is a matter of importance delicacy and difficulty and i should advise you to write to dr franklin and mr jay upon the subject if you cannot obtain satisfaction in london they may consult the swedish and danish ministers at versailles i could do the same with those of the same powers at the hague but as congress have joined dr franklin mr jay and myself together on most of their affairs in europe i should not think it prudent in me to take any step but in concert with those ministers i think the advice of my friend mr chase against taking the oaths of allegiance prudent at least until the members of the church in america shall have digested some plan for their future government perhaps parliament may authorize some bishop in england to ordain american candidates without administering the oaths the bishop of st asaph i believe would give you the best advice and perhaps mr benjamin vaughan could procure you an introduction to his lordship i have not the honor to be known to his lordship but mr vaughan if you show him this letter will i flatter myself be of service to you with much respect john adams     marquis de lafayette   march      paris john adams the marquis de lafayette to john adams paris   march      my dear sir— before i had a pointed reason to write my friendship for you and our common zeal for the public had dictated it but i must begin with the article that in my mind creates some uneasiness it is written from amsterdam that mr john adams is very violent against the society of the cincinnati and calls it a french blessing and that he says although i have long announced an intention to go to america i never fulfil it which seems to hint a want of zeal to comply with the desire of my american friends was i to take the matter up as a frenchman i might tell you that the french court had not that i know of dreamed of the society before count de rochambeau was written to by general washington and i might add that orders titles and such other foolish tokens of vanity are not more valued in france nor even so much as they are in germany russia spain and great britain but as it is as an american that i engaged bled negotiated fought and succeeded in our noble cause i only want to mark out my conduct to you whom i esteem and whose esteem in point of republicanism particularly i hold in the greatest value the institution in itself i do not examine it is worth paying attention to it should it be dangerous it must not subsist should some parts be exceptionable amendments must be made in case it is quite harmless the american officers might be indulged in that as the country is not a little indebted to them opinions must be collected because opinions of honest men may differ lee was the hero of some washington was mine and so on  i do not enter into the merits or demerits of the society i only want to acquaint you with the part i have taken the societys letters respecting the french army were directed to their generals and admirals the permitting of it     has been considered at versailles as a compliment paid to a large and meritorious body of americans as a badge of union between the two countries and i had no part to act in the business the part i acted was  stly to accept for myself and deliver the marks of the society to american officers pointed out by general washington  dly after it was accepted by the french officers to deliver it to them in a polite and brotherly manner and when i acted so i was led by two motives—the one because independent of the affectionate and dutiful regard that binds me to our gallant patriotic army independent of what can be said in favor of that freemasonry of liberty it has ever been my duty and inclination to set up in the best light every thing that is done by a body of americans and when wrong measures such as are sometimes taken in county or town meetings have been by me disputed for in foreign companies i will be still more desirous to see a proper respect paid to the measures of such a respectable body as the american officers my second motive is that independent of any propriety of the institution in itself had i amendments to propose it should be in america and not in europe and that on the moment the society is unpopular a two words resolve from an assembly may entirely destroy it when if danger is feared i heartily would consent to the destruction  i have not entered into the merits of the association your opinion and mine on the subject are not to have effect in europe let us reserve it for america where it may be of use i only wanted my conduct not to be misrepresented to you and as to my democratic principles let it be remembered that at a time when your situation was at the worst and my disobeying this court might be ruinous i went over a volunteer in the cause from which others could not recede unless they were deserters as to my going to america you know i came with an intention to settle a plan of coöperation count de grasses misfortune postponed it negotiations came on and you thought i should stay count destaing was employed and you thought i should go with him i did not set off before the affair of the six millions was settled as you well know when peace was     made i returned through spain the minister and consul wanted free ports wished to have lorient and had no instructions to act officially instead of two that were promised four have been given—dunkirk lorient bayonne and marseilles that affair will be soon concluded and before the end of may i shall set out for america many reasons of delay might be pleaded but they did not so much weigh with me as to retard the intended visit this confidential letter i consider as a personal mark of esteem for you and respect for your opinion although we have differed in a few points our fundamental principles are the same it is not to the great man i write because my popularity thank god is established in the kind liberal hearts of the american nation at large it is to the honest man because although your opinion sometimes has seemed to me wrong your principles have ever been right and i greatly value your esteem adieu my dear sir let me hear sometimes from you and believe me affectionately yours lafayette john adams   march      the hague to the president of congress the hague   march      sir— on the   th day of february the baron de thulemeier envoy extraordinary to their high mightinesses from the king of prussia did me the honor of a visit but as he found i had company he soon took his leave and as i accompanied him to the head of the stairs he told me he had something to propose to me from the king and desired to know when he might call again i offered to return his visit at any hour he pleased he chose to call upon me and named eleven the next day at which hour he came and told me that the king who honored him with a personal correspondence and was acquainted with my character had directed him to make me a visit and to say to me that as his subjects had occasion for our tobacco and some other things and as we had occasion for silesia linens and some other productions of his dominions he thought an arrangement might be made between his crown   0 and the united states which would be beneficial to both and the baron desired to know my sentiments of it i answered him that i was very sensible of the honor done by his majesty but that i had singly no authority to treat or enter into conferences officially upon the subject that congress had been pleased to confer upon their ministers at the late peace authority to enter into conferences that i could do nothing but in concurrence with mr franklin and mr jay who were at paris but i thought i could answer for the good dispositions of those ministers as well as my own for forming an arrangement between the two powers which might be beneficial to both that i would write to those ministers an account of what had passed he desired i would and said he would write by the first post to the king and inquire if his majesty had any thing in particular to propose would inform him of my answer and wait his further orders which probably he should receive as soon as i should have an answer from paris i wrote the next day and on saturday last received an answer from dr franklin and mr jay in which they say that they are persuaded that the communication of the friendly disposition of his prussian majesty made to you by the baron de thulemeier will give great pleasure to congress c  yesterday meeting the baron at court on occasion of the prince of oranges birthday he told me he had received another letter from the king and would call upon me in the evening which he did and informed me that the king had written to him that he was collecting all necessary papers and would soon send them to him with his further propositions to be made to me i showed him my letter from paris with which he was well satisfied he added that the king had directed him to mention rice and indigo as articles in demand in his ports of embden and stettin and that a large quantity of virginia tobacco had been this year purchased in those ports for the baltic market and that the excellent porcelain of saxony might be a desirable article for the americans i beg leave to submit to congress whether the model of the treaty with holland or sweden may not in general be convenient     for one with prussia as also the propriety of sending a full power to their ministers at the late peace or one or more of them to conclude this business with a great deal of difficulty and at a dear rate i have at last obtained money to save mr morriss bills which are payable this month from going back messrs willink  co will transmit the contract for the ratification of congress it is much to be lamented that we are obliged to agree to so high terms but there was absolutely no other alternative but this or protesting the bills this business has hitherto necessarily prevented me from joining my colleagues at paris in the execution of our instructions with great respect c john adams john adams    march      the hague to the president of congress the hague    march      sir— i have the honor to inclose copies of three notes from the prussian minister the baron thulemeier by which congress will see that the king has agreed to take our treaty with sweden for a model reserving to each party the right of suggesting such alterations as shall appear to him convenient my request to congress is that they would be pleased to send instructions at the same time when they send a commission what articles of the treaty with sweden they would have expunged and what new ones inserted if any i mention the sending of a commission because i suppose it is the intention of congress to send one the instructions already received are not a full power under which any sovereign can conclude nor regularly even treat we can only confer there will be some difficulty about the signature since his majesty chooses the negotiation should be conducted by m de thulemeier if congress send the commission to their ministers at the late peace as they did the instructions m de thulemeier must take a journey to paris or a majority of the american ministers must be at the hague it is a great pleasure to me to be able to inform congress that i have obtained the promise of a sum sufficient upon the new loan to save the honor of the financiers bills although i regret the severity of the terms they were the most moderate which     would obtain the money i hope for the approbation of congress and their ratification of the contract as soon as may be money is really so scarce and there are so many loans open on even higher conditions that it will not be possible i fear to obtain more money here on more reasonable ones an impost once laid on to pay the interest whether by the authority of congress if that should be agreed to or by that of the several states would soon give us better credit here but in order to keep up our reputation upon which our credit depends there should be somebody constantly residing here to publish illustrations of our affairs and to confute the calumnies of our enemies of all denominations with great and sincere respect c john adams john adams    march      the hague marquis de lafayette to the marquis de lafayette the hague    march      sir— i did not receive your letter of the  th until the day before yesterday that i have not seen with pleasure approbation or indifference the introduction into america of so great an innovation as an order of chivalry or any thing like one or that has a tendency to one is very true that i have been violent against it is not so i am not a violent man i have disapproved of this measure with as much tranquillity and selfrecollection and phlegm if you will as if i had been a native fullblooded dutchman it is not more than two or three times that i have had occasion to say any thing about it and then it was not i who introduced the subject and i said very little it is not my intention to discuss the question it is too ample a field but this is not done by the sovereigns of our country what would be said in any nation of europe if a new order were instituted by private gentlemen without consulting the sovereign it is against our confederation and against the constitutions of several states as it appears to me it is against the spirit of our governments and the genius of our people well may our government be weak if the sovereign the confederation and constitutions are thus neglected it has introduced and it will undoubtedly introduce contests and dissensions than which nothing is more injurious to republican states     especially new ones i sincerely hope our officers whose merits no man is more willing to acknowledge and reward than i am in any way consistent with our principles will voluntarily after a little reflection lay it aside i have written nothing to america upon the subject i see no motive of reason or prudence for making a mystery of our sentiments upon this subject in europe or america or for reserving them for america it is a public thing about which every man has a right to think for himself and express his thoughts as to your going to america surely i have no objection against it being asked whether you were going i answered that you talked of it but i questioned whether you would go as the war was over and i knew of no particular motive you might have to go if you go i wish you a pleasant voyage and a happy sight of your friends with much respect c john adams john adams   april      the hague benjamin franklin john jay to benjamin franklin and john jay the hague   april      gentlemen— i duly received the letter you did me the honor to write me on the subject of a treaty with prussia and communicated it to the baron de thulemeier the king agrees to take the treaty with sweden for a model and if your excellencies have any alterations to propose i should be obliged to you for the communication of them the baron waits the further instructions of the king before he proposes any additions or subtractions i should be obliged to your excellencies for a copy of the treaty with sweden as i am so unlucky as not to have one here inclosed is a copy of a petition to congress transmitted me from boston by which it appears that the britons in new york have condemned many vessels taken after the commencement of the armistice this judgment seems to me to amount to this—that a parallel of latitude is not a circle which surrounds the globe if your opinion gentlemen is clear upon this head as i doubt not it is i think it would be a public service to write it to congress as this will at least determine the     sufferers to pursue their rights by appeal to england there can be no dispute about it in england i think with great regard john adams baron de thulemeier   april      the hague john adams baron de thulemeier to john adams translation the hague   april      sir— i have the honor to send you herewith in the original the project  of a treaty of commerce to be concluded on between his prussian majesty and the united states of america just as the king has sent it to me requesting of you to return it to me as soon as you shall have caused it to be copied it will be infinitely agreeable to me sir to conduct in concert with you and to the mutual satisfaction of our masters this negotiation to the desired point if tomorrow between seven and eight oclock in the evening you could grant me a moments conversation i shall with great earnestness call on you to know your sentiments i have added sir a description of silesian linens which hitherto have been in great demand by your countrymen that is to say if the silesian merchant who furnished it to me be rightly informed i have the honor to be c

adams   april      the hague baron de thulemeier to baron de thulemeier the hague   april      monsieur le baron— i have received the letter you did me the honor to write me this morning with the original proposition of a treaty of commerce to be concluded between his prussian majesty and the united states as soon as a copy can be made the original shall be returned i shall be happy to have the honor of receiving you tomorrow evening as you propose with great respect c john adams john adams  0 april      the hague benjamin franklin john jay to benjamin franklin and john jay the hague  0 april      gentlemen— inclosed is a copy of a letter from the baron de thulemeier and a copy of a project of a treaty transmitted to me by order of the king of prussia i should be glad if your excellencies would examine it and write me your objections and proposals of alterations which i shall immediately communicate to his majesty through his minister i presume too that your excellencies will transmit it to congress that when they send a commission to conclude they may send their instructions concerning any changes to be made in the project your excellencies i flatter myself will think with me that we should execute the treaty in our own as well as in the french or german language i am gentlemen c john adams john adams  0 april      the hague to the president of congress the hague  0 april      sir— i have the honor to inclose to congress a copy of a letter from the baron de thulemeier and a copy of a project of a treaty transmitted to me by the order of the king of prussia i should hope it might be examined in congress or by a committee and that instructions may be sent concerning any changes to be made in the articles together with a commission to treat     and conclude to such person or persons as congress shall please to appoint with the greatest respect c john adams benjamin franklin    april      passy john adams benjamin franklin to john adams passy    april      sir— we duly received mr jay and i the letters you did us the honor of writing to us the   th of march and the  d instant we shall transmit as you desire the recommendation of mr browne to congress and inclosed we send a copy of the treaty with sweden we expect mr hartley here very soon to exchange the ratifications of the definitive treaty when we shall endeavor to obtain an explanatory article relating to the limits and term of captures the form used in the last treaty is precisely the same that has been used in all the treaties of peace since that of nimeguen and i therefore imagined that cases must have arisen at the end of every war in which it was necessary to decide on the meaning of that form of words wherein the canary islands are mentioned and i desired mr barclay when he went to london to procure from the records of the admiralty court some of those cases as decided there but he tells me none are to be found may there not be some in holland i should suppose they must have been adjudged by the parallel of latitude of those islands and i should be glad to have such a decision to produce to mr hartley with great respect c b franklin john adams  0 april      the hague benjamin franklin john jay to benjamin franklin and john jay the hague  0 april      gentlemen— i have just now received the letter which dr franklin did me the honor to write me on the   th with the copy of the treaty with sweden i have before inclosed the king of prussias project of a treaty prepared as i am assured by his minister with his own hand in his private cabinet i believe it has been reserved to the present age when the     subtleties of aristotle and the schools are transferred from theology to politics to discover room for a doubt in the construction of the armistice and therefore we shall search in vain in any admiralty for a precedent the words are—le terme sera dun mois depuis la manche et les mers du nord jusquaux isles canaries inclusivement soit dans locéan soit dans la méditerranée this limit is to extend to the southernmost point of the southernmost canary island from the channel this is the extent from north to south what is to be the extent from east to west is it to have none is it to be confined to a mathematical line running from the middle of the channel to the remotest part of the remotest canary or is it to be a space as wide as the channel running from it to that canary or is it to be as wide as that island if none of these constructions have common sense in them what can we suppose to have been the meaning of the contracting parties they have ascertained the space very exactly from north to south and as they have left the extent from east to west without limits it is very clear they intended it should be unlimited and reach all round the globe at least where there is any ocean or mediterranean i have the honor c john adams john adams    april      the hague to the president of congress the hague    april      sir— i received some time since a letter from an american gentleman now in london a candidate for orders desiring to know if american candidates might have orders from protestant bishops on the continent and complaining that he had been refused by the bishop of london and the archbishop of canterbury unless he would take the oaths of allegiance c meeting soon afterwards the danish minister i had the curiosity to inquire of him whether ordination might be had in denmark he answered me that he knew not but would soon inform himself i heard no more of it till today when the secretary of his embassy mr de rosenkrantz made me a visit and delivered me the papers copies of which are inclosed thus it seems that what i meant as current conversation     only has been made the subject of deliberation of the government of denmark and their faculty of theology which makes it necessary for me to transmit it to congress i am happy to find the decision so liberal i have the honor to be c john adams m de st saphorin    april      the hague john adams inclosed m de st saphorin to john adams translation the hague    april      m de st saphorin has the honor to communicate to mr adams the answer he has received from his excellency the count de rosencrone privy counsellor and secretary of state for foreign affairs of his danish majesty relative to what mr adams desired to know he will be happy should this answer be agreeable to him as well as to his superiors and useful to his fellowcitizens he has the honor to assure him of his respect de st saphorin extract inclosed sir— the opinion of the theological faculty having been taken on the question made to your excellency by mr adams if the american ministers of the church of england can be consecrated here by a bishop of the danish church i am ordered by the king to authorize you to answer that such an act can take place according to the danish rites but for the convenience of the americans who are supposed not to know the danish language the latin language will be made use of on the occasion for the rest nothing will be exacted from the candidates but a profession conformable to the articles of the english church omitting the oath called test which prevents their being ordained by the english bishops     john adams baron de st saphorin to baron de st saphorin mr adams has the honor to present his compliments to the baron de st saphorin and his sincere thanks for his note of yesterdays date and for the copy of the despatch of his excellency the count de rosencrone minister of the council of state and secretary of state for the department of foreign affairs of his majesty the king of denmark mr adams will have the honor of transmitting these papers to congress by the first opportunity and they cannot fail to be considered in a very friendly and favorable light by a considerable number of respectable people in each of the thirteen states who are materially interested in them he begs m de st saphorin to accept the assurances of the great respect with which he has the honor to be c john adams benjamin franklin john jay    april      passy john adams benjamin franklin and john jay to john adams passy    april      sir— we received the letter you did us the honor of writing to us the  0th instant with the project of a treaty that had been transmitted to you by the baron de thulemeier which we have examined and return herewith having made a few small additions or changes of words to be proposed such as citoyens for sujets and the like and intimated some explanations as wanted in particular paragraphs the sooner a copy with such of these changes as shall be agreed to by your excellency and the prussian minister is forwarded to congress for their approbation the better with regard to the language of treaties we are of opinion that if the ministers of the nation we treat with insist on having the treaty in their own language we should then insist on having it also in ours both to be signed at the same time this was done in our treaties with france but if both parties agree to use a language that is particular to neither but common to both as the latin or the french as  00 was done in our treaty with sweden we then think it not necessary to have it also signed in english with great respect c b franklin john jay john adams   may      the hague baron de thulemeier to baron de thulemeier the hague   may      monsieur le baron— i have the honor to inclose your project of a treaty with a few corrections and proposals of explanations made by my colleagues messrs franklin and jay which i have the honor to agree with them in submitting to your consideration the alterations are soon made and are so inconsiderable that if you and i can arrange them which may be done in half an hour i will transmit the whole to congress by the earliest opportunity as a plan approved by the ministers on both sides with great respect c john adams john adams    may      the hague to the president of congress the hague    may      sir— since my last arrival in holland i have not transmitted to congress the details of the politics of this court and nation nor of the neighboring courts which are exciting disputes with it mr dumas has been in the habit and train of that history and i have not thought fit to interrupt him but if i should reside here regularly the whole business of the mission will of course go through my hands i therefore wish to know in what light i am to consider this gentleman and what relation he is to stand in to me i wish it for the government of my own conduct and still more from regard to him whom i esteem as a very worthy man and one who has for a course of years been indefatigable in the service of the united states and who is not adequately rewarded or supported by the pittance which is allowed him but what is more disagreeable he has never had any character or commission from congress  0  and one knows not what to call him whether secretary or agent i cannot ask him to act as my private secretary which is really much beneath him although he is ever ready to assist me in all things i should be happy to know the pleasure of congress in this respect and to receive their instructions from time to time in all things which relate to the united netherlands which i shall endeavor to execute to the best of my power inclosed is another copy of the project of a treaty with prussia which i transmitted to paris to messrs franklin and jay and have received back again from them with their approbation excepting the few corrections and inquiries marked upon it by those ministers the king will send a full power probably to m de thulemeier and i should be happy to know the pleasure of congress with great respect c john adams john adams   june      the hague to the president of congress the hague   june      sir— some weeks ago the baron de thulemeier called upon me and delivered me the paper a copy of which is inclosed marked   it is a letter written by the envoy to the king last evening the baron called upon me again and delivered me the answer of the king contained in the paper a copy of which is inclosed marked   i have heretofore transmitted to congress by different opportunities copies of the project of a treaty and the papers herein transmitted complete the negotiation and the treaty is ready for signature unless congress have other alterations to propose as his majesty seems to choose that this business should be conducted by his envoy here who is also desirous of finishing it perhaps congress may not judge it too much complaisance in framing their commission to give authority to any one to conclude this treaty in case they should name more than one as it would be impossible for m thulemeier to go to paris it is not every ambassador however high his rank or numerous his titles or magnificent his appointments who arrives at the honor of concluding any treaty it is a distinction which is made an object of ambition and is much desired so that the  0  barons inclinations i suppose will not be thought inexcusable i should hope that congress might despatch their instructions and authority to some one or more to conclude this affair with as little delay as possible with great respect c john adams observations translation  st instead of expressing through the course of the treaty the denomination of the united states of north america simply the united states of america  d instead of respective subjects so far as regards the united states of america the

be molested on account of his religion provided he submit as regards the public demonstrations thereof to the laws of the country liberty shall moreover be granted on the death of the subjects or

christian majesty and the united states of america which is expressed as follows and on the contrary no shelter or refuge shall be given in their ports or harbors to such as shall have made prizes of the subjects of his majesty or said united states and if they are forced to enter by distress of weather or the danger of the sea they shall be obliged to leave it again as soon as possible after the declaration of this article it appears that in case of a war between prussia and france it would not be admissible for the united states of america to derogate from antecedent treaties concluded with

forced to enter therein by stress of weather or danger of the sea in this last case they shall not be stopped nor seized but shall be obliged to go away as soon as possible robert morris    june      john adams robert morris to john adams office of finance    june      dear sir— i have not any letters from your excellency which are unanswered except those of the   st of may and  0    th of september in the last year both of which arrived very long after their dates i have learnt from the gentlemen to whom the management of the loan in holland was committed the various good and ill success which they have met with and now that i am about to leave this office let me return to your excellency my sincere thanks for the assistance which has at different times been derived from the exertion of your industry and talents i pray you also to believe that when in private life i shall continue to feel that esteem and respect with which i have the honor to be sir c robert morris john adams    june      the hague to the president of congress the hague    june      sir— if my memory does not deceive me i have heretofore transmitted to congress the advice of some of the foreign ministers here that the united states in congress assembled should write a letter to each of the sovereigns of europe informing them of the complete establishment of their independence lately in separate conversations with the ministers of the two empires and the king of sardinia they all repeated this advice they say that this is the rule the practice and that the precedents are uniform the empress of russia did it lately when she ascended the throne they add that this is the precise point of time now that the ratifications of the definitive treaty of peace are exchanged which is most proper to make the communication and that their courts expect it from congress congress no doubt will write an elegant letter upon the occasion but it would in substance be sufficient to say that on the  th of july      they found it necessary to declare themselves a sovereign state that they have since entered into treaties with several powers of europe particularly a treaty of peace with the king of great britain wherein that crown has acknowledged formally and solemnly their sovereignty and that it is their desire to live in good intelligence and correspondence with the sovereigns of europe and of all other parts of the world and with the one in particular and that there may be friendship and harmony between their respective citizens  0  and subjects these letters may be transmitted to all or any of your ministers in europe to be by them communicated through the foreign ministers at the court where they reside or they may be transmitted directly if congress are at a loss for the titles of any sovereign they may leave a blank to be filled by the minister to whom the letter is sent for communication the answers which will be respectively given to these letters will prevent many questions discussions and chicaneries because that orders will then be given to all ambassadors governors generals admirals c to treat all american citizens of the united states according to their characters with great respect c john adams marquis de lafayette    june      lorient john adams the marquis de lafayette to john adams lorient    june      my dear sir— at the very instant of sailing for america i stop to send you the newmodelled regulations of the cincinnati my principles ever have been against heredity and while i was in europe disputing about it with a few friends my letters to the assembly and still more particularly to the president made them sensible of my opinion upon that matter until heredity was given up i forebore mentioning in europe what sense i had expressed but mr jay being in paris i once explained my conduct to him and he appeared very well satisfied the value i have for your esteem is the reason why i mention those particulars and so far as respects me it is for you that i write this minute account mr jay is named a minister for foreign affairs with john adams franklin and jefferson appointed a committee to make treaties with european powers with every sentiment of an affectionate regard c lafayette whatever has been thought offensive you see the cincinnati have given it up now the new frame must be examined in every circumstance my dear sir depend upon it you will find me what i have ever been and perhaps with some éclat a warm friend to the army a still warmer advocate for the cause of  0  liberty but those two things when the army is put to the proof you will ever acknowledge to agree with each other john adams    june      the hague benjamin franklin to benjamin franklin the hague    june      sir— the baron de reishach has several times said to me that his court expected that congress would announce formally their independence and he has asked me if any step of that sort had been taken that i may be able to give him an answer i must request of your excellency to inform me whether you have made the annunciation directed in the first article of the instructions of the   th of october      and what is the answer i have the pleasure to learn by report only however that mr jay is appointed minister of foreign affairs and that mr jefferson is appointed to madrid and that mr johnson has received and transmitted to your excellency a packet which probably contains an authentic account as it seems to be posterior to the appointment by being addressed only to your excellency and to me i should be glad to know whether there is any thing else of consequence and whether it appears to be the design and expectation of congress that i should join you where you are with great respect c john adams benjamin franklin   july      passy john adams benjamin franklin to john adams passy   july      sir— i have received the letter your excellency did me the honor of writing to me the   th past the annunciation directed by the instruction you mention has not yet been made some circumstances and considerations not necessary to particularize at present occasioned the delay here but it may now be done immediately by your excellency if you think proper to the imperial minister at the hague or i will do it to count mercy by presenting him a copy of the instruction itself i hope the report that mr jay is appointed minister of foreign  0  affairs will prove true such an officer has long been wanted and he will make a good one it is said here that mr jefferson was talked of to succeed me of which i shall be glad on all accounts but i have no letter nor the least hint from any one of the congress relating to these matters i wrote to you a few days since and sent you a copy of the last despatch and the only one i have received since january mr hartley who has been here more than two months is in a similar situation he has expected instructions by every late courier to treat with us on commercial points but they do not arrive he thinks the delay occasioned by the report of the committee of council on the subject not having been ready to lay before parliament the moment he is ready to treat i shall acquaint your excellency with it for i make no doubt of its being the design and expectation of congress that we should join in that transaction montgomery of alicant appears to have acted very imprudently in writing to morocco without the least authority from congress or any of their ministers it might be well however to treat with that prince if we were provided with the proper and necessary presents in which case this court would assist our negotiations agreeable to their treaty with congress i have the honor to be c b franklin john adams    july      the hague benjamin franklin to benjamin franklin the hague    july      sir— i embrace the opportunity by mr bingham to inclose to your excellency a copy of a letter from mr jefferson by which it appears that we are joined in some affairs which will give me the occasion to visit paris once more and reside there for some little time at least as mr jefferson will not probably arrive before the latter end of august and nothing can be done before he comes i shall wait at the hague for my wife and daughter who are happily arrived in london and endeavor to go with them in time to meet your excellency and mr jefferson upon his arrival at paris the philosophers are speculating upon our constitutions and i hope will throw out hints which will be of use to our countrymen  0  the science of government as it is founded upon the genuine principles of society is many centuries behind that of most other sciences that of the fine arts as well as that of trades and manufactures as it is the first in importance it is to be hoped it may overtake the rest and that mankind may find their account in it the berlin academician  has set an example which if liberally followed may produce great effects for i do not believe that many will find with him upon examination that despotism or even monarchy is the best possible form of government they have sent me from amsterdam copies of a translation of the abbé de mablys letters made by an english episcopal clergyman at amsterdam whom i do not know i inclose one to your excellency and have the honor to be c john adams benjamin franklin   august      passy john adams benjamin franklin to john adams passy   august      sir— mr bingham sent me last night from paris your excellencys letter of the   th past inclosing a copy of one from mr jefferson i had before sent you a copy of one from the same to me which i hope you received i inclose herewith copies of a letter from mr thomson some new instructions and one of the commissions the other two are in the same words except that instead of the words the united netherlands there is in one france and in the other sweden these came by monsieur de la luzerne but it was not before wednesday last that i received them you will see that a good deal of business is cut out for us—treaties to be made with i think twenty powers in two years—so that we are not likely to eat the bread of idleness and that we may not surfeit by eating too much our masters have diminished our allowance i commend their economy and shall imitate it by diminishing my expense our too liberal entertainment of our countrymen here has been reported at home by our guests to our disadvantage and has given offence they must be contented for the future as i am with plain beef and pudding the readers of connecticut newspapers  0  ought not to be troubled with any more accounts of our extravagance for my own part if i could sit down to dinner on a piece of their excellent salt pork and pumpkin i would not give a farthing for all the luxuries of paris i am glad to hear that your family are safely arrived at london and that you propose to bring them here with you your life will be more comfortable i thank you much for the translation of the abbé de mablys letters the french edition is not yet published here i have as yet only had time to run over the translators preface which seems well written i imagine mr sowden to be a presbyterian minister as i formerly corresponded with one of that name in holland who i suppose might be his father i have not seen the piece you mention of a berlin academician i should not object to his enjoyment of the discovery he has made that despotism is the best possible form of government by his living under it as long as he pleases for i admire the decision of his prince in a similar case the dispute among his clergy concerning the duration of hell torments with great respect i have the honor to be c b franklin john adams    october      auteuil thomas cushing to thomas cushing auteuil    october      dear sir— within a few days i have received your favor of the   th of august with the resolve of the general court of the  th and  th of july the line between massachusetts and nova scotia gave me much uneasiness at the time of the negotiation of the provisional articles and still continues to distress me i knew that the french in former times had a practice of erecting a holy cross of wood upon every river they had a sight of and that such crosses had been found on the banks of all the rivers in that region and that several rivers for this reason were equally entitled with any one to the appellation of st croix st johns river had a number of those crosses and was as probably meant in the grant to sir william alexander and in the charters of massachusetts as any other i would accordingly have insisted on st johns as the limit but no map or document   0 called st johns st croix nor was there one paper to justify us in insisting on it the charters the grant to alexander all the maps and other papers agreed in this that st croix was the line between massachusetts and nova scotia my colleagues thought they could not be justified in insisting on a boundary which no record or memorial supported and i confess i thought so too after mature reflection especially as the british ministers insisted long on kennebec and to the last moment on penobscot and we found their instructions upon this point were so rigorous that they would not have agreed to st johns without sending another courier to england a loss of time which would not only have hazarded but finally lost the whole peace for that year as i fully believe we had before us through the whole negotiation a variety of maps but it was mitchells map upon which was marked out the whole of the boundary lines of the united states and the river st croix which we fixed on was upon that map the nearest river to st johns so that in all equity good conscience and honor the river next to st johns should be the boundary i am glad the general court are taking early measures and hope they will pursue them steadily until the point is settled which it may be now amicably if neglected long it may be more difficult it is reported here that the indians are at war with the english which is the excuse given out for the neglect of evacuating the posts upon our frontier near the lakes sir john johnsons conference may be intended to make peace in order to the evacuation which could not easily be performed in sight of hostile indians i cannot believe that the british ministry mean to violate the treaty in this point because it must bring on a war which none of them would be willing to take upon himself at present i was once upon a committee with mr bowdoin and drew a state of the claim of the province to the lands now called vermont and i learn by a letter from mr dalton that the report in my handwriting has been lately before the general court it contains all i ever knew upon the subject and much more than i now remember i am c john adams     john adams   november      auteuil to the president of congress auteuil   november      sir— dr franklin has lately communicated to mr jefferson and me a letter he has received from the count de vergennes and another from m grand the first informs that m marbois had informed him that upon his application to the superintendent of finances he had received an answer by mr gouverneur morris that letters should be written both to amsterdam and paris to provide for the payment of the interest of the ten millions of livres borrowed for the united states in holland by the king and reminds the american minister that other interest is due and that the first payment of the capital will become due next year m grand informs that he is already about fifty thousand livres in advance for loanoffice certificates salaries c these letters the doctor will no doubt transmit to congress and as they relate to matters within his department i might have been excused from mentioning them if the mention of amsterdam had not made it probable that mr morris had it in contemplation to draw upon our bankers there for money to discharge this interest and i cannot excuse myself from observing that if such drafts should be made i am apprehensive they will be protested france is at present in so much danger of being forced to take part in a war in the low countries that i am not surprised at the count de vergennes attention to matters of revenue and that i cannot see any hope that dr franklin will be able to obtain any relief from this court it will be remembered that there is a debt of near a million and a half sterling to france and another debt of more than half a million sterling in holland whose interests are constantly accruing there are also salaries to ministers and there is another call for money which is very pressing the commerce of the mediterranean is of great importance to the united states and to every one of them and this commerce cannot be enjoyed with freedom without treaties with the barbary powers it will be not only in vain but dangerous and detrimental to open negotiations with these powers without money for the customary presents how are all these demands for money to     be satisfied if cash bills or produce can be sent to europe for the purpose it will be happy for us but i suppose that no man believes it possible and therefore we must not only forego great future advantages but violate contracts already made and faith already pledged and thereby totally ruin our credit if not expose the property of our merchants to be seized abroad or we must borrow more money in europe now there is no part of europe in which we can expect to borrow unless it be in holland and there we may rely upon it all our hopes will fail us if effectual measures are not taken to fund our foreign debt if adequate funds were established for discharging the interest we may hope for further credit without them our circumstances are absolutely desperate it is not for me to enter into the question how this is to be done so far distant and so long absent it would be impossible for me to form a judgment if the subject were within my province which it is not the ability of our people for this and much greater things cannot be doubted by any man who knows any thing of their affairs and it is a pity that any questions about the mode should retard this most necessary provision for the existence of our credit abroad i have this moment a letter from our bankers at amsterdam dated the   th of october in which they inform me that they have not received the ratification of my last loan perhaps it did not arrive until after the recess of congress i must earnestly request that congress would despatch it as early as possible after their meeting because the delay of it may excite an alarm and dash all our hopes at once the half a million sterling which we have obtained in holland has been all transmitted to america in dollars by the way of the havana or paid in redeeming bills of exchange sold in america for very advantageous premiums none of it has been laid out in goods and therefore every other consideration calls upon us to be punctual as well as our honor which alone ought to be sufficient inclosed are copies of papers received from m dumas with my answers i cannot forbear recommending this gentleman to congress upon this occasion as the critical circumstances in the low countries at this time will render his intelligence very interesting and his services at the hague perhaps indispensably necessary with great respect c john adams     the following questions submitted by their high mightinesses to m dumas were by him transmitted to mr adams whose answers are appended translation questions   on proof of a transfer in good and due form the property of a vessel to be american can the necessary sealetters be obtained at the hague   is it necessary that the purchaser should be a citizen of some town belonging to one of the thirteen states or will it suffice that he is settled there though only since the acknowledgment of the independence of america has a citizen greater claims to the protection of congress than an inhabitant   the property of a vessel being proved american agreeably to the first question is it indifferent in what port she is and to what port she is destined or is this confined to a certain port in europe and to a certain port in america and vice versâ   is it necessary that the captain of such vessel should be an american citizen or will it answer if he has been born in a city town or village actually dependent on congress   in case of purchasing a vessel on account of an american for which there is immediate employment may she not be commanded by a captain of another nation supposing that at the time no american captain could be found who might be intrusted with the command   should a vessel sold and transferred to a citizen or inhabitant of the continent be taken by the enemy sailing under foreign colors could a reclamation by congress be expected   in case such vessel should be bound from a port in europe or america for a mediterranean port or should actually be at some port in the mediterranean and elsewhere destined what means are to be taken and what papers are to be shown to obtain the necessary turkish passports to navigate that sea     answers   there is no man at present in holland legally authorized by the united states in congress assembled to issue sealetters   both citizens and inhabitants have a right to protection but every stranger who has been in the united states or who may be there at present is not an inhabitant different states have different definitions of this word the domicil and the animus habitandi is necessary in all   all vessels bonâ fide the property of american citizens or inhabitants have a right to protection   american citizens and inhabitants have a right to navigate their vessels by captains and seamen of any nation   undoubtedly but let the parties look to themselves that the translation be bonâ fide and clearly proved   the evidence of this must be very clear the united states will scarcely interfere in such a case if there is a doubt of the fact or a suspicion of collusion   the united states have not yet a treaty with the turks or barbary powers and therefore no such papers are to be had john adams   november      auteuil m dumas to m dumas auteuil   november      sir— i have received your favor of the   th of october with the seven questions inclosed i have answered these questions to the best of my judgment believing it to be my duty to give to my inquiring countrymen all the satisfaction in my power upon such occasions i should wish too to gratify the dutch merchants and all others as far as i can in character but we must above all things have the utmost caution that we do not involve the united states in quarrels which are not their own we can give no countenance whatever to any kind of fraud or collusion or to any false or suspicious papers the united states will protect their own flag and the rights liberties and properties of their own citizens but they can go no farther if we could assist any man in europe in this way we ought surely to do it for messrs willink and if we refuse it to them     certainly no others can complain although these gentlemen are in so high a trust under the united states i cannot think them entitled to the character of citizens or inhabitants and therefore should not think myself safe in giving them american papers for their vessels i hope the certificate you have given to captain veder may answer the end and in the present unexpected circumstances of the war or at least danger of war i should not venture to advise you not to give others in clear cases they may do much good and save to merchants and masters of vessels much trouble and expense and i cannot foresee any evil they can do but if any such certificate should be disputed and examined it will be found null you will continue to write all to congress and you will soon i hope receive their commands with great esteem i have the honor to be dear sir yours c john adams john adams   december      auteuil maréchal de castries to the maréchal de castries auteuil   december      monsieur le maréchal— according to your desire i have committed to writing the two or three observations on the business of masts yards and bowsprits which i had last tuesday the honor of making in conversation with your excellency at paris the eastern parts of the massachusetts particularly the counties of york cumberland and lincoln and more especially the lands lying near the four great rivers which meet in merrymeeting bay and flow together under the name of kennebec river into the sea are the spot upon which grow the best pine trees for masts which are found in america and from whence the english government before the revolution procured their masts for large ships unless perhaps they obtained a few from some parts of new hampshire by the charter of massachusetts pine trees were reserved to the crown and various acts of parliament were made from time to time forbidding upon severe penalties private persons to cut such trees the king had an officer under the title of surveyorgeneral of the woods     who had under him a great number of deputysurveyors for the inspection and conservation of these trees mr wentworth the last royal governor of new hampshire was the last surveyorgeneral at whose request the subscriber commenced and prosecuted a great number of libels in the court of admiralty at boston against transgressions of those acts of parliament so that he thinks himself well warranted to say that those acts of parliament instead of containing any proof of the bad quality of american pine trees as your excellency was pleased to say you had been informed contained the best proof of their excellence and of the high esteem in which the parliament held them there was a considerable number of large vessels which were called mast ships constantly employed in transporting from kennebec and piscataqua rivers pine trees for masts spars and bowsprits for the royal navy and the trees of thirtysix inches diameter which the english were very fond of for their large ships were only to be found in america there are upon the territory before described a number of families whose whole occupation has been to cut draw and prepare this kind of trees for the royal navy of england it is a difficult laborious and hazardous business and not very profitable but being educated to this employment from their infancy knowing perfectly the country and the lands where the trees are the proper seasons for the business and having their tools and machines as well as their teams of cattle always ready and knowing all the most frugal ways of saving expenses and making advantages they were able to live by the business when other persons without these advantages would have ruined themselves these people were commonly called mastmen and they are so valuable a set of men that whoever first engages them whether the french or the english will obtain an advantage the english are said to have sent an agent to boston and there is no doubt that they will exert themselves to secure these mastmen unless your excellency by seizing a favorable opportunity of contracting with some of the americans now here engage them beforehand your excellency will permit me to say that i apprehend all surveys and experiments made upon the masts and spars now on board of the french ships which were procured in america     will not only be useless but illusory it will not be a fair trial because on the breaking out of hostilities between great britain and america the whole system of the masting business and commerce was broken up the mastmen like the fishermen not finding their usual employment went into others sold their cattle and laid aside their tools so that the pine timber furnished to the french ships although the best then and there to be had was only such as was left by the english or obtained by hazard in improper places and in a green unseasoned state it is no wonder then if the wood is found to shrink for the wood of the pine tree is of such a nature that when cut and used green it always shrinks whether it grows in america or in sweden norway or russia i am well informed that the most intelligent officers of the british navy attributed the loss of the great number of the capital ships by bad weather in the late war a loss unprecedented in any former war wholly to the want of american masts the ministry ordered their expedition to penobscot in the view of obtaining masts but they found themselves disappointed they found there pine trees it is true but no mastmen no sufficient teams of cattle no proper machines for the business all these were without their lines so that they obtained no masts of any value there is not in america at least within my knowledge a merchant more intelligent or any way more capable of giving your excellency full information upon the subject nor more worthy of confidence than mr tracy and mr jackson who are now in paris and to them i beg leave to refer with great and sincere respect c john adams john adams    december      auteuil john jay to secretary jay auteuil    december      sir— i venture to address myself to you as minister of foreign affairs because i sincerely hope that you have accepted that important office the emperor of morocco sent an ambassador last winter to holland to demand materials for some frigates and as none of the great maritime powers have the courage or the will to refuse     such requisitions obtained them it now appears probable that they have been employed in corsairs against american trade and one virginia vessel appears to have been taken and carried to tangiers this has spread an alarm and raised the insurance on american vessels and rendered it necessary that something should be soon done there is danger of our making mistakes upon this occasion some are of opinion that our trade in the mediterranean is not worth the expense of the presents we must make the piratical states to obtain treaties with them others think it humiliating to treat with such enemies of the human race and that it would be more manly to fight them the first i think have not calculated the value of our mediterranean trade in which every one of our states is deeply interested but this is not all the piratical corsairs will go all over the ocean and will even raise the insurance upon all our commerce so high as to cost us more in this single article than all the presents exacted would amount to the last have more spirit than prudence as long as france england holland the emperor c will submit to be tributary to these robbers and even encourage them to what purpose should we make war upon them the resolution might be heroic but would not be wise the contest would be unequal they can injure us very sensibly but we cannot hurt them in the smallest degree we have or shall have a rich trade at sea exposed to their depredations they have none at all upon which we can make reprisals if we take a vessel of theirs we get nothing but a bad vessel fit only to burn a few guns and a few barbarians whom we may hang or enslave if we will and the unfeeling tyrants whose subjects they are will think no more of it than if we had killed so many caterpillars upon an appletree when they take a vessel of ours they not only get a rich prize but they enslave the men and if there are among them men of any rank or note they demand most exorbitant ransoms for them if we could even send a force sufficient to burn a town their unfeeling governors would only insult and deride unless it were possible then to persuade the great maritime powers of europe to unite in the suppression of these piracies it would be very imprudent for us to entertain any thoughts of contending with them and will only lay a foundation by irritating their passions and increasing     their insolence and their demands for long and severe repentance i hope therefore we shall think of nothing but treating with them but how where is the money france calls upon us to fulfil our engagements with her both for interest and principal and our creditors in holland who are very numerous will soon be uneasy unless something is done for their security holland is the only place where we can borrow money and there it will be impracticable unless our european debt at least be consolidated if congress therefore think of borrowing in holland they must begin by laying duties at home to pay the interest i have not time to enlarge at present on any subject this is the most pressing and deserves the immediate attention of congress and their ministers of whom i hope you are one as i am very sure no man is better qualified or better disposed but if unfortunately you should not be in office let me pray you to transmit the substance of this letter to congress with great and sincere respect c john adams john adams  0 january      auteuil jan willink to messrs willink and others auteuil  0 january      gentlemen— i have received with much pleasure your letters of the  0th and  0th of december give me leave to congratulate you on the flourishing state of your treasury which furnishes a very good proof that the credit of the united states has much ameliorated since january      when i was obliged to undertake and undergo all the hardships and inconveniences of a winter voyage and journey in packetboats iceboats and boors wagons in extreme cold weather to prevent mr morriss bills from being protested it is a great satisfaction to me to reflect that i have been able with your assistance to obtain in holland a loan of money for my country of near seven millions of guilders a sum very nearly equal to all that was ever lent us by france our debt to france is thirtyfour millions of livres ten millions of which were borrowed in holland on the warranty of the statesgeneral you see therefore that the whole national debt of the united states in europe is less than two   0 millions sterling if a capitalist in holland compares this with the national debt of england or france or any other power and at the same time considers the number of inhabitants the extent and fertility of territory the advantages for trade and above all the rapid increase of population industry agriculture commerce and fisheries he will soon think his money safer in the hands of the united states and american stocks superior to any other for my own part i confess i wish that congress would borrow money in holland to pay off their debt to france that they might not owe a shilling anywhere but in holland this however i say without authority and it is certain that congress will not borrow money upon higher terms than they pay at present in france to pay off the french debt i wait to know how many obligations you have on hand i have no orders from congress to open a new loan and i fancy i shall never have any to open another upon any other at least higher terms than the first five millions but i should be glad to know your sentiments whether there is a good prospect of success there is one subject which concerns myself personally which i beg leave to propose to your consideration my salary at present is so low that it is with the utmost difficulty i can live upon it in any kind of proportion to the public character i sustain and therefore i cannot afford to pay a commission of one per cent of m van den yver in paris and mr puller in london as those bankers have heretofore charged and congress may perhaps be displeased to be charged with such a commission merely for my convenience of receiving my money in london or paris you know gentlemen that of all the immense sums that i have borrowed upon my signature for the united states not one farthing of benefit accures to me and you know how parsimonious i have been of orders for money even for necessary public services so that i should be obliged to you for your advice whether there is not any method by which i may receive my salary and disbursements in paris or london as may be most convenient to my affairs or whether it will not be better for me to draw bills upon you in favor of bankers or merchants in london or paris i accept with a sensible pleasure gentlemen your kind compliments     of the season and in return my family joins with me in wishing you and your families all health wealth and honor not only for the year ensuing but for a long course of years after it i remain c john adams john adams  0 january      auteuil to the president of congress auteuil  0 january      sir— i have the satisfaction to inform congress that by a letter from our bankers in amsterdam i am informed they have in hand near a million of guilders and consequently that the two loans i have opened amounting in the whole to seven millions of guilders are almost full this is a full proof of an amelioration of our credit since january      when i was obliged in a very tender state of convalescence and an uncommonly rigorous season to undergo the hardships and dangers of a voyage and journey in packetboats iceboats and boeditor illegible letters wagons to obtain money to save mr morriss bills from being protested this is a very fortunate circumstance for us at this time both as it furnishes us the means of treating with the barbary powers if congress should authorize us to make the necessary presents upon which points we wait their instructions and as it will enable congress to pay the interest of their debt to france four letters upon the subject of this interest have been communicated to his colleagues by dr franklin one from the count de vergennes and three from m grand and no doubt transmitted to congress dr franklin has sounded me several times to know if i was willing to pay the salaries of the ministers and mr carmichaels salary mr dumas salary and colonel humphreys in short there is no money in europe at present but what has been obtained in holland by my signature and is supposed to be under my inspection i shall therefore be very soon embarrassed as there will be many applications to me for money and i shall not dare to advance it without orders i therefore pray for the explicit instructions of congress upon this subject your ministers in europe must not starve on the one hand and i must not on the other presume to appropriate money unappropriated by congress without necessity if it should be the     pleasure of congress that i should draw for necessary moneys upon the certificate of their ministers here or that they should draw upon my bankers in amsterdam this would relieve me from a great anxiety at all events it is absolutely necessary that congress should communicate to me their commands i wish also to know whether it is the expectation of congress that i should open a new loan as one of the old ones is full and the other is very near it i confess it grieves me to put my hand to an obligation as it always brings home to my heart the reflection that i am burdening the industry and labor of my fellowcitizens and countrymen with a heavy load and when demands are laid before me for millions of livres for interest already due i cannot help wishing that i might never have occasion to sign another obligation it will nevertheless be absolutely necessary as i believe to borrow somewhat more but it behoves the people to consider the necessity they are under of exerting themselves in season to provide for the payment of their foreign debt and especially to avoid as much as possible the necessity of increasing it they will find it very impoverishing to send annually out of their country such large sums for the payment of interest an enormous bulk of the produce of the country must go to make up these sums and we shall find the drain very exhausting to our patience if not to our strength with great respect c john adams baron de thulemeier    janvier      la haie john adams baron de thulemeier to john adams la haie    janvier      vous recevrez monsieur par un courier hollandais adressé à messieurs de berkenrode et brantzen un paquet sous votre enveloppe et celle de messieurs franklin et jefferson il renferme les observations du roi sur le contreprojet du traité de commerce qui ma été remis de votre part au mois de novembre de lannée dernière agréez quen qualité de votre ancien collègue toujours reconnaissant de lamitié que vous mavez témoignée pendant votre séjour à la haie je prenne la liberté de vous parler avec quelque franchise les observations sur les articles            0 et    du contreprojet sont envisagées à berlin     comme trop essentielles pour quon puisse se départir des changemens et additions proposés je ne vous dissimulerai point même monsieur quà en juger par mes instructions la conclusion du traité en dépendra selon toute apparence les remarques postérieures contribueront uniquement à donner plus de clarté et de précision à quelques articles daignez monsieur envisager tout ceci non comme une déclaration ministérielle mais simplement comme un témoignage de ma confiance et du désir dont je suis animé dassurer le succès de nos soins communs et déloigner tout ce qui pourrait faire naître des obstacles trop essentiels pour que je puisse espérer de les surmonter un mot de réponse de votre part me feroit grand plaisir agréez les assurances c de thulemeier jan willink   february      amsterdam john adams messrs willink and others to john adams amsterdam   february      sir— last week we received your much esteemed favor of  0 january and observed with much pleasure your satisfaction on the flourishing state of the treasury of the united states in our hands your excellency desires our opinion whether the prospect of making new loans for the congress would be favorable in answer to this we heartily wish that we may not very soon be charged to try it and that before it may become necessary congress may be put in a situation by a unanimous consentment of all the american states of the confederation to point out a sufficient fund for the punctual payment of the capital and interest which as you know has not been the case with the two first loans and which at present would absolutely be required because people in this country know that the states have not agreed upon this capital point this circumstance certainly occasions that the credit of the united states cannot be carried to the point which we believe it deserves in consequence of the inward solidity and promising prospect of the sources of her welfare besides this we are daily questioned about the ratification of the last loan and we are at a loss what we shall answer having not received any letters from the office of finance since the time when mr morris resigned but sir whenever our wishes in these points should be fulfilled     which certainly would strengthen greatly the american credit we should not advise to try another loan for some time because we know that a great number of bonds of both of the former remain still in the hands of the undertakers which as you know is the second hand and there is no great prospect that they will sell their shares so soon on occasion that we have every day new loans opened here as for instance one of seven millions in favor of the east india company one of twelve hundred thousand florins for the states of zealand one of two millions for sweden and we expect every day a loan for our province added to this large sums are employed in the french loan and you will easily conclude that money becomes very scarce which we hope will not be the case next year and if then congress might wish to pay off the loans in france and raise the money in this country it would give us much pleasure to give her again satisfaction with our endeavors and at the same time to observe an unlimited confidence with our countrymen we observe sir what you are pleased to mention about the commission which our bankers charge upon the sums which they pay you on account of your salary it is our opinion that properly this commission should be bonified by congress and even that they should indemnify your excellency for the trouble and hardships you had on their behalf would not be amiss but it being out of our line to decide any thing of that kind we will only say that in case the said commission is charged by congress to your account we will in future give such orders that you will have no reason to complain about it we beg to return our compliments to your worthy family and remain c wilhem and jan willink nich and jacob van staphorst de la lande and fynje john adams    february      auteuil baron de thulemeier to baron de thulemeier auteuil    february      sir— your favor of the   th of january did not reach me until two days ago i communicated the observations inclosed     in it immediately to my colleagues who will transmit you our answers as soon as health and other circumstances will admit i have communicated to them also your personal and confidential observations to me they will have great weight as they ought to have i am weary of the slow motions of other courts and states as much as i admire the despatch intelligence and decision of that of berlin and as much as i am charmed to find the king do us the honor to agree to the platonic philosophy of some of our articles which are at least a good lesson to mankind and will derive more influence from a treaty ratified by the king of prussia than from the writings of plato or sir thomas more you may depend upon it i will do every thing in my power to bring this treaty to a speedy conclusion and to conform in every thing as far as i can consistently with my instructions to his majestys observations this answer you perceive is not ministerial any more than your letter but i hope to have the honor of signing the treaty with you if i should not have that of residing near you at the hague which i wish in a short time with great respect c john adams john adams    february      auteuil jan willink to messrs willink and others auteuil    february      gentlemen— i have received your favor of the  th of january and that of the  d of february and am much obliged to you for the particular account of the state of the cash and obligations in your hands by all that i have learned from your letters as well as by inquiry in conversation it seems to be so possible and indeed so probable that the united states might be exposed to a loss of several hundred thousand guilders by a sudden fall of the agio that i have not been able to resolve upon giving you directions to put the cash on hand into the bank especially as i have every day expected and still expect not only the ratification of the last loan but orders from congress or their commissioners of the treasury what to do with the whole sum i still expect every moment to receive the orders of congress and therefore shall not venture as yet to give     orders for putting the money into the bank but as you are on the spot and are better informed than i am i must leave it to your judgments to do what you shall think most for the interest of the united states either by putting the whole or a part or none of the money into the bank but gentlemen let me above all things recommend it to you to keep the congress constantly informed of the state of their affairs in your hands you may address your letters either to the president his excellency richard henry lee or to the office of finance perhaps it would be best to address duplicates one to the president and the other to the commissioners of the treasury i thank you gentlemen for what you say about my salary but would it not be a saving for me to draw bills upon you and sell them here as to an indemnification to me for my troubles and hardships i have no idea of asking or even wishing for such a thing exclusive of all these it would require a larger sum perhaps than you imagine to indemnify me for my losses this too i neither expect nor desire indeed while the war continued and all was at stake i never thought about trouble hardships losses or savings but as peace is made and danger to the public is no more i should think myself bound to economy for the sake of my family if i were not necessitated to it in order to pay my daily expenses as i literally am at present with much esteem c john adams john adams   march      auteuil secretary jay to secretary jay auteuil   march      sir— permit me to congratulate the united states upon the acquisition of a minister of foreign affairs whose long services have so justly acquired their confidence and whose experience as well as his talents so fully qualify him for this important trust the joint despatches of their ministers here will inform congress of the slow progress of the negotiations intrusted to their care these delays are owing to the ordinary character of the deliberations of courts and are in no measure occasioned by any inattention or inactivity on our part and as they are irremediable must be submitted to with patience     i must beg leave to repeat a request mentioned in several of my late letters that congress would be pleased to transmit the ratification of my last loan which i opened a year ago in holland and is long since full the delay of the ratification has an ill effect congress will be pleased too to give orders if it is not yet done as i hope it has been concerning near a million of guilders which remain in the hands of their bankers at amsterdam as appears by some extracts of letters inclosed i have lately inquired of the baron de stael the swedish ambassador and of m dasp the swedish chargé daffaires an old acquaintance at the hague who has been lately removed to this court concerning the presents given by their court to the barbary powers both very obligingly promised to write to stockholm for full information upon this subject i have written to mr dumas to apply to mr bisdom and mr van der hope to learn the sums given by the republic the answers of those gentlemen i have communicated to my colleagues and copies of them will be transmitted to congress by mr humphreys in the joint despatches if we can avoid this humiliating tribute i should wish it with all my heart but am afraid we must sooner or later submit to it i cannot find it in my heart to wish illsuccess to the two empires if they really have as they are suspected to have the project of driving wholly out of europe the turkish empire because the barbary powers and their hateful piracies would probably come to an end at the same time we wait for orders relative to those states thinking it dangerous saying a word to morocco before we are ready to treat with all there is at this time so intimate a connection between france sweden and holland that i fancy we shall scarcely persuade either of the latter to agree to any supplementary treaties unless the former should set the example which we cannot expect considering the opposition the ministry meets with from the merchants of the seaport towns and even from some sovereign courts the ordinance of  0th august      which moderates the rigor of the letterspatent of october      and admits foreigners to the commerce of the colonies under certain restrictions has excited remonstrances from the merchants of marseilles bordeaux rochelle nantes st maloes and havre de grace and the parliament of bordeaux has remonstrated     and that of bretagne was very near it the marshal de castries is yet unmoved but this opposition will i fear discourage him from going further these remonstrances attack every part of the first article they oppose the free ports or entrepôts they oppose the liberty to strangers to import timber coal even live stock but especially salt beef saltfish rice indian corn vegetables leather tanned or in the hair pitch tar turpentine they are eager for reviving the regulations of      and totally excluding all foreigners from their islands in short i see that french merchants consider their colonies and colonists as english merchants considered us twenty years ago it is true that all have not been equally extravagant some have gone in their remonstrances no farther than against salt beef and salt fish merchants whether french english or dutch are very bad rulers of colonies at a distance and their mistakes if not firmly corrected by their governments will make a serious common cause between americans northern and western the french fisheries in consequence of the extension of their limits by the treaty of peace upon the island of newfoundland and the free communication between the united states and st peters and miquelon have succeeded the last year in a remarkable manner marseilles bordeaux and rochelle and many other places have engaged in the newfoundland fishery with a new ardor and uncommon profit this is one striking advantage arising wholly from their alliance with us and they ought to be too sensible of it to wish so soon to exclude us wholly from their islands the government and more enlightened part of the nation are so and will not give way to the interested clamors of those who see no further than their own private profit nothing is more extravagant than the confident pretensions of french and english merchants that they can supply their own islands it is whimsical but it is true that the mercantile spirit should be the most hostile to the freedom of commerce governments the most disposed to favor it are continually solicited by bodies of merchants from partial views and private interests to restrain and shackle it england it is plain will never treat with us here and it is for congress to determine whether they will accept the proposition     of the court of st james and send a minister there or renounce all thoughts of treating with it upon any thing spain seems equally averse to treating here but if mr gardoqui has arrived who has full powers congress may treat with him at new york the general state of europe is critical but the claims of the emperor are so directly against treaties which interest so essentially all europe that i do not believe he will urge on a war that must embroil all the world and end not at all to his advantage or honor with very great esteem c john adams john jay    march      new york john adams secretary jay to john adams new york    march      dear sir— the inclosed extracts from the journal of congress will inform you of your appointment to go as minister to the court of london and of mr smith being elected secretary of legation  i congratulate you on this event it argues the confidence reposed in you by the united states and i am persuaded will redound to your advantage as well as to your reputation the necessary papers are preparing and mr smith will carry them to you by the next packet with great respect c john jay john adams  0 march      auteuil benjamin franklin thomas jefferson to benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson auteuil  0 march      gentlemen— according to your desire i went early this morning to versailles and finding the count de vergennes unembarrassed with company and only attended by his private   0 secretaries i soon obtained the honor of a conference in which i told him that my colleagues were very sorry that indisposition necessarily prevented their paying their respects to him in person and obliged them to request me alone to wait on him and ask his advice upon a thorny question we had with the barbary powers he asked what it was and i put into his hand all the letters upon the subject in french spanish italian and english all of which he read very attentively and observed that it was obvious what was wanted and what had piqued the emperor of morocco namely—that congress had not written to him nor sent him a consul with the customary presents for that he was the most interested man in the world and the most greedy of money he asked whether we had written to congress and obtained their instructions i answered that we had full powers to treat with morocco algiers tunis tripoli and the rest but that it was impossible for us to go there and that we had not a power of substitution he said then we should write to the emperor i asked if he would do us the favor to convey a letter for us through the french consul he said he could not do this himself because it was not in his department but if we would make an office of it he would communicate it to the marshal de castries and return us his answer i told him that in looking over the treaties between the several christian powers and the barbary states we found that the treaty between the crown of france and algiers of the   th of april      was expired or near expiring and we were desirous of knowing if the question was not indiscreet whether it had been renewed he smiled upon this and said it was true their treaty was upon the point of expiring but he could not tell me whether it were renewed as it was not in his department but if we should insert this inquiry in our office he would endeavor to obtain the marshal de castriess answer i told him that in order to lay before congress all the information we could and to enable them to judge the better what other orders to give us or what other course to take we had obtained authentic information from mr bisdom and mr van der hope concerning the presents annually given by their high mightinesses and that we should be very glad to know if it was not improper what was the annual amount of the presents made by his majesty to each of those states and in what articles     they consisted he said the king never sent them any naval or military stores but he sent them glasses and other things of value but that as it was not in his department he could not give me particular information but that we might put this into our office with the other things i asked if there was not a considerable trade and frequent intercourse between parts of this kingdom and the coast of barbary he said there was from marseilles and the other ports upon the mediterranean but he thought if we had presents to send it would be more convenient to send them from cadiz i then asked the favor of his advice whether in our letter to the emperor of morocco we should leave it to his option to send here a minister to treat with us or to wait until we could write to congress and recommend it to them to send a consul he said he would by no means advise us to invite the emperor to send a minister here to treat with us because we must maintain him here and bear all the expenses of his voyages and journeys which would be much more costly than for congress to send a consul but the count concluded the whole conference by observing that every thing relative to this business was out of his department and that we must state to him in writing all we desired to know or to have done and he would convey it to the minister of the marine and communicate to us his answer and that we might depend upon it that whenever we thought proper to make any office to him it should be carefully attended to he added very particular inquiries concerning the health of dr franklin and mr jefferson which i answered to the best of my knowledge and took my leave with great respect c john adams john jay    march      john adams secretary jay to john adams office of foreign affairs    march      dear sir— i have the honor of transmitting to you herewith inclosed a certified copy of an act of congress of the   st instant instructing you to communicate to mr st saphorin the high sense the united states in congress assembled entertain of the     liberal decision made by his danish majesty on the question proposed to his minister by you respecting the ordination of american candidates for holy orders in the episcopal church commonly called the church of england congress has been pleased to order me to transmit copies of your letter and the other papers on this subject to the executives of the different states and i am persuaded they will receive with pleasure this mark of your attention and of his danish majestys friendly disposition i have the honor to be c john jay john adams   april      auteuil dr price to dr price auteuil   april      sir— some time since i received from dr franklin a copy of the first edition of your observations on the importance of the american revolution and lately a copy of the second i am much obliged to you sir for your kind attention to me and for these valuable presents i think it may be said in praise of the citizens of the united states that they are sincere inquirers after truth in matters of government and commerce at least that there are among them as many in proportion of this liberal character as any other country possesses they cannot therefore but be obliged to you and any other writers capable of throwing light upon these objects who will take the pains to give them advice i am happy to find myself perfectly agreed with you that we should begin by setting conscience free when all men of all religions consistent with morals and property shall enjoy equal liberty property or rather security of property and an equal chance for honors and power and when government shall be considered as having in it nothing more mysterious or divine than other arts or sciences we may expect that improvements will be made in the human character and the state of society but at what an immense distance is that period notwithstanding all that has been written from sidney and locke down to dr price and the abbé de mably all europe still believes sovereignty to be a divine right except a few men of letters     even in holland their sovereignty which resides in more than four thousand persons is all divine but i did not intend to enter into details if you will permit i should be glad to communicate with you concerning these things john adams john adams    april      auteuil john jay to secretary jay auteuil    april      sir— i have written by the late packets for the orders of congress concerning near a million of guilders in the hands of messrs willink  co in amsterdam and requesting the ratification of my last loan and other subjects by the february packet hourly expected i hope to have the honor of letters from you with the pleasure of congress relative to these matters our joint despatches will show all the information we have yet obtained concerning the power of the barbary states and the costliness of their friendship we must proceed slowly and cautiously i often hear the trade of the mediterranean and of the levant slightly spoken of and represented as of small value to the united states i think very differently with an absolute certainty that time will demonstrate me in the right but the rise of insurance on all of our trade is to be added to the full value of the trade we may have in the mediterranean and the levant and what is worse we have the cries of our countrymen in captivity in chains and exposed to many cruelties to consider it is not the loss of property which has induced any nation to become tributary to them but this inhuman practice of enslaving captives france england and holland have avoided stipulating in treaties to pay a tribute but sweden and denmark have not i hope we shall not imitate the example of these last if we are directed to negotiate we shall probably negotiate through the french consul but it will be necessary finally for congress to send consuls to sign the treaties and to make the presents we have collected some information which will be useful to our country respecting these powers i wish we were able to do as much under our commission     to spain that court will not treat here and for us to go to madrid is a dangerous measure we know not how much time the negotiation there may require and if we go and return without success it will be industriously spread by all the diplomatic corps and will hurt the reputation of our country in europe and elate the english beyond measure inconveniences which may be avoided by your conducting the negotiation with mr gardoqui at new york or by congress sending a minister to madrid this i know is much desired by the spanish court and by this court as many symptoms have indicated particularly a conversation between the duke de la vauguyon and me a few days before his departure for madrid a minister at madrid would be useful to us in conducting this business with the barbary powers and is in all respects as far as i can see a desirable measure the expense of maintaining three ministers is the same whether they reside at auteuil passy and paris or at madrid versailles and the hague and i am sure we could not do less separately than we are likely to do together you remember sir that one of the first things mr hartley said to us was to propose in the name of the king his master and his minister mr fox that ministers should be exchanged immediately between congress and st jamess you have received before now the formal proposition from the marquis of carmarthen transmitted to us through the duke of dorset to the same effect the appointment of mr temple as consulgeneral is a still stronger indication of a real wish in the ministry that this measure may be pursued and of a secret consciousness that they shall be obliged to treat in their refusal to treat here they would be justified by all the courts and diplomatic bodies in the world i make no scruple no hesitation to advise that a minister may be sent nor will i be intimidated from giving this advice by any apprehension that i shall be suspected of a design or desire of going to england myself whoever goes will neither find it a lucrative nor a pleasant employment nor will he be envied by me i know that for years if he does his duty he will find no personal pleasure or advantage but the measure of sending a minister to england appears to me the corner stone of the true american system of politics in europe and if it is not done we shall have cause to repent it for a long     time when it will be too late every thing is calculated as it appears to me to involve us in a war with england cries and prejudices are fomented in england and america which have no other tendency but to involve us in a war long before we shall be ready ten or fifteen years hence we shall have nothing to fear from a war with england if they should be mad enough to force us upon it at present it would distress us extremely although it would ruin england my system is a very simple one let us preserve the friendship of france holland and spain if we can and in case of a war between france and england let us preserve our neutrality if possible in order to preserve our friendship with france and holland and spain it will be useful for us to avoid a war with england to avoid a war with england we should take the regular diplomatic steps to negotiate to settle disputes as they rise and to place the intercourse between the two nations upon a certain footing then we may understand one another avoid deceits and misrepresentations it is so much the interest of england that we should be neutral in a future war that i am persuaded cool and candid reasoning with their ministers upon the subject would convince them of it the force of truth is greater even in the minds of politicians than the world in general is aware of england is now mad with the hope of our having a war with spain and even france in consequence of the family compact and of our courting them to become our allies and undertake our defence surely it would not be difficult for an american minister to convince a british one that this is chimerical and that the only thing they ought to expect from america is neutrality the real thing the english have to fear is our joining their enemies against them in a future war she has no alliance to hope from us unless spain should force us into a war and even then we ought not to ask or accept aid from england if we could avoid it unless france from the family compact should join spain this reasoning and this system you see goes upon the supposition that we are independent of france in point of moral and political obligation but if the sentiments of america are otherwise and those principles are general which you and i once heard delivered with great formality and energy namely—that america ought to join france against england in two     future wars one to pay the debt of gratitude already contracted and the other to show ourselves as generous as france had been—i confess myself all wrong and to be so totally ignorant of the rights duties and interests of my country as to be altogether unfit for any share in their public affairs foreign or domestic at any rate our negotiations in this place have not answered the ends proposed by congress and expected by the people of america nor is there now scarcely a possibility that they should i am very happy in my friend mr jefferson and have nothing but my inutility to disgust me with a residence here but i presume congress will not think it expedient to renew the commissions or attempt any longer to carry on negotiations with the rest of the world in this place if they should however i hope they will think of some other gentleman in my place as it is my desire to return home at the expiration of the term of the present commissions with great respect and sincere esteem c john adams john adams    april      auteuil john jay to secretary jay auteuil    april      sir— the letter you did me the honor to write me on the   th of february last containing the ratification of my last loan of two millions of guilders having been properly addressed to me as minister at the hague by a mistake of the postoffice at paris was sent to holland from whence it returned to me last night this loan is long since full as my first loan of five millions of guilders is nearly so i must therefore solicit the further instructions of congress whether i am to open any new loan or not your letter to dr franklin mr jefferson and me of the   th of january has been duly received and answered if i had known a few weeks sooner that congress had resolved to send a minister to london it would have saved you the trouble of a letter upon the subject which you will receive by the packet it has appeared to me for some time to be an important and a necessary measure and although the gentleman who may be sent there whoever he may be will probably find himself     in a thicket of briars from which he will hardly get free without tearing his flesh yet i am persuaded that the appearance of an american minister at the british court will have good effects upon our affairs even in france and spain and the nations in alliance with them as well as in the courts and nations in the opposite scale of the balance but especially upon the british and american nations will it be foreign to the purpose upon this occasion or improper for me to observe that the people in america and their legislatures in the several states should prepare the way for their minister in england to require a faithful execution of treaties by setting the example of a punctual execution on their part if we establish the principle that we have a right to depart from the treaty in one article because they have departed from it in another they will certainly avail themselves of the same principle and probably extend it as much farther as their sense of justice is less and their opinion of their own power however illfounded is greater it cannot i think be too often nor too earnestly recommended to our countrymen to consider the treaty as sacred and to fulfil it in all its parts according to its real spirit and intention in good conscience in that most delicate point of all respecting the refugees i even wish that the people could conquer their natural feelings and suppress their just resentments this i am confident is the best revenge that can be taken and will most effectually disarm even those among them who are most distinguished for their enmity if we have any thing to fear from canada and nova scotia or for our whale fishery it arises and will arise from our own severity to these people and the same observation may be applied to the fur trade and the posts upon the frontier your desire sir to hear from me frequently and to have my poor opinion on the affairs of your department does me great honor and shall be complied with to the utmost of my power but i shall much oftener have occasion for your advice in such affairs as are intrusted to me i think myself extremely happy in common with our countrymen that i have to correspond with a gentleman to whom our foreign affairs are very familiar by long experience who knows where our difficulties and dangers lie and who has proved himself upon all occasions superior to them     i am sorry to learn that the french chargé des àffaires has demanded monsieur longchamps to be delivered up and am the more surprised because i had understood from such sources as i thought authentic that the punishment to which he has been sentenced was satisfactory at court it may not however be amiss for the french government to keep up a claim which may be a standing restraint to their own subjects in all foreign countries but it cannot be doubted that the french ministry know our right to refuse as well as theirs to demand as there is no positive stipulation between the two powers that criminals shall be mutually given up and surely it is no perfect right by the law of nations nor is it a common practice so far from it that it will be difficult to show an example of it where there is no convention  your packet for mr carmichael shall be delivered to the spanish ambassador to go by his courier as you desire with the utmost respect and esteem c john adams baron de thulemeier   mai      la haie john adams baron de thulemeier to john adams la haie   mai      monsieur— je ressens une véritable satisfaction en mettant aujourdhui la dernière main à un ouvrage qui a commencé dêtre entrepris à la haie sous vos auspices et que vous avez favorisé monsieur de votre mieux vous verrez par la lettre cijointe que jai lhonneur de vous adresser en commun avec messieurs vos collègues que le roi na rien laissé à désirer aux états de lamérique il sagit actuellement que vous ayez la bonté de faire mettre au net un exemplaire du traité dont nous sommes convenus jen ferai autant de mon côté quelque puisse être le plaisir que je me permettrais dans une entrevue en renouvelant notre ancienne connoissance je crains cependant que les affaires du roi mattachant à la haie s m ne préfère que léchange se fasse par une voie sûre telle que le paquet des ambassadeurs de l h p     daignez maccorder constamment une place dans votre souvenir et agréez les assurances de lattachement inviolable c de thulemeier john adams   may      auteuil john jay to secretary jay auteuil   may      sir— the day before yesterday i received the letter you did me the honor to write me on the   th of march inclosing a commission instructions and letter of credence to the court of great britain and a duplicate of your letter of february   th with the ratification of the loan in holland the appointment to the court of great britain demands my most grateful acknowledgments to congress and the utmost care and diligence in the execution of it i am happy to see by the resolution of march  th that a minister is to be appointed to succeed me at the hague both because a minister will be necessary there and because that the minister in london will find employment for all his time and should devote himself wholly to the duties of that mission as no letter of recall is as yet arrived to me i am a little perplexed i have been a witness of so much friendship to the united states and have experienced so much kindness to myself in holland that i ought not finally to quit that country without taking leave of their high mightinesses even if established forms had not rendered such a ceremony indispensable there is no time to be lost unnecessarily in executing the instructions of congress but you are very sensible sir of the necessity of taking leave of this court and of the foreign ministers here and of the time which such a formality takes up it will therefore be longer before i can be in london than you may wish perhaps five or six weeks in the mean time colonel smith i hope will arrive with the additional information and i may take such measures as i can to prepare the way before us the duke of dorset has offered me all the service in his power and professes to wish me success it may not be useless for me to see mr harris at the hague the instructions are perfectly agreeable to my own inclinations but it would be my duty to carry them into punctual   0 execution to the utmost of my power if they were not so it is not the first time that a public trust of some importance has been committed to me but i do not know that any ever made a deeper impression upon my spirits or gave me more serious reflections to do my duty to our country and her allies and to reconcile the americans and english upon principles and terms which may give satisfaction to all is no easy task i can promise nothing but industry the prospect of success is far from being encouraging the measure of sending a minister had become indispensable congress will have tried the experiment and done all that in the opinion of the world was incumbent on them and if the english nation perseveres in obstinacy and delusion the united states will be fully informed of it and have it undoubtedly in their power to do themselves justice the resolutions of new york and rhode island the former laying heavier duties upon british ships and merchandises and the latter adopting the impost of five per cent if the public papers inform us truly are symptoms of a spirit rising in america which will either make the english friendly to us or their enmity a blessing the count daranda told me yesterday that your packet to mr carmichael was gone to madrid i forgot to mention in its place your letter of march   th the confidence you express is mutual which i esteem one of the happiest circumstances in my whole life i have not the honor to be personally known to mr smith but he shall receive from me all the regard which becomes the relation between us with sincere esteem i have the honor to be c john adams john adams   may      anteuil john jay to secretary jay anteuil   may      sir— the britons boast that all the prophecies of the loss of the american trade from the independence of the united states have proved false that the experiment has been tried and the contest decided that there was at the peace a competition of the commercial nations of europe for the prize that the superior abilities of the british manufacturers and the greater capitals of their merchants have enabled them to give     our traders better bargains and longer credit than any others in europe that as we love our interests and have small fortunes we must come to them who can furnish us with goods of the best qualities at the cheapest rates and allow us the longest time to pay that britain has monopolized our trade beyond credibility that all the foreign merchants—french dutch and even spanish and portuguese—who had engaged in our trade have failed while few of theirs have suffered while on the one hand it is certain that in all this there is much exaggeration it must be confessed on the other that there is too much truth and the success of your mission to london will depend very much upon the researches of congress and the states into this subject and the measures they may take in consequence of their inquiries you will negotiate for reciprocities in commerce to very little purpose while the british ministers and merchants are certain that they shall enjoy all the profits of our commerce under their own partial regulations it behoves the whole people of america then to turn their attention to this subject it would be presumption in me to discuss the question whether it is necessary that the states should give to congress a plenary power to govern the commerce of the whole confederation i have been too long absent and at too great a distance to be able to form a judgment even to my own satisfaction but i can see numberless mischiefs and inconveniences arising from the want of unity and system in the direction of such complicated interests and every state will find itself necessitated frequently to apply to congress for their interposition either by recommendations or decisions you will give me leave then to inquire whether it may not be proper for congress to call upon the states in such manner as they may judge constitutional to furnish them with authentic accounts of all the exports and imports of every state since the peace of the vessels which have entered or cleared out the nation to which they belong and all other particulars which may be thought proper it should seem impossible that the union can be preserved without some such general repository of the commercial interests and knowledge the information to be derived from it would bring the states to act in concert by showing the necessity of it to all and congress or the states     might take such measures as would insure them justice against the english from such a view they might lay such discouragements on british ships and manufactures and procure such advantages to their own as would be beneficial to our country while it would show the english their own weakness heavy duties might be laid upon articles of luxury wrought in england and imported from thence which would discourage the extravagant use of them among ourselves place other nations upon as good or a better footing than the english and raise a revenue for the public out of that enthusiasm for england which has been and is still so unwise in itself and so hurtful to our country such measures as these would discover to the english that we know our own strength and their weakness and would have probably a greater tendency to influence the ministry by preparing the nation than any reasoning which can be used it is a diplomatic axiom that he always negotiates ill who is not in a condition to make himself feared but measures for this purpose must be taken by the people of america our army will be no terror to them because they think at present they shall never send an army to fight us in our own country and they do not believe that ours will go abroad to attack them they are too proud of their own navy and have too much disregard of ours to dread us upon the sea although experience should have taught them that their commerce might be much endangered by our cruisers so that we have no means to make an impression on them but by commercial regulations which the vulgar may see strike essentially at their interests without injuring our own with great and sincere esteem c john adams john adams   may      auteuil john jay to secretary jay auteuil   may      sir— in executing the instructions of congress of the  th of march last as well as all former orders which concern the court of great britain the ministry will no doubt find my commission and letter of credence sufficient authority but you will see by a letter from the duke of dorset which your ministers here some time since transmitted that the british cabinet have     conceived doubts whether congress have power to treat of commercial matters and whether our states should not separately grant their full powers to a minister i think it may be taken for granted that the states will never think of sending separate ambassadors or of authorizing directly those appointed by congress the idea of thirteen plenipotentiaries meeting together in a congress at every court in europe each with a full power and distinct instructions from his state presents to view such a picture of confusion altercation expense and endless delay as must convince every man of its impracticability neither is there less absurdity in supposing that all the states should unite in the separate election of the same man since there is not never was and never will be a citizen whom each state would separately prefer for conducting the negotiation it is equally inconceivable that each state should separately send a full power and separate instructions to the ministers appointed by congress what a heterogeneous mass of papers full of different objects various views and inconsistent and contradictory orders must such a man pull out of his portefeuille from time to time to regulate his judgment and his conduct he must be accountable too to thirteen different tribunals for his conduct a situation in which no man would ever consent to stand if it is possible which i do not believe that any state should ever wish for such a system i suppose too that the confederation has already settled all these points and that congress alone have authority to treat with foreign powers and to appoint ambassadors and foreign ministers and that the states have separately no power to do either yet it is plain from the duke of dorsets letter that the british cabinet have conceived a different opinion this is to be accounted for only by conjecturing that they have put an erroneous construction on the limitation restriction or exception in the article of our confederation which gives to congress the power of appointing ambassadors and making treaties this limitation is confined to treaties of commerce all others congress have full power to make from this limitation however will probably arise a great deal of difficulty and delay to me if the british ministry wish and seek for delays this will be their pretext but even if they should wish for despatch which is not likely they may have propositions to make which will fall within the limitation and     in such case it will not be in my power to agree with them i can only transmit the proposition to congress who will perhaps transmit them to the states and no man can foresee when the answers will be received so that the business can be brought to a conclusion it is a long time that congress have appeared to be aware of these obstructions in the way of our prosperity but it does not yet appear that the states have been sufficiently attentive to them to remove them it is not to be supposed that congress will ever frame any treaty of commerce with any foreign power which shall be unequal and partial among the states or oppressive upon any one of them and it is very clear from the situation and circumstances of the country that no such treaty can ever be carried into execution or last long if the states should be unwilling to confer upon congress a power to make treaties of commerce unlimited in point of time it should seem that time alone might be a sufficient restriction or the limitation might be to a particular nation as the english for example for a certain time although it must be always remembered that we cannot favor the english with any thing which will not become common to other nations—the french the dutch and swedes at least it is very possible that the cabinet of st james may decline even entering into any conferences at all upon the subject of a treaty of commerce until the powers of congress are enlarged if they should the people of america cannot be too soon informed of it and turn the deliberations in their assemblies to this object in this case the only present hope of your minister will be in obedience to his orders to convince the british ministry of the necessary tendency of their restrictions on our trade to incapacitate our merchants in a certain degree to make remittances to theirs to urge the surrender of the posts the restitution of the negroes the explanation respecting the debts and those other matters pointed out in his instructions in which the right and power and equity are too clear to leave any plausible pretences for delay and to transmit by the earliest opportunities to congress full and true accounts of his proceedings on the  0th of april      congress recommended to the legislatures of the states to vest them for fifteen years with the power to prohibit any merchandises from being imported or     exported in vessels belonging to or navigated by the subjects of any power with whom we shall have no treaties of commerce and to prohibit the subjects of any foreign state unless authorized by treaty from importing into the united states any merchandises which are not the produce or manufacture of the dominions of the sovereign whose subjects they are provided that the assent of nine states be necessary to suppose that the british cabinet intended by the doubts of our powers expressed in the duke of dorsets letter to assist congress in obtaining from the legislatures a compliance with those recommendations would be more charitable than their conduct in any other instance would justify i rather think it was a mere excuse for delay but it ought to operate upon the minds of the people of the states and their assemblies as a powerful incentive to compliance but it may be still a question whether a compliance of all the states will satisfy the british cabinet and they may require an express vote of unlimited authority to congress for a certain term at least from each state to enter into a treaty of commerce with them i have not yet been able to learn with certainty how many and which of the states have agreed to those recommendations of congress it will now be necessary for me to be very attentive to this and to request of you sir the earliest and most minute intelligence of every proceeding of congress and the states relative to it the last year must have been a prosperous period in the united states the high prices of their produce and the low prices of foreign merchandises are a demonstration of it yet our shipping our seamen our carrying trade have been discouraged present ease and even wealth should not be our only object we ought to attend to considerations of strength and defence our situation is different from some of the powers of europe who have neglected their own defence switzerland is situated so that if she should be attacked by one neighbor she would infallibly be defended by two others if attacked by sardinia she would be defended by france and the emperor if by the emperor france and sardinia would support her and if by france the emperor and sardinia would unite to protect her this is so fully known to her and all her neighbors that she     fears nothing and is at no expense holland if attacked by france found a friend in england when attacked by england france supports her when the emperor threatened her she found a friend in france too and she will forever be sure that neither of these three great powers can ever suffer her to fall a prey to any of the others she has relied so much upon this as to neglect her defence to her great regret at present but what are switzerland and holland—small powers limited by nature so that they never can be great—to the united states of america destined beyond a doubt to be the greatest power on earth and that within the life of man this is so well known that instead of being overlooked among the powers like holland and switzerland we shall be more an object of jealousy than any other upon earth all the powers know that it is impossible for any the proudest of them to conquer us and therefore if we should be attacked by any one the others will not be fond of undertaking our defence knowing we can defend ourselves they will leave us to do it and if they assist us at all it will not be until we have done the work and then it will be feebly and only with a view of deriving more benefit and reputation from it than they do us good they will be pleased to see us weakened and our growth a little retarded it behoves the united states then to knit themselves together in the bands of affection and mutual confidence search their own resources to the bottom form their foreign commerce into a system and encourage their own navigation and seamen and to these ends their carrying trade and i am much afraid we shall never be able to do this unless congress are vested with full power under the limitations prescribed of fifteen years and the concurrence of nine states of forming treaties of commerce with foreign powers with great esteem c john adams john adams    may      auteuil m dumas to m dumas auteuil    may      sir— i received yesterday your favor of the  d i have received the orders of congress to go to london according to the article you read in an english newspaper which appears to have been copied from a gazette of new york i have received     too a commission and letters of credence as minister plenipotentiary from the united states of america to the king of great britain and mr william smith formerly aiddecamp of general washington is secretary of legation congress have resolved too that it will be expedient to appoint a minister to their high mightinesses to succeed me at first i concluded to go to the hague and take my leave of their high mightinesses and of the nation with all that respect affection and gratitude which is due from me to them but as i have not received a letter of recall and my successor is not arrived i cannot yet take leave according to the forms i learn that colonel smith was to embark in the packet for falmouth so that he may be expected by this time and i must see him as soon as possible to receive from him some additional papers amongst which may possibly be my letter of recall so that i have concluded to go to london first upon the arrival of my letter of recall or of my successor i shall go over to the hague if possible but if i should chance to be engaged in business for the public which i cannot leave i shall take leave of their high mightinesses and of his most serene highness by a respectful letter in this case however i will not lose the pleasure of a visit to holland and of seeing my friends there but will take a journey there with mrs adams as soon as the public service will admit whether this mission to st jamess is a subject of felicitation or not i know not one thing i know i quit the situation in europe the most to my taste and the most for my health for one that will probably be agreeable to neither i exchange a quiet cheerful mind for an anxious one and a life of ease for a scene of perplexity confusion and fatigue if the public however should derive any benefit from it i shall not regret it dr franklin has leave to return and talks of embarking next month mr jefferson is minister plenipotentiary at versailles in his stead our commissions to negotiate commercial treaties remain in force and we shall continue that business mr jefferson and i as usual we shall concert all affairs by letter and meet together to sign in london or paris as may be convenient or sign the treaties separately if we cannot meet the communication between the hague and london will be short and more frequent and i hope to hear from you often     my family send their respects to yours my son is to take leave of us tomorrow morning and may heavens blessings attend him remember him and his father to all our good friends whom you know very well with great respect john adams john adams    may      auteuil john jay to secretary jay auteuil    may      sir— we meet as you know very well so often with foreign ministers at court and at other places and have so many transient conversations upon subjects in which america is more or less concerned that i scarcely know when it is worth while to transmit them to you and when it is not there is danger on one hand of degenerating into minuteness and on the other of omitting something which may be of consequence the duke of dorset has been in general very civil to dr franklin mr jefferson and me and i believe i may say with exact truth that he has shown us as much respect and attention as he has to the ministers of any power whatever but since the english papers from the gazettes of new york have published my appointment to his court he has been more assiduous if i may use that expression than ever he congratulated me at court very politely on my appointment and said if he could be of any service to me in public or private by writing to mr pitt or lord carmarthen or to any of his private friends it would give him pleasure to do it i thanked his grace in general terms and said it was very possible he might be of service to me and to his own country too as well as mine if his grace and his humble servant thought alike upon certain points he thought then as well as i that it was proper we should compare notes and said he would come out to auteuil and see me on saturday at twelve accordingly he came and repeating his professions of good will and his offers of service i told his lordship i did not mean to give him the trouble of any official representations but as he was willing to enter into private conversation with me upon affairs i might ask what could be the reason why the posts upon our frontiers were not evacuated he said he could not     tell i added there had undoubtedly been full time and it could not but be considered as inconsistent with the treaty that he might well imagine it must be a tender point with us and that jealousies and apprehensions would be very justly kept alive among all our people until the treaty was fulfilled in this particular he seemed wholly at a loss upon this subject and did not incline to compromise himself by hazarding any opinion i then mentioned the debts and said it was certainly for the mutual advantage of both sides that we should come to an explanation upon that article that to let loose the law and perhaps the inflamed passions of some creditors upon the debtors and their estates might ruin the latter without paying the former that if execution was served upon the person of a debtor for want of estate by the ancient as well as modern laws he might in a stated period obtain his liberty upon his oath and then the debt would be lost if execution should be levied upon estate it must be sold at vendue and in the present scarcity of money would not be sold for half its value so that the creditor might lose as well as the debtor that it would surely be better for both countries as well as for creditor and debtor that the latter should be allowed time to turn himself and make the most of his property the duke replied that if the matter should be represented in this light and made appear to be so perhaps the ministry and the creditors might be satisfied but he added interest should be paid i answered that the question concerning interest would not be changed at all by a delay it would be the same whether the principal were paid now or some time hence but i found his lordship here again unwilling to hazard any opinion of his own i then mentioned the negroes and asked why the treaty was so little attended to in this article he asked whether any considerable number had been carried off i answered a very great number and not only against the treaty but confessedly so for that sir guy carleton had at the time of his carrying them away acknowledged it to be against the treaty but alleged that their treaties with the negroes obliged them to do it and therefore they must pay for them i added that this made it still harder upon the american debtors and indeed made it perfectly just for them to withhold payment because   0 that the property of many of them was thus wrongfully withheld from them property by which they might have been enabled to pay at least much of their debts but i found that either his grace had not thought much upon these subjects or that his prudence restrained him from speaking freely and he chose to wave particulars by repeating offers of his service i replied that i did not think it was proper for me to desire his grace to make any official representations because my first address of that kind should be made to lord carmarthen but that noblemen and gentlemen of high rank were often here and in company with his grace and as conversation turned often upon american affairs it might be in his graces power to rectify many mistakes relative to these subjects it would be still more in his power by his private correspondences i could not however obtain any specific promises but he concluded by more general assurances that he sincerely wished that all questions might be settled to mutual satisfaction and entire harmony and affection restored c c a few days after the duke came out a second time to see me at auteuil and brought me some letters to the customhouse at dover which he believed would save me any troublesome visits of those gentry and said he had written to mr pitt to desire him to send an order to the customhouse which would certainly answer the end he then told me i must be in london time enough to pay my respects to the king on the  th of june his birthday that to that end i must carry over from hence a fine new coat ready made for that it was a rule of etiquette there for everybody who went to court to have new clothes upon that day and very rich ones and that my family must be introduced to the queen i told him i was sorry to hear that but that i hoped it was not indispensable for that as at the court of versailles the families of ambassadors only were required to be presented and ministers plenipotentiary and envoys had their option my family had chosen to avoid it here for many reasons he said it was true that here the etiquette required only the presentation of ambassadresses but in england it was otherwise and the ladies and daughters of all ministers must be presented to the queen i hope sir you will not think this an immaterial or a trifling conversation when you consider that the single circumstance of     presenting a family to court will make a difference of several hundred pounds sterling in my inevitable annual expenses this is not the first serious lecture that i have had upon the subjects of etiquette and even dress i have formerly related to you in conversation another much more grave which i had five years ago from the count de vergennes i believe i have also repeated to you similar exhortations made to me even by the best patriots in holland there is a certain appearance in proportion to rank which all the courts of europe make a point of exacting from everybody who is presented to them i need not say to you sir because you know it perfectly well that american ministers have never yet been able to make this appearance at any court they are now less able to do it than ever i lament this necessity of consuming the labor of my fellowcitizens upon such objects as much as any man living but i am sure that the debasing your ministers so much below their rank will one day have consequences of much more importance to the husbandman artisan and even laborer with the most cordial esteem c john adams john adams    may      london thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson london    may      dear sir— i found that either the duke of dorsets letter to the premier had produced an order at dover or that his graces letter to the customhouse office had had as good an effect for i was allowed to pass without molestation and indeed i received marks of particular respect we arrived yesterday in the afternoon and as fortune would have it colonel smith arrived the night before we soon met i wrote a card to the marquis of carmarthen at nine at night acquainting his lordship of my arrival and desiring an hour to wait on him this morning i had an answer that his lordship would be glad to see me at one at his house or at four at his office as i chose i replied that i would have the honor to wait on him at one colonel smith went with me we were admitted in an instant and politely received i laid before him my commission and left him a copy colonel smith did the same with his i consulted his lordship about the etiquette of     my letter of credence and he gave me the same answers as the comte de vergennes gave you his lordship then said that on wednesday next after the levee i should be presented to his majesty in his closet and there deliver my letter of credence and that on the next leveeday colonel smith would be presented this he said was according to usage i have since seen the dutch minister who inquired of every particular step by step and then said i was received precisely upon the same footing with all the other ministers i learned from the dutch minister too another particular which gave me pleasure namely—that the usage here is directly contrary to that in holland and france here the new minister receives the first visit from all the foreign ministers whereas in france and holland the new minister makes the first visit to all the foreign ministers and notifies formally to them his reception this saves me from an embarrassment and we shall now see who will and who will not we shall see what will be done by imperial ministers c with the most cordial esteem c john adams john adams  0 may      london john jay to secretary jay london  0 may      dear sir— i have redeemed a moment from a multitude of avocations at this critical time to acknowledge the receipt by colonel smith of your letters of the   st of march with the resolutions of congress inclosed of the   st of march as m de st saphorin is many months ago recalled from the hague i shall make inquiry after him and if i cannot find where he is i shall communicate a copy of the resolution to the danish minister here by whom it will be transmitted to his court which i suppose will be an execution of my instructions as near the spirit of them as it is now practicable the liberal decision of his danish majesty respecting the ordination of american candidates for holy orders in the episcopal church called the church of england as soon as it was known in england produced a more liberal spirit and decision here than had prevailed before so that i hope that respectable body of our fellowcitizens     who are interested in it have derived a benefit from it i am much obliged to congress for this instance of their approbation and for the honor they have done me in transmitting an account of it to the executives of the states  i have received too your letter of   th of april      with the resolve of congress of   th of february      empowering your ministers to apply a sum not exceeding eighty thousand dollars to the use of treating with morocco c but i have heard nothing of captain lamb or the papers by him what my colleagues will judge proper to do i cannot say but the advice of the french court was conformable to the opinion of us all—that it will be indispensable for congress to send a consul with full powers i received at auteuil my commission instructions and letter of credence to the court of great britain and have now received by colonel smith the papers sent by him i received at auteuil the ratification of the last loan in holland which i transmitted immediately to amsterdam where it has been received registered and communicated to the lenders of the money and has given them satisfaction since which i have received from you sir duplicate and triplicate of the same ratification the cipher is received and shall be attended to your ministers have written monthly an account of their proceedings not one packet has been missed but when i left auteuil we had no certain evidence that any one of our letters had been received we supposed that this was because congress had not completed their instructions upon any of them but i must beg the favor of you sir barely to mention the receipt of my letters and their dates although you may not be prepared to answer them without this one loses the chain of correspondence i have been visited by some gentlemen who i suppose had seen the ministers and learned from them what to say to me they said that the ministry and the king considered the appointment of a minister as a proof of a conciliating disposition that it was a relief to them from an anxiety c and that they were fully determined to receive me in all respects like all the other foreign ministers this i believe is     true but we must be cautious what consequences we draw from it it by no means follows that they are determined to do what their honor and their public faith oblige them to do according to our ideas of their obligations it by no means follows that they will surrender the posts restore the negroes relieve the debtors or make any equitable treaty of commerce i hope they will do all these things but i can ascertain nothing until my character is acknowledged by a public reception and audience of his majesty i have made my visits to his ministers and have had time to enter into a candid discussion of these questions you shall be punctually informed from step to step with great esteem c john adams p s this morning sir clement cottrell dormer master of the ceremonies called upon me to inform me that he was ordered to attend me to court on wednesday as he did on all foreign ministers at their first presentation to show them the way through the apartments c john adams   june      westminster john jay to secretary jay bath hotel westminster   june      dear sir— in my letter of the   th ultimo i inclosed copies of the letters which had passed between the secretary of state and myself wherein this day was fixed upon for my introduction to his majesty agreeable to that arrangement the master of ceremonies waited on me at one and accompanied me to the secretarys office from whence lord carmarthen accompanied me to the palace i was in a very short time introduced to the kings closet where with the usual ceremony i presented my letter of credence to his majesty and after a few minutes conversation retired i have only time to observe sir that i was introduced with every necessary formality and received with some marks of attention the door being now opened i may perhaps soon have it in my power to form some opinion respecting the general disposition     of the king and his ministers relative to the objects of my mission of which you may expect the earliest communication i am c john adams john adams   june      westminster john jay to secretary jay bath hotel westminster   june      dear sir— during my interview with the marquis of carmarthen he told me that it was customary for every foreign minister at his first presentation to the king to make his majesty some compliments conformable to the spirit of his letter of credence and when sir clement cottrell dormer the master of the ceremonies came to inform me that he should accompany me to the secretary of state and to court he said that every foreign minister whom he had attended to the queen had always made a harangue to her majesty and he understood though he had not been present that they always harangued the king on tuesday evening the baron de lynden called upon me and said he came from the baron de nolken and they had been conversing upon the singular situation i was in and they agreed in opinion that it was indispensable that i should make a speech and that that speech should be as complimentary as possible all this was conformable to the advice lately given by the count de vergennes to mr jefferson so that finding it was a custom established at both these great courts and that this court and the foreign ministers expected it i thought i could not avoid it although my first thought and inclination had been to deliver my credentials silently and retire at one on wednesday the master of ceremonies called at my house and went with me to the secretary of states office in cleveland row where the marquis of carmarthen received me and introduced me to his under secretary mr fraser who has been as his lordship told me uninterruptedly in that office through all the changes in administration for thirty years having first been appointed by the earl of holderness after a short conversation upon the subject of importing my effects from holland and france free of duty which mr fraser     himself introduced lord carmarthen invited me to go with him in his coach to court when we arrived in the antechamber the æil de bæuf of st jamess the master of the ceremonies met me and attended me while the secretary of state went to take the commands of the king while i stood in this place where it seems all ministers stand upon such occasions always attended by the master of ceremonies the room very full of ministers of state lords and bishops and all sorts of courtiers as well as the next room which is the kings bedchamber you may well suppose i was the focus of all eyes i was relieved however from the embarrassment of it by the swedish and dutch ministers who came to me and entertained me in a very agreeable conversation during the whole time some other gentlemen whom i had seen before came to make their compliments too until the marquis of carmarthen returned and desired me to go with him to his majesty i went with his lordship through the levee room into the kings closet the door was shut and i was left with his majesty and the secretary of state alone i made the three reverences—one at the door another about half way and a third before the presence—according to the usage established at this and all the northern courts of europe and then addressed myself to his majesty in the following words— sir—the united states of america have appointed me their minister plenipotentiary to your majesty and have directed me to deliver to your majesty this letter which contains the evidence of it it is in obedience to their express commands that i have the honor to assure your majesty of their unanimous disposition and desire to cultivate the most friendly and liberal intercourse between your majestys subjects and their citizens and of their best wishes for your majestys health and happiness and for that of your royal family the appointment of a minister from the united states to your majestys court will form an epoch in the history of england and of america i think myself more fortunate than all my fellowcitizens in having the distinguished honor to be the first to stand in your majestys royal presence in a diplomatic character and i shall esteem myself the happiest of men if i can be instrumental in recommending my country more and more to your majestys royal benevolence     and of restoring an entire esteem confidence and affection or in better words the old good nature and the old good humor between people who though separated by an ocean and under different governments have the same language a similar religion and kindred blood i beg your majestys permission to add that although i have some time before been intrusted by my country it was never in my whole life in a manner so agreeable to myself the king listened to every word i said with dignity but with an apparent emotion whether it was the nature of the interview or whether it was my visible agitation for i felt more than i did or could express that touched him i cannot say but he was much affected and answered me with more tremor than i had spoken with and said— sir—the circumstances of this audience are so extraordinary the language you have now held is so extremely proper and the feelings you have discovered so justly adapted to the occasion that i must say that i not only receive with pleasure the assurance of the friendly dispositions of the united states but that i am very glad the choice has fallen upon you to be their minister i wish you sir to believe and that it may be understood in america that i have done nothing in the late contest but what i thought myself indispensably bound to do by the duty which i owed to my people i will be very frank with you i was the last to consent to the separation but the separation having been made and having become inevitable i have always said as i say now that i would be the first to meet the friendship of the united states as an independent power the moment i see such sentiments and language as yours prevail and a disposition to give to this country the preference that moment i shall say let the circumstances of language religion and blood have their natural and full effect i dare not say that these were the kings precise words and it is even possible that i may have in some particular mistaken his meaning for although his pronunciation is as distinct as i ever heard he hesitated some time between his periods and between the members of the same period he was indeed     much affected and i confess i was not less so and therefore i cannot be certain that i was so cool and attentive heard so clearly and understood so perfectly as to be confident of all his words or sense and i think that all which he said to me should at present be kept secret in america unless his majesty or his secretary of state who alone was present should judge proper to report it this i do say that the foregoing is his majestys meaning as i then understood it and his own words as nearly as i can recollect them the king then asked me whether i came last from france and upon my answering in the affirmative he put on an air of familiarity and smiling or rather laughing said there is an opinion among some people that you are not the most attached of all your countrymen to the manners of france i was surprised at this because i thought it an indiscretion and a departure from the dignity i was a little embarrassed but determined not to deny the truth on one hand nor leave him to infer from it any attachment to england on the other i threw off as much gravity as i could and assumed an air of gayety and a tone of decision as far as was decent and said that opinion sir is not mistaken i must avow to your majesty i have no attachment but to my own country the king replied as quick as lightning an honest man will never have any other the king then said a word or two to the secretary of state which being between them i did not hear and then turned round and bowed to me as is customary with all kings and princes when they give the signal to retire i retreated stepping backward as is the etiquette and making my last reverence at the door of the chamber i went my way the master of the ceremonies joined me the moment of my coming out of the kings closet and accompanied me through the apartments down to my carriage several stages of servants gentlemenporters and underporters roaring out like thunder as i went along mr adamss servants mr adamss carriage c i have been thus minute as it may be useful to others hereafter to know the conversation with the king congress will form their own judgment of i may expect from it a residence less painful than i once expected as so marked an attention from the king will silence many grumblers but we can infer nothing from all this concerning the success of my mission     there are a train of other ceremonies yet to go through in presentations to the queen and visits to and from ministers and ambassadors which will take up much time and interrupt me in my endeavors to obtain all that i have at heart—the objects of my instructions it is thus the essence of things is lost in ceremony in every country of europe we must submit to what we cannot alter patience is the only remedy with great respect c john adams john adams   june      westminster john jay to secretary jay bath hotel westminster   june      dear sir— colonel smith on the  d of this month informed me that colonel forrest had been with him in behalf of two gentlemen of glasgow—mr colquhoun provost of that city and mr alexander brown—who were deputed by the merchants of that place who had debts in america to confer with the creditors in london concerning an application to ministry and parliament to obtain their interposition for the recovery of their claims but that having heard of the appointment of a minister to this court and of my arrival they were desirous of seeing me i desired colonel smith to inform them that i should be glad to see them the next morning accordingly on the  th they came and mr colquhoun informed me of his errand and said he was very glad that congress had appointed a minister because he hoped that the article of debts would now be accommodated to mutual satisfaction without any application on their part and he should be glad to return to scotland without making any provided he could be furnished with a reasonable account to give of himself to his constituents i told him i was obliged to him for having given me an opportunity to see him that the merchants of glasgow must be sensible we were but just emerged from an impoverishing war in which there had been a great interruption of agriculture and commerce and a still greater destruction of property which rendered it difficult for any debtor and impossible for many to discharge their debts forthwith that i was persuaded there was a general disposition to discharge the debts as fast as it could   0 be done but that time and patience were as much for the interest of the creditors as the debtors that if there had been any interposition of the governments in america it had been as i presumed solely with a view of giving time to negotiate an explication of the article of the treaty and to prevent the imprudence of hasty creditors from hurting themselves as well as the debtors to no good end that one principal object of my mission was to negotiate this affair with the minister and although i was not authorized by the debtors and could not be impowered by congress to treat with the merchants of london and glasgow they might depend upon my devoting a full proportion of my time to this subject with the ministry and should be always ready to hear any proposals explanations or arguments even from individuals and to transmit them to congress if they were such as merited attention that it was thought very hard and unreasonable in america that interest should be insisted on during the war and that if the creditors could be brought to consent to relinquish it and that a reasonable time should be allowed i thought the whole might be arranged to mutual benefit and satisfaction that creditors should consider that there was a great demand for clothing stock and utensils to repair the waste of war and to put estates into a condition to produce and to set commerce in motion that this together with the zeal to pay as much of their debts as possible had already raised the interest of money even to an alarming height that it must be better to allow the debtor time to turn himself that he might pay all rather than press him suddenly so that he might not be able to pay more than a part that if property were seized upon now it might not produce half its value whereas left in the hands of the present possessor it would enable him to employ it to such advantage as to pay his debts in time mr colquhoun made no particular reply to the subject of interest but said the merchants of glasgow were fully sensible of the circumstances i had mentioned and were very willing to wait and they were desirous of entering into some agreement that the debts should be paid in five years by instalments one fifth in a year but they were alarmed at the spirit of migration into the wilderness of america they thought it wrong to be restrained from arresting the person or attaching property of     a debtor whom they saw about to remove to kentucky and other places where they could never be come at i told him that this was new to me but that kentucky and all other new settlements were under the laws and jurisdiction of some state as i supposed and therefore the debtor and his property would be within the reach of the creditor as much as if he remained in the cities and old settlements and as those removals commonly advanced the fortune of the emigrant it might be rather a benefit to his creditors by increasing the ability to pay i subjoined that there were two things which fell very hard upon the debtors in the states of virginia and new york for he had mentioned these particularly one was the great number of negroes which had been carried away if these negroes had been restored according to the treaty they would have been at work to earn money to pay their masters debts but the carrying them off was a double loss to the owner and the holding possession of the posts upon the frontiers had kept out of our hands a valuable trade which would have gone a great way to enable us to pay our debts he said he thought it a very foolish thing to hold possession of the posts c that he would venture to return to scotland and would take no more measures about applying to parliament which he was sensible must excite a clamor and he hoped the merchants of glasgow would be contented to wait he seemed to be well pleased with the conversation and took his leave in good humor so that i think it very lucky that so noisy a business as a petition to parliament should be so easily diverted at this critical moment but i am unfortunate in another respect as my lord carmarthen is ill of a fever so that i shall not i fear be able to commence conferences with him upon business so soon as hoped no time shall be lost by me with great and sincere esteem c john adams m dumas   juin      la haie john adams m dumas to john adams la haie

plus à propos décrire encore plus aisée permettez c c w f dumas john adams  0 june      westminster john jay to secretary jay bath hotel westminster  0 june      sir— yesterday the  th of the month i was presented to the queen by my lord ailesbury her lordchamberlain having been attended to his lordship and introduced to him by the master of the ceremonies the queen was attended by her ladies and i made my compliments to her majesty in the following words— madam—among the many circumstances which have rendered my mission to his majesty desirable to me i have ever considered it as a principal one that i should have an opportunity of making my court to a great queen whose royal virtues and talents have ever been acknowledged and admired in america as well as in all the nations of europe as an example to princesses and the glory of her sex permit me madam to recommend to your majestys royal goodness a rising empire and an infant virgin world another europe madam is rising in america to a philosophical mind like your majestys there cannot be a more pleasing contemplation than the prospect of doubling the human species and augmenting at the same time their prosperity and happiness it will in future ages be the glory of these kingdoms to have peopled that country and to have sown there those seeds of science of liberty of virtue and permit me madam to add of piety which alone constitute the prosperity of nations and the happiness of the human race after venturing upon such high insinuations to your majesty it seems to be descending too far to ask as i do your majestys royal indulgence to a person who is indeed unqualified for courts and who owes his elevation to this distinguished honor of standing before your majesty not to any circumstances of illustrious birth fortune or abilities but merely to an ardent devotion to     his native country and some little industry and perseverance in her service the queen answered me in these words—i thank you sir for your civilities to me and my family and am glad to see you in this country the queen then asked me if i had provided myself with a house i answered i have agreed for one madam this morning she then made her courtesy and i made my reverence and retired into the drawingroom where the king queen princess royal and the younger princess her sister all spoke to me very obligingly i attended until the drawingroom was over and then returned home it has been necessary in order to guard against false reports and malicious fictions to reduce to writing what was said in my audiences of the king and queen and it is the custom of all ministers to transmit these compliments to their courts i transmit them to you in cipher that they may be exposed to as little criticism as possible as the court knew very well that the eyes of all nations were fixed upon these audiences it may be fairly concluded from them that it is the intention of the royal family and of ministers to treat america like other foreign powers but our inferences can go no farther we cannot infer from this that they will relax their navigation act for us any more than for france we are sure of one thing that a navigation act is in our power as well as in theirs and that ours will be more hurtful to them than theirs to us in short it is scarcely possible to calculate to what a height of naval power a navigation act would raise the united states in a few years with great esteem c john adams john adams  0 june      london m fagel to m fagel london  0 june      sir— i have the honor to inform you that i have received from congress a letter of credence to his britannic majesty as minister plenipotentiary of the united states of america and     that i have had the honor of presenting that letter to his majesty and of being received in that character i have received too authentic information that congress have resolved that it is expedient to appoint a minister to succeed me at the hague but i have not received my letter of recall nor news of the actual appointment of a successor this sir is the only reason why i did not and could not come to the hague and take a formal leave of their high mightinesses and of his most serene highness as i wished it is still my intention to come or to take leave by a respectful letter whenever my letter of recall shall arrive or a successor my being appointed to other service upon this occasion is no new thing i was last august received at the court of versailles as minister plenipotentiary from the united states of america to his most christian majesty which was never considered any more than intended as any failure of respect to the republic for myself and for my country i know that respect esteem and affection to the republic is engraven on all our hearts i beg then the favor of your advice if you think it proper and necessary for me to take any farther steps upon this occasion before my letter of recall or my successor shall arrive with great esteem c john adams m fagel    juin      la haie john adams m fagel to john adams la haie    juin      monsieur— je viens de recevoir la lettre dont vous mavez honoré le  0 de ce mois je considère comme une marque particulière de lestime que vos merites vous ont acquis que le congrès vous a nommé pour leur ministre plénipotentiaire auprès de sa majesté britannique et je suis fâché que nous perdons par là la résidence dune personne qui sest rendu très agréable chez nous et qui par ses manières honnêtes se seroit rendu de plus en plus estimable il faut espérer que celui qui vous succedera aura les mêmes bonnes qualités je ne saurois vous déguiser quon a fait quelques réflexions ici sur ce que vous aviez remis vos lettres de créance au roi dangleterre avant que davoir présenté vos lettres de rappel

vous recevrez vos lettres de rappel ce ne pourra être que très agréable à leurs hautes puissances que vous les présentiez en personne si les circonstances de vos affaires ne le permettent point il suffira de le faire par un mémoire adressé aux étatsgénéraux vous pouvez être persuadé monsieur que la réponse que leurs h p y feront ne servira qua témoigner leur égard pour le congrès et leur désir de cimenter de plus en plus lunion et la bonne intelligence dans laquelle elles ont le bonheur de vivre avec eux jai lhonneur dêtre c h fagel john adams    june      westminster john jay to secretary jay westminster    june      sir— at three oclock according to appointment i went to the secretary of states office in cleveland row st jamess and was immediately received by the marquis of carmarthen his lordship began the conversation by saying that he could answer for himself and he believed for the rest of the kings servants that they were sincerely desirous of cultivating the most cordial friendship with america and of doing every thing in their power for dissipating every little animosity that might remain among individuals in return i told his lordship that i was glad to hear such assurances from him and the other ministers that i was very confident that the people of the united states had correspondent dispositions and that i had sanguine hopes that in a short time all remaining difficulties would be amicably settled that to this end i was charged by congress with several particulars which had hitherto given some uneasiness but which upon a candid discussion might be easily accommodated as i hoped to mutual satisfaction that there were six principal points to be discussed with his lordship the first and perhaps the most pressing was the posts and territories within the limits of the united states which were still held by british garrisons the exportation of negroes and other american property which by the seventh article of the treaty of peace was not to be exported the tendency of the restrictions     on our trade to incapacitate our merchants to make remittances to theirs the losses of our merchants as well as theirs if we were uneasonably pressed for the payment of debts contracted before the war the construction of the armistice of  0th january      and the decision of questions of captures made after the expiration of the month and the liquidation of the charges of prisoners of war these were the general heads the great question of the commerce between the countries involving so many interests and those of so important and so permanent a nature might be attended with the most difficulties and require the longest time to be adjusted but all the others appeared to be so clear and easy that i hoped they might soon be finished that however having barely opened to his lordship the principal matters of negotiation i should not enlarge upon all of them at present that the debts seemed to be a leading point because they were intimately connected with all the others the withholding the posts the exportation of so many negroes the restrictions on our trade the misconstruction of the armistice and the delay of liquidating the charges of prisoners had all contributed very much to obstruct our merchants in their honest exertions to discharge their debts to the merchants of great britain that it could not be unknown to his lordship that the withholding the posts had withheld from our merchants a very profitable fur trade which we justly considered as our right that the furs which would have been obtained if the posts had been in our hands would have come to england in payment of debts to the amount probably of several hundred thousand pounds and his lordship must be sensible that one hundred thousand pounds a year more would have gone a great way towards contenting the creditors of this country that it was impossible to say what a difference had been made by carrying away the negroes which belonged chiefly to the southern states and if the treaty had been observed would have been at work on their masters plantations so that not only their original value but their labor and the profit upon their labor had been lost all of which might and ought to have been applied to the payment of debts that it was well known that a number of valuable vessels had been taken upon the coast of america after the expiration of the month and as yet withheld from the owners who were   0 all probably debtors which had incapacitated them so far to pay that there was supposed to be a large balance in our favor in the account of the charges of prisoners which being withheld operated still to disable us on that account to do as we desired to do that from all that i might be supposed to know of the character of the people of the united states and from all the intelligence i could gather from all parts of them i was persuaded that nothing lay with greater weight upon their minds than the payment of their debts that they thought their moral characters and their reputations as men as well as their credit as merchants concerned in it that their zeal to make remittances had been such as to raise the interest of money to double its usual standard to advance the price of bills of exchange to eight or ten per cent above par and to raise even the prices of the produce of the country to almost double its usual standard that his lordship well knew we had no other mines of gold and silver than our lands and seas that large sums of the circulating cash we had had been remitted to england in specie and as much produce as could be purchased at almost any rate but that this produce lay in magazines in london because it would not fetch the price that was given for it in america that the people of america were nineteen twentieths of them farmers that these had sold their produce dearer and purchased the manufactures of europe cheaper since the peace than ever but that the situation of the merchants both in america and in england had been and continued to be very distressing no political arrangements having been made they had all expected that the trade would return to its old channels and nearly under the same regulations but they had been disappointed british merchants had made large advances and american merchants contracted large debts both depending upon remittances in the usual articles and upon the old terms but both had found themselves disappointed and it was much to be feared that the consequence would be numerous failures that the cash and bills had been chiefly remitted to the great loss and damage to the country that remittances could not be made as heretofore by reason of obstructions restrictions and imposts laid by great britain on our exports to great britain that neither rice tobacco pitch tar turpentine ships oil nor other articles the great sources of     remittances formerly could now be sent as heretofore and the trade of the west indies formerly a vast source of remittance was now obstructed that under all these circumstances if the debtor should be immediately pressed by his british creditor it would be a certain loss to both that it was apprehended among a number of creditors there might be some perhaps many influenced by strong passions by keen avidity or by personal resentment who might rashly make use of the law to the ruin of the debtor without being able however to recover much of his debt here his lordship interrupted me and said i have seen one remarkable instance of the violence and unreasonableness of private resentment when mr chase was here from maryland in one of the trustees of the maryland stock mr chase produced from the legislature of maryland authority to make full compensation to a relation of that trustee for an estate that had been confiscated but he would not accept it though i told him he would not be able to prevent the claim of maryland but would probably hurt his own interest or that of his relations i told his lordship i had yesterday received a letter from mr paca the governor of maryland relative to the claim of that state and should be glad to do them any service with his lordship or elsewhere respecting that affair that if his lordship gave their full weight to all these considerations he must see the motives and the necessity of restraining the impetuosity of creditors his lordship then read me from a late petition to him from the merchants an account of a bill lately brought into the assembly of virginia for paying the debts by instalments which he understood had been lost by a sudden storm or frost the merchants complained of the cutting off the interest during the war for the long term of seven years and of the restraint from preventing the alienation of property or removal of debtors into the wilderness his lordship heard me very attentively and said that he hoped we should be able with patience and time to adjust all these things that we should probably meet with many rubs in our way that passion and private interest would sometimes be in our way on both sides but while the ministers on both sides could keep right he should think we might succeed for his part he was for attending to every consideration and giving it     its just weight and he desired me to give him in writing something to begin upon he thought the affair of the posts the most pressing and wished i would begin with that i told his lordship that i would let him know between him and me that i had instructions to require the evacuation of the posts and surrender of all our territory but i wished to conduct the business with all the delicacy that was possible and therefore i wished rather to inquire of his lordship what were the intentions of his majestys ministers and whether they had already expedited orders for the evacuation of the posts c his lordship said i must give him my inquiries in writing that he might have a ground for making those inquiries himself as it was an affair in another department i agreed accordingly to make an office of it i shall at first confine myself to decent inquiries concerning the orders given or to be given and if i receive positive assurances that explicit orders are gone to the governor and commanderinchief in canada to evacuate all the posts and territories i shall content myself to wait but if i do not obtain such explicit assurances i shall think it my duty to present a memorial with a decent but firm requisition i shall transmit to you sir every step of my progress but i find it very tedious and fear you will find it more so to transmit particular circumstances in detail when one looks over again a letter in which he has attempted it he finds a multitude of things omitted or but half represented with great esteem c john adams p s i forgot one circumstance of some consequence his lordship said he had seen in the gazettes some proceedings at boston which he was very sorry to see i answered that i had seen them in the same gazettes as i supposed and had no more authentic account of them that i had no authority to say any thing officially about them but as an individual i might say that the observations i just had the honor to make to his lordship concerning the state of the commerce between the two countries would be sufficient to explain to his lordship the motives to those proceedings and to convince his lordship of the probability of such sentiments and proceedings becoming general throughout the united states and alienating the commerce     of that country from this either by increasing manufactures in america or opening new channels of commerce with other countries which might easily be done unless some arrangements were made which might facilitate remittances it was so obviously the true policy of this country to facilitate remittances from america and to encourage every thing we could send as the americans think that when they find remittances discouraged impeded and even prohibited it was natural to expect they would be alarmed and begin to look out for other resources that my fellowcitizens were very confident they had the power in their own hands to do themselves justice as soon as they should find it denied them here but i hoped the difficulties would all be removed here the whole conference was conducted with perfect good humor and on the part of his lordship with perfect politeness j a john adams    june      westminster john jay to secretary jay bath hotel westminster    june      dear sir— by the ninth article of the confederation the united states in congress assembled have the sole and exclusive right and power of entering into treaties and alliances provided that no treaty of commerce shall be made whereby the legislative power of the respective states shall be restrained from imposing such imposts and duties on foreigners as their own people are subjected to or from prohibiting the exportation or importation of any species of goods or commodities whatsoever i have ventured sir in some former letters to you notwithstanding the delicacy of tampering with the confederation to suggest to your consideration whether it may not be necessary for the states to reconsider this proviso and give to congress unlimited authority to enter into treaties of commerce with foreign powers at least for a limited term of years i have also inquired whether it might not be necessary for the states to confer upon congress authority to regulate the external commerce of all the members of the confederation for a like term of years if the states should hesitate at this i am persuaded they     would readily comply with recommendations of congress to this effect for example if congress should recommend to the legislatures of the states to lay duties heavy duties upon all british vessels entering into or clearing out of their ports especially upon all vessels coming from or bound to the west india islands nova scotia canada or newfoundland and upon all merchandises imported from or exported to any part of the british dominions i can scarcely doubt that every legislature would immediately comply and by this means our own navigation would be encouraged and the british discouraged to such a degree as to compel the british government to enter into an equitable treaty nay i cannot doubt the readiness of the states to comply with a recommendation of congress wholly to prohibit british vessels and merchandises although i have been received here and continue to be treated with all the distinction which is due to the rank and title you have given me there is nevertheless a reserve which convinces me that we shall have no treaty of commerce until this nation is made to feel the necessity of it i am every day astonished at the ignorance of all ranks of people of the relation between this country and ours cui bono they cry to what end a treaty of commerce when we are sure of as much american trade as we have occasion for without it the experiment has been tried and the americans have found that they cannot supply themselves elsewhere there must be quīd pro quo and what have the united states to give in exchange for the liberty of going in their own ships to our sugar colonies and our colonies upon the continent these smart reasoners are answered the americans allow britons to come in their own vessels to all their ports in the united states and this is more than a quid for your quo this is the true reciprocity and while we allow you this liberty we have a right to demand it in return but replies the briton you cannot avoid this you have no government you cannot agree to prohibit our ships and goods or to lay duties on them then says the american you give up the argument of reciprocity you confess that you are not willing to allow us a quid for your quo and that you are disposed to take advantage of our supposed disunion to get unequal benefits from us but you will find yourselves disappointed in this disunion that you build so much upon nothing but     too much good nature to you and too high an opinion of your wisdom has prevented the states hitherto from uniting in a reciprocal discouragement of your ships and goods but when the americans find themselves deceived you will soon see them too much united for your purposes such have been the dialogues in conversation for a year or two and these ignorant sophisms of the britons will never be confuted to any effect until vigorous measures are taken by all the states in concert whatever measures are taken i should recommend them to be taken upon this express proviso to continue in force only until things shall be otherwise settled by a treaty of commerce i receive sometimes unexpected visits from persons who i suppose are sent on purpose to say things to me which they wish no doubt to have transmitted to you since the appearance of the resolutions of the merchants traders and mechanics of boston i have several times fallen into company with persons whose connections i knew and who have assumed very grave faces and inquired about the disturbances at boston as they call them and given very sage hints of their fears that those proceedings would obstruct my success a few days since my servant announced lord hood would be glad to see me if i was at leisure i desired his lordship might walk up i was surprised that among so many visits of ceremony his lordship should not be content with leaving his card but in the year      i had appeared before him then commodore hood in a special court of admiralty for the trial of four sailors for killing lieutenant panton in defending themselves from his pressgang his lordship took advantage of this very transient acquaintance of seventeen years standing to make me a friendly visit he soon began a conversation about the boston proceedings it is not necessary to repeat what was said as it was of no consequence for you to know excepting that his lordship was very sorry to see the account of those proceedings was very much afraid they would obstruct the return of friendship and prove a bar to what he wished to see—a good treaty of commerce i told his lordship that those proceedings were prefaced with whereas there is no treaty of commerce and as i understood them they were not to be in force any longer than there should be no treaty of commerce his lordship concluded     by saying that the sooner such a treaty was made the better i had no doubt then and have been confirmed by others since in the opinion that his lordship did not come of his own head all parties are upon the reserve respecting american affairs they are afraid of each other and it is my clear opinion that it is congress and the states and they alone who can enable me to do any thing effectual i may reason till i die to no purpose it is unanimity in america in measures which shall confute the british sophisms and make them feel which will ever produce a fair treaty of commerce with great esteem c john adams john adams    july      to the marquis of carmarthen grosvenor square    july      my lord— the twentysecond article of the preliminary treaty of peace between great britain and france signed on the  0th of january      is in these words namely—in order to prevent all causes of complaint and dispute which may arise on account of prizes that may be taken at sea after the signing of these preliminary articles it is reciprocally agreed that the vessels and effects which may be taken in the channel and in the north seas after the space of twelve days to be computed from the ratification of those preliminary articles shall be restored on each side that the term shall be one month from the channel and the north seas as far as the canary islands inclusively whether in the ocean or in the mediterranean five months from the said canary islands as far as the said equinoctial line or equator and lastly five months in all other parts of the world without any exception or any other distinction more particular of time and place in the preliminary articles of peace between great britain and spain a cessation of hostilities was stipulated in the same manner on the same  0th of january it was agreed between the minister plenipotentiary of his britannic majesty on the one part and the ministers plenipotentiary of the united states of america on the other that the subjects citizens and possessions     of both powers should be comprised in the suspension of arms above mentioned and that they should consequently enjoy the benefits of the cessation of hostilities at the same periods and in the same manner as the three crowns aforesaid and their subjects and possessions respectively it appears however that many vessels which were taken after the expiration of one month from the  d of february      the day of the ratification of the said preliminary articles within that part of the ocean which lies between the channel and north seas and the canary islands have not been restored but on the contrary in some instances such vessels have been condemned as lawful prizes upon an opinion that the words as far as said to be used in the preliminary articles meant the distance from paris to the southernmost part of the canaries it must be obvious to your lordship that this construction is extremely foreign from the intention of the contracting parties who never had paris in contemplation as a boundary of the region of one month nor as any limit of a measure of distance the channel and north seas being expressly marked as the northern boundary and the southernmost canary as the southern and every part of the ocean from the channel and north seas up to the canary islands inclusively is comprehended indeed the words as far as are scarcely a proper translation of the words jusquaux in the article of the treaty the original words are depuis la manche et les mers du nord jusquaux isles canaries and not depuis paris jusquaux isles c c the intention of the contracting parties is so clear and their expression so plain that it is not easy to account for the misinterpretation of them but as many lawsuits are depending upon the point and several americans are now in london waiting the decision of them i do myself the honor to propose to your lordship a particular convention to determine all these controversies on both sides by inserting the words jusquà la latitude des isles canaries instead of jusquaux isles canaries and also the words depuis la latitude des dites isles canaries instead of depuis les dites isles canaries it being apparent from the mention of the mediterranean as in the same stage of one month between the channel and north seas on the north and the canaries on the south and of the equinoctial line as the next     stage that the line of latitude of the southern canary was intended i have the honor to be c john adams john adams    july      london thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson london    july      dear sir— your favors of june    and july   and    are before me  the delay of mr lambs arrival is unfortunate but i think with you that the sooner a project of treaties is prepared the better and i will give the earliest attention to it whenever you shall send it i shall go this morning to stockdale to talk with him about sending you the newspapers and pamphlets through the channel of cleveland row that is lord carmarthens office i agree with pleasure to the appointment made by the doctor and you of mr short to carry the treaty through london to the hague and in joining dumas with him in making the exchange a letter to him and another to mr dumas signed by you and me as the doctor is gone would be sufficient authority but i should have no objection to giving each of them a more formal commission under our hands and seals to be our secretaries especially pro hâc vice he must carry our original commission to show to the baron de thulemeier and a copy of it attested by colonel humphreys to deliver him and mr dumas and he should see the prussian commission and receive an attested copy of that i do not think of any other papers necessary i have given to lord carmarthen long ago an explanation of the power of congress to form treaties of commerce exactly conformable to that which you gave the english gentleman but i did not extend it to the case of consuls he asked me no questions concerning consuls and i did not think it proper for me to say any thing on that subject not having any instructions but i am not easy on that head mr temple talks of going out in three or four weeks but i am very apprehensive he will meet with the difficulties you foresee     the rest in cipher and kept secret i do not like the symptoms galloway deane chalmers watson are too much in favor the lottery for the tories although perhaps in part inevitable has been introduced with such pompous demonstrations of affection and approbation as are neither wise nor honest there is too much attention to the navy and there is another step which alarms my apprehensions hanover is joining prussia against the views of the two imperial courts at least in bavaria keep this as secret as the grave but search it to the bottom among the foreign ministers where you are does this indicate a doubt whether our business with de thulemeier may be delayed does it indicate a design in the british cabinet to be neutral in order to be more at leisure to deal with us can it be a secret understanding between st jamess and versailles the design of ruining if they can our carrying trade and annihilating all our navigation and seamen is too apparent yours most sincerely john adams john adams    july      westminster john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square westminster    july      dear sir— give me leave to propose for your consideration and to request you to submit to the decision of congress whether it would not be proper that some measures should be taken to furnish your ministers abroad with the laws of the several states and more especially with such laws as may have a relation to external commerce or any other foreign affair information of this kind will be wanted at every court but more particularly here and at this critical period our fellowcitizens here from all the states have been very civil to me in furnishing me with all the lights in their power and this will ever be the case it is to be hoped wherever you have a minister yet all the lights which individuals abroad can furnish will be imperfect though ever so carefully collected by a minister without the continual assistance of congress and the states i have been lately obliged to a fellowcitizen captain c miller for the laws of new york of the second meeting of the eighth session of the legislature among which to my great satisfaction   0 i find the united states in congress assembled vested for fifteen years with powers to prohibit any goods wares or merchandise from being imported into or exported from any of the united states in vessels belonging to or navigated by the subjects of any power with whom these states shall not have formed treaties of commerce and also with power of prohibiting the subjects of any foreign state kingdom or empire unless authorized by treaty from importing into the united states any goods wares or merchandise which are not the produce or manufacture of the dominions of the sovereign whose subjects they are i read this act with pleasure because it is very nearly all that is wanting the legislature of new york have avoided giving to the united states the power of imposing equalizing or retaliating duties and i cannot say that they are not right in this although it is very probable such duties will be indispensable such duties if laid by any state should be laid by all and if the states will in such cases respect the recommendations of congress this may be sufficient if we enter into treaty with england how shall we manage this subject shall we stipulate that britain shall pay in our ports no higher duties than the most favored nations shall pay in return for her stipulating that americans shall pay in her ports no higher duties than the most favored nation pays this would be unequal because the most favored nation pays in british ports much greater imposts than the nation the most favored by the united states pays in our ports if we enter into such a stipulation the consequence will be that in order to form an equality we must impose enormous duties not only upon british subjects but upon all other nations for example the most favored nation pays in england upon oil eighteen pounds three shillings sterling per ton if we attempt to equalize and retaliate we must lay on the amount of this upon the importation of goods from all other nations a measure that may be very inconvenient to us should we not then endeavor to obtain a stipulation that americans shall pay in british ports no higher duties than british subjects no doubt to obtain this we must stipulate that britons shall pay in our ports no higher duties than our own citizens and even this will be unequal because that duties in general are higher in england than in america this however cannot     be avoided and as it is our felicity we have less cause to repine at it but if the british ministry should refuse to go farther than the mutual privilege of the most favored nation we shall have no remedy but in equalizing duties which it will be absolutely necessary to lay on in order to do ourselves justice this cannot be done but by a concert of all the states if such a concert can be effected by recommendations of congress so much the better if it cannot i see no other remedy but to give congress the power this nation relies upon it that our states can never accomplish such a concert either by giving congress the power or by complying with their recommendations proofs of this are innumerable lord sheffields writings the constant strain of all the writings in the newspapers the language of conversation the report of the committee of council but above all the system adopted by the duke of portlands administration and uniformly pursued by him and his successor mr pitt are a demonstration of it for although many express a contempt of the american commerce and i am sorry to say that even lord camden has lately said that while they had a monopoly of the american trade it was a valuable thing but now they had not he thought very little of it yet those of the ministry and nations who understand any thing of the subject know better and build all their hopes and schemes upon the supposition of such divisions in america as will forever prevent a combination of the states either in prohibitions or retaliating duties it is true that the national pride is much inflated at present by the course of exchange which is much in their favor with all parts of the world and disposes them to think little of american commerce they say that the progress of the fine arts in this kingdom has given to their manufacturers a taste and skill and to their productions an elegance cheapness and utility so superior to any others that the demand for their merchandises from all parts of europe is greater than ever that even lord norths prohibitory bill has contributed to this advantage by occasioning a demand among foreign merchants during the war for goods to supply america the knowledge and taste for british manufactures they say has been by this means spread all over europe and the demands for them multiplied which has turned the balance so much in their favor and caused such an extraordinary     influx both of cash and bills of exchange into these kingdoms those who reflect more maturely upon this however see that this advantage is but temporary if it is one they say that the long stagnation of business by the war had filled the country with manufactures that upon the peace extraordinary efforts were made to dispose of them by sending factors abroad not only to america but to all parts of europe that these factors have not only sold their goods at a low price but have sent home cash and bills at a high one so that their own factors have turned their course of exchange in their favor in appearance and for the present moment only at their expense for the loss both upon the sale of goods and the purchase of remittances is theirs if these conjectures are right the present appearance of prosperity will be succeeded by numerous failures and great distress be this as it may the present appearance has produced a selfsufficiency which will prevent for some time any reasonable arrangement with us the popular pulse seems to beat high against america the people are deceived by numberless falsehoods industriously circulated by the gazettes and in conversation so that there is too much reason to believe that if this nation had another hundred millions to spend they would soon force the ministry into a war against us the court itself whatever may be thought of it appears at present to be the principal barrier against a war and the best disposed towards us and whether they are restrained by any thing beside their own poverty may be justly questioned their present system as far as i can penetrate it is to maintain a determined peace with all europe in order that they may war singly against america if they should think it necessary their attachment to their navigation act as well as that of all other parties here is grown so strong and their determination to consider us as foreigners and to undermine our navigation and to draw away our seamen is so fixed in order to prevent us from privateering in case of a war that i despair of any equal treaty and therefore of any treaty until they shall be made to feel the necessity of it it cannot therefore be too earnestly recommended to all the states to concur with the state of new york in giving to congress full power to make treaties of commerce and in short to govern all our external     commerce for i really believe it must come to that whether prohibitions or high duties will be most politic is a great question duties may be laid which will give a clear advantage to our navigation and seamen and these would be laid by the states upon the recommendations of congress no doubt as soon as the principle is admitted that it is necessary that our foreign commerce should be under one direction you will easily infer from all this that i have no hopes of a treaty before next spring nor then without the most unanimous concurrence of all our states in vigorous measures which shall put out of all doubt their power and their will to retaliate with great esteem i am c john adams john adams    july      london thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson london    july      dear sir— i have a letter from the baron de thulemeier of the   th and a copy of his letter to you of the same date i hope now in a few days to take mr short by the hand in grosvenor square and to put my hand to the treaty i think no time should be lost we will join mr dumas with mr short in the exchange if you please in cipher the britons aliens duty is a very burdensome thing and they may carry it hereafter as far upon tobacco rice indigo and twenty other things as they now do upon oil to obviate this i think of substituting the words natural born citizens of the united states and natural born subjects of great britain instead of the most favored nation you remember we first proposed to offer this to all nations but upon my objecting that the english would make their ships french or swedish or dutch c to avail themselves of it without agreeing to it on their part we altered it to the footing of gentis amicissimæ but if the english will now agree to it we shall secure ourselves against many odious duties and no ill consequence can arise it is true the french dutch swedes and prussians will of course claim the advantage but as they     must in return allow us the same advantage so much the better let me know if any objection occurs to you there is a bill before parliament to prevent smuggling tobacco in which the restrictions are very rigorous but cannot be effectual two thirds of the tobacco consumed in this kingdom i am told is smuggled how can it be otherwise when the impost is five times the original value of the commodity if one pound in five escapes nothing is lost if two in five a great profit is made the duty is sixteen pence a pound and tobacco sells for three pence yet all applications for lowering the duty are resisted yours most affectionately john adams john adams    july      to the marquis of carmarthen grosvenor square    july      my lord— since the letter which i did myself the honor to write to your lordship relative to the construction of the armistice i have received further information from america which i beg leave to communicate to your lordship the first judgment rendered on a mistaken interpretation of the armistice appears to have been at new york where all american vessels taken within the second month were condemned as lawful prize by the judge of admiralty the fame of these decrees having reached connecticut and rhode island it is said that similar decrees were rendered by the inferior courts of admiralty there against british vessels there is my lord a court of admiralty in each of the united states but by our constitution an appeal lies from all of them to a court appointed by the united states in congress assembled for receiving and determining finally appeals in all cases of capture if the parties interested in the decrees in connecticut and rhode island had appealed to the supreme court those decrees would certainly have been reversed because every cause which ever came before that court upon the point in question has been decided in favor of the british owner of the vessel and should a declaration be now made of the true intention of the contracting parties the british owners against whom the decrees were rendered in connecticut and rhode island may still appeal and have justice if the time limited is not passed if it     is by an application to the legislatures of those states there is no doubt to be made that an appeal would be granted under the present circumstances notwithstanding the lapse of time the decisions in the court of admiralty of massachusetts and all other states have been conformable to the judgment of the supreme court of appeals that is to say conformable to the true intention of the armistice and it is with pleasure that i add that the judgments of his majestys court of admiralty at halifax have been the same way the words of the armistice are supposed to be the same which have been constantly used in every treaty of peace for the last hundred years and it is not known that there ever was before any doubt or difference of opinion concerning the construction of them in order to establish confidence between the two countries my lord it is necessary there should be a mutual confidence in each others tribunals of justice which can hardly exist while such various interpretations are given of so plain a point by different courts in each nation in order to settle all disputes upon this subject upon one principle i have the honor to propose to your lordship that a declaration should be made in the form inclosed or to the same effect in any other form which to your lordship may appear more proper with great respect c john adams declaration whereas by the first article of the preliminary treaty of peace between the crown of great britain and the crown of france signed at versailles on the  0th of january      it was stipulated in these words namely— as soon as the preliminaries shall be signed and ratified sincere friendship shall be reestablished between his most christian majesty and his britannic majesty their kingdoms states and subjects by sea and by land in all parts of the world orders shall be sent to the armies and squadrons as well as to the subjects of the two powers to stop all hostilities and to live in the most perfect union forgetting the past their sovereigns showing the example and for the execution of this article seapasses shall be given on each side to the ships which shall be despatched to carry the news of it to the possessions of the said powers and by the twentysecond article of the same treaty it was stipulated in these words— in order to prevent all causes of complaint and dispute which may arise on account of prizes that may be taken at sea after the signing of these preliminary     articles it is reciprocally agreed that the vessels and effects which may be taken in the channel and in the north seas after the space of twelve days to be computed from the ratification of these preliminary articles shall be restored on each side that the term shall be one month from the channel and the north seas as far as the canary islands inclusively whether in the ocean or in the mediterranean two months from the said canary islands as far as the equinoctial line or equator and lastly five months in all other parts of the world without any exception or any other distinction more particular of time and place and whereas on the said  0th day of january      it was agreed and by instruments signed by the minister plenipotentiary of his britannic majesty in behalf of his majesty on one part and by the minister plenipotentiary of the united states of america in behalf of the said united states on the other it was mutually declared that the said united states of north america their subjects and their possessions and his britannic majesty his subjects and possessions should be comprised in the suspension of arms above mentioned and that they should consequently enjoy the benefit of the cessation of hostilities at the same periods and in the same manner as the crowns aforesaid and their subjects and possessions respectively and whereas a doubt has arisen and a question has been made concerning the sense and intention of the high contracting parties by the words dun mois depuis la manche et les mers du nord jusquaux isles canaries inclusivement and by the words de deux mois depuis les dites isles canaries jusquà la ligne equinoxiale now in order to remove all such doubts and questions and to the end that the same rule of justice may take place in all courts of justice in both nations it is hereby agreed and declared by—in the name and behalf of his majesty the king of great britain on the one part and by— minister plenipotentiary of the united states of america to the court of great britain on the other in the name and behalf of the said united states that the line of latitude of the southernmost canary island was intended by the said contracting parties and that the armistice aforesaid ought to be everywhere understood and construed in the same manner as if the words had been from the channel and the north seas to the latitude of the canary islands inclusively and from the latitude of the said canary islands to the equinoctial line and that all judgments and decrees of courts of justice of either of the parties to this declaration rendered upon any different construction of the armistice aforesaid ought to be reversed done at westminster this day of john adams    july      to the marquis of carmarthen grosvenor square    july      my lord— the course of commerce since the peace between great britain and the united states of america has been such as to have produced many inconveniences to the persons concerned in it on both sides which become every day     more and more sensible the zeal of americans to make remittances to british merchants has been such as to raise the interest of money to double its usual standard to increase the price of bills of exchange to eight or ten per centum above par and to advance the price of the produce of the country to almost double the usual rate large sums of the circulating cash and as much produce as could be purchased at almost any rate have been remitted to england but much of this produce lies in store here because it will not fetch by reason of the duties and restrictions on it the price given for it in america no political arrangements having been made both the british and american merchants expected that the trade would have returned to its old channels and nearly under the same regulations found by long experience to be beneficial but they have been disappointed the former have made advances and the latter contracted debts both depending upon remittances in the usual articles and upon the ancient terms but both have found themselves mistaken and it is much to be feared that the consequences will be numerous failures cash and bills have been chiefly remitted neither rice tobacco pitch tar turpentine ships oil nor many other articles the great sources of remittances formerly can now be sent as heretofore because of restrictions and imposts which are new in this commerce and destructive of it and the trade with the british west india islands formerly a vast source of remittance is at present obstructed these evils my lord as far as they merely affect the united states should not be offered to your lordships consideration they are proper subjects for the deliberations of congress and the legislatures of the several states but as far as they affect the merchants and manufacturers of great britain and ireland and as far as they affect the general system of commerce revenue and policy of the british empire your lordship will undoubtedly give them their due weight there is a literal impossibility my lord that the commerce between the two countries can continue long to the advantage of either upon the present footing the evils already experienced will be much increased and more severely felt if the causes of them are permitted much longer to operate it is the desire of the citizens of the united states to cultivate the most friendly     intercourse with the kings subjects and it will be with regret that they shall see the necessity of searching for other resources as substitutes for british commerce either in other countries or in manufactures at home whether it is not putting at hazard too material an interest to risk an alienation from these kingdoms of the american commerce or any considerable part of it for the sake of the advantages that can be obtained by the present restrictions on it is a question which must be submitted to your lordships consideration in order to bring this subject so momentous to both countries under a candid discussion i do myself the honor to inclose to your lordship and to propose to the consideration of his majestys ministers a project of a fair and equitable treaty of commerce between his majesty and the united states of america prepared in conformity to the instructions of congress and submit it entirely to your lordship to decide whether the negotiation shall be conducted with your lordship or with any other person to be invested with powers equal to mine to be appointed for the purpose with great respect c john adams john adams    july      westminster john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square westminster    july      sir— i have the honor to inclose a copy of a letter to the marquis of carmarthen of the   th july another of the   th with a project of a declaration concerning the construction of the armistice and another of this date with a project of a treaty of commerce it is high time something should be done to turn the attention of administration to the relation between this country and the united states and it seemed most advisable to lay the project of a treaty directly before the ministry rather than first negotiate the appointment of any other minister to treat with me than the marquis of carmarthen himself if i had first proposed the appointment of a minister they would have procrastinated the business for six months and perhaps twelve before i could have communicated any thing to them now they can have no excuse the offer is made and hereafter they may repent of their error if they do not accept it or     something nearly like it immediately i am very sensible it will greatly embarrass the administration because most of them i believe are sensible that some such treaty must be one day agreed to and that it would be wise to agree to it now but they are afraid of oppositions from many quarters i must not however disguise my real sentiments the present ministry are too much under the influence of chalmers and smith and others of that stamp and have been artfully drawn into so many manifestations of a determination to maintain their navigation laws relatively to the united states and of a jealousy of our naval power small as it is that i fear they have committed themselves too far to recede their newfoundland act as well as their proclamations and the fourth of their irish propositions are in this style i have no expectation that the proposed treaty will be soon agreed to nor that i shall have any counter project or indeed any answer for a long time it is very apparent that we shall never have a satisfactory arrangement with this country until congress shall be made by the states supreme in matters of foreign commerce and treaties of commerce and until congress shall have exerted that supremacy with a decent firmness i am with great esteem c john adams john adams   august      westminster john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square westminster   august      dear sir— i find the spirit of the times very different from that which you and i saw when we were here together in the months of november and december      then the commerce of the united states had not fully returned to these kingdoms then the nation had not digested its system nor determined to adhere so closely to its navigation acts relatively to the united states then it was common in conversation to hear a respect and regard for america professed and even boasted of now the boast is that our commerce has returned to its old channels and that it can follow in no other now the utmost contempt of our commerce is freely expressed in pamphlets   0 gazettes coffeehouses and in common street talk i wish i could not add to this the discourses of cabinet counsellors and ministers of state as well as members of both houses of parliament the national judgment and popular voice is so decided in favor of the navigation acts that neither administration nor opposition dare avow a thought of relaxing them farther than has been already done this decided cast has been given to the public opinion and the national councils by two facts or rather presumptions the first is that in all events this country is sure of the american commerce even in case of war they think that british manufactures will find their way to the united states through france holland the austrian low countries spain portugal sweden the french and dutch west indies and even through canada and nova scotia the second is that the american states are not and cannot be united the landed interest will never join with the commercial nor the southern states with the northern in any measures of retaliation or expressions of resentment these things have been so often affirmed to this people by the refugees and they have so often repeated them to one another that they now fully believe them and i am firmly persuaded they will try the experiment as long as they can maintain the credit of their stocks it is our part then to try our strength you know better than i do whether the states will give congress the power and whether congress when they have the power will judge it necessary or expedient to exert it in its plenitude you were present in congress sir in      when many members discussed in detail the commercial relations between the united states then united colonies and great britain ireland the british west indies and all other parts of the british empire and showed to what a vast amount the wealth power and revenue of great britain would be affected by a total cessation of exports and imports the british revenue is now in so critical a situation that it might be much sooner and more essentially affected than it could be then you remember however sir that although the theory was demonstrated the practice was found very difficult britain has ventured to begin commercial hostilities i call them hostilities because their direct object is not so much the     increase of their own wealth ships or sailors as the diminution of ours a jealousy of our naval power is the true motive the real passion which actuates them they consider the united states as their rival and the most dangerous rival they have in the world i see clearly they are less afraid of an augmentation of french ships and sailors than american they think they foresee that if the united states had the same fisheries the same carrying trade and the same market for ready built ships which they had ten years ago they would be in so respectable a posture and so happy in their circumstances that their own seamen manufacturers and merchants too would hurry over to them if congress should enter in earnest into this commercial war it must necessarily be a long one before it can fully obtain the victory and it may excite passions on both sides which may break out into a military war it is to be hoped therefore that the people and their councils will proceed with all the temperance and circumspection which such a state of things requires i would not advise to this commercial struggle if i could see a prospect of justice without it but i do not every appearance is on the contrary i have not indeed obtained any direct evidence of the intentions of the ministry because i have received no answer to any of my letters to lord carmarthen and it seems to me to press them at this juncture with any great appearance of anxiety would not be good policy let them hear a little more news from ireland france and perhaps spain as well as america which i think will operate in our favor i am c john adams john adams   august      london thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson london   august      dear sir— i am happy to find we agree so perfectly in the change which is made in the project the die is cast the proposal is made let them ruminate upon it i thought of proposing a tariff of duties that we might pay no more in their ports than they should pay in ours but their taxes are so essential to their credit that it is impossible to part with any of them and we should not choose to oblige ourselves to lay on     as heavy ones we are at liberty however to do it when we please if the english will not abolish their aliens duty relatively to us we must establish an alien duty in all the united states an alien duty against england alone will not answer the end she will elude it by employing dutch french swedish or any other ships and by frenchifying dutchifying or swedishing her own if the english will persevere in excluding our ships from their west india islands canada nova scotia and newfoundland and in demanding an alien duty from us in their ports within the realm and in refusing to american built ships the privileges of british built ships we must take higher ground—a vantageground we must do more than lay on alien duties we must take measures by which the increase of shipping and seamen will be not only encouraged but rendered inevitable we must adopt in all the states the regulations that were once made in england   richard ii c   and ordain that no american citizen or denizen or alien friend or enemy shall ship any merchandise out of or into the united states but only in ships built in the united states and navigated by an american captain and three fourths american seamen i should be sorry to adopt a monopoly but driven by the necessity of it i would not do things by halves the french deserve it of us as much as the english for they are as much enemies to our ships and mariners their navigation acts are not quite so severe as those of spain portugal and england as they relate to their colonies i mean but they are not much less so and they discover as strong a lust to annihilate our navigation as anybody or might we modify a little might we lay a duty of ten per cent on all goods imported in any but ships built in the united states without saying any thing about seamen if we were to prohibit all foreign vessels from carrying on our coasting trade that is from trading from one state to another and from one port to another in the same state we should do something for this commerce will be so considerable as to employ many ships and many seamen of so much the more value to us as they will always be ready at home for the defence of their country but if we should only prohibit importations except in our own bottoms or in the bottoms of the country or nation     of whose growth or production the merchandises are we should do nothing effectual against great britain she would desire nothing better than to send her productions to our ports in her own bottoms and bring away ours in return i hope the members of congress and the legislatures of the states will study the british acts of navigation and make themselves masters of their letter and spirit that they may judge how far they may be adopted by us and indeed whether they are sufficient to do justice to our citizens in their commerce with great britain there is another inquiry which i hope our countrymen will enter upon and that is what articles of our produce will bear a duty on exportation all such duties are paid by the consumer and therefore are so much clear gain some of our commodities will not bear any such duties on the contrary they will require encouragement by bounties but i suspect that several articles will bear a handsome impost we shall find our commerce a complicated machine and difficult to manage and i fear we have not many men who have turned their thoughts to it it must be comprehended by somebody in its system and in its detail before it will be regulated as it should be i am c john adams john adams   august      westminster john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square westminster   august      dear sir— it would be of little consequence to us whether there was a union between great britain and ireland or not or whether mr pitts twenty propositions are accepted or not provided both these countries should be allowed to trade with the united states upon free and equal terms but the design is too apparent at least too suspicious of drawing ireland into the shackles of the navigation acts in order that the three kingdoms may be made to act in concert in maintaining that system of monopoly against us several speakers in parliament and many writers have lately thrown out hints of an union with ireland and a certain printer and bookseller is now employed in reprinting daniel de foes book upon the union with scotland to which he has engaged     mr de lolme to write an introduction this is all a ministerial operation and is intended to be pushed if mr pitts twenty propositions should either be rejected by the irish parliament or give too much discontent to the volunteers the twenty propositions and the bill which is grounded on them betray too clearly the intentions of the ministry whereas it is highly and equally important to the interests both of great britain and ireland and essential to the objects of the present settlement that the laws for regulating trade and navigation so far as relates to securing exclusive privileges to the ships and mariners of great britain and ireland and the british colonies and plantations and so far as relates to the regulating and restraining the trade of the british colonies and plantations should be the same in great britain and ireland and that all such laws in both kingdoms should impose the same restraints and confer the same benefits on the subjects of both which can only be effected by the laws to be passed in the parliament of both kingdoms the parliament of great britain being alone competent to bind the people of great britain in any case whatsoever and the parliament of ireland being alone competent to bind the people of ireland in any case whatsoever therefore be it declared that it shall be held and adjudged to be a fundamental and essential condition of the present settlement that the laws for regulating trade and navigation so far as the said laws relate to the securing exclusive privileges to the ships and mariners of great britain ireland and the british colonies and plantations shall be the same in great britain and ireland and shall impose the same restraints and confer the same benefits on the subjects of both kingdoms that all privileges advantages and immunities which are now granted or shall by any law to be passed by the parliament of great britain be hereafter granted to ships built in great britain or to ships belonging to any of his majestys subjects residing in great britain or to ships manned by british seamen or to ships manned by certain proportions of british seamen shall to all intents and purposes whatever be enjoyed in the same manner and under the same regulations and restrictions respectively by ships built in ireland or by ships belonging to any of his majestys subjects residing in     ireland or by ships manned by irish seamen or by ships manned by certain proportions of irish seamen that it shall be held and adjudged to be a fundamental and essential condition of the present settlement that such regulations as are now or hereafter shall be in force by law passed or to be passed in the parliament of great britain for securing exclusive privileges advantages and immunities as aforesaid to the ships and mariners of great britain ireland and the british colonies and plantations shall be established in ireland for the same time and in the same manner as in great britain by laws to be passed in the parliament of ireland within—months c provided that the laws so to be passed in the parliament of great britain for the purposes aforesaid shall impose the same restraints and confer the same benefits on the subjects of great britain and ireland that it shall be held and adjudged to be a fundamental and essential condition of the present settlement that irish sailcloth shall be deemed british sailcloth within the meaning of    g ii or any other act or acts of parliament respecting the furnishing of ships with british sailcloth and that irish sailcloth shall be entitled to equal preference and advantage as british for the use of the british navy that it shall be held and adjudged to be a fundamental and essential condition of the present settlement that all goods of the growth produce or manufacture of any british or of any foreign colony in america or in the west indies or of any of the british or foreign settlements on the coast of africa and all peltry rum train oil and whalefins being the growth produce or manufacture of the countries belonging to the united states of america or being the produce of the fisheries carried on by the subjects of the united states of america shall on importation into ireland be made subject to the same duties and regulations as the like goods are or from time to time shall be subject to on importation into great britain or if prohibited from being imported into great britain shall in like manner be prohibited from being imported into ireland these extracts from the bill for finally regulating the intercourse and commerce between great britain and ireland moved in the house of commons by the chancellor of the exchequer are sufficient evidence of a design to draw ireland into a combination against america     this jealousy of our ships and mariners sir is not peculiar to the english the french are equally possessed of it and both are infected with it to such a degree that i am confident that each of these nations had rather contribute to the increase of the others ships and mariners than those of the united states it would not surprise me at all if these two courts which can agree in nothing else should combine together to exclude us from every branch of the carrying trade and every advantage of the whale fishery what shall we do to defend ourselves shall we confine the exportation of the produce of the united states to the ships and mariners of the united states to increase the english navy the statute of the   ric ii c   enacted that none of the kings liege people should ship any merchandise out of or into the realm but only in the ships of the kings liegeance on pain of forfeiture if the united states were able and willing to imitate this statute and confine all our exports and imports to ships built in the united states and navigated with american seamen or three quarters american seamen or one half or even one third american seamen what would be the consequence we should not have at first enough either of ships or seamen to export the produce and import what would be wanted from abroad but we should see multitudes of people instantly employed in building ships and multitudes of others immediately becoming sailors and the time would not be long before we should have enough of both the people of the united states have shown themselves capable of great exertions and possessed of patience courage and perseverance and willing to make large sacrifices to the general interest but are they capable of this exertion are they possessed of patience courage and perseverance enough to encounter the losses and embarrassments which would at first be occasioned by an exclusion of foreign ships i wish i could know the number of foreign ships which have entered the ports of the united states since the peace including english french dutch italian and swedish vessels the number must be very great if all these ships and seamen were american what materials would they furnish for a navy in case of need how would this be received by foreign nations spain and portugal would say nothing because they have no ships in our trade     france has few italy would have no right to object nor germany russia sweden or denmark it would be laying an axe at the root of the british commerce revenue and naval power however slightly they may think of us whether a heavy duty upon all foreign vessels such as should operate as a decisive encouragement to american ships would not answer the end as well i am not able to judge the provisions of the act of navigation    car ii c    would not be sufficient for our purpose if the united states should agree in a law that no goods should be suffered to be imported into the united states in any other than american bottoms navigated by an american master and three fourths of the seamen american or in the ships of that european nation of which the merchandise imported was the genuine growth or manufacture this would not accomplish our wish because british and irish ships would desire no other than to import into our states the manufactures of the british empire and to export our produce in the same bottoms some of the british statutes prohibit foreigners to carry on the coasting trade that is to go from one port to another in great britain and this regulation will now be extended to ireland if the twenty propositions are accepted a similar regulation might be adopted by the united states and this would be a vast encouragement to our navigation for the intercourse between one state and another and between one port and another of the same state will now be so frequent and considerable as to employ many ships and mariners and in these the greatest strength of a country consists because they are always at home ready to fight for the defence of their firesides if we should get over our aversion to monopolies and exclusions and adopt the selfish unsocial principles of the european nations particularly of france and england we should astonish the world with a navy in a very few years not more than eight or ten equal perhaps to the third maritime power in europe this would be amply sufficient for our defence european statesmen know it better than we do and dread it more than we desire it because they think that from that period all the west india islands canada nova scotia the floridas and mexico too would be made to join us why then will england pursue measures which will force us to try experiments     against our inclinations there is no answer to be given to this question but the same which must be given to another why did she force us into independence the nation îs infatuated and every successive minister must be infatuated too or lose his popularity and his place nor is france much less infatuated in her system of politics relative to america the jealousy of our navigation is so strong and so common to both that i should not be at all surprised if france should agree that england should carry her point in ireland draw her into the navigation monopoly and agree together to keep peace with one another and force us if they can out of every nursery for seamen i know that french noblemen are in england and english gentlemen in france preaching up to each other a terror of our naval power and even the late arrêt against british manufactures may be but a blind to cover very different designs both courts are capable of such dissimulation and they are now acting in concert in germany so much to the disgust of the two imperial courts that i confess i do not admire this appearance of friendship any more than i can account for it it will require all the wisdom and all the firmness of congress and the states to plan and execute the measures necessary to counteract all these wiles with great and sincere esteem c john adams john adams  0 august      westminster john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square westminster  0 august      dear sir— the arrêt of the king of france in his council of the  0th of july has a preamble which deserves to be well considered in america the increasing liberality of sentiment among philosophers and men of letters in various nations has for some time given reason to hope for a reformation a kind of protestantism in the commercial system of the world but i believe that this arrêt is the first act of any sovereign which has openly avowed commercial principles so generous and noble nothing could appear to the king more desirable or suitable to his own principles than a general liberty which freeing from all kinds of fetters the circulation of all productions and goods     of different countries would make of all nations as it were but one in point of trade but as long as that liberty cannot be universally admitted and everywhere reciprocally the interest of the kingdom requires of his majestys wisdom that he should exclude from it or suffer to be imported by the nation only those foreign goods the free importation of which would be hurtful to his kingdom and manufactories and might make the balance of trade to be against him the united states of america have done more than all the economists in france towards propagating in the world this magnanimous sentiment but they have more cause than the court of france to complain that liberty is not universally and reciprocally admitted they have cause to complain against france herself in some degree but more against great britain for france in some degree calculates all her policy towards us upon a principle which england pursues more steadily a principle not so properly of enriching and strengthening herself at our expense as of impoverishing and weakening us even at her own expense simple selfishness which is only the absence of benevolence is much less unamiable than positive malevolence as the french court has condescended to adopt our principle in theory i am very much afraid we shall be obliged to imitate their wisdom in practice and exclude from the united states or suffer to be imported by our nation only and in their own ships those foreign goods which would be hurtful to the united states and their manufactories make the balance of trade to be against them or annihilate or diminish their shipping or mariners we have hitherto been the bubbles of our own philosophical and equitable liberality and instead of meeting correspondent sentiments both france and england have shown a constant disposition to take a selfish and partial advantage of us because of them nay to turn them to the diminution or destruction of our own means of trade and strength i hope we shall be the dupes no longer than we must i would venture upon monopolies and exclusions if they were found to be the only arms of defence against monopolies and exclusions without fear of offending dean tucker or the ghost of doctor quesnay i observe further with pleasure in the preamble that the king is particularly occupied with the means of encouraging  00 the industry of his subjects and of propagating the extent of their trade and reviving their manufactories great things may be done in this way for the benefit of america as well as of france if the measures are calculated upon the honest old principle of live and let live but if another maxim is adopted i will live upon your means of living or another still worse i will half starve that you may quite starve instead of rejoicing at it we must look out for means of preserving ourselves these means can never be secured entirely until congress shall be made supreme in foreign commerce and shall have digested a plan for all the states but if any of the states continue to refuse their assent i hope that individual states will take it separately upon themselves and confine their exports and imports wholly to ships and mariners of the united states or even to their own ships and mariners or which is best of all to the ships and mariners of those states which will adopt the same regulations i should be extremely sorry however that there ever should be a necessity of making any distinction between the ships and mariners of different states it would be infinitely better to have all american ships and seamen entitled to equal privileges in all the thirteen states but their privileges should be made much greater than those of foreign ships and seamen with great respect c john adams john adams    august      london thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson london    august      dear sir— i have received your favor of the  th instant with the notes and project inclosed how can we send another person we have not in our full power authority to substitute will not the emperor and the regencies feel their dignity offended if a person appears without a commission from congress do you mean that he should only agree upon the terms and transmit them to us to be signed if you think this method will do i have no objection to either of the persons you mention nor to mr short dr bancroft is the greatest master of the french language if we conclude to send either he should have an attested copy at least of all our commissions  0  for africa and a letter and instructions from us if there is any truth in any of the reports of captures by the algerines lambs vessel may be taken by them whoever is sent by us should be instructed to correspond constantly with us and to send by whatever conveyance he may find whether through spain france england holland or otherwise copies of his letters to us to congress he should be instructed further to make diligent inquiry concerning the productions of those countries which would answer in america and those of the united states which might find a market in barbary and to transmit all such information to congress as well as to us i have read over the project with care the seventeenth article appears to be carried further than our countrymen will be willing at present to go i presume the three last words of the third line of this seventeenth article must be left out and in the fourth line the seventh eighth ninth tenth eleventh and twelfth words and in the sixth line the first second third fourth and fifth words you have seen by this time our massachusetts navigation act and the reasonings and dispositions of all the states tend the same way at present so that we must conform our proceedings as i suppose to their views yours c c john adams john adams    august      london thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson london    august      dear sir— last night i received your favor of the   th  if both governments are possessed of the contents of my letter of the  th by opening it in the postoffice much good may those contents do them they both know they have deserved them i hope they will convince them of their error and induce them to adopt more liberal principles towards us i am for answering their utmost generosity with equal and indeed with greater generosity but i would not advise my country to be the bubble of her own nobleness of sentiment the spirited conduct of ireland i think will assist me here  0  the news of the reception in the irish parliament of the twenty resolutions together with the efforts in america towards a navigation act have raised my hopes a good deal but our states must mature their plan and persevere in it in order to effect the work in time and with a steady pursuit of our purpose i begin to think we shall prevail if mr barclay will undertake the voyage i am for looking no farther we cannot find a steadier or more prudent man he should look out for some clerk or companion who can write french and who understands italian when dr price returns from his august excursion to some watering place i will get him to make the insurance upon houdons life on the best terms he can adieu john adams john adams    august      westminster john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square westminster    august      dear sir— yesterday i had a long conference with mr pitt for the first time he never had proposed any interview with me and i had delayed to request him to appoint any time after the first ceremonial visit for two reasons—because while parliament was sitting his time and mind were so engaged that it was impossible he should attend in earnest to the affairs of the united states and because i expected that a little time would bring both from america and ireland intelligence which would somewhat lessen that confidence with which the ministry and the nation were elated such intelligence has now arrived the twenty resolutions have been in effect given up that they might not be rejected by the irish parliament and the massachusetts act of navigation has appeared together with advices from virginia philadelphia new york and various other parts of the united states which have excited a serious apprehension that all have the same principles and views i shall not attempt to give you the conversation in detail yet it is necessary to give some particulars from which you may judge how much or how little may result from the whole he asked me what were the principal points to be discussed  0  between us i answered that i presumed the marquis of carmarthen had laid before the kings servants some papers which i had done myself the honor to write to him he said he had i replied that those letters related to the evacuation of the forts upon the frontier to the construction of the armistice and to a treaty of commerce and that besides these there were the negroes carried off contrary to the treaty and some other points which i had particularly explained to lord carmarthen he said that the carrying off the negroes was so clearly against the treaty that they must take measures to satisfy that demand if we could prove how many were carried off i told him that sir guy carleton could easily ascertain the number and that colonel smith who negotiated with sir guy could do the same and that i had the evidence of their proceedings ready to produce whenever it was wanted he entered then into the subject of the armistice and we were longer on this point than we needed to have been i observed to him that mr blowers construction was demonstrably absurd because it would place the whole coast of america in the period of five months the coast of the united states certainly was not between the canary islands and the equator and therefore could not be included in the period of two months it is neither in the channel nor north seas and therefore cannot be within the period of twelve days consequently if it is not in the period of one month it must be in that of five months an idea that never could have been entertained a moment by either of the contracting parties mr pitt said he thought that was clear and that this point might be easily settled but as to the posts says he that is a point connected with some others that i think must be settled at the same time i asked him what these points were he said the debts several of the states had interfered against the treaty and by acts of their legislatures had interposed impediments to the recovery of debts against which there were great complaints in this country i replied to this that i had explained this at great length to the marquis of carmarthen but that i might now add that congress had very early after the peace proposed an explanation of the article as far as it respected the interest of debts contracted before the war they had instructed their ministers at paris to propose such an explanation to this court that we  0  had proposed it through mr hartley first and the duke of dorset afterwards and that i had renewed the proposition to my lord carmarthen upon my first conference with him but that we had never received an answer i thought it was best there should be an explanation for i was persuaded that an american jury would never give any interest for the time which ran during the war mr pitt said that would surprise the people here for that wars never interrupted the interest nor principal of debts and that he did not see a difference between this war and any other and the lawyers here made none i begged his pardon here and said that the american lawyers made a wide difference they contended that the late war was a total dissolution of all laws and government and consequently of all contracts made under those laws and that it was a maxim of law that a personal right or obligation once dissolved or suspended was lost forever that the intervention of the treaty and the new laws was necessary for the revival of those ancient rights and obligations that these rights were in a state of nonexistence during the war and no interest during that period could grow out of them these being the opinions in america it was not probable that any jury would be found from georgia to new hampshire who would give by their verdict interest to a creditor and therefore it was most fair and equitable that an explanation should be made that the same rule of law might be observed on both sides this observation appeared to strike him he said if there was any danger of this it would be best that an explanation should be made but that the balance of debts was much in favor of this country which i did not deny but he said the government would not dare to make it without previously feeling out the dispositions of the persons chiefly interested and knowing how it would be taken by them we had a much longer conversation concerning these debts and the difficulty of paying them arising from the restrictions on our trade in which i repeated to him what i had before said to lord carmarthen and to the deputies of the scotch creditors but as i have transmitted that to you before it is unnecessary to repeat it here he then began upon the treaty of commerce and asked what were the lowest terms which would be satisfactory to america i answered that i might not think myself competent to determine  0  that question articles might be proposed to me that i should not think myself qualified to decide upon without writing to congress but i would venture so far as to say that i thought the project i had communicated to lord carmarthen would give satisfaction to america and secure the friendship of the united states and the essence of their trade to this country but that in proportion as a plan less liberal was adopted that friendship would be precarious and that trade would be scattered i added that the most judicious men in america had been long balancing in their minds the advantages and the disadvantages of a commerce perfectly free on one side and of a navigation act on the other that the present time was a critical one the late intelligence from all parts of america concurred with the navigation act of massachusetts in proving which way the balance began to incline and in my opinion it would be decided by the conduct of this country it was now in his mr pitts power to decide it but the more americans reflected upon the great advantages which they might derive from a navigation act the more they would become attached to that system i had heard there were five hundred foreign ships employed the last year in the commerce of the united states how easy would it be to have all these ships the property of american citizens and the navigators of them american seamen there was once a statute in england that of   ric ii c   that none of the kings liege people should ship any merchandise out of or into the realm but only in ships of the kings liegeance on pain of forfeiture i asked him what physical or political impediment there was to prevent the united states from adopting that very act in all its rigor the right of every nation to govern its own commerce its own exports and imports would not be denied nor questioned by any nation to this he agreed our ability to build the ships and our abundance of materials could not be doubted this he assented to nobody would pretend that our produce would not find a market in europe in our own ships or that europeans would not sell us their manufactures to carry home in them even england if she should make ever so strict laws to prevent exports and imports in our bottoms would still be glad to receive and consume considerable quantities of our produce though she imported them through france or holland and to  0  send us as many of her manufactures as we could pay for through the same channels he more than smiled assent to this for he added that there were american articles of much importance to them but he said that englishmen were much attached to their navigation and americans too said i to theirs but said he the united states having now become a foreign nation our navigation act would not answer its end if we should dispense with it towards you here i begged his pardon again for i thought their navigation act would completely defeat its own end as far as it respected us for the end of the navigation act as expressed in its own preamble was to confine the commerce of the colonies to the mother country but now we were become independent states if carried into execution against us instead of confining our trade to great britain it would drive it to other countries this he did not deny but said he you allow we have a right certainly i do and you sir will allow we have a right too yes i do but you cannot blame englishmen for being attached to their ships and seamen which are so essential to them indeed i do not sir nor can you blame americans for being attached to theirs which are so much fewer and so much more essential to them no i do not blame them as this was a very sprightly dialogue and in very good humor i thought i might push it a little i will be very frank with you sir said i and i think it will be best for us to go to the bottom of these subjects the americans think that their exclusion from your west india islands the refusal of their ships and oil and other things and their exclusion from your colonies on the continent and newfoundland discover a jealousy of their little naval power and a fixed system of policy to prevent the growth of it and this is an idea that they cannot bear no said he if we endeavored to lessen your shipping and seamen without benefiting or increasing our own it would be hard and unreasonable and would be a just ground of uneasiness but when we only aim at making the most of our own means and nurseries you cannot justly complain i am happy sir to hear you avow this principle and agree with you perfectly in it let us apply it both parties having the right and the power to confine their exports and imports to their own ships and seamen if both exercise the right and exert the power  0  in its full extent what is the effect the commerce must cease between them is this eligible for either to be sure said he we should well consider the advantages and the disadvantages in such a case if it is not found to be eligible for either said i after having well considered what remains but that we should agree upon a liberal plan and allow equal freedom to each others ships and seamen especially if it should be found that this alone can preserve friendship and good humor for i fully believe that this plan alone can ever put this nation in good humor with america or america with this country he then mentioned ships and oil he said we could not think hard of them for encouraging their own shipwrights their manufactures of ships and their own whale fishery i answered by no means but it appeared unaccountable to the people of america that this country should sacrifice the general interest of the nation to the private interest of a few individuals interested in the manufacture of ships and in the whale fishery so far as to refuse these remittances from america in payment of debts and for manufactures which would employ so many more people augment the revenue so considerably as well as the national wealth which would even in other ways so much augment the shipping and seamen of the nation it was looked upon in america as reconciling themselves to a diminution of their own shipping and seamen in a great degree for the sake of diminishing ours in a small one besides keeping many of their manufacturers out of employ who would otherwise have enough to do and besides greatly diminishing the revenue and consequently contrary to the maxim which he had just acknowledged that one nation should not hurt itself for the sake of hurting another nor take measures to deprive another of any advantage without benefiting itself he then asked me if we could grant to england by a treaty any advantages which would not immediately become the right of france i answered we could not if the advantage was stipulated to england without a compensation france would be entitled to it without a compensation but if it was stipulated for an equivalent or reciprocal privilege france must allow us the same equivalent or reciprocal privilege but i added france would not be a very successful rival to great britain in the american commerce upon so free a footing as that of the  0  mutual liberty of naturalborn subjects and citizens upon the footing of the most favored nation france would stand a good chance in many things in case of mutual navigation acts between britain and america france would have more of our commerce than britain in short britain would lose and france gain not only in our commerce but our affections in proportion as britain departed from the most liberal system upon this he asked me a question which i did not expect what do you really think sir that britain ought to do that question sir may be beyond my capacity to answer and my answer may be suspected but if it is i will answer it to the best of my judgment and with perfect sincerity i think this country ought to prescribe to herself no other rule but to take from america every thing she can send as a remittance nay to take off every duty and give every bounty that should be necessary to enable her to send any thing as a remittance in this case america would prescribe to herself no other rule than to take of british productions as much as she could pay for he might think this no proof of our republican frugality but such was the disposition of our people and how much soever i might lament it i would not disguise it he then led me into a long rambling conversation about our whale fishery and the english and the french whale fishery that m de calonne is essaying to introduce too little interesting to be repeated yet i should mention that he asked me a sudden question whether we had taken any measures to find a market for our oil anywhere but in france this question must have been suggested to him i think either by information that our oil is wanted in some countries upon the continent or by a suspicion that we have been trying to introduce our oil into ireland i answered that i believed we had and i have been told that some of our oil had found a good market at bremen but there could not be a doubt that spermaceti oil might find a market in most of the great cities in europe which were illuminated in the night as it is so much better and cheaper than the vegetable oil that is commonly used the fat of the spermaceti whale gives the clearest and most beautiful flame of any substance that is known in nature and we are all surprised that you prefer darkness and consequent robberies burglaries and murders in your streets to the receiving as a remittance our spermaceti  0  oil the lamps around grosvenor square i know and in downing street too i suppose are dim by midnight and extinguished by two oclock whereas our oil would burn bright till nine oclock in the morning and chase away before the watchmen all the villains and save you the trouble and danger of introducing a new police into the city he said he owned he was for taking advantage of the present short time of leisure to mature some plan about these things i told him i rejoiced to find that was his opinion and that i would be at all times ready to attend him or any other minister whenever any explanation should be wanted from me that i was anxious for an answer concerning the posts as i was in duty bound to insist on their evacuation he said he thought that connected with several other points and should be for settling all these together so that he must reserve himself at entire liberty concerning them i am sorry that in representing all these conversations i am obliged to make myself the principal speaker but i cannot get them to talk the reason is they dare not all must be determined in the cabinet and no single minister chooses to commit himself by giving any opinion which may be ever quoted to his disadvantage by any party this is not only the state of mind of every minister but of every ministry they have an unconquerable reluctance to deciding upon any thing or giving any answer and although mr pitt and lord carmarthen have hazarded opinions upon some points to me i do not believe i shall get any answer officially from the cabinet or the minister of foreign affairs i wish for an answer be it ever so rough or unwise mr pitt i confess was much more open than i expected he was explicit in my favor relative to the negroes and the armistice and for digesting the whole in the present leisure and giving me an answer i should rejoice in a cabinet answer to all my letters and especially in a counterproject of a treaty but i will be so free as to say i do not expect any answer at all before next spring nor then unless intelligence should arrive of all the states adopting the navigation act or authorizing congress to do it and even in that case i am inclined to think they will try the experiment and let our navigation acts operate to satisfy themselves which people will first roar out with pain they deceive themselves   0 yet in many points which i may enumerate in a future letter from what mr pitt said i am convinced we shall have no answer concerning the posts with great respect c john adams this letter will be delivered to you by mr charles storer your old acquaintance who has served me much as a private secretary and that without fees john jay    august      john adams secretary jay to john adams office for foreign affairs    august      dear sir— it gives me pleasure to inform you that your letters of  d  th and   th june last have been received and were this day laid before congress who i am persuaded will read them with as much satisfaction as i have done you have been in a situation that required much circumspection i think you have acquitted yourself in a manner that does you honor the vessel that is to carry this sails in the morning so that at present i can only add my best wishes and assure you that i am c john jay john adams  0 august      westminster john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square westminster  0 august      sir— the more i consider what i see and hear every day the more i am inclined to think we shall be obliged to imitate the utopians who as sir thomas more informs as to their exportations thought it better to manage that themselves than to let foreigners come and deal in it for by this means as they understand the state of the neighboring countries better so they keep up the art of navigation which cannot be maintained but by much practice in it i would not be understood however to wish that the united     states should at present proceed farther than to exclude british ships from coming and dealing in our exportations other nations may be permitted for any thing that i know without inconvenience at least the experiment may be tried other foreign nations will probably have few ships employed in this way england scotland and ireland would have many but if it should be found that british ships are frenchified dutchified or otherwise metamorphosed in order to manage any part of our exportations i hope the united states will not hesitate to make the prohibition universal to the ships of all nations and confine their exports to their own there is no other way that i know of in which we can compensate ourselves for that vigorous exclusion of american built ships from the british dominions upon which all parties here i fear are determined the popular cry has been universal as i am informed what shall the united states be our ship carpenters shall we depend upon a foreign nation for our navigation in case of war with them shall we be without ships or obliged to our enemies for them with regard to duties will our countrymen be long contented to pay four or five hundred per cent upon their tobacco and fifty per cent upon other articles of their produce in the ports of great britain while british subjects pay but ten per cent upon the importation of any of their commodities in our ports i do not believe they will they will rather lay duties upon british luxuries to repay their own citizens the duties they pay in british ports it is indeed impossible to foresee where this conflict of prohibition and duties will end it is impossible to conjecture what the english will attempt i am not easy about the negotiations now on foot with france and spain i have not yet sufficiently explained myself to you upon this subject by the eighteenth article of the definitive treaty of peace between france and england signed at versailles the  d of september      it is stipulated that immediately after the exchange of the ratifications the two high contracting parties shall name commissaries to treat concerning new arrangements of commerce between the two nations on the basis of reciprocity and mutual convenience which arrangements shall be settled and concluded within the space of two years to be computed from the first of january in the year          in the ninth article of the definitive treaty between great britain and spain there is a stipulation in the same words and the duke of manchester made a declaration to each of those powers at the same time that the new state in which commerce may perhaps be found in all parts of the world will demand revisions and explanations of the subsisting treaties in compliance with these stipulations and declarations mr crawford was long ago sent to paris to treat with the court of versailles and mr woodward is lately appointed here to treat with mr del campo on the part of spain mr crawford transmitted to his court a year ago a plan which he received from the french minister but i know from the duke of dorset who told me himself that mr crawford had no answer from england in six months and indeed i conjecture that he had none till since the edict of the french king prohibiting british manufactures if these arrangements are not made before the first of january the two years will be expired and nothing more will be said of them until another war and peace but i confess i shall be anxious until new years day the conduct of this court in these discussions with france and spain is very interesting to us as it will throw much light upon their intentions towards us there are great appearances of a fixed intention to keep the peace with france and spain for a long period the late advice of the ministers of the king of great britain to the elector of hanover to join the league of the king of prussia against the views of the emperor and empress can be accounted for on no supposition but that of a determination in all events to preserve their peace with france and spain whence this love of france and of peace neither is a natural passion in an english breast let my country answer it is not love of me on the contrary although i wish not to alarm my fellowcitizens it appears to me that the plan of this country towards us is nearly settled it is not fully and will not be until the next budget is opened the next budget will decide the fate of this country and especially her system towards the united states if mr pitt should then in      be able to justify his hypothesis at the opening of the budget in      and shall be able to show that the taxes have increased in the proportion with the hope of which he flattered himself and the nation this government     will then preserve the peace with france and spain at almost any rate persevere in their system of commerce respecting the united states of america in spite of all your arguments and remonstrances prohibitions and retaliations and ultimately attack you with a new war in my private opinion in the mean time it is their fixed design to keep possession of the posts on the frontier sir john johnson is certainly going out and it is given out that fifteen hundred men are going to quebec and materials engineers and workmen for large fortifications in nova scotia in short sir america has no party at present in her favor all parties on the contrary have committed themselves against us except shelburne and buckingham and the last of these is against a treaty of commerce with us so is even mr temple who is gone out to new york appointed as i suppose in compliment to his namesake the marquis of buckingham i had almost said the friends of america are reduced to dr price and dr jebb patience under all the unequal burthens they impose upon our commerce will do us no good it will contribute in no degree to preserve the peace with this country on the contrary nothing but retaliation reciprocal prohibitions and imposts and putting ourselves in a posture of defence will have any effect this country can furnish their west india islands and continental colonies and newfoundland so that we cannot suddenly make them feel we cannot prevent the introduction of their manufactures among us so effectually as to make them feel very soon they may lessen the duties on spanish tobacco so as to make the spaniards our rivals and hurt our tobacco states there are many ways in which they may hurt us of which we should be apprized beforehand ships and oil all men say will never be received of us i hope the states will be cool and do nothing precipitately but i hope they will be firm and wise confining our exports to our own ships and laying on heavy duties upon all foreign luxuries and encouraging our own manufactures appear to me to be our only resource although i am very sensible of the many difficulties in the way and of the danger of their bringing on in the course of a few years another war nothing but our strength and their weakness will in my opinion protect us     from such a calamity they will never again pour large armies into the united states but they think they can distress us more by cutting off all our trade by their shipping and they mean that we shall have no ships nor sailors to annoy their trade i would however advise the states to suspend their judgments as much as they can without suspending their navigation acts until another spring and summer shall have developed the british system of politics in germany their plans with france and spain and above all the state of their debts and taxes and their credit i do not believe the ministers have yet digested their own system it will depend still in some measure upon contingencies there is a taciturnity among them that is very uncommon they have spies in every corner who can carry them every whisper as punctually as the police of paris i wish i had better means of obtaining intelligence from them and watching their words and actions but information of this kind is costly beyond my revenues with great esteem c john adams john adams    september      london thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson london    september      dear sir— i have received your letter of the  th instant by colonel franks with a project of a letter to the emperor of morocco and several other papers i have had this letter fairly copied with very few and very inconsiderable alterations and have signed it i have left room enough at the beginning for you to insert or leave mr barclay to insert the emperors titles and address which may be done with the most certainty in morocco by the treaty we have with holland the statesgeneral have agreed upon requisition to second our negotiations in the most favorable manner by means of their consuls i would have prepared a memorial and requisition to that purpose and have sent it to the hague but such a memorial would publish to all the world mr barclays mission i shall wait for your advice and if you think proper i will still send a memorial but i am inclined to think we had better wait until we receive     from mr barclay in morocco some account of his prospects the best argument mr barclay can use to obtain treaties on moderate terms is that we have absolutely as yet no ships in the mediterranean sea and shall have none until treaties are made that our seamen will not go there until treaties are made that therefore the algerines will have no chance of taking any american vessels anywhere but in the atlantic and there they can expect to take but very few at a vast expense of corsairs and exposed to our privateers and frigates treaties of peace are very unpopular with the people of algiers they say it is taking from them all the opportunities of making profits by prizes for the sake of enriching the dey by presents the probability then that our trade would be more beneficial to the people than the few prizes they would have a chance to make by going at a vast expense out of the mediterranean and spreading themselves over the ocean in quest of our ships exposed to our frigates and the menofwar of portugal c would be the best reason for the dey to use with the people the common argument is the bombardments and depredations with which their enemies threaten them by their fleets and squadrons which commonly accompany the embassy mr barclay will be very naked in this respect your most humble servant john adams john adams    september      london thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson london    september      dear sir— inclosed you have in confidence some compliments give me in confidence your opinion of them is there any thing said by me which i ought not to have said is there any expression exceptionable have i compromised myself or the public in any thing more than ought to be the custom of making a speech is so settled that not only the secretary of state and the master of ceremonies but some of the foreign ministers took the pains to inform me it was indispensable otherwise being sensible of the difficulty of being complaisant enough without being too much i intended     to have delivered my credentials without saying more than that they were credentials to his majesty from the united states your friend john adams john adams thomas jefferson   october      london john jay the commissioners to john jay london   october      sir— we have the honor to transmit to congress by mr fitzhugh the treaty between the united states and the king of prussia signed separately by your ministers at the several places of their residence and by the baron de thulemeier at the hague in english and french and exchanged at the hague in presence of messrs short and dumas as this treaty may be of considerable importance to the united states and will certainly promote their reputation it is to be wished that the ratifications may be exchanged and the publication made as soon as possible the admission of our privateers into the prussian ports by a treaty signed at the moment of the negotiation of the league in which brandenburg and hanover are parties is a little remarkable it certainly merits the consideration of congress and the states with great respect c john adams paris    october      thomas jefferson john adams   october      london thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson london   october      dear sir— colonel franks arrived yesterday afternoon with your favor of the   th september i have signed all the papers as you sent them not perceiving any alterations necessary i am afraid that our agent to algiers going without any military power will not succeed as the danger of having their town bombarded or their vessels taken is the principal argument which the dey has to use with the people to reconcile them to peace however we must try the experiment i have     received a letter from mr stephen sayre dated new york   th august inclosing another of   d august signed by messrs gerry king hardy monroe and grayson recommending strongly mr sayre to you and to me to be employed as agent to morocco algiers and the other powers and inclosing another letter to you probably to the same effect this letter i now inclose you it is but a day or two those letters have been received by me franks is gone to see if mr randall can be prevailed on to go if he cannot will you join sayre with lamb if you will insert his name in the papers mr lamb will meet mr sayre at madrid where i suppose he now is but if he is not lamb must not wait for him a moment i should very willingly undertake the trouble of having bills drawn on me both by mr barclay and mr lamb if the good of the service could be promoted by it but you are sensible there must be a loss in transferring money from amsterdam to london yet the advantage may balance it you are diffident of interpositions but it is possible we may carry this too far i think mr barclay and mr lamb would do well to visit all the foreign consuls every one of them will i am persuaded show them civilities and do nothing at all to obstruct their negotiations they will not dare to do it without orders and no cabinet in europe i verily believe will venture to give such orders it will not be from governments that we shall receive opposition agents of insurance offices in london or of merchants trading in fish c in the mediterranean may stimulate the corsairs by exaggerated representations of our wealth and the riches of our prizes but that is all as nothing can be more hostile to the united states than any endeavors to embarrass obstruct or counteract them in their endeavors to form treaties of peace with the barbary powers i wish you would impress it upon mr b and mr l to be attentive to this and obtain proofs and if the consul or agent of any foreign power should be found and proved to do any thing against us that they transmit to us the earliest account of it with the evidence congress would no doubt order a formal complaint to be made against him to his court and in this way he would be held up publicly to the execrations of all mankind and probably be punished by his master       october we have prevailed on paul randall esquire to go with mr lamb so that sayre i suppose must be out of the question especially as we know not that he is arrived in europe i should think that much time might be saved by mr lambs going directly to marseilles and from thence over to algiers but if you think there will be a greater advantage in the seeing the algerine envoy at madrid or the count dexpilly if he negotiated the late treaty for spain i shall submit entirely to your judgment as our commissions authorize us i suppose it will be construed that they require us to constitute the agents by writing under our hands and seals i have accordingly made out four commissions which if you approve you will sign and seal as i have done i have written letters to mr barclay and mr lamb authorizing them to draw on me these letters you will please to sign as the signature of both of us will be necessary you will be so good also as to write to messrs willink and nicholas and jacob van staphorst of amsterdam giving your approbation and consent to their paying the bills to be drawn upon me by mr barclay and mr lamb otherwise they may think my authority alone imperfect i am sir yours c john adams thomas jefferson    october      paris john adams thomas jefferson to john adams paris    october      dear sir— colonel franks and mr randolph arrived last night this enables me to send copies of all the barbary papers to congress by the mr fitzhughs together with the prussian treaty they wait till tomorrow for this purpose considering the treaty with portugal as among the most important to the united states i some time ago took occasion at versailles to ask the portuguese ambassador if he had yet received an answer from his court on the subject of our treaty he said not but that he would write again his secrétaire     dambassade called on me two days ago and translated into french as follows a paragraph of a letter from his minister to the ambassador relativement à ce que votre excellence nous a fait part de ce quelle avoit parlé avec le ministre de lamérique cette puissance doit être déjà persuadée par des faits de la manière dont ses vaisseaux ont été accueillis ici et par conséquence sa majesté auroit beaucoup de satisfaction à entretenir une parfaite harmonie et bonne correspondance avec les mêmes états unis mais il seroit à propos de commencer par la nomination réciproque des deux parties des personnes qui au moins avec le caractère dagens informeroient réciproquement leurs constituants de ce qui pourroit conduire à la connoissance des intérêts des deux nations sans préjudice de lun ou de lautre cest le premier pas quil paroit convenable de donner pour conduire à la fin proposée by this i suppose they will prefer proceeding as spain has done and that we may consider it as definitive of our commission to them i communicate it to congress that they may take such other measures for leading on a negotiation as they may think proper you know that the third article of instructions of october         to the ministers for negotiating peace directed them to negotiate the claim for the prizes taken by the alliance and sent into bergen but delivered up by the court of denmark you recollect also that this has been deferred in order to be taken up with the general negotiation for an alliance captain jones desiring to go to america proposed to me that he should leave the solicitation of this matter in the hands of dr bancroft and to ask you to negotiate it through the minister of denmark at london the delay of baron waltersdorf is one reason for this your better acquaintance with the subject is a second the danish minister here being absent is a third and a fourth and more conclusive one is that having never acted as one of the commissioners for negotiating the peace i feel an impropriety in meddling with it at all and much more to become the principal agent i therefore told captain jones i would solicit your care of this business i believe he writes to you on the subject mr barclay sets out in two or three days lamb will follow   0 as soon as the papers can be got from this ministry having no news i shall only add c c thomas jefferson john adams    october      john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square    october      dear sir— i have received the letter you did me the honor to write me the  th september the act of congress of the   th of august which you inclose shall be communicated as directed i have the honor to agree fully with you in your opinion that it is manifestly as much the interest of this country to be well with us as for us to be well with them but this is not the judgment of the english nation it is not the judgment of lord north and his party it is not the judgment of the duke of portland and his friends and it does not appear to be the judgment of mr pitt and the present set in short it does not at present appear to be the sentiment of anybody and i am much inclined to believe they will try the issue of importance with us i have insisted upon the surrender of the posts with as much earnestness as prudence would warrant but can obtain no other answer than certain hints concerning the debts and some other points which are sufficient to convince me that the restoration of the posts will have certain conditions tacked to it i have insisted in conversation and have inquired in writing but have not yet made a formal requisition by a memorial in the name and by order of the united states if i had done it i should have compromitted my sovereign and should certainly have had no answer whenever this is done it should be followed up i shall certainly do it if i should see a moment when it can possibly prevail if it is the judgment of congress that it should be done immediately i should be glad of their orders which shall be exactly obeyed i should even wish they would prescribe to me the form of the memorial it is indeed as you observe in the power of congress to take a certain step which would be longer and more sensibly felt by britain than the independence of the united states you have not hinted at the nature of this measure i can conceive of     more than one exclusion of british ships from all our exports and a heavy duty upon british manufactures is one a defensive alliance with france spain and holland is another a case may happen in which this last might be justifiable but i presume it will not hastily be adopted nor ever without canada and nova scotia to be admitted into our confederation and one half at least of the best of the english west india islands besides stipulations for the admission of our produce freely to the french west india islands and some articles into france duty free with similar stipulations with spain and holland i hope however the first measure will be adopted forthwith and not the smallest article of our produce be permitted to be exported in british bottoms mr barclay is appointed to go to morocco and colonel franks goes with him mr lamb to algiers and paul r randall with him there will be captives to redeem as well as treaties to form i can obtain no answer from the ministry to any one demand proposal or inquiry in this i am not alone it is the complaint of all the other foreign ministers the dutch envoy particularly told me yesterday that he could obtain no answer to any of his memorials some of which were presented as long ago as last april the ministry since the ill fortune of their studies in ireland have been in a lethargy but they must soon awake mr pitt has long had with him in the country our project of a treaty and it cannot be long before he comes to some determination they have had lately evidence enough of the utility to them of the public hope of a commercial agreement with america holding up the idea of a treaty has rapidly raised the stocks but i cannot entertain any sanguine hopes for all experience all evidence seem to be lost upon this nation and its rulers according to most appearances a nation so entirely given up to the government of its passions must precipitate itself into calamities greater than it has yet felt i still think however that a decided opinion concerning the system it will pursue cannot be formed before the opening of the next budget with great esteem c john adams     john adams    october      john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square    october      dear sir— it has been the general sense of our country since the peace that it was their duty and their interest to be impartial between the powers of europe and observe a neutrality in their wars this principle is a wise one upon the supposition that those powers will be impartial to us and permit us to remain at peace but it is natural for england and france to be jealous of our neutrality and apprehensive that notwithstanding our professions we may be induced to connect ourselves with one against the other while such uncertainties and suspicions continue we may find that each of these rival kingdoms will be disposed to stint our growth and diminish our power from a fear that it will be employed against itself and in favor of its enemy if france could be sure of our perpetual alliance it is to be supposed she would favor our increase in every thing which could be reconciled to her own interest if england could obtain such an alliance with us she for the same reason would favor our interests in all cases compatible with her own i need not point out to you instances in proof of such a jealousy in france yet it may not be amiss to refer you to some hints in mr neckers late work mr hartley you will remember dwelt much too often upon the subject of an alliance with england for us to doubt that however indecent the suggestion of such an idea was he nevertheless entertained it he has lately renewed this topic with me and i gave him the only answer which can ever be given namely—that the moral character of the united states was of more importance to them than any alliance that they could not in honor hear such a proposal but that if honor and character were out of the question while england held a province in america we could not safely forfeit the confidence of france nor commit ourselves to the consistency of england but to rise higher when the king was pleased to say to me that he would be foremost in favor and friendship to the united states when he should see a disposition to give the preference to this country he probably meant more than we can     comply with if a preference in commerce only had been meant it was quite unnecessary to make it a future condition because the ardor of our citizens in transferring almost the whole commerce of the country here and voluntarily reviving that monopoly which they had long complained of as a grievance in a few of the first months of the peace imprudently demonstrated to all the world an immoderate preference of british commerce it was impossible that we could give stronger proofs of a preference in this sense if the royal expression then was a deliberate one it must have intended something more and something which the united states cannot agree to the british ministry therefore have now before them a question as important to the british empire as any that ever was agitated in it whether by evacuating the posts and fulfilling the treaty of peace in other points and by opening their ports in the west indies and on the continent of america as well as in europe to our ships and produce upon equal and fair terms they shall insure the impartiality and neutrality of america or whether by a contrary conduct they shall force them into closer connections of alliance and commerce with france spain and holland a treaty of defensive alliance with france would deserve a long and careful deliberation and should comprehend the east and west indies i mean our right to trade in them as well as many other considerations too numerous to hint at here a new treaty of commerce might be made greatly beneficial to both countries if we once see a necessity of giving preferences in trade great things may be done by the treaty between england and portugal of   th of december   0  portugal promised to admit forever into portugal the woollen cloths and the rest of the woollen manufactures of the britons as was accustomed till they were prohibited by the laws nevertheless upon this condition—ii that is to say that great britain shall be obliged forever hereafter to admit the wines of the growth of portugal into britain so that at no time whether there shall be peace or war between the kingdoms of britain and france any thing more shall be demanded for these wines by the name of customs or duty or by whatsoever title directly or indirectly whether they shall be imported into great britain in pipes or hogsheads or other casks than what shall be demanded from the like quantity or measure of french wine     deducting or abating a third part of the customs or duty but if at any time this deduction or abatement of customs shall in any manner be prejudiced it shall be just and lawful for his sacred royal majesty of portugal again to prohibit the woollen cloths and the rest of the british woollen manufactures this treaty which the irish call the methuen treaty from the name of the ambassador who signed it and which they now claim the benefit of as britons although the portuguese deny them to be britons and accordingly refuse their woollens has had a vast effect both in portugal and england the consequence has been that portugal has now for more than fourscore years clothed herself in british woollens like an english colony and has never been able to introduce woollen manufactures at home and the british islands have drank no other wine than port lisbon and madeira although the wines of france are so much better the united states may draw many useful lessons from this example if from the blind passions and rash councils of the britons they should be compelled to deviate from their favorite principle of impartiality and neutrality they might make a new commercial treaty with france for a term or forever exempting all the manufactures of france from one third or one half or all the duties which shall be stipulated to be laid upon the english manufactures in this case what becomes of the manufactures of britain what of their commerce revenue and naval power they must decline and those of her rival must rise i hint only at these things they open a wide field of inquiry and require all the thoughts of the people we should stipulate for the admission of all our produce and should agree upon a tariff of duties on both sides we should insist upon entire liberty of trade and navigation both in the east and west indies and in africa and upon the admission of our oil and fish as well as tobacco flour rice indigo potash c c this country boasts of her friends and partisans in this and the other assemblies particularly in new york and virginia and is confident we can do nothing neither exclude their ships from our exports nor lay on duties upon their imports into our states neither raise a revenue nor build a fleet if their expectations are not disappointed we shall be and that in a     few months not only a despised but a despicable people with the power in our own hands of doing as we please we shall do nothing with the means of making ourselves respected by the wise we shall become the scorn of fools i am under embarrassments in treating with the ministry here to know how far it is prudent in me to go in urging upon them what the united states may do or not do with france there would be danger of my committing congress imprudently but in conversation with friends arguments may be casually and by way of speculation only put into their mouths which they will not fail to use where they may or ought to have weight yet it is still uncertain whether any thing can have weight the ministry behave as if they saw certain ruin coming upon the nation and thought it of no importance in what shape it should appear with great respect c john adams john adams    october      john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square    october      dear sir— yesterday at eleven oclock i went by appointment to lord carmarthens office and was admitted to his lordship as soon as he arrived from his house as this was an hour earlier than the usual appearance of the foreign ministers at the secretary of states levee i had time for a long conversation with his lordship at first i presented him a memorial containing a requisition of immediate orders for the discharge of our citizens particularly of low secondly the correspondence between governor bowdoin and captain stanhope with the act of congress upon it and thirdly a letter concerning the questions some time ago communicated to your ministers at paris relative to their full powers by the duke of dorset these papers were left with his lordship for his perusal at his leisure but i conjecture he laid them before the king in a conference after the drawingroom after the communication of those papers i had the honor to observe to his lordship that although they contained matters of some importance i most sincerely wished there were nothing of greater difficulty and more danger between the two countries his lordship wished so too i added that as it     was wished on both sides it was remarkable that the business was not done as it seemed to be very easy to do that it was much to be lamented when the war was ended and every thing essential which had been in contest was decided that such circumstances as remained should impede the return of confidence between the two nations i paused here in hopes his lordship would have made some reflection or dropped some hint from whence i could have drawn some conclusion excited some hope or started some fresh topic but not a word escaped him after a long silence i told him that i hoped for an answer from his lordship concerning the posts upon the frontiers not a word of reply i said i was extremely uneasy concerning those posts that by the last accounts from america there seemed to be danger of our being involved in an indian war merely from the circumstance of their being withheld that his lordship could not be unacquainted with the cruelty and barbarity with which those savages made war upon people the most innocent peaceable and defenceless that an indian war by filling the gazettes and conversation with relations of horrors naturally spread a greater alarm and excited keener passions than other wars which might be much more destructive and impoverishing that if such a war should happen in consequence of withholding the posts it would enkindle a flame in america which might spread wider and last longer than any man could foresee that i sincerely hoped the kings ministers would think seriously of it and give orders for the evacuation that i must insist on an answer here his lordship in broken sentences expressed a wish that the ministry would answer everybody and conveyed a hint that it did not depend upon him i proceeded upon this to say that in a conference with mr pitt when i pressed him for an answer concerning the posts although he was not explicit with me i understood him to insinuate to me that the surrender of the posts would be made conditional upon something respecting the debts here i got something out his lordship said—to be sure nothing could be done until the debts were paid paid my lord that is more than ever was stipulated no government ever undertook to pay the private debts of its subjects and in this case nobody ever had such a thought the treaty only stipulated that creditors should meet with no     lawful impediment to the recovery of their debts but said his lordship if lawful impediments have been thrown in the way—and this was all he could or would let out i understood him to mean that government by putting an impediment in the way had made itself answerable for the debts themselves this was the first suggestion to me of such a thought but it was so fully communicated that i should not be surprised if a requisition should be made to that effect i proceeded with his lordship that the people in america saw the treaty violated in two important points relative to striking objects the negroes were carried off and the posts were withheld the last looked like a continuance of war it was continuing a foreign army in their territory these were the first breaches of the treaty and without them i did believe that the debtors would not have had influence enough in any assembly to have procured an act or vote to impede the course of law and if the posts were now evacuated and the negroes paid for i did not believe the impediment would be continued longer than to the meeting of the assemblies but if the removal of these impediments should be made a condition precedent to the evacuation of the posts and payment for the negroes i very much apprehended it would not be done as the english had been first in the wrong it was natural and reasonable to expect that they should be first to get right finding it impossible to learn any thing from his lordship of his own sentiments or those of his colleagues upon these points after a pause of some time i proceeded to some others and said— your lordship alone was present when the king was pleased to say to me that when he should see a disposition in the united states to give this country the preference he would be foremost in friendship to them yes i was said his lordship what greater preference my lord can be expected or reasonably desired than has been given it is not possible for one country to give another stronger proofs than america has given this of a commercial preference they have with an imprudent ardor discovered too early and too immoderate a predilection to the commerce of this country by voluntarily reviving at the peace almost the very monopoly which had been established before the war by the acts of parliament     can any other preference than a commercial one be thought of no answer is it not receiving this disposition too coldly my lord to meet it with obstructions to so many of our remittances is there not danger that the conduct of this country will change that disposition is it not easily changed does it not consist chiefly in mode and taste setting aside what there is remaining of good will between the people and if credit is the lure is it not easily counteracted we have been used to buy russian hemp and duck in london say we paid ten per cent more than it would have cost us in petersburgh and that the advantage of having it upon credit was worth to the american merchant twenty per cent by laying on a duty of ten per cent on these articles imported from london more than when imported directly from russia would not the advantage of credit be wholly counteracted by laying on fifteen per cent more would there not be an end forever to american importations of these articles by the way of london silesia linens are another article which we bought in london may not this commerce be diverted entirely to stetin and embden by a similar duty may not all sorts of manufactures in iron be bought in germany and all other manufactures in cotton linen metals silk velvet wool be in the same manner diverted from this to other countries in europe only by thus laying a bounty on the importation of them into america to be paid by those who choose to purchase in england it has become fashionable here for gentlemen to speak diminutively of american trade even among some who had magnified it while in opposition to lord north these could not certainly be sincere but be the value of it what it may can it be good policy in this country to divert it from herself and send it to her rivals for example could it be wise in the english to throw their own newfoundland fishery into the hands of the french merely to prevent americans from supplying it with provisions and necessaries in their own bottoms i was very much afraid the ministry had not yet duly considered upon what a delicate circumstance their fishery depended how easily it might be lost and how hardly recovered though the fishery was very beneficial to the public as a nursery of seamen and a source of wealth as it stood connected with various other     branches of business yet to the generality of individuals it was not very profitable with their utmost art industry and economy they could but barely live the jamaica fish as some call it or the west india fish as others named it was one third part of the whole and the preservation and sale of it was essential to the life of the fishery unfit for the european market it had never found any other consumers than the negroes and the english depended upon selling theirs to the french in their west india islands they have been able to undersell the french in their own islands why because their fishery at newfoundland being supplied from the united states at a cheaper rate than the french could be from europe they could afford to sell their fish cheaper but now the tables were turned the french are supplied from the united states and the english must be from europe the consequence of which must be that the french will very soon be able to supply their own islands cheaper than the english can and when this happens it will be very natural for them to prohibit all foreign fish american as well as english i left his lordship to judge if this was a probable means of increasing british seamen and navigation and whether it was not probable that if the americans saw the english like rash gamesters playing away their own fisheries into foreign hands they would look out for themselves and purchase of the french the admission of their fish into the islands by stipulating some equivalent for it here his lordship said he wished the council could be brought to take into consideration the relative situation of the two countries and their commerce i was in hopes he would have said more and waited long to hear but as it appeared he did not intend to be more particular i said it was surely necessary that something should be thought of and done with regard to the west india trade it would be well to consider whether the united states if they found themselves excluded from the english islands would not think it necessary to purchase a free admission of their flour and ships as well as fish and other things to perpetuity by stipulating with the french court some perpetual advantage in some particulars over the english commerce hitherto it had been the policy of the states to be impartial but if they were once driven from this principle i left his lordship to judge how far they   0 might go and ought to go i asked his lordship whether it would not be just and wise in france to stipulate with us a perpetual admission of our oil to illuminate their cities of our potash duty free of our tobacco upon easier duties and better terms in short of all the produce of our country upon better conditions of our flour fish and ships into their islands and of our ready built ships for sale into all her dominions if congress would stipulate with them a perpetual preference of french ships and manufactures over the english in america if we would stipulate to lay on duties one third or one half heavier upon english than french navigation and merchandize might we not make a profitable bargain might we not do the same with any and every other trading nation in europe necessity would force us to carry our trade where we could find a market for our produce and if england would not receive it upon living terms we must carry it to germany or the baltic to holland or the mediterranean to portugal or france to spain or even to the east indies all this was very patiently and civilly heard but not a word of answer i then asked what could be the reason that the commerce between the united states and the remaining british colonies canada and nova scotia should not be encouraged it had been found mutually beneficial heretofore and our share of the profit of it had been a source of remittance to england and would be again those colonies especially nova scotia would find it difficult to subsist without it for a long time finding however that his lordship was determined to deliver no opinions nor give the smallest hint from whence any conclusions or conjectures could be formed i asked him for his advice whether it would answer any good end for me to wait on any other of the ministers as my lord camden and the duke of richmond for example and enter into more particular conversation with them upon these subjects his lordship said lord camden was gone into the country and the duke of richmond to the distant seaports and would not be here for many weeks but mr pitt was here i replied that i had found mr pitt in the conversations i had had with him candid and intelligent and that for any thing i knew the affairs of the nation could not be in better hands but he was in a critical situation and if a foundation should be laid of a final     alienation between england and america it would be a deeper stain a blacker blot upon his administration than the indepenence of the united states had been upon that of lord north it is not worth your while nor mine to endeavor to recollect more particularly this useless conversation in which the reciprocity as lord north said on another occasion was all on one side i did not think it prudent to urge to his lordship the possibility of any other new connections between the united states and other european nations than commercial ones the possibility and the probability of a more permanent indeed of a perpetual defensive alliance between france spain holland and the united states with even ireland soliciting to be the fifth power is so obvious to common sense that one would think it could not escape the contemplation of the ministry there are persons in this kingdom sufficiently insane to say that they will bring america to petition to come again under the government of this country they will distress them till they break their faith with france and then they say we will spurn them if the king and ministry entertain such thoughts they are weaker than i ever thought them and wickeder than anybody ever represented them but although insidious policy is not a novelty in this country i do not believe them capable of such an excess of it at this time the true secret i conceive to be a real ignorance and indecision what to do they have discovered by their newfoundland bill and irish propositions a desire to preserve the principle of the navigation act against the united states both these experiments have been unfortunate the first produced the massachusetts and new hampshire navigation acts and the last procured a defeat in the parliament of ireland they are now confounded and know not whether to persevere or to retreat and i am convinced they have agreed together to observe a total silence with me until they shall come to a resolution this reserve they maintain to all others as well as to me lest any hints might escape them by which the various parties who are led by shelburne buckingham north and fox should know how to begin the foundation of their opposition they are really embarrassed for whatever treaty they make with us must be submitted to parliament either before it is signed or it must be made and signed expressly subject to     the approbation or disapprobation of parliament and they are at a loss to guess what they can carry through parliament knowing the talents of the opposition and the force of national prejudice and passion in favor of the navigation laws they are afraid to attempt what they know they ought to do this being the state of things you may depend upon it the commerce of america will have no relief at present nor in my opinion ever until the united states shall have generally passed navigation acts if this measure is not adopted we shall be derided and the more we suffer the more will our calamities be laughed at my most earnest exhortations to the states then are and ought to be to lose no time in passing such acts they will raise our reputation all over the world and will avail us in treating with france and holland as well as england for when these nations once see us in the right way and united in such measures they will estimate more highly our commerce our credit and our alliances the question has been asked in france as often as in england what have you to give in exchange for this and that particularly it was a constant question of the marechal de castries what have you to give as a reciprocity for the benefit of going to our islands when we have once made a navigation act or shown that we can unite in making one we may answer we can repeal our act or our imposts in return for your repealing yours with regard to this country i confess to you i never should have believed nor could have imagined the real situation of it if i had not been here and resided here some time i never could have conceived such an union of all parliamentary factions against us which is a demonstration of the unpopularity of our cause if the states do not make haste to confine their exports to their own ships and lay on duties upon british merchandise which shall give a decided advantage to our own manufactures and those of germany france and other nations it will be to no purpose to continue a minister here and i am sure i shall wish myself anywhere else rather than here these are remedies which congress and the states can apply i should hope they will not proceed farther at present but if these are found insufficient i hope they will think of proceeding farther in commercial treaties with other nations and reserve the resource of further alliances as a last resort     the drafts already made and the negotiations in barbary will exhaust your little fund in amsterdam and before next march all your servants in europe must return home for want of means even of subsistence unless something is done our countrymen should not expect that miracles will be wrought for their relief if their affairs are not conducted with wisdom and activity they will reap most certainly the fruits of folly and supineness before i conclude i will mention one more extravagance that i know is lurking in some hearts here they would willingly embarrass mr pitt in any rational plan of agreement with me and cheerfully precipitate him into a war with the united states if they could well knowing that it would be his ruin they think and i can add they say that canada and nova scotia must soon be ours there must be a war for it they know how it will end but the sooner the better this done we shall be forever at peace till then never but these people do not consider that this will involve us in unchangeable connections with france and prove the final ruin of this country the stocks have lately risen to sixtyfive and sixtysix whether this is owing to ministerial tricks or the real affluence of money it will raise the fund of pride and vanity in the nation in a much greater proportion and make it more difficult for the minister to do what even he may think right with america i must conclude by repeating that my only hopes are in the virtue resolution and unanimity of my fellowcitizens with great respect c john adams richard henry lee    october      new york john adams richard henry lee to john adams new york    october      dear sir— having yesterday written a long letter to you i have now only to request your attention to the following business which is of very great importance to those whom it concerns and who form a considerable portion of the citizens of these states the representatives of those professing the church of england system of religion having been lately assembled at philadelphia where lay and clerical deputies     from seven states were convened in general convention for the purpose among other things of preserving and maintaining a succession of divines in their church in a manner which they judge consonant to the gospel and no way interfering with the religious or civil rights of others have sent an address to the archbishops and bishops of england proposing a plan for the consecration of american bishops it is imagined that before any thing is done in this business by the bishops of england they will consult the king and ministry who it is apprehended may now as heretofore suppose that any step of the kind being taken in england might be considered here as an officious intermeddling with our affairs that would give offence on this side the water should this be the case the church of england members in congress have the greatest reliance on your liberal regard for the religious rights of all men that you will remove mistaken scruples from the mind of administration by representing how perfectly consonant it is with our revolution principles professed throughout all the states that every denomination of christians has a right to pursue its own religious modes interfering not with others that instead of giving offence it must give content by evidencing a friendly disposition to accommodate the people here who are members of the church in question in proof of this congress did lately show their attention to the accommodation of this class of christians by communicating to the different executives your information from the danish minister of that kings willingness to facilitate the business of ordination for our church and the assembly of virginia hath incorporated this society under which act of incorporation the convention was held in that state that sent both lay and clerical deputies to the general convention lately held in philadelphia i have the honor to be c richard henry lee john jay   november      new york john adams john jay to john adams new york   november      dear sir— the inclosed letter from president lee to you of the subject and contents of which i am informed will explain to you the design of the letters and papers which accompany this the ones to the archbishops of york and     canterbury are left open for your information and that you may the more easily determine with yourself either to deliver it in person or merely to forward it by a proper conveyance the attention you manifested to the episcopalian church in the affair of denmark has much obliged the members of it and induced them to hope for your further good offices the convention are not inclined to acknowledge or have any thing to do with mr seabury his own high church principles and the high church principles of those who ordained him do not quadrate either with the political principles of our episcopalians in general or with those on which our revolution and constitutions are founded they wish therefore to have a bishop to whom no objections of that kind can be made and that is the object of their present measures it will be much in your power to aid them in the attainment of it and for my own part i think your friendly interposition will neither disserve your country nor yourself to me personally bishops are of little importance but as our civil affairs are now circumstanced i have no objections to gratifying those who wish to have them i confess i do not like the principles of the nonjurors and i think the less patronage such opinions meet with among us the better with great and sincere esteem john jay john adams   november      westminster john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square westminster   november      dear sir— yesterday at the ministers levee one of the foreign ministers put into my hands a leyden gazette in which i found announced to the public an arrêt of the king of france of the   th of september in which a bounty of ten livres per quintal is promised to any french merchants who shall import into the market of the french west india islands or of spain portugal or italy any fish of the french fisheries and in which the impost upon all foreign fish is raised to five livres a quintal this amounts to an encouragement of fifteen livres a quintal upon french fish in the west indies as the supply of the french islands with fish is so material perhaps so essential to our fishery this ordinance deserves the     earliest and most serious attention of every man in america who has any regard to our fisheries as the supply of the french islands with fish is of so much consequence to the british fishery i took occasion in a conference with the marquis of carmarthen to mention it to him and to observe to him that i left it to his lordship to consider whether the british fisheries could be supported against the influence of this ordinance without the freest communication of supplies from the united states his lordship thought it deserved consideration and that was all the oracle would deliver i afterwards mentioned it to mr fraser his lordships under secretary of state the marquis of carmarthen that i may let you into enough of his character to account for his conduct is a modest amiable man treats all men with civility and is much esteemed by the foreign ministers as well as the nation but is not an enterprising minister is never assuming and i believe never takes upon himself to decide any point of importance without consulting the cabinet he never gives his private opinion but in all things which respect america i do not believe that he or any other of the ministry has yet formed any we shall i think learn nothing of their designs till they are brought forth in parliament in the course of the winter and spring mr pitt commenced his career with sentiments rather liberal towards the united states but since he has been prime minister he has appeared to give ear to the chancellor and lord gower mr dundas and mr jenkinson with their instruments erving chalmers smith and others so much as to have departed from his first principle he has tried the experiments of the newfoundland bill and the fourth irish proposition but finding the fatal success of both he may be brought back to the system with which he set out but i doubt it or rather i am convinced he never will until he is obliged to it by our states adopting navigation acts there is published this morning in the chronicle the proceedings at charleston on the   th august which look very encouraging if the legislature of south carolina lay partial restrictions on the ships of such nations as have no treaty of commerce with the united states i think it cannot be doubted that all the other states will come into the measure because     there is none which will suffer a greater temporary inconvenience by it these measures have a tendency to encourage the naval stores of north carolina so much that she will be a gainer but the principal danger is that these restrictions may not be sufficiently high to give a clear advantage to the ships of the united states i cannot repeat to you too often sir that all my hopes are founded upon such exertions in america the trade with america must come under consideration of parliament in the renovation of the intercourse act if not of the newfoundland act and their deliberations will be influenced by nothing but american navigation acts i fear there are not enough of these yet made nor likely to be made this year to have much effect this nation is strangely blinded by prejudice and passion they are ignorant of the subject beyond conception there is a prohibition of the truth arising from popular anger printers will print nothing which is true without pay because it displeases their readers while their gazettes are open to lies because they are eagerly read and make the paper sell scribblers for bread are wholly occupied in abusing the united states and writers for fame if there are any such left in this country find the public applause wholly against us the rise of the stocks has established mr pitt and if he were willing he would scarcely be able to do right until america shall enable him and oblige him i am sir c john adams john adams   november      westminster john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square westminster   november      dear sir— the chevalier de pinto envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary from portugal after a long absence by leave of his court is lately arrived here from lisbon upon several occasions when i met him at court and upon visits he told me that he had orders from his court to confer with me upon the project of a treaty between the united states and portugal but he never descended to particulars till yesterday     when he called upon me and said that before he left lisbon his court had learned that i was in england and had charged him to enter into conference with me concerning that project of a treaty which had been transmitted to his court by the count de souza that the portuguese ministry notwithstanding their high esteem for their ambassador in france knowing that he lived in the country and was in distress did not choose that the negotiation should be any longer conducted by him but had committed the project to their envoy at the court of england and had instructed him to assure me that the court of lisbon was sincerely desirous of entering into a treaty of commerce with the united states of america a power with which it was more convenient for portugal to trade than any other but there were some things in the plan proposed which were inadmissible particularly the americans could never be admitted into the brazils it was impossible it was the invariable maxim of their court to exclude all nations from those territories and having himself served for some years as governorgeneral of one of the brazils he knew it was a policy from which his court could never on any condition depart that it was a great compliment to him to be preferred to the count de souza for the conduct of such a negotiation that he made no pretensions to such merit but readily acknowledged the superiority of the ambassador but it was the pleasure of his court and he had no right to dispute it i answered that i had no authority to treat but in conjunction with mr jefferson the minister plenipotentiary of the united states at the court of versailles that the full power to treat with portugal was to mr jefferson and me jointly so that i could conclude nothing without his concurrence nor carry on any conferences without communicating them to him to this i supposed he could have no objection he said none at all his first instruction was he said to confer with me concerning the mutual wants and several productions of our countries which might be the objects of commerce his countrymen wanted he said grain i asked if they did not want flour he said he was not precisely instructed concerning flour but they had mills in portugal which they wished to employ i replied that in every negotiation i thought there ought to be     a mutual consideration of each others profits and losses advantages and disadvantages so that the result might be equitable and give satisfaction on both sides that a commerce founded upon compacts made upon this principle would ever be carried on with more pleasure and to better effect that we had mills which we wished to employ as well as portugal and mills as costly and as good as those of any nation in this respect then our pretensions were mutual and equal but there were other particulars in which without benefit to portugal the loss to the united states would be very great the commodity was more difficult to preserve in grain than in flour it was more exposed to the insect and to heat both at home and upon the passage by which means the loss upon wheat was much greater than that upon flour that it would not be equitable then for portugal to receive wheat to the exclusion of flour that this was a point of so much importance that it would facilitate the treaty and encourage the commerce if his court should think fit to agree to receive our flour he said he had not precise instructions but he would write to his court particularly upon this subject the next article wanted by the portuguese was lumber of various sorts particularly staves for pipes in large quantities they wanted also ship timber pitch tar and turpentine potash for their manufactures of glass iron masts yards and bowsprits furs ginseng and above all salt fish the consumption of this article in portugal he said was immense and he would avow to me that the american salt fish was preferred to any other on account of its quality here you see says the chevalier de pinto is a catalogue of articles which the portuguese will want in larger or smaller quantities now what are the articles you can take in america in exchange it behoves my nation to inquire what they can supply yours with otherwise the balance in your favor may be too ruinous to us it happens unluckily for portugal that the americans have no occasion for our principal commodities which are tobacco rice indigo c the produce of the brazils i replied that the united states had been used to take considerable quantities of madeira lisbon and port wines fruits olive oil salt c he asked why we could not take tea from lisbon they imported from the east large quantities and very good the english east india company   0 had purchased of them this year teas to the amount of forty thousand pounds and he thought they could sell it to us cheaper than we bought it elsewhere they could supply us likewise with other east india goods perhaps we intended to supply ourselves by a direct trade to india he was glad to hear that our first enterprises had succeeded but if we continued to take any part of our consumption from europe they could supply us as cheaply as any other nation sugar too the produce of the brazils they could furnish to us of as good quality as english or french and much cheaper if we should think of manufactures among ourselves they could let us have wool of the same quality with the spanish and cotton in any quantities we might want if we made chocolate they could sell us cocoa indeed they had woollen manufactures and could afford us cloth as good and cheap as other nations these were things i replied in which the merchants on both sides should speculate if the united states should proceed in the plan already begun of encouraging their own manufactures the raw materials of wool and cotton would be in demand and if they persevered in their measures for encouraging their own navigation they would want large quantities of hemp sail cloth c from the baltic and for what i knew they might find their account in taking sugars cotton cocoa c at lisbon to carry as remittances to petersburgh and stockholm they might even upon some occasions purchase tobacco rice and indigo for the same market as well as the mediterranean if that sea should be open to our ships but all these things would depend upon the facilities given to our commodities by the treaty nothing would contribute so much to promote the trade as their receiving our flour without duties or discouragements our ready built ships too were an article of importance to us he said he did not know that our ready built ships were prohibited i asked if they could not take our spermaceti oil to burn in their lamps or for any other uses he said no they had such an abundance of oil made in the country of olives which grew there that they had no occasion for their own spermaceti oil which they sold to spain they had now a very pretty spermaceti whale fishery which they had learned of the new englanders and carried on upon the coast of brazil i asked if they could not take our spermaceti candles and burn     them in their churches he said they made some wax in portugal and some in brazil but he would own it was not enough for their consumption the surplus they bought in italy and barbary at a dear rate at length i observed to the chevalier that portugal abounded in two articles which would be extremely convenient to my fellowcitizens in which she might always balance accounts with us to our entire satisfaction whether we should take more or less of their other commodities these were silver and gold than which no kind of merchandise was in greater demand or had a higher reputation the chevalier thought the taste of his countrymen so much like ours that they had rather pay us in any thing else i added if the conduct of the court of st james should oblige the united states to make a navigation act their commerce must increase with portugal a navigation act said he why there is not a nation in europe that would suffer a navigation act to be made in any other at this day the english navigation act was made in times of ignorance when few nations cultivated commerce and no court but this understood or cared any thing about it but at present all courts were attentive to it for his part if he were minister in portugal he would not hesitate to exclude from her ports the ships of any nation that should make such an act i replied that i did not mean a navigation act against any nation but this but if the english persevered in enforcing their act against us we could do no other than make one against them the chevalier said we should be perfectly in the right the courts of europe had a long time cried out against this act of the english if it were now to begin it would not be submitted to this observation is just and it may be carried farther i do not believe the british navigation act can last long at least i am persuaded if america has spirit enough umbone repellere umbonem that all other nations will soon follow her example and the apprehension of this would be alone sufficient if thinking beings governed this island to induce them to silence america by giving her satisfaction but they rely upon our disunion and think it will be time enough when we shall have shown that we can agree the chevalier concluded the conference by saying that he would write to his court for farther information and instructions     and as i understood him for full powers but before he went away he said he had orders from his court to inquire of me what were the sentiments of congress upon the head of ministers and consuls whether they would send a minister and consul to lisbon his court had a mind to send somebody to the united states but etiquette required that congress should send in return to portugal i answered that in the project of a treaty which was in his possession there was an article that each party should have a right to send consuls so that when the treaty was concluded portugal would be at liberty to send when she would as to ministers i had no instructions but there could be no doubt that if their majesties of portugal thought proper to send an ambassador of any denomination he would be received by congress with all the respect due to his character and his sovereign he said if there was a treaty there ought to be ministers i could not answer to this particularly for want of instructions but congress had as yet but few ministers abroad and indeed they had not found many gentlemen disposed to quit the delights of their own families and connections and the esteem of their fellowcitizens for the sake of serving in europe and here ended the conversation with great esteem c john adams p s i forgot to mention in its place that i asked the chevalier about our ships being admitted to the portuguese island of macao in the east indies he said that would be of importance to us for he did not see how the commerce with china could be carried on without the use of that island as there were certain seasons of the year when european ships and american too he supposed could not be admitted into canton but our ships should enjoy the benefit of their island as fully as any nation in europe you will perceive sir by this conference what is more and more manifest every day that there is and will continue a general scramble for navigation carrying trade ship building fisheries are the cry of every nation and it will require all the skill and firmness of the united states to preserve a reasonable share of their own they have brought treaties of commerce so much into fashion that more have been made since     the american war and are now in negotiation than had been made for a century before courts which never made one before are now proposing them to several others portugal is supposed to be pushing for one with russia and if we have heretofore been discouraged and thwarted in any attempts it was by those who meant to be beforehand with us in proposals which they taught us to believe it unnecessary and beneath our dignity to make france does not now think it beneath her dignity to propose a treaty with russia nor do french or english newspapers under the direction of their courts think it beneath them to fill all europe with reports of our disunion and of the want of powers in congress to make treaties in order to keep us back the fatal policy of obstructing and delaying our treaties of commerce especially with england has thrown american merchants into their present distress and not only prevented our acquiring fresh advantages in trade by the revolution but taken from us many sources which we enjoyed before our countrymen partly from penury and partly from fondness have been too easily drawn into the snare j a john adams    november      john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square    november      dear sir— there is no better advice to be given to the merchants of the united states than to push their commerce to the east indies as fast and as far as it will go if information from persons who ought to know may be depended upon the tobacco and peltries as well as the ginseng of the united states are proper articles for the china market and have been found to answer very well and many other of our commodities may be found in demand there but there is another resource which may prove of equal value at present there are many persons in the european factories in india particularly the english who have accumulated large property which they wish to transmit to europe but have not been able to do it on account of the distance and the scarcity of freights     these would be glad to sell us their commodities and take our bills of exchange upon europe or america payable in twelve or eighteen months possibly in longer periods these facts are known to individuals in america but will probably be concealed from the public at large lest the speculators and adventurers should be too numerous for the profit of a few the states may greatly encourage these enterprises by laying on duties upon the importation of all east india goods from europe and indeed by proceeding in time to prohibitions this however may never be necessary duties judiciously calculated and made high enough to give a clear advantage to the direct importation from india will answer the end as effectually as prohibitions and are less odious and less liable to exceptions we should attend to this intercourse with the east with the more ardor because the stronger footing we obtain in those countries of more importance will our friendship be to the powers of europe who have large connections there the east indies will probably be the object and the theatre of the next war and the more familiar we are with every thing relating to that country the more will the contending parties desire to win us to their side or at least what we ought to wish for most to keep us neutral much will depend upon the behavior of our people who may go into those countries if they endeavor by an irreproachable integrity humanity and civility to conciliate the esteem of the natives they may easily become the most favored nation for the conduct of european nations in general heretofore has given us a great advantage east india manufactures in silk and cotton c are prohibited in england and as we have no such prohibitions in america because we have no such manufactures for them to interfere with we may take them to a great advantage i am c john adams     john adams    november      john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square    november      dear sir— i was yesterday honored with your letter of the   th of october accompanied with the gazettes and the act of congress of the   th september you will learn from mr dumass letters as well as by the public papers that the treaty of defensive alliance between france and holland was signed at paris on the  0th of this month the vain exertions of the cabinet of st james to prevent it are so far from being a secret that the english or orange party which is the same have inserted them in their own courier du bas rhin the offers are there stated to have been the restitution of negapatnam the renunciation of the navigation of the moluccas the payment of the millions to the emperor the warranty of the new treaty with the emperor and the alteration of the navigation act in favor of holland sir james harris with his secretary of legation and three clerks are said to have been very busy night and day but all to no purpose it is not at all to be wondered at that british ministers should be alarmed the only wonder is that they did not foresee and prevent the danger two years ago by an honest settlement with america and less costly offers to holland they might have maintained their rank among the powers of europe it is now lost forever the loss of the empire of the seas which their ambition has long aspired to and which their arrogance has long claimed would be a benefit to mankind and no real evil to them but they will now find it difficult to defend their liberty upon the seas and if the united states of america should accede to this defensive alliance upon any reasonable terms think of it as they will their navigation their possessions in the east and the west and their empire will be at mercy i am not informed whether congress have any such measure in contemplation but if they have they ought not to delay it from any expectation of any thing that i can do here so far from entertaining any sanguine hopes i think there is scarcely a possibility that i should do any thing there are divisions in the ministry thurlow gower dundas and jenkinson are of     the old leaven and the king will have them or some other of the same stamp to govern pitt is but a tool and an ostensible pageant a nose of tender virgin wax he could not carry in parliament nor in the cabinet any honest system with america if he meant to do it but he is himself very far from being steady in his american politics any more than camden or richmond and sidney and carmarthen are ciphers this is naked truth but i should be unworthy of your confidence if i did not expose it to you although your prudence and that of congress will not proclaim it to the world this great event of the french and dutch alliance must awaken the feelings of this nation if they have any left and it affords the only opportunity which has yet presented for offering with any propriety a memorial concerning the evacuation of the frontier posts it would have looked somewhat too emphatic to have gone with a memorial the first moment of the arrival of the news and it would be imprudent to delay it till the whole impression is worn off as a medium then i have concluded on the day of the next stated conferences of the foreign ministers which will be next thursday before the drawing room to wait on lord carmarthen with a memorial requiring in the name of the united states the evacuation of all the posts it will not be done however and i shall have no answer they have not the courage to refuse any more than to comply i have no answer to any of my letters or memorials to the ministry nor do i expect any before next spring perhaps not then there is no resource for me in this nation the people are discouraged and dispirited from the general profligacy and want of principle from the want of confidence in any leaders from the frequent disappointments and impositions they have experienced in turn from all parties patriotism is no more nor is any hypocrite successful enough to make himself believed to be one fox and his friends and patrons are ruined by the endless expenses of the last elections and have no longer any spirit or any enterprise north and his friends are afraid of impeachments and vengeance and therefore will avoid all hazardous experiments by which the popular cry might be excited     i see nothing therefore to prevent the states from completing their measures for the encouragement of their own manufactures and navigation or from deliberating upon a new treaty of commerce with france or even a new alliance you might probably purchase a market for your ready built ships and your oil c in france and the admission of your flour and all other things to their islands by stipulating to lay greater duties upon british than french ships and goods to lay duties upon english west india rum in favor of french brandies c but in these things i think we need not be in haste mr barclay and mr franks are gone to morocco and mr lamb and mr randall to algiers as i suppose russia as well as portugal are piqued at present with this court and count woronzow has several times lately asked a friend of mine why the united states did not make advances to his mistress our commissions for treating with the powers of europe expire next june long before we shall have completed the business congress will determine whether to renew them i have the honor to be c john adams john adams    november      john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square    november      dear sir— i should have added in my letter of this day that shelburne professes to be steady to the principle which he adopted at the peace and if he were to come in he would do something if he could but as an irishman he is hated both by the english and scotch nobility as marquis of lansdown he is envied for his elevation over older families and he seems to have no sufficient connections to support a vigorous administration nor do i learn there is any probability of his coming in indeed i think this nation will have dangerous convulsions the nobility are poor in debt and distressed and at present the great families are all out of power ireland will give them trouble and no one can say what events may turn up from day to day if the stocks can be supported however the calm will continue but it is doubtful whether this can be there is no question more frequently asked me by the foreign ministers than what can be the reason of such frequent divisions     of states in america and of the disposition to crumble into little separate societies whereby there seems to be danger of multiplying the members of the confederation without end or of setting up petty republics unacknowledged by the confederacy and refusing obedience to its laws in the infancy of societies men have generally been too little informed in their understandings and too much given up to the government of their passions to associate in large communities but experience has shown them the ill effects of too many divisions spain was not long ago divided into ten or twelve kingdoms ten of them are now united in one france was once divided into twelve states now all incorporated into one kingdom scotland was formerly divided into two kingdoms and england into seven these are all now in one one must read many volumes of history to see the miseries arising from those petty divisions of mankind and the immense expense of blood and treasure which it cost them to learn by experience the necessity of uniting in larger bodies i have not information enough of the facts in any particular instance to apply these reflections to any particular case but the frequent accounts we have in europe of new states springing up out of fragments of old ones and the numerous proposals of more do us much harm abroad they are considered as proofs of an impatience of temper a restlessness of disposition that will give us much inconvenience will weaken us and endanger our confederation it is the earnest wish of all who desire our prosperity that this dangerous spirit may be checked as far as it can be consistently with reason and justice it gives me pleasure to learn that doctor franklin is arrived in so good health and that he is happy in philadelphia and i wish very sincerely that his great age and singular reputation may give him a dominion over the minds of the people sufficient to reconcile them to certain amendments in the constitution of pennsylvania without which that respectable commonwealth from the very nature of man and society must forever remain a prey to unbalanced parties i have not had the time to send you copies of the letters which passed between me and mr fagel and mr dumas upon my arrival here if mr dumas has done it i am much obliged     to him and it will be unnecessary for me to repeat them i wish a minister may be soon sent there but it is doubtful whether anybody can be found to accept of an appointment abroad and you will not be surprised at the reluctance with great regard c john adams william white    november      philadelphia john adams william white to john adams philadelphia    november      sir— i presume on the circumstance of being not entirely unknown to your excellency to offer to you the inclosed papers knowing that the president of congress has already written to you on the subject of them as you formerly sir communicated to congress information of the friendly dispositions of the danish government and clergy towards the episcopal church in these states it may be proper for me to state to you the reason of the nonacceptance of their kind offer of ordaining for us however gratefully we acknowledge the favor as well as your excellencys liberal intention to serve us on that occasion i believe i might mention that there are objections against the succession of the danish bishops but i have not sufficiently informed myself of the constitution of that church to say any thing more on this head i might also mention that before the information reached us of a door being opened in that quarter an act had passed the british parliament allowing the bishop of london to admit to the orders of priest and deacon persons out of allegiance to the king without administering the oaths but sir it is the wish of all the well informed members of our church to be independent and selfgoverned principally from a conviction of the unhappy influence which a foreign spiritual jurisdiction has always maintained in civil matters wherever it has been acknowledged this we have severely felt in the late war and if persevered in it must at last be fatal either to our church or to the commonwealth in those states at least where the members of our communion are a majority of the people there is nothing wanting to the establishing of our constitution but the obtaining the episcopal succession in   0 the first instance from the english bishops which we trust will fix our church on such a footing as must be desired by all who wish well to the present civil system of confederate america should any political objection arise from the british ministry on the point of delicacy as to intermeddling with the concerns of this country i cannot doubt of your excellencys endeavors to remove it with my best wishes c i have the honor to subscribe myself william white p s the specimens of the prayer book herewith inclosed go as far as the press has yet furnished john adams   december      westminster john jay to secretary jay  grosvenor square westminster   december      dear sir— i am anxious to convey to you if i can in as strong a light as that in which i see it myself the impossibility of our doing any thing satisfactory with this nation especially under this ministry that the states may neither neglect nor delay any measure which they would judge necessary or expedient upon the certainty that england will not alter her conduct in order to do this i must be allowed to write freely things which congress ought to know but to keep secret i know how much i expose myself but as i have hitherto made it my rule as much as i could to conceal nothing which i thought necessary to be known whatever might be the consequence to myself i shall not now begin a new system and shall only request that a reasonable caution may be observed not to injure a man merely for discharging a disagreeable part of his duty the king i really think is the most accomplished courtier in his dominions with all the affability of charles ii he has all the domestic virtues and regularity of conduct of charles i he is the greatest talker in the world and has a tenacious     memory stored with resources of small talk concerning all the little things of life which are inexhaustible but so much of his time is and has been consumed in this that he is in all the great affairs of society and government as weak as far as i can judge as we ever understood him to be in america he is also as obstinate the unbounded popularity acquired by his temperance and facetiousness added to the splendor of his dignity gives him such a continual feast of flattery that he thinks all he does is right and he pursues his own ideas with a firmness which would become the best system of action he has a pleasure in his own will and way without which he would be miserable which seems to be the true principle upon which he has always chosen and rejected ministers he has an habitual contempt of patriots and patriotism at least for what are called in this country by those names and takes a delight in mortifying all who have any reputation for such qualities and in supporting those who have a contrary character upon this principle only can i account for the number of tories who were forced into the administration of the earl of shelburne the duke of portland and of mr pitt and for the immoderate attachment to american refugees which has appeared in all of them mr pitt is very young he has discovered abilities and firmness upon some occasions but i have never seen in him any evidence of greater talents than i have seen in members of congress and in other scenes of life in america at his age i have not yet seen any decided proofs of principle or patriotism or virtue on the contrary there are many symptoms of the want of these qualities without which no statesman ever yet appeared uniformly great or wrought out any memorable salvation for any country in american affairs he has oscillated like a pendulum and no one can yet guess when he will be fixed his attention appears to have been chiefly given to two objects—preserving tranquillity and raising the stocks his attention to these would have been laudable if he had not neglected others equally essential in the end though not so urgent for the present the discontents of the nation arising from their late disappointments disgraces and humiliations as well as the pressure of taxes would have broken out into seditions if the ministers had not studiously avoided every thing     which could raise a clamor or operate forcibly upon popular passions and if the stocks could not have been supported all would have been distraction at once with all his care he has barely escaped from more furious tumults at the expense of a few stones thrown at his carriage and a few executions in effigy the stocks he has raised and if he can keep them up they will support him and intoxicate the nation to such a degree that i presume it will be impossible for him to pursue that system towards america and ireland which is indispensable for the complete preservation of the remainder of the empire the chancellor mr dundas mr jenkinson and lord gower being of the old set of kings friends it may be easily supposed that they are masters of his character that they think and feel like him and consequently that they embarrass mr pitt whenever his principles interfere with the kings to this probably is owing the late accession to the league in germany which the chancellor of the exchequer is thought to have opposed to the same cause we may ascribe the undecided conduct towards holland where sir james harris is as complete a cipher as the baron de lynden and i have the honor to be at st jamess the king has been amused by his old deceivers who are very much alike in america holland and ireland by assurances that the prince of orange and his party would get the upper hand and that the populace would rise to de witt the patriots under this fond delusion the time has been dreamed away and those offers were delayed until they were too late to have any effect which if they had been made in season would have preserved the friendship or at least the neutrality of the dutch to this country lord camden and the duke of richmond if they ever had any just notions of the relation between england and america are become soured by the company they keep and if they are not inimical they are at least peevish and fretful upon every subject that concerns us lord carmarthen is rich and of high rank very civil and obliging but is not enough of a man of business to have influence in the cabinet or to project or conduct any thing lord sidney with less wealth and a lower rank has all the other parts of the same character if these traits of character are just you will easily be convinced     that we cannot expect from the present ministry any reasonable arrangement with america for some time if we look to opposition we see no better prospects lord north is supposed to have great influence but how by being at the head of the landed gentlemen which is but another term for the tory interest if he should depart from their system he would lose all consideration mr fox has never been steady in american politics and he has not at present the spirit to take any decided part the marquis of lansdown would be more liberal but he has no chance to come in and if he had he would not be able to carry any plan into execution so numerous and violent from all quarters would be the opposition to him the marquis of buckingham has some good opinions of american commerce but although he is celebrated for minute details of information in american affairs by all i can learn of him he has lost his judgment and the true system in the chaos of these very minutiæ and besides he is extremely odious to great multitudes of the first people add to all these unfavorable considerations that the stocks are at a great height and the nation consequently in high spirits as they have now evidence as they think that their commerce flourishes and their credit is established without a treaty with the united states and without opening the west indies or canada nova scotia and newfoundland to us without taking off the alien duty upon oil or admitting our ready built ships for sale they will not now think it necessary to do any of these things the general opinion is that an act of parliament will be made at the ensuing session placing the united states upon the footing of the most favored nation and then let things take their course let the united states do as they please lay on duties or prohibitions or make navigation acts as they judge proper france is not idle amidst all this the language they hold is that of perpetual and universal peace their ambassadors in all the courts of europe speak in this style the corps diplomatique here have it familiarly in their mouths that the courts of london and versailles have now the best dispositions towards each other and that there is every prospect of a long peace between them and there is such a fund of gullibility in this nation that these lullabies soothe them into a     perfect security indeed it is possible the peace may be maintained for ten or a dozen years long enough for the english to get a little money to go to war again but if at the end of fifteen or twenty years the navies of bourbon and holland should be pitted against that of great britain and especially if the united states should join their privateers and aids to the confederacy the crisis of the british empire will then be complete and its destruction certain some men see it but posterity and futurity though not very distant appear to be less attended to in this country at present than in any other in the world present advantage is all they aim at present evil all they hope to shun no briton would deserve the character of a statesman without a comprehensive view of the interests of the nation relative to their liberties and form of government relative to their manufactures commerce and navigation relative to their foreign dominions in asia africa america and in europe relatively to all the other powers of europe especially their ancient enemies who have always endangered their existence i mean the house of bourbon and their ancient friends who have assisted in supporting them and rearing up their wealth and power i mean the dutch and the united states of america and all these relatively to the interests of posterity and future ages but i have not seen the least appearance of any man in the three kingdoms among the men in power who answers this description lansdown is the most like it but his integrity is suspected his selfishness is acknowledged and his influence far from great the posts upon our frontier give me great uneasiness the ministers and people are so assured of peace with all their neighbors in europe that they hold all we can do in indifference they think that if we should raise an army and take these posts as we have a right to do it would not oblige them to go to war with us but if we should march an army to quebec and take it and another to nova scotia and take that it would be no great harm to them if we should fit out privateers against their trade they could easily send a line of frigates along our coast that would do us more harm so that they are quite easy but they rely upon it that we shall not raise an army to take the posts the expense and difficulty they know will be great and therefore they think they may     play with us as long as they please the refugees are doing all they can to persuade the king and ministry to build other forts on their side of the lakes to build a fleet of armed ships upon the lakes and to negotiate with all the indian nations in order to attach them to their side if these people can prevail our posts will not be evacuated until this new system is accomplished the resolutions of some of the united states staying proceedings at law for old debts and some other resolutions concerning the tories represented to have been in some instances contrary to the treaty will be the pretence in short sir i am like to be as insignificant here as you can imagine i shall be treated as i have been with all the civility that is shown to other foreign ministers but shall do nothing i shall not even be answered at least this is my opinion but congress will no doubt insist upon an answer perhaps it may be most convenient to wait till spring and until the session of parliament is over that we may have a full knowledge of their designs it is most certain that what is called high language which you and i have heard so much of in the course of our lives would be misplaced here at this time it would not be answered with high language but with what would be more disagreeable and perplexing—with a contemptuous silence to borrow an expression from the late governor bernard i find myself at the end of my tether no step that i can take no language i can hold will do any good or indeed much harm it is congress and the legislatures of the states who must deliberate and act at present the only system they can pursue to help themselves is to complete their regulations for the encouragement of their own manufactures and navigation to consider of more intimate commercial connections with france and other nations of europe to push their trade to the east indies and perhaps to extend even their political connections with france and holland how far it will be wise to go in these projects i pretend not to judge but i hope they will proceed with caution and deliberation the united states stand upon high ground and they will consider whether it would not even be descending to form any closer political connections at present they are certainly at present on vantage ground if     they can unite in a system if not they must trust to the chapter of accidents with great regard c john adams john adams   december      john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square   december      dear sir— if the facts which i have had the honor to state to you in my preceding letters are credited i think it will appear that the connections of these kingdoms with foreign powers every idea of the balance of europe the dominions of great britain in asia and america and all considerations of posterity are sacrificed to a momentary tranquillity and credit from which premises it will be easy to conclude what will be the effect of the memorial a copy of which is here enclosed and which i shall certainly present tomorrow it will not be answered in any manner it is generally said things must take their course we must take our chance and meet the consequences of all the combinations of our rivals we must risk it c it is commonly said that ministry will bring in an act of parliament at their next session placing the united states upon the footing of the most favored nation and then let them do what they please thus i find myself at a full stop i shall not neglect any opportunity to say or do whatever may have the least tendency to do any good but it would be lessening the united states if i were to tease ministers with applications which would be answered only by neglect and silence i shall transmit you every thing i can which may afford you any information but i think congress cannot avoid instructing me to demand an answer and to take my leave and return to america if it is not given me in a reasonable time in the spring it is now with the states to determine whether there is or is not a union in america if there is they may very easily make themselves respected in europe if there is not they will be little regarded and very soon at war with england as i verily believe i should advise all the great seaport towns to think a little of the means of defence put the fortifications they have in as good order as they can furnish themselves with arms     and ammunition and put the militia through the continent upon as good a footing as may be i have little reliance on our negotiations in barbary the presents we have to offer will i fear be despised we shall learn by them however what will be necessary and congress will determine what we must do mr lamb and mr randall are gone mr barclay has been detained by monsieur beaumarchais accounts but i hope will go soon if all intercourse between europe and america could be cut off forever if every ship we have were burnt and the keel of another never to be laid we might still be the happiest people upon earth and in fifty years the most powerful the luxuries we import from europe instead of promoting our prosperity only enfeeble our race of men and retard the increase of population but the character of our people must be taken into consideration they are as aquatic as the tortoises and seafowl and the love of commerce with its conveniences and pleasures is a habit in them as unalterable as their natures it is in vain then to amuse ourselves with the thought of annihilating commerce unless as philosophical speculations we are to consider men and things as practical statesmen and to consider who our constituents are and what they expect of us upon this principle we shall find that we must have connections with europe asia and africa and therefore the sooner we form those connections into a judicious system the better it will be for us and our children we may now take measures which may save us many miseries and a vast expense of blood we shall find that nothing can be done in europe but by keeping up the dignity of the united states and that dignity in europe is a very different thing from that which is and ought to be dignity in america i have the honor to be c john adams john adams a memorial the subscriber minister plenipotentiary from the united states of america has the honor to represent to the ministry of his britannic majesty that by the seventh article of the preliminary     treaty of peace between his majesty and the united states of america signed at paris on the thirtieth day of november one thousand seven hundred and eightytwo confirmed by the definitive treaty of peace signed at paris on the third day of september one thousand seven hundred and eightythree it was stipulated that his britannic majesty should with all convenient speed and without causing any destruction or carrying away any negroes or other property of the american inhabitants withdraw all his armies garrisons and fleets from the said united states and from every port place and harbor within the same leaving in all fortifications the american artillery that may be therein that although a period of three years has elapsed since the signature of the preliminary treaty and of more than two years since that of the definitive treaty the posts of oswegatchy oswego niagara presque isle sandusky detroit michillimachinac with others not necessary to be particularly enumerated and a considerable territory around each of them all within the incontestable limits of the said united states are still held by british garrisons to the loss and injury of the said united states the subscriber therefore in the name and behalf of the said united states and in obedience to their express commands has the honor to require of his britannic majestys ministry that all his majestys armies and garrisons be forthwith withdrawn from the said united states from all and every of the posts and fortresses hereinbefore enumerated and from every other port place and harbor within the territory of the said united states according to the true intention of the treaties aforesaid done at westminster this thirtieth day of november one thousand seven hundred and eightyfive john adams john adams   december      westminster john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square westminster   december      dear sir— i went to court yesterday morning if not in despair with very faint hopes of ever receiving an answer to     any letter or memorial of mine to the british ministry i went early but found three of the foreign ministers before me the rule is to admit them to his lordship in the order in which they arrive in my turn i was shown into his lordships apartment received very politely as usual and very much surprised to be accosted by him with mr adams i am about to write to you officially i have received a letter from lord howe relative to your communication concerning the behavior of a captain of a man of war at boston the admiralty letter is very long and i shall send you a copy of it i am also to answer your memorial concerning the seamen the ship is ordered and expected home from the east indies and when she arrives the man you applied for will be discharged and orders are gone to portsmouth to discharge the other sailor whom you mentioned this last requires some explanation as i have not mentioned it before to you some time ago i received a letter from a man at portsmouth who called himself an american and desiring me to apply for his discharge but as i had no orders from congress concerning him nor any other information than his own letter i thought it not safe to apply officially in his behalf when i delivered my memorial demanding the discharge of the sailors in general i showed this mans letter to his lordship and left it with him and it has had it seems a better fortune than i expected i replied to his lordship that i was very happy to hear that i was soon to have an official answer for that whenever we could come to communicate officially and freely i hoped we might gradually remove all difficulties we fell then into some conversation upon another point but as nothing new was said on either side and i could learn nothing new from him it would be fatiguing you to no purpose to repeat it one thing however his lordship said in the course of conversation namely—that he could not yet give me any satisfaction upon any other point because nothing was yet determined mr pitt had all my papers under consideration and had not yet determined any thing at length i presented to his lordship the memorial of the  0th november a copy of which is here inclosed i do not expect an answer till next summer but i thought it safest for the united states to have it presented because without   0 it some excuses or pretences might have been set up that the evacuations had not yet been formally demanded with great esteem c john adams john adams   january      john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square   january      dear sir— i have only time to acquaint you that since my last there have been some appearances of an intention in ministry to take up american affairs lord carmarthen and mr pitt have certainly had conferences with committees of merchants who have represented to them the necessity of arrangements with the united states upon terms which will give satisfaction nevertheless i have no confidence in this at all and i think that congress and the states should not relax in any measure in consequence of it mr pitt did say to mr campbell the principal man among them that mr adams the american minister was well disposed to a friendly settlement and had made some propositions to the kings ministers who were also well disposed he was very inquisitive whether they had seen mr adams they answered they had not and that they were not known to him in the business this was true in a literal sense but in fact they had taken pains to give me circuitous information that they had been consulted by lord carmarthen and to desire of me such information as i could give them and i had by means of colonel smith conveyed to the sight of a person in their confidence some papers containing such matter as i thought might be trusted to them in such a mysterious way the representation they have made is very strong as they say but i cannot yet obtain a copy of it they pretend to say that mr pitt assured them their report had given him new light and they think america may have whatever she desires except a free trade with the west india islands this will prove only a delusion for if the ministry really are desirous of an equitable settlement i am well persuaded they cannot yet carry it in parliament so that i hope the states will persevere in their own measures and that even all the southern states will at least lay heavy duties upon the tonnage of such nations as     have not treaties with us and prohibit the importation in their bottoms of any merchandises except the produce of the country to which they belong even the importation of irish linens in british bottoms should be forbidden as well as silesia linens hemp and duck from russia and iron from sweden wines from portugal goods from the east indies c with great regard c john adams john adams   january      london john jay to john jay london   january      dear sir— a day or two after the receipt of your letter of november  st and that of president lee which came with it i wrote to the archbishop of canterbury by colonel smith for an hour when i might have the honor to pay my respects to his grace and was answered very politely that he would be glad to have the honor of seeing me next day between eleven and twelve accordingly i went yesterday and was very agreeably received by a venerable and a candid prelate with whom i had before only exchanged visits of ceremony i told his grace that at the desire of two very respectable characters in america the late president of congress and the secretary for the department of foreign affairs i had the honor to be the bearer to his grace of a letter from a convention of delegates from the episcopal churches in most of the southern states which had been transmitted to me open that i might be acquainted with the contents that in this business however i acted in no official character having no instructions from congress nor indeed from the convention but i thought it most respectful to them as well as to his grace to present the letter in person the archbishop answered that all he could say at present was that he was himself very well disposed to give the satisfaction desired for that he was by no means one of those who wished that contention should be kept up between the two countries or between one party and another in america but on the contrary was desirous of doing every thing in his power to promote harmony and good humor i then     said that if his grace would take the trouble to read two letters from mr lee and mr jay he would perceive the motives of those gentlemen in sending the letter to my care i gave him the letters which he read attentively and returned and added that it was a great satisfaction to him to see that gentlemen of character and reputation interested themselves in it for that the episcopalians in the united states could not have the full and complete enjoyment of their religious liberties without it and he subjoined that it was also a great satisfaction to him to have received this visit from me upon this occasion he would take the liberty to ask me if it were not an improper question whether the interposition of the english bishops would not give uneasiness and dissatisfaction in america i replied that my answer could only be that of a private citizen and in that capacity i had no scruple to say that the people of the united states in general were for a liberal and generous toleration i might indeed employ a stronger term and call it a right and the first right of mankind to worship god according to their consciences and therefore i could not see any reasonable ground for dissatisfaction and that i hoped and believed there would be none of any consequence his grace was then pleased to say that religion in all countries especially a young one ought to be attended to as it was the foundation of government he hoped the characters which should be recommended would be good ones i replied that there were in the churches in america able men of characters altogether irreproachable and that such and such only i presumed would be recommended i then rose to take my leave and his grace asked me if he might be at liberty to mention that i had made him this visit upon this occasion i answered certainly if his grace should judge it proper thus sir i have fulfilled my commission and am yours c john adams     james bowdoin    january      boston john adams james bowdoin to john adams boston    january      sir— i am honored by your excellencys letter of the  d of september by mr storer the navigation act of massachusetts having been found to militate with the french treaty of commerce and to exclude our fish from the levant by excluding the subjects of the italian and other states coming with their vessels for it when our own in attempting to carry it to them would be intercepted by the algerines it was judged expedient to repeal it in part so that it now operates in full force only against the subjects of great britain and their property a copy of the repealing act will be sent to you and also of an act passed by the legislature of rhode island at their last session i have transmitted copies of our repealing act to the executives of the several states and warmly urged a similitude of measures without which the united states cannot hope to bring about an alteration in the commercial system of britain that system in my idea of it is clearly opposed to her own interest considered in all its parts and in a complex view of it it is very true their encouragement of their whalefishery by suffering the alien duty on oil to depress ours will increase their shipping in this branch increase their seamen and in several other ways be advantageous to them to a person that looks no farther it would appear that this was good policy and the goodness of it would be inferred from the advantages arising but when he should extend his view and see how that stoppage of the american whale fishery by depriving the americans of so capital a mean of paying for the woollen goods they used to take of britain must at the same time occasion the american demand to cease or be proportionately diminished not to mention the risk of a change or deviation of the trade from the old channel he will calculate the national profit and loss that arises from that stoppage three thousand tons of oil was the usual annual quantity produced by the whalemen at nantucket all of which was shipped to england at an average price of £   per ton making about £ 0 000 the whole of which went to pay for and purchase a like amount of woollens and other british goods nine tenths of the value of which are computed to arise from the labor of the manufacturer and to be so much clear gain to the nation the other tenth therefore being deducted gives the national gain arising from the industry of the nantucket whalemen and the capital employed in that business namely £   00 £ 0 00  £   00 without the nations paying a shilling for the risk of insurance or any other risk whatever on the change of trade pursuant to the new regulations the british merchants must employ a large capital in the whale fishery whose products we will suppose equal to that of the nantucket £ 0 000 they will have made an exceeding good voyage if the whole of that sum should be equal to one half of the cost of the outfits though from many of the vessels not meeting with fish and from a variety of accidents to which such a voyage is subject it probably would not be a quarter the whole of the product goes towards payment of the outfits and charges of the voyage and a large sum must be advanced for the second voyage c now although this mode of commerce would be productive of some national benefits yet considered in a comparative view with the benefits resulting from the former mode they would be found of little importance a like comparison may be made with other branches of commerce particularly the british west indian and the result will be found the same for the sake then of gaining pence and farthings britain is sacrificing pounds by her new regulations of trade she has a right to see for herself but unhappily resentment and the consequent prejudices have so much disordered her powers of vision that it requires the skilful hand of a good political optician to remove the obstructing films if she will not permit the application of your couching instruments or if applied they can work no effect the old lady must be left to her fate and abandoned as incurable but it is to be hoped not so much on her account as our own that they may be successful one ground of hope is the private negotiation which mr nathaniel barrett is gone to     france to perfect and execute relative to their taking our whale oil duty free and in lieu of it giving at an agreed rate according to their quality such french manufactures as are best suited to our market excepting a certain proportion of the oil which must be paid for by bills of exchange to raise money for the men engaged in the voyage about two months ago mr barrett sailed for france with letters for mr jefferson and the marquis de lafayette and if he succeeds a great revolution in trade will probably be the consequence and france on the principle of reciprocal benefit exclude britain from all trade with america this appears to me so probable that if you could impress the british ministry with the same idea you would find little difficulty to bring about a commercial treaty with them perfectly agreeable to your own mind and to the wishes of the united states an interchange of a few letters on this subject with mr jefferson would give you the present state of the negotiation with the most perfect regard c james bowdoin john adams    january      london thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson london    january      dear sir— i am favored with yours of the   th december and am obliged to you for what you said to the count de vergennes in the case of the chevalier de mezières  you may always very safely depend upon it that i never have given and never shall give any opinion against the letter or spirit of the treaty with france in this case i have never given any opinion at all indeed i have never been consulted the marquis de bellegarde with whom i had a slight acquaintance at the hague called upon me here after the death of general oglethorpe and desired that mr granville sharp might call upon me and show me some papers relative to the generals lands in georgia and south carolina mr sharp called accordingly but showed me no papers i never looked nor inquired into     the case but advised both to write and send powers of attorney to our old friend edward rutledge who was able to give them the best advice and information and all the assistance which the law allows in their claim the treaty with france never occurred to me nor was suggested to me in the conference nor did i ever give any opinion on any question concerning it i have never written a line to america about it nor put pen to paper the supposition that any opinion of yours in private conversation or of mine if any such had been given which never was should influence courts and juries in georgia or carolina is ridiculous the case as you state it indeed appears to be unconnected with the treaty entirely and if sound sense can remove a prejudice what you have said upon it will put an end to the jealousy does the count de vergennes pretend that the united states of america are bound by their treaty with france never to lay a duty on french vessels the massachusetts and new hampshire navigation laws leave french ships subjects and merchandises upon the footing gentis amicissimæ does the treaty require more i have been informed by richard jackson esq whose fame is known in america that a question has been referred to a number of the first lawyers common and civil among whom he was one whether the citizens of the united states born before the revolution were still entitled in the british dominions to the rights of british subjects their unanimous determination was that such as were born before the signature of the definitive treaty of peace are still to be considered as british subjects if they claim the rights in the british dominions this decision was i believe more upon analogy and speculation than upon any established principle or precedent since ours is i believe a new case how it has been determined in america i know not but i think not the same way however the lawyers and judges may determine it i wish the assemblies would adopt it as a rule respecting estates held before the separation since a generosity of this kind will be more for their honor and their interest as i conceive than a rigorous claim of an escheat however clear in law the chevalier de pinto informs me that he has written to his court for explanations upon some points and expects an answer     in a few days when it arrives he will call upon me in the mean time he says his court is solicitous to send a minister to america but that etiquette forbids it unless congress will agree to send one to lisbon they would send a minister to new york if congress would return the compliment but if congress will not send a minister plenipotentiary they wish to send a resident or even a chargé des affaires but etiquette will not permit this unless congress will send a resident or chargé des affaires to portugal is it really expected or intended that eden shall do more than crawford did pray let me know if there is any probability of a treaty in earnest between france and england        mr voss from virginia has just now called upon me and shown me a state of the debt of that commonwealth which is very consolatory it is dated   th november      and signed b stark h randolph and i pendleton the whole debt at that period was only £   0    the annual interest £         pension list £ 000 officers of government £      criminal prosecutions £  0  thus it appears that £         annually will pay the whole interest of their debt and all the charges of government virginia by this may sing o be joyful on the   th november the lower house resolved to invest congress with full powers to regulate trade and in the mean time that all commerce should cease with the british colonies in the west indies and north america and that all ships of foreign nations with whom we have no treaties of commerce should be prohibited from importing any thing but the production of their own country it seems they revoked these resolutions again because the house was thin but with design to take them up in another day this perhaps may not be done until next year but it is a strong symptom of what is coming mr voss gives me a comfortable account of the trade in peltries as well as grain and tobacco every vessel that arrives brings fresh comfort and i fancy our commerce with the east indies will be effectually secured by the reception of mr pitts bill mr voss tells me that the british debts will not be permitted to be sued for until the treaty is complied with by the english by the evacuation of the posts and payment for the negroes lord carmarthen told me     yesterday that he was laboring at an answer to my memorial concerning the posts and that he should complete it as soon as he could get all the information he was looking for concerning the british debts for that complaints had been made by the creditors here to ministry i am glad i am to have an answer for whatever conditions they may tack to the surrender of the posts we shall find out what is boiling in their hearts and by degrees come together an answer though it might be a rough one would be better than none but it will not be rough they will smooth it as much as they can and i shall transmit it to congress who may again pass the smoothingplane over it i expect it will end in an accommodation but it will take eighteen months more time to finish it i am c john adams john adams    january      john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square    january      dear sir— on wednesday the chevalier de pinto informed me that he had written to lisbon for explanations from his court upon certain points that he expected an answer in a few days and that as soon as he should receive it he would call upon me and proceed in the negotiation that in the mean time he would not disguise from me the solicitude of his court to send a minister to congress etiquette forbade that the court of portugal should send an ambassador minister plenipotentiary or envoy to america until the united states should agree to send one of equal rank to lisbon but if congress had any reasons for not sending ministers of so high an order they might send a resident or chargé daffaires i answered him that i had heard it was the intention of congress to send a consul but that i could say no further lord carmarthen on thursday told me he was at work upon an answer to my memorial concerning the posts and should complete it as soon as he could collect some further information concerning the debts of the obstructions to the payment of which the ministry had received complaints from persons in this country who were interested in them you     may conclude from this as well as i what kind of answer it will be i am very glad that i am to have an answer whatever it may be it will lead to further eclaircissement and a final accommodation yet i think the answer will not come before the spring it will take eighteen months more to settle all matters exclusive of the treaty of commerce mr eden has said within a few days that he believed there would be a treaty of commerce with the united states of america within a year or two he may wish to be employed in it for however sanguine he may be of his success at versailles i shall lose my guess if he ever accomplishes a commercial treaty with that court he may however this nation would now crouch to france for the sake of being insolent to us the disposition to crush the weak is almost always attended with that of cringing to the strong arrogance to inferiors is ever servile to superiors but a treaty with france such as she would accept would be hurtful to such numbers and raise such an opposition that i cannot yet believe mr eden will be permitted to sign one the term of two years is expired and del campo has done nothing crawford is returned without doing any thing as i suppose the true secret of the appointment of mr eden as i conceive is the court of versailles was offended that crawford was not allowed to do any thing and used some sharp expressions which intimidated the ministry eden was appointed for two ends—first to appease the wrath at versailles and secondly to keep up a mysterious delusive hope in the english nation perhaps too the ministry are afraid of commercial speculations between france and ireland these conjectures are precarious and no great stress should be laid on them with great respect c john adams john adams    january      count sarsfield to count sarsfield grosvenor square    january      dear sir— if i were so fortunate as you are and could pass the water from dover to calais in three hours i would go to paris and dine with you in some of your american parties but i can never get over from harwich to helvoet nor from   0 dover to calais in less than seventeen hours and sometimes not under three days i have all the pieces relative to the united provinces excepting the pays de drenthe i have one piece upon slavery one upon women and two introductions to the subject of fiefs that is all that i have  among all my acquaintance i know not a greater rider of hobbyhorses than count sarsfield one of your hobbyhorses is to assemble uncommon characters i have dined with you two or three times at your house in company with the oddest collections of personages that were ever put together i am thinking if you were here i would invite you to a dinner to your taste i would ask king paoli king brant le chevalier deon and if you pleased you might have mr and mrs—with whom you dined in america how much speculation would this whimsical association afford you how goes on your inquiry into fiefs if you do not make haste i may perhaps interfere with you i have half a mind to devote the next ten years to the making of a book upon the subject of nobility i wish to inquire into the practice of all nations ancient and modern civilized and savage under all religions—mahometan christian and pagan—to see how far the division of mankind into patricians and plebeians nobles and simples is necessary and inevitable and how far it is not nature has not made this discrimination art has done it art may then prevent it would it do good or evil to prevent it i believe good think what you will of it how can it be prevented in short it is a splendid subject and if i were not too lazy i would undertake it i want to see nations in uniform no church canonicals no lawyers robes no distinctions in society but such as sense and honesty make what a fool what an enthusiast you will say what then why should not i have my hobbyhorse to ride as well as my friend ill tell you what i believe this manyheaded beast the people will some time or other have wit enough to throw their riders and if they should they will put an end to an abundance of tricks with which they are now curbed and bitted whipped and spurred john adams     john adams   february      to the marquis of carmarthen grosvenor square   february      my lord— i have the honor of transmitting to your lordship a copy of a letter of the   st of december last from his majestys consulgeneral in the united states to their secretary of state for the department of foreign affairs which has been laid before congress  who have been pleased to direct me to communicate it to his majesty with this information that the complaint stated in it being in general terms and unsupported by any particular facts or evidence they do not think it necessary or proper to take any measures in consequence of it and with this assurance that as it is their determination the treaty of peace shall be punctually observed by their citizens and that his majestys subjects shall enjoy in the united states all the rights which friendly and civilized nations claim from each other so they will always be ready to hear every complaint which may appear to be well founded and to redress such of them as on investigation shall prove to be so let me request the favor of your lordship to lay this communication before his majesty your lordship will permit me to avail myself of this opportunity of remarking that the office of consulgeneral does not extend to matters of this kind neither the rights of commerce nor of navigation being in question and therefore that it was delicacy towards his majesty rather than a sense of the propriety of such an application from a consulgeneral which induced congress to treat it with this mark of attention as the united states my lord have a minister plenipotentiary residing at this court in consequence of a proposition to that purpose made by his britannic majestys minister through his grace the duke of dorset his ambassador at paris your lordship will permit me to propose to the consideration of his majestys ministers the expediency as well as propriety of sending a minister plenipotentiary from his majesty to the     united states of america i am authorized my lord to give assurances that congress expect such a minister and are ready to receive and treat him in a manner consistent with the respect due to his sovereign with great respect c john adams john adams    february      john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square    february      sir— at a late levee the king in conversation with one of the foreign ministers was pleased to say that the tripoline ambassador refused to confer with his ministers and insisted on an audience but that nothing had been said at it more than that tripoli and england were at peace and desirous to continue so his majesty added all he wants is a present and his expenses borne to vienna and denmark if nothing more was said at the audience there are not wanting persons in england who will find means to stimulate this african to stir up his countrymen against american vessels it may reasonably be suspected that his present visit is chiefly with a view to the united states to draw them into a treaty of peace which implies tribute or at least presents or to obtain aids from england to carry on a war against us feeling his appearance here to be ominous like that of other irregular bodies which from their horrid hair shake pestilence and war i thought at first to avoid him but finding that all the other foreign ministers had made their visits and that he would take amiss a longer inattention it was judged necessary to call at his door for the form but when the attempt was made which was last evening so late that there was no suspicion of his being visible the ambassador was announced at home and ready to receive the visitant it would scarcely be reconcilable to the dignity of congress to read a detail of the ceremonies which attended the conference it would be more proper to write them to harlequin for the amusement of the gay at the new york theatre it is sufficient to say that his excellency made many inquiries concerning america the climate soil heat cold c and observed it is a very great country but tripoli is at war with it in return it was asked how there could be war     between two nations when there had been no hostility injury insult or provocation on either side his excellency replied that turkey tripoli tunis algiers and morocco were the sovereigns of the mediterranean and that no nation could navigate that sea without a treaty of peace with them that america must make such treaties with tripoli first then with constantinople then with algiers and morocco as france england and all the other powers of europe had done a secretary brought him some papers one of which was put into my hands it was a french translation of a full power from the pacha dey and regency of tripoli to treat with all the powers of europe and to manage all the foreign concerns of his country without limitation of time or place the original commission in his own language was also produced and shown it was observed that america was not named in it but it was replied that the power was universal to manage every thing and that a treaty might be made at once or at least that conferences might be held and the result written to tripoli and america for further instructions what time was required to write to congress and receive an answer three months at least that was too long but he should remain here sometime you may call here tomorrow or next day with an interpreter and we will hear and propose terms as his excellency expected to gain by the negotiation as much as the american knows he must lose you will perceive the former was the most eager to promote it when mr jeffersons answer to a letter upon this subject shall arrive it will be proper to learn his terms but there is reason to believe they will be too high for your ministers to accept without further instructions this is the substance of a conference which was carried on with much difficulty but with civility enough on both sides in a strange mixture of italian lingua franca broken french and worse english this minister appears to be a man of good sense and temper with great respect c john adams     john adams  0 february      john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square  0 february      sir— yesterday the tripolitan ambassador sent a message by a dr benamor an english jew most probably who has formerly resided in barbary and speaks the arabic language as well as the italian and lingua franca to inform me that he wished to return his visit in the same friendly and respectful manner and that as he had much at heart a treaty between the barbary and american states he wished it might be soon it was agreed that he should be received at noon at twelve his excellency came in ceremony accompanied with his secretary and benamor for an interpreter whom he had chosen in preference to the interpreter assigned him by the court because he was sorry to see that this nation was not so steady in its friendship to america as the french the french consul at tripoli congratulated him upon his appointment and hoped he would meet in england a minister with whom he might make a treaty of peace with america but he was sorry to say he found here much ill will to the americans and a desire to prevent him from seeing the american minister for this reason he would have nothing to do with the court interpreter it was the delight of his soul and the whole pleasure of his life to do good and he was zealous to embrace an opportunity which now presented itself of doing a great deal the time was critical and the sooner peace was made the better for from what passed before he left home he was convinced if the treaty should be delayed another year it would after that be difficult to make it if any considerable number of vessels and prisoners should be taken it would be hard to persuade the turks especially the algerines to desist a war between christian and christian was mild and prisoners on either side were treated with humanity but a war between turk and christian was horrible and prisoners were sold into slavery although he was himself a mussulman he must still say he thought it a very rigid law but as he could not alter it he was desirous of preventing its operation or at least of softening it as far as his influence extended the algerines were the most difficult to treat they were eager for prizes     and had now more and larger ships than usual if an application should be made first to algiers they would refuse but when once a treaty was made by tripoli or any one of the barbary states they would follow the example there was such an intimate connection between all that when one made peace the rest followed algiers had refused to treat with spain in defiance of all her armaments until tripoli interposed and then they relaxed at once he called god to witness that is to say he swore by his beard which is a sacred oath with them that his motive to this earnestness for peace although it might be of some benefit to himself was the desire of doing good when he was informed that congress had received some friendly letters from the emperor of morocco and that an agent was gone to treat with his majesty he rejoiced to hear it and doubted not that this agent would succeed as the emperor was a man of extensive views and much disposed to promote the commerce of his subjects as it was now apparent that his principal business here was to treat with the united states and that no harm could be done by dealing frankly with him the commission of congress to treat with tripoli was shown to him as well as those to morocco algiers and tunis he was rejoiced to see them and although he could not answer for algiers he would undertake for tunis and tripoli and he would write in favor of any person who might be sent or go with him in person to assist in the completion of peace with all the states of barbary which was more than he had ever before said to any ambassador or minister in europe it was then proposed that his excellency should mention the terms which he might think proper to propose but he desired to be excused at present and that tomorrow evening at his house he might have an opportunity of explaining himself more particularly this was agreed to it was then observed that although america was an extensive country the inhabitants were few in comparison with france spain and england nor would their wealth bear any proportion to that of these nations or of holland that we were just emerged from the calamities of war and had as yet few ships at sea especially in the mediterranean so that the barbary corsairs could not expect to make any considerable     number of prizes god forbid was his reply that i should consider america upon a footing at present in point of wealth with these nations i know very well that she has but lately concluded a war which must have laid waste her territories and i would rather wish to leave to her own generosity the compliments to be made upon the occasion than stipulate any thing precisely this man is either a consummate politician in art and address or he is a benevolent and wise man time will discover whether he disguises an interested character or is indeed the philosopher he pretends to be if he is the latter providence seems to have opened to us an opportunity of conducting this thorny business to a happy conclusion colonel smith will go to paris to communicate the whole to mr jefferson and entreat him to come over to london in order to finish as much as possible of it immediately and to agree with the portuguese minister at the same time mr jefferson has long projected a visit to england and this will be a good opportunity no notice will be taken of it publicly in america and his real errand will be concealed from the public here if the sum limited by congress should be insufficient we shall be embarrassed and indeed a larger sum could not be commanded unless a new loan should be opened in holland i doubt not a million of guilders might be obtained there upon the same terms with the last two millions this would enable congress to pay their interest in europe and to pay the french officers who are uneasy with great respect c john adams marquis de lafayette    february      paris john adams the marquis de lafayette to john adams paris    february      my dear sir— i have been honored with your favor by mr joy to whom i will readily render every service in my power and i am also to thank you for the valuable books you took the trouble to collect for me in the cause of my black brethren i feel myself warmly interested and most decidedly side so far as respects them against the white part of mankind whatever be the complexion of the enslaved it does not in     my opinion alter the complexion of the crime which the enslaver commits a crime much blacker than any african face it is to me a matter of great anxiety and concern to find that this trade is sometimes perpetrated under the flag of liberty our dear and noble stripes to which virtue and glory have been constant standardbearers inclosed i beg leave to send a letter to mr sharp with acknowledgments for his attention no event of great importance in paris cardinal de rohans affair has produced many memoirs which of the different tales is the right one i do not pretend to say the cardinal has been either a rogue or a fool the latter seems the most probable all the farms have been renewed with an augmentation of revenue that of tobacco excepted and on this as well as on every other point i stand a warm opposer to the principles of the farm on this side of the channel when good deeds fail you will at least find good intentions in england neither while policy is the result of passion not of reason every sensible calculation is at an end and it is still a matter of doubt with me however strange it appears if they will give up the posts or let us have the pleasure to walk into those formidable works on our saratoga tune of yankee doodle with every sentiment c lafayette john adams    february      john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square    february      sir— on monday evening another conference was held with the tripolitan ambassador attended with his interpreter benamor who is a decent man and very ready in the english as well as arabic and italian the foreign ministers here say it is the custom of all the ambassadors from barbary to be much connected with jews to whom they are commonly recommended it may be supposed the jews have interested motives and therefore although their interference cannot be avoided they ought to be objects of jealousy benamor soon betrayed proofs enough that he had no aversion to the ambassadors obtaining large terms the ambassador who is known to many of the foreign ministers here is universally well spoken of     when he began to explain himself concerning his demands he said they would be different according to the duration of the treaty if that were perpetual they would be greater if for a term of years less his advice was that it should be perpetual once signed by the bashaw dey and other officers it would be indissoluble and binding forever upon all their successors but if a temporary treaty were made it might be difficult and expensive to revive it for a perpetual treaty such as they had now with spain a sum of thirty thousand guineas must be paid upon the delivery of the articles signed by the dey and other officers if it were agreed to he would send his secretary by land to marseilles and from thence by water to tripoli who should bring it back by the same route signed by the dey c he had proposed so small a sum in consideration of the circumstances but declared it was not half of what had been lately paid them by spain if we chose to treat upon a different plan he would make a treaty perpetual upon the payment of twelve thousand five hundred guineas for the first year and three thousand guineas annually until the thirty thousand guineas were paid it was observed that these were large sums and vastly beyond expectation but his excellency answered that they never made a treaty for less upon the arrival of a prize the dey and the other officers were entitled by law to large shares by which they might make greater profits than these sums amounted to and they never would give up this advantage for less he was told that although there was a full power to treat the american ministers were limited to a much smaller sum so that it would be impossible to do any thing until we could write to congress and know their pleasure colonel smith was present at this as he had been at the last conference and agreed to go to paris to communicate all to mr jefferson and persuade him to come here that we may join in further conferences and transmit the result to congress the ambassador believed that tunis and morocco would treat upon the same terms but would not answer for algiers they would demand more when mr jefferson arrives we shall insist upon knowing the ultimatum and transmit it to congress congress will perceive that one hundred and twenty thousand guineas will be indispensable to conclude with the four     powers at this rate besides a present to the ambassadors and other incidental charges besides this a present of five hundred guineas is made upon the arrival of a consul in each state no man wishes more fervently that the expense could be less but the fact cannot be altered and the truth ought not to be concealed it may be reasonably concluded that this great affair cannot be finished for much less than two hundred thousand pounds sterling there is no place in europe or america where congress can obtain such a sum but in holland perhaps a loan for two millions of guilders might be filled in amsterdam upon the terms of the last if it is not done this war will cost us more millions of sterling money in a short time besides the miserable depression of the reputation of the united states the cruel embarrassment of all our commerce and the intolerable burthen of insurance added to the cries of our countrymen in captivity the probable success of mr barclay and mr lamb need not be pointed out if a perpetual peace were made with these states the character of the united states would instantly rise all over the world our commerce navigation and fisheries would extend into the mediterranean to spain and portugal france and england the additional profits would richly repay the interest and our credit would be adequate to all our wants colonel smith is gone to paris he departed yesterday by the sixth article of the confederation no state without the consent of the united states in congress assembled shall send any embassy to or receive any embassy from or enter into any conference agreement alliance or treaty with any king prince or state all the states are so deeply interested in this case that surely no separate state can have occasion to move for the consent of congress upon this occasion but if unexpectedly congress should not agree to treat there are several states in the union so deeply interested in navigation that it would richly compensate each of them to go to the whole extent of two hundred thousand pounds to obtain peace nevertheless a single state might obtain peace and security for its ships at a much cheaper rate with great and sincere esteem c john adams   0 john adams    february      john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square    february      sir— the envoy from portugal has received from his court an answer to his despatches relative to the treaty with the united states and the inclosed extract from it which has been delayed some time by the sickness of the chevalier de freire the portuguese secretary of legation that minister did me the honor to deliver to me two days ago with his request that it might be transmitted to congress at the same time he delivered me the inclosed state of the trade between the united states and portugal the last year when mr jefferson arrives we shall endeavor to finish this business the proposition of sending and receiving a minister has been many times made before congress will no doubt answer this which is now made formally and officially the regard which is due from one sovereign to another and indeed common decency seems to require it to refuse it would be thought surprising indeed according to all the rules of politeness between nations and sovereigns it ought to be left at the option of her most faithful majesty to send what grade of public minister she shall judge proper and assurances should be given of the most amicable disposition of congress to receive him with all the respect due to his sovereign and to send a minister to her majesty of equal character the united states are at this moment suffering severely for want of an equitable adjustment of their affairs with the powers of europe and africa which can never be accomplished but by conforming to the usages established in the world if the united states would come to the resolution to prohibit all foreign vessels from coming to their ports and confine all exports and imports to their own ships and seamen they would do for any thing that i know the wisest thing which human prudence could dictate but then the consequence would be obvious they must give up the most of their commerce and live by their agriculture in this case they might recall their ministers and send no more on the other hand if the united states would adopt the principle of the french economists and allow the ships and     merchants of all nations equal privileges with their own citizens they need not give themselves any further trouble about treaties or ambassadors the consequence nevertheless would be the sudden annihilation of all their manufactures and navigation we should have the most luxurious set of farmers that ever existed and should not be able to defend our seacoast against the insults of a pirate as these are two extremes that we know americans will never consent to we must vindicate our own manufactures and navigation by legislation at home and negotiation abroad and therefore the prejudices against exchanges of public ministers will be found some of the most pernicious that ever have arisen among american citizens laws at home must be made in conformity to the state of affairs abroad which can never be known to congress but by ambassadors with great respect c john adams john adams    february      john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square    february      sir— at the last conferences as they call here what is understood in paris by ambassadors days the marquis of carmarthen was pleased to make an apology for not having yet answered the memorial requiring the evacuation of the posts it would sound oddly to say that he had delayed his answer to prevent delays but it was true he had drawn up his answer but as he was obliged to say something concerning the old debts he had been obliged to wait for a little further information that he might state in one view all the acts of the assemblies which had interposed impediments as this is some kind of respect to the memorial it ought to be communicated to congress as no doubt it was intended and expected that it should be the public prints will inform you that the newfoundland bill and the american intercourse bill are revived it would be sufficient to convince every american what the system is to say that mr jenkinson was the member of administration and the house of commons selected to conduct this business comparing his well known character with what he said you     will believe that the same men and the same principles which have governed this nation in their conduct towards america these twenty years prevail to this hour as far as the circumstances will admit and that mr pitt is either a convert to their sentiments or is only an ostensible minister it remains with the states to determine what measures they will take to discourage a commerce the most impoverishing and ruinous that can be imagined to promote a more beneficial intercourse with the rest of europe and to support their own manufactures and navigation for on such measures alone can they have any dependence in future with sincere esteem c john adams john adams    february      london william white to william white london    february      sir— your favor of the   th of november  by mr peters i had not the honor to receive till a few days ago i am much obliged to you for this mark of your confidence and for the pamphlets and papers inclosed which i had yesterday an opportunity of communicating to the archbishop of canterbury when his grace did me the honor of a visit to deliver me the inclosed letter with the desire of the bishops that i would transmit it to the committee i have not understood that there will be any political objections against the measure you desire if any such should arise as an american citizen though not an episcopalian i can very consistently endeavor to remove it because i do not believe that the benevolence of the father of all is confined by our lines of distinction or differences of opinion and because i think that when we can enlarge our minds to allow each other an entire liberty in religious matters the human race will be more happy and respectable in this and the future stage of their existence it would be inconsistent with the american character and with the principles of our constitutions to raise political objections against the consecration of bishops as it is merely a religious ceremony the states will no doubt take care     that no temporal powers inconsistent with their civil politics shall be annexed to the character this however is their affair with great respect c john adams john adams   march      london matthew robinson to matthew robinson  london   march      sir— you have obliged me very much by your kind letter of   th february the americans are indeed englishmen and will continue such in language and sentiments and manners whether they are allowed to be friends or compelled to be enemies of those other englishmen who inhabit these islands great britain and ireland the privileges of purchasing inheriting exercising trades voting or being chosen into offices of all kinds if declared by act of parliament would no doubt be considered in a friendly light but give me leave to say would have no material effect while embarrassments are either studiously or ignorantly thrown in the way of commerce the united states are willing to throw wide open every port in their dominions to british ships and merchants and merchandizes and i am ready in their behalf to pledge their faith in a treaty to this effect upon the reciprocal stipulation of this nation that her ports shall be equally open to our ships merchants and produce but the united states must repel monopolies by monopolies and answer prohibitions by prohibitions i may be uninformed respecting the east indies but although the east india company have by their charter and act of parliament an exclusive privilege of importing east india goods into the port of london only i do not know that americans or any other foreign nation are prohibited to trade with the british factories and settlements in asia this nevertheless is not a point with us the ministry might except the charter of the rights of the east india company but the american commerce is a system and a free intercourse between the     united states and canada nova scotia newfoundland and the west india islands as well as a market for their oil and fins and spermaceti candles and readybuilt ships is so essential to it that if one nation will not another must concede it if england will not germany holland france c will this commerce is even more necessary to your colonies than it is to us and the present policy is sowing the seeds of disquiet and discontent in the minds of your colonies that will alienate them all if persisted in this uneasiness has already broken out in barbadoes into violence which occasioned the troops to fire upon the people by which a number were killed as the public prints inform us and it will increase from day to day the  th of march    0 ought to be an eternal warning to this nation on that night the foundation of american independence was laid i have the honor to agree perfectly with you in opinion that england might receive more benefit from a liberal commerce with america than she would if we had remained under her government and i may be permitted to say that having been from      to this day either in congress or in her service abroad i have been fully acquainted with every step and motive of her conduct towards the powers of europe and it has been her constant rule to concede no preferences to france or any other nation that she might be at liberty to settle a commercial plan with england upon the fairest terms little did she expect or foresee that england would refuse the favors intended her i must say the ministry appear to have no idea of the principles on which congress have acted the consequence must be that the trade of america must leave this country and go to her rivals the ministry and the nation too seem to consider the united states as a rival and we know very well what in english lexicography is the meaning of the word rival it is an enemy to be beat down by every means but it may be depended on that if the united states are treated in this manner they will make common cause with the other rivals of british commerce who at this day are almost as numerous as the nations of europe it is the earnest desire of the united states to live in friendship with this country and to have no other contention but in reciprocal good offices it seems to be your opinion that the     people of england have the same disposition i beg you to explain yourself on this head as i must confess i have not met with any symptoms of it excepting in a few a very few individuals much fewer than i expected when i first arrived here to what purpose is the universal industry to represent the commerce of the united states as of no importance where would have been the stocks the exchange and the revenue of this country without it there has been a constant stream of produce cash and bills flowing into this country since the peace from the united states remittances to an immense amount have been made and even a large sum through france spain portugal and holland which has contributed in no small degree to turn the balance of exchange so much in your favor as well as to throw a surplus into the exchequer and raise the stocks and these remittances might have been nearly doubled if common sense had dictated to the british politicians to receive from us in payment such things as we have the americans are at this day a great people and are not to be trifled with their numbers have increased fifty per cent since      a people that can multiply at this rate amidst all the calamities of such a war of eight years will in twenty years more be too respectable to want friends they might sell their friendship at this time at a very high price to others however lightly it may be esteemed here i have the misfortune to differ widely from your opinion in the address that the independence of america happened a century too soon it would be easy to show that it happened at the best point of time there is no imaginable period past or future at which it could have been brought into event to so much advantage for america but this would lead me too far the information you may have received concerning the confusions distresses c of the united states are of a piece with those misrepresentations which have constantly misguided this nation for five and twenty years the inconveniences now felt are confined to those who have been deceived into an excess of trade with this country by expectations which have been disappointed that the usual remittances would be received and they have arisen from a desire to live and trade in friendship with england the country in general is in a thriving and     flourishing condition and this country alone will finally be the sufferer by the impediments they have thrown in the way of their own interest you will perceive sir that i have written too freely and too largely in my situation it may be imprudent but the subject is of great importance and deserves your closest attention you will greatly oblige me by communicating your sentiments with equal frankness with great esteem c john adams samuel osgood walter livingston arthur lee   march      john adams the treasury board to john adams board of treasury   march      sir— we do ourselves the honor of transmitting to you the resolves of congress of the   th day of february last from which you will observe the embarrassments under which the united states labor to comply with their foreign engagements through the want of exertions in the several states to pay in their quotas of the annual requisitions the present state of the treasury is in consequence so reduced that we are apprehensive it may not perhaps be in our power to remit to the commissioners of the dutch loans in europe sufficient funds in season to discharge the whole interest which will become due on the dutch loans on the first day of june next if the sum of eighty thousand dollars which has been appropriated by the resolves of congress of the   th february      for the purpose of forming treaties with the barbary powers should be drawn out of the hands of the dutch commissioners before that day we are using our endeavors to make arrangements so that our remittances may arrive in season but as they may be prevented by some casualty from coming to hand by the  st of next june it becomes our duty to request the favor of you to avoid if it possibly can be done drawing out of the hands of the dutch commissioners the moneys appropriated for the purpose of making treaties with the barbary powers before the  st of june next and to direct it if our remittances should not arrive in season to be appropriated to the payment of the june interest you may rest assured sir that every exertion will be made by this board that the remittances may arrive in season without placing any dependence on this resource and that at all     events the sum of seventy thousand dollars shall be remitted to the dutch commissioners on or before the first day of august next to wait your orders to your excellency who knows so well the importance of preserving the public faith with foreign nations and particularly with the dutch moneylenders it would be unnecessary to use any arguments to show the propriety of our application on this subject we are satisfied that if the state of the negotiations will possibly admit of it you will permit this money to remain for the purposes we have mentioned on examining the abstract of the distribution of the obligations on the five millions loan to the  0th september last we find that there remained undistributed on that day one hundred and thirtyeight obligations equal to   0000 florins it is much to be wished that this loan may be completed with all the despatch possible without it we have too much reason to fear we shall experience difficulties in remitting sufficient sums to europe to pay the interest of the foreign loans and the salaries of foreign ministers and agents during the present year we have the honor to be c samuel osgood walter livingston arthur lee john adams   march      granville sharp to granville sharp grosvenor square   march      sir— i took the first opportunity to send your present of books to my friend the marquis de lafayette and have this morning received the inclosed letter for you from that nobleman let me avail myself of this opportunity of presenting my thanks for your obliging present of books to me you have merited the respect and esteem of all men amongst whom liberty and humanity are not disregarded by your writings the idea that captives in war are slaves is the foundation of the misfortunes of the negroes this principle is honored and admitted by all the powers of europe who pay tribute to the states of barbary i expect that one part of africa will avenge upon my fellow citizens the injury they do to another by purchasing     their captives yet i presume we shall be compelled to follow the base example of submission and pay tribute or make presents like the rest of christians to the mussulmen i wish you would take up the whole of this african system and expose it altogether never never will the slave trade be abolished while christian princes abase themselves before the piratical ensigns of mahomet with great esteem john adams samuel osgood walter livingston   april      john adams the treasury board to john adams board of treasury   april      sir— we do ourselves the honor of transmitting to you a duplicate of our letters to yourself and the commissioners of the dutch loans of the  th and   d march last the latter together with one of this date addressed to the same gentlemen and inclosing a bill in their favor on messrs wilhem and jan willink of amsterdam we request the favor of you to forward by the first mail our letter to the commissioners is left open for your perusal by which you will find that our directions to those gentlemen are to appropriate the proceeds of this bill for the purpose specified in the resolve of congress of the   th february      relative to the proposed treaties with the barbary powers in case the moneys appropriated for this object have not been drawn out of their hands previous to the receipt of this bill but in case this event has taken place our orders are to discount the bill and to apply the proceeds for the payment of the dutch interest which becomes due on the first of june next this remittance added to the sum of thirty thousand dollars which will be remitted to them for the same purpose by messrs constable rucker  co in pursuance of a contract made with this board will very nearly complete the whole sum of interest which will become due on that day the deficiency we trust will be made up by additional subscriptions to the loan but should this not be the case we must request you not to draw the whole moneys appropriated for the barbary treaties out of the hands of the commissioners if not already done relying on our taking measures to remit with all possible despatch to those gentlemen a further     sum of twenty thousand dollars with directions to apply it in the first instance to make up any deficiency arising on this account on the sum of eighty thousand dollars appropriated for the purpose above mentioned we have the honor to be c samuel osgood walter livingston john adams   may      london james bowdoin to james bowdoin london   may      sir— your excellencys letter of the   th january  i have had the honor to receive and am much obliged to you for the information in it your opinion of the policy of this country will be found in the result of things to be just and your reasoning in support of it is so conclusive and at the same time so obvious that it is astonishing it has not its effect upon the cabinet every consideration has been repeatedly urged to no effect seamen the navy and power to strike an awful blow to their enemies at sea on the first breaking out of a war are the ideas that prevail over all others mr jenkinson an old friend of the british empire is still at his labors he is about establishing a bounty upon fifteen ships to the southward and upon two to double cape horn for spermaceti whales americans are to take an oath that they mean to settle in england before they are entitled to the bounty i have long since informed congress that nothing is to be expected from this country but poverty weakness and ruin if after all our people will carry on a ruinous trade it is their own concern but no man can do them a greater injury than by holding up to their view a hope that we shall receive any relief by taking off the duty on oil or by admission to the west india islands they will infallibly be deceived if they entertain any such expectations i have been circumstantially informed from time to time and step by step from mr jefferson the marquis de lafayette and mr barrett of all the negotiations for exchanging our oil for the produce manufactures and sugars of france the   0 great revolution in trade which you mention ought to be promoted by every friend of america and it must take place i have made use of all these considerations but if an angel from heaven should declare to this nation that our states will unite retaliate prohibit or trade with france they would not believe it there is not one man in the nation who pretends to believe it and if he did he would be treated with scorn let me entreat you sir and every other citizen of the united states to extinguish all hopes of relief to their trade from this country peace with the turks comprehending under this term constantinople tunis tripoli algiers and morocco is essential to our navigation and commerce and political consideration in europe two or three hundred thousand guineas and nothing less will obtain it it will be miserable policy and economy to lose two or three millions in trade insurance c c and still worse to add two or three millions more in fitting out a navy to fight them in order to save that sum in customary presents we are now limited to a sum that will be worse than thrown away intrigues of individuals are said to be on foot to set south america free from spain and not improbably the pulse may be felt in the united states but i hope the states will not only be prudent themselves but oblige individuals to be so too portugal and spain are bound by a treaty of      to support each other in such a case and all the world will be in flames we had better avoid the fury of them three great objects agitate the cabinets of europe in secret the passage of the dardanelles and navigation of the danube i consider as one a free commerce with all the east indies is a second and the independence of south america is the third they will all be pursued until they are obtained as i fully believe but as all know the contest will be sharp extensive and long all are afraid to begin this is all confidential between you and me and a few of our discreet friends god bless our country but i still tremble for its safety with great respect c john adams     john adams    may      john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square    may      dear sir— last night i was honored with your letter of april  th and am happy to find that twelve states have granted to congress the impost new york i am persuaded will not long withhold her assent because that in addition to all the other arguments in favor of the measure she will have to consider that all the blame of consequences must now rest upon her and she would find this alone a greater burden than the impost this measure alone as soon as it is completed will have a great effect and instantly raise the united states in the consideration of europe and especially of england its beneficial effects will be soon felt in america by producing a circulation of that property the long stagnation of which has been a principal cause of the distress of the community the states jointly and severally would find immediate benefits from establishing taxes to pay the whole interest of their debts those of the confederation as well as those of particular states the interest of money would instantly be lowered and capitals be employed in manufactures and commerce that are now at usury it is no paradox to say that every man would find himself the richer the more taxes he pays and this rule must hold good until the taxes shall amount to a sum sufficient to discharge the interest due to every creditor in the community the power to regulate the commerce of the whole will not probably be long withheld from congress and when that point shall be agreed to you will begin to hear a cry in england for a treaty like daniel defoes game cock among the horses feet it will be pray gentlemen dont let us tread upon one another you have i hope before now lord carmarthens answer of february   th to my memorial of november  0th i had determined in my own mind not to demand a categorical answer without the further orders of congress and it is a great satisfaction to find your opinion coincide it is now with congress to deliberate what answer they should make to his lordship and for my own part i do not see what answer they can     give until they know the sense of massachusetts new york virginia and south carolina with the highest regard c john adams john adams    may      london to the marquis of carmarthen london    may      my lord— i do myself the honor of transmitting to your lordship herewith inclosed an act of the united states of america in congress assembled the   th of october      together with copies of sundry other papers relative to the boundary line between the united states and his majestys late province of nova scotia part of which is now called new brunswick it is still fresh in the recollection of every person who was concerned in the negotiation of the late peace that mitchells map was made use of by the british and american plenipotentiaries and the river st croix was marked out on that map as there delineated for the boundary which circumstance alone it is hoped will be sufficient to determine all questions which may have been raised concerning so recent a transaction in former controversies between the crowns of great britain and france concerning the boundary between the late province of massachusetts bay and nova scotia it has often been contended by the british ministers and commissioners that the river st croix was a river still further eastward than the easternmost of those three which fall into the bay of passamaquoddy but never once admitted to be a river more westerly so that the plenipotentiaries at the peace on both sides had reason to presume that when they fixed on the st croix surveyed by mitchell and laid down by him on his map there never could afterwards arise any controversy concerning it yet it seems my lord that a number of his majestys subjects have crossed over the river and settled in the territory of the united states an encroachment in which they can not be supposed to be countenanced by his majestys government difficulties of this kind if early attended to are easily adjusted and i shall be ready at all times to enter into conferences with your lordship that every point may be discussed     and all uneasiness prevented but while new maps are every day made and old ones colored according to an erroneous idea a foundation may be laid for much future evil both to nations and individuals i am my lord c john adams john adams    may      london thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson london    may      dear sir— i am honored with yours of the   th  with the inclosures from mr lamb mr carmichael and mr barclay i am not surprised that mr lamb has only discovered that our means are inadequate without learning the sum that would be sufficient il faut marchander avec ces gens là they must be beaten down as low as possible but we shall find at last the terms very dear the algerines will never make peace with us until we have treaties finished with constantinople tunis tripoli and morocco they always stand out the longest mr barclay will have no better fortune and i dont believe it worth while for him to wait a moment to discover what sum will do i think with you that it is best to desire mr lamb immediately to return to congress and mr randal too it is surprising that neither of them has given us more circumstantial information and that mr randal has not come on to paris and london i think you will do well to write him to come forward without loss of time and am glad you sent copies of all the letters to mr jay i concur with you entirely in the propriety of your going on with the comte de merci in the negotiation and in transmitting to congress the plan you may agree upon that they may send a new commission if they judge proper i have a letter from mr randal at madrid   may but shall not answer it as i wish you to write him in behalf of both of us to return immediately to paris and london i have a letter     too from isaac stephens at algiers the   th of april he says the price is  000 for a master  000 for a mate and   00 for each sailor the dey will not abate a sixpence he says and will not have any thing to say about peace with america he says the people that is the sailors i suppose are carrying rocks and timber on their backs for nine miles out of the country over sharp rocks and mountains that he has an iron round his leg c he begs that we would pay the money for their redemption without sending to congress but this is impossible yours john adams john adams    may      john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square    may      dear sir— i have not presented a formal memorial in the name of our sovereign concerning the negroes carried off contrary to the treaty although it has been frequently and constantly insisted upon with the british ministry for several reasons one was a desire to confine the first memorial to one point the frontier posts that the real motives and intentions of the cabinet might be the more distinctly laid open to congress another reason was the frankness of ministers to own in conversation that the negroes must be paid for as a clear point another was that time might be allowed to you sir to transmit me the whole amount and evidence of the claim and lastly that i might have the explicit instructions of congress to demand payment for the negroes in money and especially at what prices they should be stated by the answer of lord carmarthen to the memorial of the  0th of november congress will see that the detention of the posts is attempted to be justified by the laws of certain states impeding the course of law for the recovery of old debts c were another memorial to be now presented relative to the negroes the same answer would undoubtedly be given or more probably a reference only to that answer it is my duty to be explicit with my country and therefore i hope it will not be taken amiss by any of my fellow citizens when they are told that it is in vain to expect the evacuation of posts     or payment for the negroes a treaty of commerce or restoration of prizes payment of the maryland or rhode island demand compensation to the boston merchants or any other relief of any kind until these laws are all repealed nor will the ministry ever agree to any explanation concerning the interest during the war or payments by instalments the old creditors have formed themselves into a society and have frequent meetings send committees to mr pitt and lord carmarthen and i am well informed oppose even a treaty of commerce upon this ground and the ministers know them to be so numerous that they could raise a clamor a consideration which has always had more weight at this court and in parliament than the interest of america or the british empire what then is to be done the states it may be said will not repeal their laws if they do not then let them give up all expectation from this court and country unless you can force them to do as you please by investing congress with full power to regulate trade i will run the hazard sir of all the clamor that can be raised against me by my friends or by my enemies if any such there are and of all the consequences that can befall me for writing my sentiments freely to congress on a subject of this importance it will appear to all the world with an ill grace if we complain of breaches of the treaty when the british court have it in their power to prove upon us breaches of the same treaty of greater importance my advice then if it is not impertinent to give it is that every law of every state which concerns either debts or royalists which can be impartially construed contrary to the spirit of the treaty of peace be immediately repealed and the debtors left to settle with their creditors or dispute the point of interest at law i do not believe a jury would give the interest i beg leave to suggest another thing if congress are themselves clear that interest during the war was not part of that bonâ fide debt which was intended by the contracting parties they may declare so by a resolution or the legislatures of the separate states may declare so and then the courts of justice and the juries will certainly give no interest during the war but even in this case those states which have few debts and have made no laws against the recovery of them will think it hard that they should be subjected to dangers by     the conduct of such as have many and have made laws inconsistent with the treaty both respecting debts and tories you will give me leave sir to suggest another idea suppose the states should venture to do themselves justice for example suppose maryland should undertake to pay herself for her bank stock and negroes carried off after the treaty by accepting security for it from her own citizens who are debtors to british subjects and giving discharges to those debtors or engaging to stand between them and the claims of the creditor suppose the carolinas virginia and all the other states which had negroes carried off after the peace should do the same suppose massachusetts should make up the losses of the inhabitants of boston in goods carried off by general howe in the same way at least those of them who were promised compensation by general howe for these are undoubtedly creditors of the british government suppose further that each state should undertake in the same way to compensate the owners of vessels taken after the commencement of the armistice i throw out these hints as possibilities and speculations only sensible that they might open a door to much altercation but i will not fail to add that i think it would be much sounder policy and nobler spirit to repeal at once every law of every state which is in the smallest degree inconsistent with the treaty respecting either debts or tories and am well persuaded that no inconvenience would be felt from it neither law suits nor bankrupticies nor imprisonments would be increased by it on the contrary the credit and commerce of all the states would be so increased that the debtors themselves in general would find their burthens lighter with great esteem c john adams p s inclosed are two acts of parliament and the kings last proclamation the other acts which affect america shall be sent as soon as they are passed and i can obtain them     thomas jefferson  0 may      paris john adams thomas jefferson to john adams paris  0 may      dear sir— in my letter of this day i omitted to inform you that according to what we had proposed i have had a long consultation with the count de vergennes on the expediency of a diplomatic mission to constantinople his information is that it will cost a great deal of money as great presents are expected at that court and a great many claim them and his opinion is that we shall not buy a peace one penny the cheaper at algiers he says that these people do indeed acknowledge a kind of vassalage to the porte and avail themselves of it when there is any thing to be claimed but regard it not at all when it subjects them to a duty that money and fear are the two only agents at algiers he cited the example of spain which though under treaty with the porte is yet obliged to buy a peace at algiers at a most enormous price this is the sum of his information the baron de tott is gone to flanders for the summer i am c thomas jefferson john adams   june      london james bowdoin to james bowdoin london   june      sir— dr gordon yesterday called upon me with the letter which your excellency did me the honor to write me on the  0th of april i have long since transmitted to congress the answer of the board of admiralty to the representations relative to the conduct of captain stanhope in which the letters of that officer are disapproved the representations of the encroachments on the territory of the united states have been laid before the british ministry but i presume they will like many others be little attended to in short sir i must be so free as to say to you that by every thing i have seen and heard in this country nothing of any material consequence will ever be done while there remains in force a law of any one state impeding the recovery of bonâ fide debts contracted before the  0th of november      or inconsistent     with the article of the treaty of peace respecting the tories it is very true that mitchells map governed the american and british plenipotentiaries in settling the line between the two nations there is upon that map but one river which is marked with the name of st croix and that was the object undoubtedly fixed upon there is no river upon that map that i remember marked with the name of schoodack or megacadava next to the great river st johns proceeding westward on that map is a little river inscribed mechior next to that is another stream running between the words carriage harbor next to that we come to a larger river running from kousaki lake into the bay passamaquoddy and inscribed with the name of river st croix next to that still proceeding westward is passamaquoddy river but that inscribed river st croix running from the sea or what i call passamaquoddy bay up to the kousaki lake was marked with the pencil for the boundary it is impossible for me to say more if the true st croix cannot be discovered by these marks there is no remedy but by an ulterior agreement or the law of the strongest it is astonishing that to this hour no man can produce a map of all the bays harbors islands and rivers in that neighborhood that can be depended on if the ministry will meet me in a fair discussion of the question or in any of the methods pointed out to me by my superiors for a settlement i shall be glad they have it under consideration and as soon as they give me an answer i shall transmit it to congress but as they do not love pains and trouble so well as you and i do i fear they will leave it all to sir guy carleton who is no more of a friend to the united states than any other british knight and will be guided by the royalists more than by maps or surveys why any of my countrymen should choose to give to these royalists so much importance as they do i know not we should recollect that all parties in this country are pledged to support them and party faith is a stronger tie than national faith the paper relative to alexander gross of truro i must transmit to mr jefferson it being in his department i may nevertheless previously communicate it to the comte dadhemar and request his friendly offices in the matter yours john adams     john adams   june      london count dadhemar to count dadhemar london   june      sir— i do myself the honor to inclose to your excellency an extract of a letter i received yesterday from his excellency james bowdoin governor of massachusetts together with the documents under the seal of the state therein referred to as the ransoming captain is an englishman he no doubt applauds himself for the address with which he persuaded a simple american to go as a hostage upon promises which as he never has given himself any concern about he probably never intended to fulfil at present as gross can have no remedy against him he has no compassion for gross and would probably with great indifference suffer him to pass all his days in prison and as the relations of the hostage are poor and unable to pay the ransom he must remain in prison till he perishes unless the government or the persons interested will consent to his liberation i beg leave to intercede with your excellency in behalf of my unfortunate countryman that his case may be transmitted to your court to the end that he may be set at liberty either by the humanity of the persons interested or by the authority of government upon whom the expense of his maintenance in prison for life will otherwise fall yours john adams john adams   june      london thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson london   june      dear sir— yesterday i received your favor of  0th may with its inclosures you have since that day no doubt received my answer to yours of the   th in which i agreed perfectly with you in the propriety of sending mr lamb to congress without loss of time i am content to send mr randal with him but had rather he should come to you first and then to me and embark in london after we shall have had opportunity from his conversation to learn as much as we can the comte de vergennes is undoubtedly right in his judgment that avarice and fear are the only agents at algiers and  00 that we shall not have peace with them the cheaper for having a treaty with the sublime porte but is he certain we can ever at any price have peace with algiers unless we have it previously with constantinople and do not the turks from constantinople send rovers into the mediterranean and would not even treaties of peace with tunis tripoli algiers and morocco be ineffectual for the security of our mediterranean trade without a peace with the porte the porte is at present the theatre of the politics of europe and commercial information might be obtained there the first question is what will it cost us to make peace with all five of them set it if you will at five hundred thousand pounds sterling though i doubt not it might be done for three or perhaps for two the second question is what damage shall we suffer if we do not treat compute six or eight per cent insurance upon all your exports and imports compute the total loss of all the mediterranean and levant trade compute the loss of one half your trade to portugal and spain the third question is what will it cost to fight them i answer at least half a million a year without protecting your trade and when you leave off fighting you must pay as much money as it would cost you now for peace the interest of half a million sterling is even at six per cent  0000 guineas a year for an annual interest of £ 0000 sterling then and perhaps for £  000 or £ 0000 we can have peace when a war would sink us annually ten times as much but for gods sake dont let us amuse our countrymen with any further projects of sounding we know all about it as much as ever we can know until we have the money to offer we know if we send an ambassador to constantinople he must give presents how much the comte de vergennes can tell you better than any man in europe we are fundamentally wrong the first thing to be done is for congress to have a revenue taxes duties must be laid on by congress or the assemblies and appropriated to the payment of interest the moment this is done we may borrow a sum adequate to all our necessities if it is not done in my opinion you and i as well as every other servant of the united states in europe ought to go home give up all points and let all our exports and imports be done in european bottoms my indignation  0  is roused beyond all patience to see the people in all the united states in a torpor and see them a prey to every robber pirate and cheat in europe jews and judaizing christians are now scheming to buy up all our continental notes at two or three shillings in the pound in order to oblige us to pay them at twenty shillings this will be richer plunder than that of algerines or lloyds coffeehouse i remain c john adams john adams    june      john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square    june      dear sir— two days ago i was honored with your letter of the  th of may in which another of the  st of the same month is referred to and as i hear there is a passenger expected from the packet i hope to receive it from him when he arrives in town lord carmarthen told me yesterday that he had letters from mr anstey mentioning his civil reception his lordship said too that a minister plenipotentiary would certainly be sent to congress that it was not from any coldness or want of respect to the united states that it had not been already done but merely from the difficulty of finding a proper person that he had received many applications but they had been generally from persons who he was sure would not be agreeable in america and in some instances from persons more suitable for a place in the customs than in the corps diplomatique a long conversation ensued upon the subject of the posts debts c little of which being new is worth repeating the policy of giving up the interest during the war and of agreeing to a plan of payment by instalments was again insisted on from various considerations particularly from the evident injustice of demanding interest for that period it was argued that the claim of interest in most cases was grounded upon custom and the mutual understanding of the parties but that it never had been the custom nor had it ever been understood or foreseen that an act of parliament should be passed casting the american debtor out of the protection of the crown cutting  0  off all correspondence and rendering all intercourse criminal for that was the result and the legal construction during the whole war here his lordship fully agreed with me and even outwent me in saying that it was very true that by construction of the law of this land it was high treason in a creditor in great britain to receive a remittance from his debtor in america during the war his lordship added some slight expressions concerning the interest and wished that the courts were open for recovering the principal we might leave the interest for an after consideration in short they waited only for some appearance of a disposition the answer to my memorial of  0th november contained their true intentions they sincerely meant to fulfil every engagement whenever they saw a disposition on our part these expressions you see are somewhat oracular but they conveyed so much meaning to me that i will no longer hesitate to recommend to congress to take up this matter and decide it at once it would be going too far to point out the mode but it may be suggested to require of all the states who have made laws irreconcilable to the treaty immediately to repeal them declaring at the same time that interest upon book debts and simple contracts during the war cannot be considered as any part of the bonâ fide debts intended in the treaty as to specialties there may be in some cases more difficulty yet i do not see but the same reasoning is applicable to all the legal contract was dissolved by throwing us out of the protection of the crown and our subsequent assumption of independence and had no existence until renewed by treaty private honor and conscience are out of this question those who think themselves bound by these ties will do as they please but i believe under all the circumstances few persons even of the most delicate sentiments will be scrupulous if such a declaration should be made by congress candor will require that it should extend to both sides to the british and refugee debtor to american creditors as well as vice versâ if congress should choose to avoid involving themselves in such a declaration it would not be proper for individual states to do it and in this case i humbly conceive the laws ought to be repealed and the question left to judges and juries who  0  upon the strictest construction of law equity and the treaty may in my opinion in most cases if not in all deny the interest during the war to the creditor in some of these ways relief must be had or in none for the ministry here will never intermeddle in the business if any one should ask what was the intention of the contracting parties at the treaty the answer must be the treaty itself must determine and any one who reads it may judge as well as one of the plenipotentiaries the word heretofore was not used in preference to the words before the war with any view to the interest but to comprehend debts which had been contracted during the war the intention was no doubt that whatever judges and juries should find to be a debt should be recovered and i believe that any man acting in the character of either will find it difficult to say upon his oath that interest during the war is bonâ fide due did any debtor foreseeing the war contract a debt and pledge his faith to pay interest during the continuance of it let this be proved and a judge or juror would compel payment but probably there is not one such case the war may be considered as one of those accidents bonâ fide not expected or foreseen against which equity will always give relief with great and sincere esteem c john adams david griffith    june      philadelphia john adams david griffith to john adams philadelphia    june      sir— the general

inhabitants of the coast of barbary to the united states renders it necessary that every information which can be obtained should be laid before congress and as the demands for the redemption of captives as well as the amount of customary presents are so much more considerable than seem to have been expected in america it appears to us necessary that you should return without loss of time to new york there to give an account to congress of all the particulars which have come to your knowledge as well as of your own proceedings and of the moneys which have been paid on account of the united states in consequence of your drafts upon their ministers in london from congress when you arrive there you will receive orders for your future government and in the mean time we have no further occasion for your services in europe if you know of  0  a certain passage immediately from any port in spain we advise you to avail yourself of it if not we think it most advisable for you to come to paris and from thence after having consulted with mr jefferson to repair to lorient and embark for new york in the first packet as the instructions we send to mr randal are to come on to paris in his way to america unless he should choose to accompany you from some port in spain we desire you to furnish him with money for his expenses to paris and london out of the cash already in your hands and we recommend to him as well as to you all reasonable attention to economy we are c john adams t jefferson john adams   july      london thomas jefferson to t jefferson london   july      dear sir— yours of the   d june is come to hand with a copy of mr lambs of  th june from aranjuez there is no intelligence from america of armies marching to take the posts from the english the news was made as i suppose against the opening of the three per cents and it had the intended effect to beat down the stocks a little although the posts are important the war with the turks is more so i lay down a few simple propositions   we may at this time have peace with them in spite of all the intrigues of the english or others to prevent it for a sum of money   we never shall have peace though france spain england and holland should use all their influence in our favor without a sum of money   that neither the benevolence of france or the malevolence of england will be ever able materially to diminish or increase the sum   the longer the negotiation is delayed the larger will be the demand from these premises i conclude it to be wisest for us to negotiate and pay the necessary sum without loss of time  0  now i desire you and our noble friend the marquis to give me your opinion of these four propositions which of them do you deny or doubt if you admit them all do you admit the conclusion perhaps you will say fight them though it should cost us a great sum to carry on the war and although at the end of it we should have more money to pay as presents if this is your sentiment and you can persuade the southern states into it i dare answer for it that all from pennsylvania inclusively northward would not object it would be a good occasion to begin a navy at present we are sacrificing a million annually to save one gift of £ 00000 this is not good economy we might at this hour have two hundred ships in the mediterranean whose freights alone would be worth £ 00000 besides the influence upon the price of our produce our farmers and planters will find the price of their articles sink very low indeed if this peace is not made the policy of christendom has made cowards of all their sailors before the standard of mahomet it would be heroical and glorious in us to restore courage to ours i doubt not we could accomplish it if we should set about it in earnest but the difficulty of bringing our people to agree upon it has ever discouraged me you have seen mr randal before this no doubt if he has not fallen sick on the road this letter is intended to go by mr fox the chevalier de pintos courier unfortunately missed a packet which delayed him and consequently the treaty a month the queen his mistress as i wrote you a few days since has given orders to her squadron cruising in the straits to protect all vessels belonging to the united states this is noble and deserves thanks with great respect john adams thomas jefferson   july      paris john adams t jefferson to john adams paris   july      dear sir— i wrote you last on the   d of may your favor of that date did not come to hand till the   th of june in consequence of it i wrote the next day letters to mr lamb  0  and mr randal copies of which i have now the honor to inclose you in these you will perceive i had desired mr randal who was supposed to be at madrid to return immediately to paris and london and to mr lamb supposed at alicant i recommended the route of marseilles and paris expecting that no direct passage could be had from alicant to america and meaning on his arrival here to advise him to proceed by the way of london that you also might have an opportunity of deriving from him all the information he could give on the  d july mr randal arrived here and delivered me a letter from mr lamb dated may  0 of which i inclose you a copy as well as of another of june   which had come to hand some time before copies of these i have also sent to mr jay yours of the   th of june by dr bancroft and inclosing a draft of a joint letter to mr lamb came to hand on the  th instant i immediately signed and forwarded it as it left him more at liberty as to his route than mine had done mr randal will deliver you the present and supply the information heretofore received i think with you that congress must begin by getting money when they have this it is a matter of calculation whether they will buy a peace or force one or do nothing i am also to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of june      and    the case of gross shall be attended to i am not certain however whether my appearing in it may not do him harm by giving the captors a hope that our government will redeem their citizen i have therefore taken measures to find them out and sound them if nothing can be done privately i will endeavor to interest this government have you no news yet of the treaty with portugal does it hang with that court my letters from new york of the   th of may inform me that there were then eleven states present and that they should ratify the prussian treaty immediately as the time for exchange of ratifications is drawing to a close tell me what is to be done and how this exchange is to be made we may as well have this settled between us before the arrival of the ratification that no time may be lost after that i learn through the maréchal de castries that he has information of new yorks having ceded the impost in the form desired by congress so as to close this business corrections in the acts  0  of maryland pennsylvania c will come of course we have taken up again the affair of whale oil that they may know in time in america what is to be done in it i fear we shall not obtain any further abatement of duties but the last abatement will be continued for three years the whole duties payable here are nearly one hundred and two livres on the english ton which is an atom more than four guineas according to the present exchange the monopoly of the purchase of tobacco for this country which had been obtained by robert morris had thrown the commerce of that article into agonies he had been able to reduce the price in america from  0s to   s  d lawful the hundred weight and all other merchants being deprived of that medium of remittance the commerce between america and this country so far as it depended on that article which was very capitally too was absolutely ceasing an order has been issued obliging the farmers general to purchase from such other merchants as shall offer fifteen thousand hogsheads of tobacco at thirtyfour thirtysix and thirtyeight livres the hundred according to the quality and to grant to the sellers in other respects the same terms as they had granted to robert morris as this agreement with morris is the basis of this order i send you some copies of it which i will thank you to give to any american not british merchants in london who may be in that line during the year this contract has subsisted virginia and maryland have lost £ 00000 by the reduction of the price of their tobacco i am meditating what step to take to provoke a letter from mrs adams from whom my files inform me i have not received one these hundred years in the mean time present my affectionate respects to her and be assured of the friendship and esteem with which i have the honor to be dear sir c thomas jefferson john adams  0 july      london john jay to secretary jay london  0 july      dear sir— i have received the letter you did me the honor to write me on the  th of june with the ratification of the treaty with prussia as the term limited is near expiring i   0 shall go over to holland or send colonel smith to make the exchange mr penn a member of the house of commons whose character is well known in america and in england as a steady friend to our country will be the bearer of this and will be able to acquaint you with the present disposition of this court and nation and i believe his information although a british subject and senator will not be materially different from mine i cannot but lament from my inmost soul that lust for paper money which appears in some parts of the united states there will never be any uniform rule if there is a sense of justice nor any clear credit public or private nor any settled confidence in public men or measures until paper money is done away it is a great satisfaction to me to learn that you have received in my letter of the  th march the answer of this court to the memorial respecting the posts as that is a despatch of more importance than all others you have received from me i shall be anxious to know your sentiments upon it you will not expect me to answer lord carmarthens letter nor to take any further steps concerning it until i shall receive the orders of congress i wish for the instructions of that august body concerning a requisition in their name for the negroes whether i am to demand payment for them at what prices and for what number with great regard c john adams john adams    july      london thomas jefferson to t jefferson london    july      dear sir— i have received the ratification of the prussian treaty and next thursday shall set off for the hague in order to exchange it with the baron de thulemeier your favor of the   th instant i have received there are great and weighty considerations urged in it in favor of arming against the algerines and i confess if our states could be brought to agree in the measure i should be very willing to resolve upon external war with vigor and protect our trade and people the resolution to fight them would raise the spirits     and courage of our countrymen immediately and we might obtain the glory of finally breaking up these nests of banditti but congress will never or at least not for years take any such resolution and in the mean time our trade and honor suffers beyond calculation we ought not to fight them at all unless we determine to fight them forever this thought i fear is too rugged for our people to bear to fight them at the expense of millions and make peace after all by giving more money and larger presents than would now procure perpetual peace seems not to be economical did monsieur de massac carry his point without making the presents has not france made presents ever since did any nation ever make peace with any one barbary state without making the presents is there an example of it i believe not and fancy you will find that even massac himself made the presents i agree in opinion of the wisdom and necessity of a navy for other uses but am apprehensive it will make bad worse with the algerines i will go all lengths with you in promoting a navy whether to be applied to the algerines or not but i think at the same time we should treat your letter however has made me easier upon this point nevertheless to humble the algerines i think you have undercalculated the force necessary they have now fifty gunboats which being small objects against great ships are very formidable  none of these existed in the time of monsieur massac the harbor of algiers too is fortified all round which it was not in m massacs time which renders it more difficult and dangerous to attempt a blockade i know not what dependence is to be put upon portugal and naples in case of a war with the barbarians perhaps they might assist us in some degree blocking algiers would not obtain peace with morocco so that our commerce would still be exposed after all though i am glad we have exchanged a letter on     the subject i perceive that neither force nor money will be applied our states are so backward that they will do nothing for some years if they get money enough to discharge the demands upon them in europe already incurred i shall be agreeably disappointed a disposition seems rather to prevail among our citizens to give up all ideas of navigation and naval power and lay themselves consequently at the mercy of foreigners even for the prices of their produce it is their concern and we must submit for your plan of fighting will no more be adopted than mine of treating this is more humiliating to me than giving the presents would be i have a letter from mr jay of  th july by packet containing nothing but an acknowledgment of our letter of   th april new hampshire and rhode island have suspended their navigation acts and massachusetts now left alone will suspend theirs so that all will be left to the convention whose system if they form one will not be completed adopted and begin to operate under several years congress have received the answer which you saw to my memorial of  0th november and mr ramsay writes me he is not distressed at it because it will produce a repeal of all the laws against recovering private debts i am c john adams thomas jefferson    august      paris john adams t jefferson to john adams paris    august      dear sir— your favor of july   st was lately delivered to me the papers inform me you are at the hague and uncertain what stay you may make there i send this by mr voss who is returning to london by the way of amsterdam i inclose you the last letters from mr barclay and mr carmichael by which we may hope our peace with morocco is signed thanks to the good offices of a nation which is honest if it is not wise this event with the naval cruises of portugal will i hope quiet the atlantic for us i am informed by authority to be depended on that insurance is made at lorient on american vessels sailing under their own flag against every event at the price usually paid for risks of the sea alone still however     the most important of our marts the mediterranean is shut i wrote you a proposition to accept mr barclays offer of going to algiers i have no hope of its making peace but it may add to our information abate the ardor of those pirates against us and shut the mouths of those who might impute our success at morocco and failure at algiers to a judicious appointment to the one place and an injudicious one at the other let me hear from you as soon as possible on this and if you accede to it send me all the necessary papers ready signed i inclose you the article états unis of one of the volumes of the encyclopédie lately published the author m de meusnier was introduced to me by the duc de la rochefoucauld he asked of me information on the subject of our states and left with me a number of queries to answer knowing the importance of setting to rights a book so universally diffused and which will go down to late ages i answered his queries as fully as i was able went into a great many calculations for him and offered to give further explanations where necessary he then put his work into my hands i read it and was led by that into a still greater number of details by way of correcting what he had at first written which was indeed a mass of errors and misconceptions from beginning to end i returned him his work and my details but he did not communicate it to me after he had corrected it it has therefore come out with many errors which i would have advised him to correct and the rather as he was very well disposed he has still left in a great deal of the abbé raynal that is to say a great deal of falsehood and he has stated other things on bad information i am sorry i had not another correction of it he has paid me for my trouble in the true coin of his country most unmerciful compliment this with his other errors i should surely have struck out had he sent me the work as i expected before it went to the press i find in fact that he is happiest of whom the world says least good or bad i think if i had had a little more warning my desire to see holland as well as to meet again mrs adams and yourself would have tempted me to take a flying trip there i wish you may be tempted to take paris in your return you will find many very happy to see you here and none more so than dear sir your friend and servant thomas jefferson     john adams    september      london thomas jefferson to t jefferson london    september      dear sir— on my return from holland on the  th instant i found your favors of the  th and   th august on my arrival at the hague the exchange of ratifications was made on the  th august with the baron de thulemeier and i had it printed it is only in french copies shall be sent you as soon as i can find an opportunity we were present at utrecht at the august ceremony of swearing in their new magistrates in no instance of ancient or modern history have the people ever asserted more unequivocally their own inherent and unalienable sovereignty but whatever pleasure i might have in enlarging upon this subject i must forbear the affair of the oil has taken a turn here the whalemen both at greenland and the southward have been unsuccessful and the price of spermaceti oil has risen above £ 0 per ton boylstons ship arrived with two or three hundred tons and finding he could pay the duties and make a profit of twentyfive per cent he sold his cargo here instead of going to france as he intended this circumstance will oblige the french court or the french merchants or both to take other measures or they will lose this trade the price of oil will rise in boston so much that i am afraid mr barretts contract must be fulfilled at an immense loss as to mr lambs settlement i still think he had better embark forthwith for new york from spain if he cannot he may transmit to you and me his account and remit to us the balance in favor of the united states mr barclays proposal of going to tunis and tripoli i suppose appears to you as it does to me from what we learned from the ambassador from tripoli in london to be unnecessary at least till we hear further from congress it seems to me too very unlikely that any benefit will be had from the journey to algiers i wish to see the treaty with morocco and to know the particulars of that affair first at present i believe we are taken in and that we shall be plagued with demands for annual presents i confess i have no faith in the supposition that spanish     interference has counted for money or at least that it will pass long for it if however you are clearly in favor of sending mr barclay to algiers i will make out a commission and send it to you for your signature signed by myself because i would not set up my own judgment against yours mr carmichaels and mr barclays but i confess at present i cannot see any advantage in it but on the contrary several disadvantages mr randal is gone to congress and we may expect further orders ere long with great respect c john adams john adams    october      john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square    october      dear sir— when the ratification of congress of their treaty with the king of prussia arrived here the term limited for the exchange of it was near expiring as a few members of the statesgeneral had discovered uneasiness at my coming to london without going to the hague to take leave it seemed a convenient opportunity to go over and show them as much of the respect they required as remained in my power accordingly i went and making the customary visits to the president pensionary and secretary renewed the assurances of the friendship esteem and respect of the united states for their high mightinesses and the republic and the visit appeared to be kindly received the exchange of ratifications was soon made with the baron de thulemeier who had time to transmit the act of congress to the great prince who first proposed the treaty some days before he expired the ratification under the signature of frederic the great is here inclosed at the same time sir you will receive so much of the substance of a treaty of commerce between france and england as the ministry have thought fit to publish this is so great an event and must have consequences so extensive that i feel myself incapable of forming any judgment of it upon the whole every treaty of commerce between these nations for three hundred years has been found beneficial to france and hurtful to england but at present this nation is very sanguine the     advantage will be theirs they boast of the superior skill of their manufacturers of the superlative excellence of their manufactures the multitude of inventions and machines peculiar to themselves by which time and labor are saved and productions sold cheaper than in any other country a market like france where fiveandtwenty millions of people have occasion for english fabrics must be a valuable acquisition commercial connections by softening prejudices may lessen the disposition to war and a friendship even an alliance with france would enable the two nations to govern the world this is at present the style of conversation and the treaty appears to be popular france and england are both endeavoring at this moment to impose upon each other by professing desires of friendship which they never felt the secret motive of both is to impose upon the united states of america the english imagine that by assuming an appearance of friendship for france they shall excite a jealousy of france in america and provoke congress to break their faith with her the french are in hopes that by putting on a show of familiarity with england they shall stimulate congress to make them proposals of closer connections the whole at bottom is a farce of political hypocrisy the united states will continue steadily it is to be hoped on the reserve england is now pursuing her proposals of treaties of commerce with the emperor the empress of russia with denmark and portugal and perhaps spain france and the emperor took the only way to compel england to treat when they by their edicts prohibited british manufactures the united states must imitate the example or they will never be attended to the present appearances of friendship are forced and feigned the time may not be far distant however when we may see a combination of england and the house of bourbon against the united states it is not in gloomy moments only but in the utmost gayety of heart i cannot get rid of the persuasion that the fair plant of liberty in america must be watered in blood you have seen enough in europe to know that these melancholy forebodings are no chimeras there is such a disposition in the principal powers who have possessions in the indies that our country will find no other resources but to swear her childdren     on the holy altar to fight them all at once in defence of her liberties it may have some tendency to save us from such extremities if we enter into treaties with the two empires for these will soon be jealous of any connection between france and england the chevalier de pintos courier is not yet returned from lisbon with the treaty this worthy minister makes frequent apologies on account of the absence of the queen in the country and the unsettled state of the court but perhaps there may be difficulties which he is not apprised of or not inclined to mention mr barclays treaty with morocco is not yet come to hand congress will i hope determine whether we are to send him or any other to algiers without more money in his hands it would cost us three or four thousand pounds to send any one and unless he has power to offer larger presents he would only make matters worse i hope our country in every part of it will cherish their militia as the apple of their eyes and put every thing in as good a posture of defence as possible and keep up a constant expectation of war this is the best and most serious advice that can be given by dear sir c john adams samuel osgood    october      john adams the treasury board to john adams board of treasury    october      sir— in your letter of the   th may last you were pleased to inform us that you had already accepted bills which had been drawn on you to a considerable amount by messrs barclay and lamb in consequence of the appropriation which had been made by congress for forming treaties with the barbary powers but as we have no advice from you since that date we are at a loss to know whether the whole or what part of the appropriation has been drawn for on the dutch commissioners to the present day the accounts transmitted by those gentlemen to the first of june last do not specify the particular disbursements for this object but as far as we are able to form an estimate from the accounts transmitted we presume that     out of the various drafts you have made on them to the first of june last   000 florins have been on account of the barbary negotiations if this is the case    000 florins remained after that day subject to the appropriation above mentioned the embarrassments of the government for want of a steady and operative system of revenue are daily growing more distressing and such commotions have of late prevailed in the states of massachusetts and new hampshire that we cannot promise ourselves that the complexion of our affairs will soon change for a better thus circumstanced it has not been in our power since the remittance of the last sum of    000 florins through your hands to make any considerable remittance to the dutch commissioners we wish therefore most anxiously that the whole of the moneys appropriated by congress may not have been exhausted by an unsuccessful attempt to form treaties as we are extremely apprehensive that in this case there may not be sufficient funds in the month of february next in the hands of the dutch commissioners to enable them to discharge the interest which will then be due and it is not in our power to remit in season any funds to make up a deficiency if therefore you can possibly avoid drawing out of the hands of messrs willink the whole of the moneys which have been appropriated for the barbary treaties till the february interest is discharged we must request the favor of you to do it and no time shall be lost on our part in making such further remittances as may complete any part of the sum of  00000 florins which may have been applied towards the payment of interest we are with great respect c samuel osgood walter livingston arthur lee samuel osgood    november      new york john adams samuel osgood to john adams new york    november      dear sir— i have to acknowledge the receipt of your favor which i should have answered sooner had any thing within the compass of my knowledge occurred of sufficient consequence to     inform you of the present secretary for foreign affairs i have no doubt keeps you well informed of all the political occurrences here but in a government where expedients only keep up its existence it is impossible to foresee what sudden and unexpected changes may take place the federal government seems to be as near a crisis as it is possible for it to be the state governments are weak and selfish enough and they will of course annihilate the first their stubborn dignity will never permit a federal government to exist there are however a few men in every state who are very seriously impressed with the idea that without a proper federal head the individual states must fall a prey to themselves or any power that is disposed to injure them with this idea they are thinking very seriously in what manner to effect the most easy and natural change of the present form of the federal government to one more energetic that will at the same time create respect and secure properly life liberty and property it is therefore not uncommon to hear the principles of government stated in common conversation emperors kings stadtholders governorsgeneral with a senate or house of lords and house of commons are frequently the topics of conversation many are for abolishing all the state governments and for establishing some kind of general government but i believe very few agree in the general principles much less in the details of such a government how to effect a change is the difficulty the confederation provides that congress shall make the alterations and that they shall be adopted by the several legislatures yet the idea of a special convention appointed by the states to agree upon and propose such alterations as may appear necessary seems to gain ground but the danger is that neither congress nor a convention will do the business for the situation of the united states and of some of the particular states is such that an army must be kept up and the probability is at present that this army will be seriously employed and in case of a civil war the men of property will certainly attach themselves very closely to that army the final issue of which it is feared will be that the army will make the government of the united states many say already any change will be for the better   0 and are ready to risk any thing to effect it the disturbances in massachusetts seem most likely to produce some very important event it is a little surprising to some how they come to break out in such a manner there it is said that the insurgents have two objects in view one to reduce their state debt and those securities given by the united states to citizens of that state for their services or moneys loaned to their current value in the market the other to annihilate private debts perhaps this may be in part true and the greater number may have nothing further in view but to remedy some supposed grievances yet as it affords a fine opportunity for the restless enemies of this country to sow dissensions we have too much reason to believe that they are not only looking on as spectators but that they are industriously employed in disseminating disaffection to the present forms of government if these enemies are british or their old adherents among us which seems to be the case because they are traced from hampshire and berkshire to vermont and from thence to canada if they are british their object must be something further than mere revenge and that object can be nothing short of establishing a monarchical government in this country and placing some one of georges sons on the throne if this object is worth to the british from five to ten millions sterling and they can advance the money they can and will effect it not by force of arms for if they should come out openly against us we should fight again but be assured this country is extremely poor as well as extravagant and i have no doubt that ten millions artfully applied would secure nearly the whole country that the british will and do cherish all their old adherents is not to be doubted and that those adherents never will be americans is a principle founded in nature that the french will not be silent unoperative spectators in these negotiations if they should happen is most certainly to be expected they wish to keep us just where we are or if a little more insignificant quite as well they will therefore view without emotion any civil commotions that tend to weaken us but if there should be any danger of the scales preponderating in favor of any other foreign power they will act with their usual address the british party is and will be great the french party     also the genuine americans few the speculators numerous who care not what the government is so that they can speculate upon and spunge it mr jay will probably have furnished you with the newspapers of this country which will contain much with respect to the hostile disposition of the indians that the british instigate them to make depredations on us is very natural but why they are reënforcing canada which by the public papers appears to be the case is not so easy to determine all things are operating here to bring the cincinnati into vogue i cannot say i think they are all for supporting government but they are for having government the leader of the insurgents in masschusetts is entitled to the ribbon and eagle he left the army in the fall of    0 being then a captain of good reputation his name is shays a man without education but not without abilities he is privately involved which may be the reason why he has adopted such violent measures it is generally supposed that he cannot retreat as to the situation of the finances of the united states they can scarcely be in a worse condition as to making any further attempt to discharge any part of the principal or interest of our foreign debt it is in vain the thirteen states do not pay enough to keep the civil list together which does not require more than one hundred thousand dollars a year i have inclosed you a schedule which will give you a full view of the requisitions of congress the payments and balances due i am sir with great respect c samuel osgood john adams    january      john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square    january      dear sir— i must beg the indulgence of congress while i solicit their attention for a few moments to some particulars which are very interesting to me personally and have some relation to the foreign affairs of the united states it is now in the beginning of the tenth year since i embarked first for europe in obedience to the commands of the united states the various services to which they have been pleased to destine     me are known to congress by their own records and the particular details of the execution of their orders as far as circumstances have permitted have been transmitted from time to time to congress and their ministers of foreign affairs so that it would be unnecessary to repeat any thing of that kind upon this occasion the mission with which they honored me to the united provinces of the low countries both as public minister and as agent to negotiate a loan of money is not yet revoked the commissions to negotiate with the barbary states in which i had the honor to be associated with mr jefferson are still in force the commission to his britannic majesty will expire on the   th of february      this day thirteen months unless sooner revoked i take this early opportunity of informing congress of my intention to return to america as soon after the expiration of this commission as possible that measures may be taken in season to complete all the arrangements which that honorable assembly may judge necessary i have been a witness of so much respect and affection to the united states of america in the low countries and have there experienced so much candor and friendship to myself that it is natural for me to wish to take leave of their high mightinesses with decency and according to the forms that the usages of nations prescribe i must therefore solicit a letter of recall it would be a pleasure to me to go over in person to the hague in order to present it but as i have the most candid assurances that a memorial sent from hence would be equally well received i shall probably avoid the expense of a journey if congress judge a minister at that court necessary they will appoint one of course and if there is further occasion for borrowing any small sums of money they will commission a new agent colonel franks arrived here this morning with the treaty with morocco and will be despatched to congress without delay there is no probability of any further progress or success with the barbary powers without further orders from congress and larger sums of money if congress should give fresh instructions and order more money to be appropriated i must request that they will associate some other person with mr jefferson if they should not judge it more convenient for that able and excellent minister to conduct it alone or designate some other single person     to the service it may be the intention of congress to recall me from this court before the expiration of their present commission but as this would be a measure of éclat perhaps they may judge it more prudent to avoid it if congress determine to send another minister i hope it will be done in such season that he may arrive before my departure if no other minister is sent it will perhaps be thought necessary to leave the negotiation in the hands of a chargé daffaires colonel smith has at present only a commission as secretary of legation i may be permitted i hope without presuming too far to recommend him to this office and solicit it for him when he was appointed secretary he was unknown to me even by name he has since formed a connection in my family which renders it delicate for me to say any thing in his favor such a circumstance however cannot forfeit his title to justice from me and it is no more to say that his conduct his talents and his industry merit a much higher station than has yet been assigned him you know perfectly well sir that the office even of a public minister of the second order is a station extremely humiliating at any court in europe at versailles at madrid at the hague and at london the difference between ambassadors and ministers plenipotentiary or envoys is so immense that the latter are little more regarded than the maître dhôtel of a minister of state this is a fact known to you but not known to our countrymen and therefore i think it my duty to mention it that it may be considered the place of chargé daffaires is so much below that of minister and that of simple secretary of legation so much below that of chargé daffaires that nothing can reconcile a gentleman who has commanded in an army through a whole war with reputation to it but the most decided determination to sacrifice his feelings to the good or rather to the sense of his country i need not add that in the present times and circumstances these things are more intolerable in england than elsewhere may i be permitted to request that congress would be pleased to take up this subject as soon as their more important affairs will permit that their arrangements may be received in europe in time to despatch the few things both of a public and private nature that will remain for me to do a letter of recall from holland and an appointment in my place in the commission to     the barbary states are of importance to be expedited early if they do not arrive in season before the expiration of the commission to st james i shall presume that it is the intention of congress to take no further arrangement in those affairs and embark with my family for america in one of the early spring ships in      with great respect c john adams john adams    january      london john jay to john jay london    january      private my dear friend— i wrote you yesterday in your ministerial capacity as well as mine my ultimate determination to revisit my country this time twelve months i now write to you this private letter to entreat you as a friend to promote in every way in your power an arrangement as early as possible by which i may be permitted to return with decorum it is not from a desire to stimulate anybody to vote for a new commission to be sent me to this court which may for what i know be suspected by some but from a sincere and unalterable resolution to come home in all events that i have taken this measure thus early it would hurt me to come home in disobedience but in all events i will come home if congress should send me a new commission i shall certainly return it unaccepted this is between you and me and not intended to offend the feelings of any man whatever my northern friends may wish me to remain longer in europe but i must be excused i shall complete with submission to providence my ten years in europe and then go home my family join with me in affectionate compliments to you and yours a year will soon come about and then or soon after i may have the pleasure of kissing your hand mean time i am c john adams     john adams    january      london to the delegates of massachusetts in congress london    january      private gentlemen— i had yesterday the honor of writing to congress my desire and intention to return to america at the expiration of my commission to this court i know not the sentiments of my friends in congress and possibly some of them may wish me to remain longer in europe but i beg leave gentlemen to signify to you in this private manner my fixed resolution to return in all events candor requires that i should inform you of this to prevent you gentlemen from compromising yourselves and our state as well as me it would expose me to an odium and do no honor to any member of congress who should vote for me to remain longer in europe if i should come home against orders or without permission let me therefore request the favor of you gentlemen and of all the friends i have in congress to promote my recall according to the decent plan i have proposed to congress i hope the measure will be adopted with perfect unanimity to be explicit i am determined to come home though i should be compelled to do it in an ungracious manner but i hope this will not be made necessary with great respect c john adams john adams    january      london john jay the commissioners to secretary jay london    january      sir— we had the honor of transmitting to congress copies of the commission and instructions which in pursuance of the authority delegated to us were given to mr barclay to conclude a negotiation with morocco mr barclay has conducted that business to a happy conclusion and has brought with him testimonials of his prudent conduct from the emperor of morocco and his minister so clear and full that we flatter ourselves mr barclay will receive the approbation of congress mr barclay has received somewhat more than four thousand     pounds sterling for the expenses of presents and all other things colonel franks who accompanied mr barclay in his tedious journeys and difficult negotiations in the character of secretary will be despatched to congress and will have the honor of delivering this letter together with the treaty the emperors letter to congress and a variety of other papers relative to this mission a schedule of which is annexed the resolution of congress vacating mr lambs commission and instructions has been forwarded to him and we have repeatedly advised him to return to new york that gentleman has received somewhat more than three thousand pounds sterling of the public money for which he is accountable to congress we beg leave to recommend mr barclay and colonel franks to the favorable consideration of congress it is no small mortification not to be able to communicate any intelligence concerning the treaty with portugal the chevalier de pinto is equally uninformed his own confidential domestic despatched to lisbon last spring has been constantly waiting on the minister for an answer but has obtained none and has not yet returned to london the treaty between france and england has probably excited parties and surprise in portugal and the system of men and measures is not yet settled the apologies are the queens absence in the country and the prime ministers indisposition the article of money is become so scarce and precious that we shall be obliged to suspend all further proceedings in the barbary business even for the redemption of prisoners until we shall be honored with fresh instructions from congress with great respect c john adams thomas jefferson john adams    january      london to the marquis of carmarthen london    january      my lord— last night i received the card your lordship did me the honor to write me yesterday inclosing a petition to the right honorable the lords commissioners of his majestys     treasury from john hales relative to sixteen chinese seamen who are alleged to have informed mr hales that they came from india in the hyder or hydrœa captain clark belonging to the united states of america to ostend where they were discharged and caused to take passage to london in hopes of obtaining a passage to their own country all these allegations my lord are very surprising to me having no knowledge of any such ship as the hyder or hydrœa or of any such person as captain clark humanity my lord requires that the unhappy men should not be left to suffer but as i have no knowledge information or instructions concerning them i have no authority to do any thing for their relief there is reason to apprehend my lord that there is some mystery in this business which it will be for the interest and honor of both countries to clear up for which reason i shall do myself the honor to transmit your lordships note and the memorial to congress that the truth of the facts may be searched to the bottom and such measures taken as the interests of humanity as well as the honor and interests of both countries require with great respect c john adams john adams    january      london sidi hadji ben abdelleck fennish to sidi hadji ben abdelleck fennish london    january      we have received with high satisfaction the letter which your excellency by the command of his majesty the emperor of morocco did us the honor to write us on the first day of the blessed month ramadan   00 and transmitted to us by the honorable thomas barclay who was sent to your court in order to negotiate an amicable treaty of peace and commerce between his majesty the emperor of morocco and all his dominions and those of the united states of america we are happy to learn that this matter has been fortunately concluded to the satisfaction of all parties the contents of the treaty we have learned from the said envoy the honorable thomas barclay to whom his imperial majesty delivered it with a letter to the united states it is with the most respectful satisfaction that we learn from your excellency that the conduct of our said envoy the     honorable thomas barclay has the entire approbation of his imperial majesty and that he has behaved with integrity and honor since his arrival in his imperial majestys dominions and above all that his imperial majesty has been graciously pleased to give him two honorable favorable and unparalleled audiences signifying his majestys perfect satisfaction at his conduct we pray your excellency if you think proper to express to his imperial majesty the high sense we entertain of his majestys friendship to the united states of america and of his goodness to the said honorable mr barclay and we request of your excellency to accept of our sincere thanks for the kind assistance you have given to the said envoy in the course of these negotiations with much pleasure we learn that your excellency is charged by his imperial majesty with the affairs of our country at his court and doubt not that your excellency will do all that lies in your power to promote the friendly intercourse that is so happily begun we shall transmit without delay to the honorable the congress of the united states an account of all these proceedings and entertain the fullest assurance that they will receive in due time the approbation of that august assembly may the providence of the one almighty god whose kingdom is the only existing one protect your excellency we have the honor to be c john adams thomas jefferson john adams   february      london john jay to secretary jay london   february      sir— i wrote a few days since by colonel franks who embarks in the french packet from havre de grace with the morocco treaty there is no further intelligence of the portugal business nor any better prospect or more agreeable disposition in this country whatever artifices may be employed in america to keep up delusive hopes parliament opened with an uncommon gloom and has been sitting in a mournful silence nobody dares oppose the french     treaty yet nobody seems to have any confidence in it it seems truly a forced plant something to appease france and amuse the people the revenue is found to be greatly deficient a new loan and fresh taxes are expected a dead taciturnity prevails about america the gazettes are employed and every coffeehouse and booksellers shop filled with talkers to keep up the spirits of the people at any expense of truth the holding of our frontier posts is found to cost government more money annually than the whole trade is worth nay than the whole capital employed in it mr pitts plan for the session is not yet developed they are skirmishing about hastings and rodney who i suppose have nearly all the scribblers enlisting for or against them yet hastings must be acquitted and i suppose rodney remunerated right or wrong such is the state of this nation inclosed is a copy of the convention between france and england which was sent me yesterday by lord carmarthen and a letter from mr hales relative to the east india ship which it is supposed was made an american bottom a practice which congress will no doubt judge proper to discountenance as the politics of parliament shall open to view i shall do myself the honor to transmit you still further accounts of them by colonel franks i had the honor to convey to congress my intention to return home at the expiration of my commission to this court a duplicate will go by this opportunity a life so useless to the public and so insipid to myself as mine is in europe has become a burden to me as well as to my countrymen by the first packet or convenient merchantship in the spring of      i shall embark with my family if my life and health enough to make the voyage remain to me unless congress should see fit to recall me sooner which would be so much the more agreeable it will be necessary that arrangements should be made as early as possible and the pleasure of congress signified whether the secretary of legation is to return with me or remain longer here with great respect and esteem c john adams   0 thomas jefferson   february      paris john adams t jefferson to john adams paris   february      dear sir— your favors by colonel franks have come safely to hand he will set out from hence the  th instant the packet being to sail from havre the  0th i inclose you the copy of a letter from mr barclay and of the paper it inclosed in a letter from mr carmichael is a postscript dated   th december in the following words—since writing the preceding the portuguese ambassador has pressed me to hint that the present moment is favorable to push our treaty with his court in the body of the letter he says the comte dexpilly has promised me to continue his attention to our prisoners during his stay at algiers and i have also engaged the consul of spain who remains there on his return to take care of them advances have been made for their support which ought to be refunded i suppose that these advances have been made by order of mr lamb and that his powers being at an end it will be incumbent on us to take measures on that subject the comte de vergennes is extremely ill his disease is gouty we have for some days had hopes it would fix itself decidedly in the foot it shows itself there at times as also in the shoulder the stomach c m de calonne is likewise ill but his complaints are of a rheumatic kind which he has often had before the illness of these two ministers has occasioned the postponement of the assembly of the notables to the   th and probably will yet postpone it nothing is yet known of the objects of that meeting i send you a pamphlet giving a summary account of all the meetings of a general nature which have taken place heretofore the treaty between russia and this country is certainly concluded but its contents are not yet known i shall set out for the waters of aix on the   th instant so that i am unable to say when and whence i shall have the honor of addressing you again but i take measures for the conveying to me on my road all letters so that should any thing extraordinary require it i can at all times be recalled to paris in a fortnight i shall hope to hear from you at times as if i were in paris i thank you much for the valuable present     of your book  the subject of it is interesting and i am sure it is well treated i shall take it on my journey that i may have time to study it you told me once you had had thoughts of writing on the subject of hereditary aristocracy i wish you would carry it into execution it would make a proper sequel to the present work i wish you all possible happiness and have the honor to be c thomas jefferson thomas jefferson  0 february      paris john adams t jefferson to john adams paris  0 february      dear sir— i am now to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of january   th col franks sailed in the packet of this month from havre for new york this arrangement of the packets opens a direct communication between paris and america and if we succeed as i expect we shall in getting honfleur made a free port i hope to see that place become the deposit for our whale oil rice tobacco and furs and that from thence what is not wanted in this country may be distributed to others you remember giving me a letter of credit on messrs willink  staphorst for one thousand guineas to pay for the swords and medals when the swords were finished i drew on the van den yvers with whom the money was deposited for   00 livres to pay for the swords they paid it a medal is now finished and others will very soon be but these gentlemen say they must have fresh orders in the mean time the workmen complain will you be so good as to draw in favor of mr grand on willink  co for the balance of the thousand guineas which is about the sum that will be necessary and send the bill to mr grand who in my absence will negotiate it and pay the workmen i inclose you van den yvers answer the meeting of the notables on thursday and the necessity of paying my court to our new minister will detain me till friday and perhaps till tuesday next nothing is known yet of the objects of this assembly i inclose you two new pamphlets relative to it and will inform you of whatever i can discover relative to it during my stay     i learn with real pain the resolution you have taken of quitting europe your presence on this side of the atlantic gave me a confidence that if any difficulties should arise within my department i should always have one to advise with on whose counsels i could rely i shall now feel bewidowed i do not wonder at your being tired out by the conduct of the court you are at but is there not room to do a great deal of good for us in holland in the department of money no one can do it so well as yourself but you have taken your resolution i am sure on mature consideration and i have nothing to offer therefore but my regrets if any thing transpires from the notables before my departure worth communication you shall yet hear from me in the mean time believe me c thomas jefferson thomas jefferson    february      paris john adams t jefferson to john adams paris    february      dear sir— the notables met yesterday the king opened the assembly with a short speech wherein he expressed his inclination to consult with them on the affairs of his kingdom to receive their opinions on the plans he had digested and to endeavor to imitate the head of his family henry iv whose name is so dear to the nation the speech was affectionate the garde des sceaux spoke about twenty minutes complimented the clergy the noblesse the magistrates and tiers état the comptrollergeneral spoke about an hour he enumerated the expenses necessary to arrange his department when he came to it he said his returns had been minutely laid before the king he took a review of the preceding administrations and more particularly of m neckars he detailed the improvements which had been made he portrayed the present state of the finances and sketched the several schemes proposed for their improvement he spoke on a change in the form of the taxes the removal of the interior customhouses to the frontiers provincial administrations and some other objects the assembly was then divided into committees today there was to be another grand assembly the plans more fully explained and referred to the discussion of the committees the grand assembly will meet once a week and vote individually the     propriety of my attending the first audience day of count montmorin which will not be till the   th retards my departure till then i have read your book with infinite satisfaction and improvement it will do great good in america its learning and its good sense will i hope make it an institute for our politicians old as well as young there is one opinion in it however which i will ask you to reconsider because it appears to me not entirely accurate and not likely to do good page      congress is not a legislative but a diplomatic assembly separating into parts the whole sovereignty of our states some of these parts are yielded to congress upon these i should think them both legislative and executive and that they would have been judiciary also had not the confederation required them for certain purposes to appoint a judiciary it has accordingly been the decision of our courts that the confederation is a part of the law of the land and superior in authority to the ordinary laws because it cannot be altered by the legislature of any one state i doubt whether they are at all a diplomatic assembly on the first news of this work there were proposals to translate it fearing it might be murdered in that operation i endeavored to secure a good translator this is done and i lend him my copy to translate from it will be immediately commenced to prevent others attempting it i am with sincere esteem and respect c thomas jefferson john adams   march      london thomas jefferson to t jefferson london   march      dear sir— i am much obliged to you for your favors of february  0th and   rd by mr carnes and the curious pamphlets opening a direct communication between paris and america will facilitate the trade of the two countries very much and the new treaty between france and england will promote it still more john bull does not see it and if he does not see a thing at first you know it is a rule with him ever afterwards to     swear that it does not exist even when he does both see it and feel it i have this moment written to messrs willink and van staphorst to remit to you or mr grand in your absence what remains to be received to make up the thousand guineas for the swords and medals you having before drawn for   00 livres tournois as part of them my resolution of quitting europe has been taken upon mature deliberation but really upon motives of necessity as much at least as choice congress cannot consistently with their own honor and dignity renew my commission to this court and i assure you i should hold it so inconsistent with my own honor and dignity little as that may be that if it were possible for congress to forget theirs i would not forget mine but send their commission back to them unless a minister were sent from his britannic majesty to congress as to a residence in holland that climate is so destructive to my health that i could never bear it and i am sure it would be fatal to her on whom depends all the satisfaction that i have in life no consideration would tempt me to think of removing to that country with my family for a man who has been for thirty years rolling like a stone never three years in the same place it is no very pleasant speculation to cross the seas with a family in a state of uncertainty what is to be his fate what reception he shall meet at home whether he shall settle down in private life to his plough or push into the turbulent scenes of sedition and tumult whether he be sent to congress or a convention or god knows what if it lay in my power i would take a vow to retire to my little turnipyard and never again quit it i feel very often a violent disposition to take some resolution and swear to it but upon the whole it is best to preserve my liberty to do as i please according to circumstances the approbation you express in general of my poor volume is a vast consolation to me it is a hazardous enterprise and will be an unpopular work in america for a long time when i am dead it may be regretted that such advice was not taken in the season of it but as i have made it early in life and all along a rule to conceal nothing from the people which appeared to me material for their happiness and prosperity however unpopular it might be at the time or with particular     parties i am determined not now to begin to flatter popular prejudices and party passions however they may be countenanced by great authorities the opinion you object to page     that congress is not a legislative but a diplomatic assembly i should wish to have considered as a problem rather for consideration than as an opinion and as a problem too relative to the confederation as it now stands rather than to any other plan that may be in contemplation of the states it is a most difficult topic and no man at a distance can judge of it so well as those in america if the book should be translated into french i wish you to insert this in a note you have laid me under great obligation by taking the trouble to secure a good translator if the thing is worth translating at all it will not surely bear to lose any thing by the translation but will not the government prohibit it if i should get well home and spend a few years in retirement i shall pursue this subject somewhat further but i hope never to be left again to publish so hasty a production as this a work upon the subject you mention nobility in general which i once hinted to you a wish to see handled at large would be too extensive and splendid for my means and forces it would require many books which i have not and a more critical knowledge both of ancient and modern languages than at my age a man can aspire to there are but two circumstances which will be regretted by me when i leave europe one is the opportunity of searching any questions of this kind in any books that may be wanted and the other will be the interruption of that immediate correspondence with you which is one of the most agreeable events in my life there are four or five persons here with whom i hold a friendly intercourse and shall leave with some degree of pain but i am not at home in this country with every affectionate and friendly sentiment i am john adams john adams    april      london william s smith to william s smith london    april      dear sir— congress by their resolutions of february the  d      determined that the letter to the queen of portugal     herewith delivered you should be transmitted to her faithful majesty by your hands you will therefore prepare yourself as soon as conveniently may be and proceed to lisbon in your way as you pass through france and spain you will of course pay your respects to the ministers of the united states residing at those courts and to the ministers of foreign affairs of those sovereigns and endeavor to collect intelligence of any kind commercial or political in which the united states may be interested when you shall arrive at lisbon you will make your court to the minister of foreign affairs and communicate to him the object of your mission and take his advice concerning the delivery of the letter to her most faithful majesty if it should not be judged advisable to desire an audience the minister himself will deliver the letter to his mistress in whatever country or at whatever court you will remember to make your court to the ambassadors of all those sovereigns with whom the united states are in alliance france holland sweden prussia to all ministers consuls agents of these powers you will pay a particular regard while you show a respectful politeness to all others in all places you will endeavor to collect information concerning the barbary powers and the situation of our unfortunate countrymen in captivity at algiers especially from mr carmichael and mr barclay in spain if you should chance to meet the latter at lisbon you will inform yourself particularly of the state of the war between portugal and those piratical states that of venice with the same and naples and whether there is a prospect of peace the force of the algerines the probability of their coming out of the straits this summer the force of the portuguese that is to cruise against them you will also inform yourself particularly of the state of the commerce between the united states and portugal and by what means it might be extended improved and increased to the mutual advantage of both nations you will make particular inquiries concerning sugars the prices and qualities of brazil sugars raw or manufactured to satisfy yourself whether our countrymen might not purchase those sugars to advantage even for manufacture and exportation an experiment has been made in france of a purchase of raw sugars for boston and it     is suspected might be made to greater advantage in lisbon for philadelphia and new york as well as boston you will please to inquire whether the treaty which was signed last may between the american ministers and the chevalier de pinto has been agreed to by his court and if not what are the objections and whether there is a prospect of a renewal of the negotiation you will inquire particularly whether rice and indigo may be expected to obtain admission to portugal from carolina and georgia as they did before the late war whether flour has any chance to be admitted and what is the state of the trade of salt fish as the whole of the negotiations with portugal as well as with the barbary powers for the last two years have passed under your eye and indeed through your hands you are already acquainted with every particular which renders any further instructions in detail unnecessary the languages of europe are now become of much importance to us and every gentleman employed under the united states in the diplomatic department ought to take all reasonable methods to acquaint himself with them you will have in this journey a great opportunity of perfecting yourself in french and of improving yourself in spanish and the portuguese which is but a dialect of the spanish and in the italian in the article of expenses you will observe as much economy as possible consistent with the comfort of your journey the decency of your character and the honor of your country you will transmit your account to congress or the board of treasury or mr barclay and you will neglect no opportunity of writing to the secretary of foreign affairs i know very well that the situation of your family as well as your attention to the public service will be motives sufficient to induce you to lose no time unnecessarily and to return with as much expedition as the execution of the design of your journey will admit the interest the honor and dignity of the united states will never be out of your thoughts nor will any opportunity to promote either be neglected i wish you as pleasant a journey as the season promises and a happy return to your friends and your services at this court with great regard c john adams     john adams    april      london john jay to secretary jay london    april      dear sir— i do myself the honor to inclose the new act of parliament for regulating the trade between the territories of the united states of america and the dominions of the king of great britain by which congress will see that the same system continues and is fortified with fresh provisions provisions and lumber the growth or production of the united states are now prohibited from any foreign island the west india planters and merchants complain to no purpose the canada merchants give out that there is some negotiation on foot between lord dorchester and vermont the object of which is to give vent to the productions of that territory through canada and the river st lawrence that the west indies may derive some assistance from that source inclosed is another very curious bill that was moved in the house of lords by one chancellor and seconded by another thurlow and bathurst but the lords had honor enough to reject it the project is said to have originated in general arnold the whole transaction shows the spirit of the present ministry the chance of passing such a bill would have been greater in the house of commons where the ministers have a clearer majority some persons are of opinion that the present set cannot hold the reins much longer but if they are not mistaken there is little chance of a change for the better what effect the changes in france may have cannot be foreseen but they cannot but be favorable to america with great regard c john adams john adams   may      london john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square london   may      dear sir— i am honored with your letter of april  d and am happy to receive the resolutions of congress inclosed in it especially those of the   st of march      the convention at philadelphia is to consist of members of     such ability weight and experience that the result must be beneficial to the united states the settlement of so many great controversies such as those between the massachusetts and new york pennsylvania and connecticut new york and vermont c shows that the union has great weight in the minds of the people it is indeed an object of such magnitude that great sacrifices ought to be made to its preservation the consequences of a division of the continent cannot be foreseen fully perhaps by any man but the most shortsighted must perceive such manifest danger both from foreign powers and from one another as cannot be looked upon without terror the navigation of the mississippi in the south and the fisheries in the north have ever appeared to me objects without which the union cannot be preserved and therefore whether the free use of them be obstructed for a time or not it has ever appeared a dangerous policy to cede the right even for a moment inclosed is a letter from our unfortunate countrymen in captivity at algiers which must be sent in the original as there is not time to transcribe it i hope sir ere long to receive your orders in consequence of the resolutions of congress preparatory to my return home in the next spring the conduct of this court in so imprudently as well as uncivilly neglecting to send a minister to america renders it impossible for congress consistently with their own dignity to renew my commission when the american minister shall leave this country they will begin to think it necessary to send one of their own to new york they may for what i know wish in this way to get rid of one whom they have not been able to mould to their views in hopes of obtaining another of a more ductile temper let them try the experiment i dare say they will be disappointed for if congress appoints another he will not be found more to their taste this country is in a shocking situation its royal family its administration and its opposition are all such as will never seduce an american from his duty he will only be shocked at the sight and confirmed in his natural principles and feelings with great respect c john adams   0 wilhem jan willink nic jacob van staphorst    may      amsterdam john adams messrs willink and others to john adams amsterdam    may      agreeably to what we had the honor to acquaint your excellency the   th instant we have exerted ourselves to procure money for payment of the interest due the  st proximo by the united states a matter very difficult to be accomplished as we had against us the late news from america no immediate flattering prospects and an excessive scarcity of money here at present we have however been successful enough to persuade the undertakers to subscribe to a new loan for one million of florins upon the following conditions one thousand bonds for one thousand guilders each to be issued on the same conditions as the preceding loan of five per centum the interest commencing the first of june of which thousand bonds two hundred and forty to be immediately negotiated to the subscribers the one half of their amount to be paid upon the delivery of the bonds the undertakers reserving to themselves the faculty of taking one months credit for payment of the remaining half the surplus seven hundred and sixty bonds are to remain in our custody subject to be delivered to the undertakers each one in proportion to his subscription at the same rate of those actually negotiated at the expiration of which period those on hand will be at the free disposal of congress congress shall not be at liberty to make any further money negotiations in this country until the surplus seven hundred and sixty bonds shall be placed or before the end of the eighteen months they are to lie at the choice of the undertakers to purchase them such are the best conditions we have been able to obtain and although the money will cost the united states eight per cent including premium our commission brokerage and charges we deem ourselves fortunate to have been thus able to face the june interest an object your excellency justly views of the highest importance to the credit and interest of the united states by this arrangement we shall be obliged to advance part of     the interest until the undertakers shall have completed payment for the engaged bonds upon which advances we do not doubt the united states will most readily admit our charge of interest we endeavored all in our power that the money should be received by us in récépissés and thus leave you the time to visit this country at your conveniency to pass the bonds but the undertakers have insisted as an absolute condition that they should be liable to pay only on receipt of the bonds signed and perfected by you so that there is an indispensable necessity for your excellencys setting out for this country with the full power you have from congress by the packet which will leave harwich next wednesday or at latest on saturday the   th instant when we will have everything ready that your excellency may be able to return by the next or following packet we request your excellency to be assured nothing in our power was left untried to spare you this jaunt so suddenly but since the payment of the june interest entirely depends upon this exertion of your excellency we are confident it will be undertaken with alacrity and upon this conviction we have assumed to advertise the payment of the interest on the first of june which is in all our newspapers of this day we are respectfully c wilhem and jan willink nic and jacob van staphorst john adams    june      london john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square london    june      sir— inclosed is a copy of the translation from the dutch into the english of the contract entered into by me in behalf of the united states by virtue of their full power for a million of guilders this measure became absolutely necessary to prevent the total ruin of their credit and the greatest injustice to their former creditors who are possessed of their obligations for the failure in payment of the interest but for one day would in holland cause those obligations to depreciate in their value like paper money     it is of great importance that this contract should receive a prompt ratification in congress and be retransmitted to amsterdam as soon as possible whether this loan may not enable congress or their board of treasury to raise the credit of their own paper at home in some degree is for them to consider and whether the board of treasury may not purchase produce to advantage and contract to have it delivered free of all risk and charges at amsterdam and pay for it in bills of exchange i know not if they do this i should advise them to send one cargo to the house of willinks and another to the house of van staphorst instead of consigning the whole jointly to both houses this would not only excite an emulation between the two houses to make the most advantage for the interest of the united states but would prevent delays and other inconveniences which must arise from two houses meeting to consult and dispose of a vessel and cargo as the brokers or moneylenders were pleased to insist upon my signature to all the obligations i was obliged to make a tour to amsterdam for that purpose and happened to enter the city the day after the first riots which continued two nights while i was there the proceedings of the prince of orange have at last brought on a crisis and the english are holding out an appearance as if they thought it possible they might be obliged to take a part in it if no foreign power interferes the patriotic party is so much stronger than the other that i think the prince must give way in the principal points in controversy if any one foreign power interferes many others must follow the example this being well known and france and england weary of war for the present i hope the dutch will be left alone to settle their own disputes with great respect c john adams thomas pinckney  0 july      charleston john adams thomas pinckney to john adams charleston  0 july      sir— i embrace the earliest opportunity of acknowledging your excellencys favors of the   st of april by mr miller and of the   d of the same month by mr heyward which were yesterday handed to me the intelligence they contain of     attempts to counterfeit our paper currency in great britain will i hope by putting us on our guard enable us to repel the threatened mischief at the same time that i express the high sense with which i am impressed of your excellencys attention to the welfare of this state give me leave to entreat a continuance of that vigilance and exertion hitherto manifested in this business and as it may be essential to the success of our endeavors to oppose the evil in its first stage that some expense should be incurred in employing proper persons to detect and counteract the intended fraud in procuring intelligence and in rewarding those whose services may merit it i will readily answer your excellencys drafts for disbursements on this account to the amount of £ 00 sterling the recess of our legislature constrains me to be thus limited in a business wherein i think expense should not be spared we are looking forward with anxious expectation to the result of the deliberations of the federal convention now sitting at philadelphia your excellencys defence of the constitutions arrived in time to be of utility i have the honor to be c thomas pinckney p s if any counterfeit bills should come into your excellencys possession it will be of essential service to have them immediately transmitted thomas jefferson    july      paris john adams t jefferson to john adams paris    july      dear sir— i have been duly honored with yours of the  0th instant and am happy to hear of the success of your journey to amsterdam there can be no doubt of its ratification by congress would to heaven they would authorize you to take measures for transferring the debt of this country to holland before you leave europe most especially is it necessary to get rid of the debt to the officers their connections at court are such as to excite very unfavorable feelings there     against us and some very hard things have been said particularly in the assemblée des notables on the prospects relative to our debts the payment of the interest to the officers would have kept them quiet but there are two years now due to them i dare not draw for it without instructions because in the instances in which i have hitherto ventured to act uninstructed i have never been able to know whether they have been approved in the private sentiments of the members of congress much less by any vote i have pressed on them the expediency of transferring the french debt to holland in order to remove every thing which might excite irritations between us and this nation i wish it may be done before this ministry may receive ill impressions of us they are at present very well disposed i send you by mr appleton some pamphlets and have the honor to be c thomas jefferson samuel osgood arthur lee    july      john adams the treasury board to john adams board of treasury    july      sir— we are favored with your letter of the  th of may last transmitting protests for nonacceptance of the two bills of exchange for   000 florins drawn by constable rucker  co of new york by their partner mr john rucker of london from the solidity of the house by whom the bill was drawn being in partnership with mr robert morris of philadelphia we had not the most distant apprehension of any disappointment on this remittance you may therefore judge of our surprise and mortification when previous to the receipt of your letter we heard of mr ruckers arrival in this city it gives us pleasure to inform you that this gentleman is returned by direction of mr morris to take up the bills drawn on him and that we have the fullest assurance from the house that effectual measures will be adopted for paying the bills remitted to you when they become due we are glad you changed your first intentions of transmitting the original bills you will be pleased to have them presented for payment when at maturity your communications to congress on the subject of the loan you have effected in consequence of this and other circumstances     for one million of florins having been referred to this board we have agreed on a report approving of the same and recommending an immediate ratification as soon as the determination of congress is made known to us you shall be acquainted with the result we have the honor to be c samuel osgood arthur lee john jay    july      new york john adams john jay to john adams new york    july      my dear sir— it gives me pain to have occasion so often to repeat that the irregular attendance of the members of congress has for a long time past prevented their paying a seasonable attention to their foreign affairs for there have been very few and those very short intervals in which nine states were represented in congress this year hence and from some other affairs deemed more pressing it has happened that you have been so long kept in suspense on the subject of your public letter of the   th and your private one of the   th january last i have regretted that suspense the more as it might have created in your mind some doubts of my attention i wished to write to you that the business was done rather than that i would endeavor to get it done the probability of this which from time to time flattered and disappointed me led me on to omit one opportunity after another in expectation of being able to write satisfactorily by the next there are now nine states in congress and i am assured that the necessary acts and instructions shall be despatched in season to accompany this letter by the packet your experience in affairs your knowledge of characters and your intimate acquaintance with the concerns and interests of this country together with other circumstances and considerations induce me to wish that all questions between us and the court of london as well as other affairs in europe could be arranged and adjusted before you leave it the manner however in which you mention your intention to return is decisive and as the prospect of your doing much good here is fair and     promising perhaps it may upon the whole be best that you should be with us especially considering the actual situation of our affairs you have my good friend deserved well of your country and your services and character will be truly estimated at least by posterity for they will know more of you than the people of this day i have collected your public letters and despatches and a good clerk has already recorded a large volume of them it is common you know in the course of time for loose and detached papers to be lost or mislaid or misplaced it is to papers in this office that future historians must recur for accurate accounts of many interesting affairs respecting the late revolution it is best therefore that they should be recorded regularly in books and although it will take much time and labor which some may think unnecessary i shall nevertheless persevere in the work your book circulates and does good it conveys much information on a subject with which we cannot be too intimately acquainted especially at this period when the defects of our national government are under consideration and when the strongest arguments are necessary to remove prejudices and to correct errors which in many instances design unites with ignorance to create diffuse and confirm if after all that we have seen and done and experienced in public life we should yet live to see our country contentedly enjoying the sweets of peace liberty and safety under the protection of wise laws and a wellconstructed steady government we shall have reason to rejoice that we have devoted so many years to her service be assured of my constant esteem and believe me c john jay john adams    august      london thomas jefferson to t jefferson london    august      dear sir— on my return from an excursion to devonshire with my family where we have been to fly from the putrefaction of a great city in the summer heats i had the pleasure to find your favors of the   th and   d july     a million of guilders are borrowed on a new loan in holland and i went over lately to subscribe the obligations a punctilio which the brokers were pleased to think indispensable to gratify the fancies of the moneylenders but as i had no fresh authority from congress nor any particular new instructions i have been and am still under serious apprehensions of its meeting with obstacles in the way of its ratification if it is ratified congress may if they please pay the interest and principal too out of it to the french officers i presume that if m grand should refuse your usual drafts for your salary messrs willink and van staphorst will honor them to the amount of yours and mr shorts salaries without any other interposition than your letter but if they should make any difficulty and if it should be in my power to remove it you may well suppose i shall not be wanting to be explicit i will either advise or order the money to be paid upon your draft as may be necessary so that i pray you to make your mind perfectly easy on that score mr barclay i agree with you took the wisest course when he embarked for america though it will lay me under difficulties in settling my affairs finally with congress the french debt and all the domestic debt of the united states might be transferred to holland if it were judged necessary or profitable and the congress or convention would take two or three preparatory steps all the perplexities confusions and distresses in america arise not from defects in their constitution or confederation not from a want of honor or virtue so much as from downright ignorance of the nature of coin credit and circulation while an annual interest of twenty thirty and even fifty per cent can be made and a hope of augmenting capitals in a proportion of five hundred per cent is opened by speculations in the stocks commerce will not thrive such a state of things would annihilate the commerce and overturn the government too in any nation in europe i will endeavor to send you a copy with this letter of the second volume of the defence if frouillé the bookseller has a mind to translate it he may but it may not strike others as it does americans three editions of the first volume have been printed in america the second volume contains three long courses of experiments in political philosophy every trial     was intended and contrived to determine the question whether mr turgots system would do the result you may read it has cost me a good deal of trouble and expense to search into italian ruins and rubbish but enough of pure gold and marble has been found to reward the pains i shall be suspected of writing romances to expose mr turgots system but i assure you it is all genuine history the vast subject of confederations remains but i have neither head hands heart eyes books nor time to engage in it besides it ought not to be so hasty a performance as the two volumes already ventured before the public with perfect esteem your sincere friend john adams le chevalier de pinto   september      london john adams the chevalier de pinto to john adams translation london   september      sir— i have received orders from my court to inform you that notwithstanding no answer has hitherto been made to the project of a commercial treaty which we conferred about in london nevertheless sir the inclinations of her most faithful majesty are not less ardent nor less disposed to conclude this same treaty with the united states of america on suitable terms and conditions and i am moreover directed to add sir that my court will not delay to give you the most convincing and immediate proofs thereof i am desired at the same time to observe to you that it would be very useful and suitable to appoint ministers as soon as possible on the part of the two powers and my court expressly orders me to endeavor to arrange this important point with you sir and to agree definitively on the character these ministers are to bear in their missions it is essential to inform on this head that it will be necessary to fix at least on the title of resident minister on account of reception at the court of lisbon which is never granted either to simple agents or to consulsgeneral and as soon as this point shall be fixed i have orders to assure you sir that the court of lisbon will lose no     time to appoint and send to america the person that shall be chosen to reside with the congress of the united states i have the honor of being c le chevalier de pinto john adams  0 september      chevalier de pinto to the chevalier de pinto grosvenor square  0 september      sir— i have received the letter which you did me the honor to write me on the  th of this month and have observed with great satisfaction the assurances of her most faithful majestys desire to conclude with the united states of america a treaty of commerce upon convenient conditions i am very well convinced sir of the utility and convenience which would be found in the nomination of ministers between the two powers and if it depended upon me i flatter myself there would be no difficulty in concerting with your excellency both that important point and the character those ministers should bear in their missions but as i have neither instructions nor authority from my sovereign to justify me in entering into such negotiations i can only transmit to congress copies of your excellencys letter and of my answer this i shall have the honor to do the first opportunity the earnest desire of the citizens of the united states of america to show their respect for her most faithful majesty to live in perfect friendship with all her majestys dominions will undoubtedly induce congress to transmit as soon as possible their answer to her majestys friendly proposition i have the honor to be c john adams lafayette    september      paris john adams the marquis de lafayette to john adams paris    september      my dear friend— i am very sorry to find that you leave europe before i have the pleasure to take you by the hand let me at least enjoy the satisfaction to wish you and your family a most happy voyage and to anticipate your feelings on your touching the blessed shores of liberty and entering our   0 good town of boston be so kind as to remember me very affectionately to all friends i am sorry i have not yet the printed journals of the assembly of auvergne which would at once satisfy you on the objects of your inquiries but they shall be sent to boston by the next opportunity i once more give you joy on your prospect to see before long a country to the liberty and prosperity of which you have so much contributed and which in welcoming you will at once acknowledge place fortune and future obligations with most sincere affection and regard yours lafayette john adams    september      london john jay to secretary jay london    september      dear sir— there was yesterday in the river an impress of seamen and several american vessels had their men taken from them an application was made to me this morning by a master of a ship from new york and i instantly wrote the inclosed letter to lord carmarthen and went in person to whitehall to deliver it his lordship read the letter and the representation to me from the captain and after some conversation on the subject assured me that he would take measures to have the men restored and precautions against such mistakes in future this opportunity was a favorable one for some communication of sentiments upon the present posture of affairs and his lordship was invited to talk upon the subject by several questions which were proposed to him his lordships answers were civil enough he hoped there would not be war he should be very sorry for a war c c but nothing was to be learned from him if he knew any thing one fact indeed his lordship assured me of namely—that war is in truth declared by the porte against russia that the count de montmorin had sent him an extract of a despatch of monsieur de choiseul the french ambassador at constantinople containing an account of it and that the french ministry had done him the justice to believe that the english ambassador and ministry had done nothing to excite this declaration his lordships last despatches from constantinople     assured him of every appearance of peace so that the declaration must have been some sudden emotion of the mufti or janissaries c it is easy to believe that the english did not excite the turks to declare for that step excuses france from any obligation to aid the porte the present conjuncture appears the most critical and important in europe of any that has ever happened in our times mankind seem impatient under the yoke of servitude that has been imposed upon them and disposed to compel their governors to make the burden lighter but the wars that now threaten have no tendency that way or but a remote one and what dependence can be placed upon the common people in any part of europe upon my return home another american master of a vessel from alexandria in virginia came with his complaint that the pressgang had taken all his men i will demand every man as fast as i shall be informed of his being pressed but i am much afraid of pretences excuses c c i expect to hear that one sailor is irish another scotch and a third english all in my power however shall be done and you shall be informed of the result with great respect c john adams john adams    september      london john jay to john jay private london    september      dear sir— your private letter of the   th of july is very friendly and obliging as usual give yourself no concern about my apprehensions of your want of attention i know too well your constant and assiduous application to the duties of your public offices as well as to the just concerns of your private friends ever to suspect your failing in either i shudder when i think of your next volume of my despatches i shall appear before posterity in a very negligent dress and disordered air in truth i write too much to write well and have never time to correct any thing your plan however of recording all the despatches of the foreign ministers is indispensable future negotiations will often make it     necessary to look back to the past besides the importance of public history the true idea of the negotiation with holland particularly will never be formed without attending to three sorts of measures those taken with the stadtholder and his party those taken with the aristocratical people in the regencies and those taken with the popular party if any one of these had been omitted that unanimity could never have been effected without which the united states could not have been acknowledged nor their minister admitted by obtaining from congress a letter of credence to the prince of orange a measure that the patriots did not like his party were softened and by the inclosed letters to mr calkoen two very important burgomasters of amsterdam his intimate friends and many others of the aristocratics were kept steady i had not time to transmit copies of those letters to congress in the season of them but they ought to be put upon the files or records of congress i do myself the honor to transmit you a copy for yourself and another for congress whether it would be in my power to do most service in europe or at home or any at all in either situation i know not my determination to go home was founded in a fixed opinion that neither the honor of congress nor my own nor the interest of either could be promoted by the residence of a minister here without a british minister at congress and in that opinion i am still clear if my poor book does any good i am happy another volume will reach you before this letter in the calm retreat of penns hill i may have leisure to write another but if i should venture to throw together any thoughts or materials on the great subject of our confederation i shall not dare to do it in such haste as the second volume already printed has been done in the convention of philadelphia is composed of heroes sages and demigods to be sure who want no assistance from me in forming the best possible plan but they may have occasion for underlaborers to make it accepted by the people or at least to make them unanimous in it and contented with it one of these underworkmen in a cool retreat it shall be my ambition to become with invariable esteem and affection i am sir john adams     john adams    september      to the marquis of carmarthen grosvenor square    september      my lord— i do myself the honor to inclose to your lordship a letter this moment received from the master of a vessel belonging to the united states of america his name is john douglass commander of the ship four friends american built and the property of andrew van tuyl merchant of new york he informs me that as two of his people were going on shore for provisions for the day they were seized by the pressgang and forced on board his majestys brig dispatch then lying at execution dock that the gang then came on board his vessel and attempted to open his hatches when his chief mate opposed them and informed the officers that they were american citizens that although the officers of the pressgang then went away there is reason to believe that another disagreeable visit will be made before morning which will distress him exceedingly as his ship is completed for sea and bound for new york the names of the two men pressed are joseph cowley a native of the city of new york the other is a negro man called primus the property of mr andrew van tuyl merchant of new york but a native of the city it is my duty my lord to make this representation to his majestys ministers and to request that orders may be given for the restoration of these men to the master of their vessel and further propose to your lordships consideration whether it be not expedient that some general order should be given upon this occasion to the officers of his majestys navy to give a particular attention to american vessels and seamen lest perplexities and inconveniences of this kind should be multiplied with great respect c john adams john adams    september      london john jay to secretary jay london    september      dear sir— the accounts from holland and france are very discouraging so much so that it would be imprudent to     enter into a detail of evils that are inevitable the republic of holland is in the utmost danger of being extinct and if the old forms are hereafter preserved the prince will be so much master in reality that the friends of liberty must be very unhappy and live in continual disgrace and danger the english are arming with all the affectation of spirit and firmness and france neither moves nor negotiates with the least appearance of fortitude or understanding to do the former justice they have had the prudence to send both to versailles and the hague men of sense and business england will rise in consideration and power and france will fall in the eyes of all europe this will make the former overbearing and her people insolent and france will soon in my poor opinion at least be obliged to go to war or sink very low the united states of america instead of being more courted by the english as they would probably be in case of a war will rather be more neglected perhaps treated cavalierly it is easy to see however that the peace cannot continue long between the two european nations the philosophical visions of perpetual peace and the religious reveries of a near approach of the millennium in which all nations are to turn the weapons of war into implements of husbandry will in a few years be dissipated the armaments now making in england will disarrange mr pitts boasted plans of economy and in short there is every appearance that the peace of europe will be for years but an armed truce the surplus of revenue so ostentatiously displayed to the public is but an artful deception oh fortunate americans if you did but know your own felicity instead of trampling on the laws the rights the generous plans of power delivered down from your remote forefathers you should cherish and fortify those noble institutions with filial and religious reverence instead of envying the rights of others every american citizen has cause to rejoice in his own instead of violating the security of property it should be considered as sacred as the commandment thou shalt not steal instead of trampling on private honor and public justice every one who attempts it should be considered as an impious parricide who seeks to destroy his own liberty and that of his neighbors what would have become of american liberty if there had not been more faith honor and justice in the minds     of their common citizens than are found in the common people in europe do we see in the austrian netherlands in the united netherlands or even in the parliaments in france that confidence in one another and in the common people which enabled the people of the united states to go through a revolution where is the difference it is a want of honesty and if the common people in america lose their integrity they will soon set up tyrants of their own or court a foreign one laws alone and those political institutions which are the guardians of them and a sacred administration of justice can preserve honor virtue and integrity in the minds of men with great respect c john adams john adams   october      london to the marquis of carmarthen london   october      my lord— it is with concern that i do myself the honor to inclose to your lordship a letter which i received this morning from charles baldwin a citizen of the united states of america who represents that on the   d of last month he was involuntarily taken out of the ship favorite henry cooper commander belonging to new york by a pressgang and taken without any of his property but the clothes he had on and sent on board the dispatch tender where he remained till next day when he was sent on board the vestal frigate at long reach which two days afterwards sailed for sheerness when arrived there he was sent on board the conqueror guardship he remained there one day and was then sent on board the scipio of    guns which sailed the next day for spithead this letter is dated on board the triumph of    guns at spithead under the command of lord hood where probably this charles baldwin whose father and family are well known to the secretary of legation of the united states now is according to his representation there are six or seven others american citizens on board the same ship in similar circumstances it is my duty my lord to remonstrate against this practice     which has been too common of impressing american citizens and especially with the aggravating circumstances of going on board american vessels which ought to be protected by the flag of their sovereign it is my duty also to request your lordships interposition to obtain for this person and his companions their liberty with great respect i have the honor to be c john adams de lafayette marquis    october      paris john adams the marquis de lafayette to john adams paris    october      my dear friend— amidst the bustling of interior and foreign affairs i am glad to find an opportunity to remind you of me which may be free from the rogueries of english and french postoffices i have been some time in auvergne attending a preliminary assembly in that my province the journal of which i have once directed and am now again sending to you although it contains nothing interesting my stay in paris is but short and i am returning again to auvergne for five weeks letters that would arrive after the   d instant and before the   th of december could not probably be delivered into my hands a new regulation had been framed to fix the functions of the assemblies and those of the intendants it had also been directed that the printing of our journals be submitted to certain formalities complaints have been made about all that and we are going to obtain conditions much more favorable the affairs of this country considered in a constitutional light are mending fast the minds of the nation have made a great progress opposition is not of course free from party spirit many things are done or said which are not much to the purpose but while desultory expeditions are rambling about the main body moves slowly on the right road this country will within twelve or fifteen years come to a pretty good constitution the best perhaps that can be framed but one may that one the only one truly consistent with the dignity of man be forever the happy lot of the sons of america but i think a representation will be obtained in france much better than the one now existing in england     you know as much of the present politics and even more than i do i cannot bear the thought of the late transactions in holland this ministry have been most completely taken in deceived also they have been with respect to ottoman affairs i am afraid england will cheat them too under the appearance of negotiations we are however making ready for war and as the prime minister is a man of genius and of very brilliant as well as sound parts i think that if once launched he will act vigorously he can borrow money the only thing is to know on what conditions but it matters not with respect to the operations and the more they will afterwards want taxes the sooner we get a national assembly i have been thinking what our transatlantic country ought to do in case there is a war to take a part in it is very brilliant but in my humble opinion ought not to be the plan america may favor her allies as far as a friendly helping neutrality can go but not farther circumstanced as she is a war would lay her under great expense with little profit such a neutrality as i point out to myself will be beneficial to her but it appears to me that will be time to insist with england for a restoration of the forts should they make war with france it seems to me that they cannot for the sake of those forts risk to quarrel with the united states i hear that the convention have finished their business but do not know the result and am very anxiously waiting adieu my dear sir my best respects wait on mrs adams and the rest of the family madame de lafayette is still in the country most affectionately and respectfully yours lafayette john adams    october      london thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson london    october      dear sir— mr daniel parker will have the honor to deliver you this he is an intelligent american and as wellinformed as any you will see from hence i beg leave to introduce him to you let me thank you for your late letter and the important state papers inclosed in it     i have ordered to your address a dozen copies of my boudoir for the marquis who desired mr appleton and mr paine to have them sent i have called it a defence of the american constitutions because it is a resistance to an attack of m turgot the two volumes are confined to one point and if a city is defended from an attack made on the north gate it may be called a defence of the city although the other three gates—the east west and south—were so weak as to have been defenceless if they had been attacked if a warrior should arise to attack our constitutions where they are not defensible i will not undertake to defend them two thirds of our states have made constitutions in no respects better than those of the italian republics and as sure as there is a heaven and an earth if they are not altered they will produce disorders and confusion i can tell you nothing of politics all the world is astonished at the secrecy of mr pitt great preparations for war yet the world can find no enemy nor object carmarthen hopes the scud will blow over and even that the quarrel between the porte and russia will be made up while a fire is burning in any quarter of europe no one can tell when or where it may spread the general understanding is that the united states are to be let alone and they have given general orders to the navy to let american vessels and seamen alone they will have their hands full i believe and there is little plunder to be made of americans so that we may be quiet as long as they will let us but our countrymen will do well to think of the possibility of danger and of the means of defence a war would cost us more than we have of cash or credit but if we should be attacked we must defend money or no money credit or no credit whether john bull has command enough of his passions to see us punctually fulfil our treaties as we must do without being transported with rage you who know him can tell as well as i we know this gentlemans hasty temper so well that i think we may very safely wish for the continuance of peace between france and him even upon selfish principles though our commerce and navigation would be greatly promoted by a war if we can keep out of it i tremble and agonize for the suffering patriots in holland     you may judge to what lengths the spirit extends against them by a formal complaint of their high mightinesses against dumas and a requisition to me to employ him no longer but to appoint some other person in my absence it is not i am well persuaded as agent for the united states but as a friend of france or of the patriotic party against the stadtholder that he has incurred this censure and displeasure yet as mr dumas holds not his character or authority from me i can do nothing but transmit the papers to congress yours c john adams john adams    november      london john jay to secretary jay london    november      dear sir— the attack upon mr dumas is but a part of that system of intimidation that the present triumphant party in holland is pursuing and if one were to conjecture it would be plausible to suppose that sir james harris was the instigator of it the english court and nation with all their affected contempt and rude execrations of the dutch have at bottom a very great opinion of the importance of that power in the balance between england and the house of bourbon hints have been several times thrown out in the english papers of the partiality of the american minister at the hague to france and as mr dumas was supposed to be under my direction his motions have been imputed to me mr dumas has a pension from france reversible to his daughter it would be better for congress to pay this pension at the expense of the united states or to dismiss him from their service paying him however during his life his annual allowance than to have a person in their service in the pay of two powers at once if an english ambassador or chargé daffaires or agent at the hague should receive from france a pension for opposing the interests of the united states congress would have some cause to be uneasy i am not at all surprised therefore at the attack upon mr dumas yet i should be very sorry if it should prevail against him and therefore it is to be hoped that congress will   0 take time to deliberate upon the subject as there has been no formal deliberation of their high mightinesses upon my memorial and as the correspondence has been hitherto only between mr fagel and me—although their high mightinesses have been acquainted with it and have directed it on the part of mr fagel—yet congress are not obliged formally to answer it sovereign to sovereign and minister to minister is the diplomatic maxim congress therefore may take as long time as they please to deliberate and it is hoped they will take so much that the present passions may cool and the present scene be shifted after another year or six or nine months circumstances may be very different if we were to judge by the tone of arrogance at present in holland we should conclude that they would infallibly blow up a war between england and france and join the former but this to me at least is very doubtful notwithstanding the complaint against mr dumas and the recall of mr van berckel if that should be agreed to you will not find any hostile disposition towards the united states if france remains quiet as she ought at present for it is now too late for her to move all nations and parties will sit down satisfied with the restoration of the stadtholder for some years and there will be no formal rupture with france or america england has blustered and france has slept but the former has at heart no inclination for war fifty millions of debt added to the present would produce a tornado in this country the consequences of which cannot be computed england holland and prussia will be very glad to remain as they are and france shows no disposition to disturb them as i take all the late transactions to have been merely a system of intimidation you will not hear of those rigorous prosecutions and cruel punishments of the patriots in holland which are held out in terror neutrality eternal neutrality will still be the passion and politics in the united provinces both of stadtholderians and patriots there are no warlike characters among them and the present dominant party will be as anxious as their adversaries to avoid every provocation to a war either with france or england william v is neither the politician nor the warrior that william iii was an appearance of spirit and even of arrogance has been assumed in the netherlands     as well as in england merely to overawe and upon the secret presumption that they should not be forced into a war in earnest this policy has succeeded so well that i cannot help suspecting there were better grounds for it than the world in general were acquainted with i know that the patriots in holland some of them at least as long ago as when mr rayneval made his curious journey into that country suspected that their ideas of liberty were not to be supported and accordingly thought very seriously of emigrating to america i do not mean however by this the casuistical characters money is however so much better understood and more beloved than liberty that you will not hear of many emigrations the friends of france affect to speak slightly of holland at present and of her weight in the scale this is necessary to excuse their inattention and blunders on the late occasion but france never committed a greater error in policy than she has done by her unskilful negotiations at berlin the hague and london since the peace if holland should be forced into a renovation of her connections with england america in my opinion will have reason to regret it for i have not a doubt that england holland and prussia would get the better in a war against the house of bourbon and america will be obliged to join the latter in selfdefence for after having humbled france england would not scruple to attack the united states that our country may act with dignity in all events that she may not be obliged to join in any war without the clearest conviction of the justice of the cause and her own honor and real interest it is indispensably necessary that she should act the part in holland of perfect independence and honest impartiality between the different courts and nations who are now struggling for her friendship and who are all at present our friends this has ever appeared to me so clear and obvious that i never could approve the conduct of m dumas or messieurs van staphorst in taking so decided a part in favor of france and against the stadtholder although i fully believe they followed the judgments of their understandings and the inclinations of their hearts with integrity and honor with great respect c john adams     john adams  0 november      london john jay to secretary jay london  0 november      dear sir— i do myself the honor to inclose the kings speech at the opening of parliament as it has been transmitted to me from the marquis of carmarthen and the morning chronicle of the   th which contains not the debates for there were none but the panegyrics upon it i have long seen sir in silent astonishment and grief the negligent and imprudent conduct of a deceased french minister of foreign affairs in his negotiations and intercourse in holland the despicable history of a maillebois the unmeaning or illmeaning intrigues of rayneval the rhingrave not to mention others equally disgusting at paris with a minister whom you know when i first knew or suspected that the dutch patriots and their confidential agents had surrendered themselves to female intrigues i had a thousand apprehensions that they would finally meet with that ruin which you perfectly well know would have been the devoted fate of the united states if they had submitted to mr deanes system of de maillebois and du coudrays ten years ago let me entreat gentlemen to compare what remains upon the records or files of congress at that period with what happened before and at the peace with what has taken place in holland and thank heaven for their providential escapes there are many worthy characters now exiles from holland and refugees in germany the austrian netherlands and france for whom i have many years entertained an esteem and affection whose melancholy situation is truly deplorable these however have ever appeared to me to be too inattentive to the sense of the common people in their own country too little acquainted with the nature of government and too confidently dependent on the support of france the orations in parliament upon the speech inclosed are however more extraordinary than any thing that has occurred the interposition of prussia in the affairs of holland cannot be justified upon the principles of the law of nations and if truth and justice are not lost out of the world will be marked by the impartial both in the present and in future ages with     severe censure but the speeches of mr fox and mr pitt appear to me to have set every tie that can bind mankind every principle which ought to be held sacred at open defiance it is openly avowed by both that a treaty of alliance is in agitation between england and holland at this moment when a treaty recently made between france and holland is in full force and when there is no pretence of a violation of it is not this a most outrageous insult in the face of the whole world—for the debates in parliament are known to be published all over europe—upon the law of nations upon the faith of treaties and national honor is it the intention of the speech and of the address which will echo it back to the throne to force the house of bourbon into a war to me it seems manifest if france should bear it patiently what are we to think the fermentation in that kingdom occasioned by the ruin brought upon it by that administration of whose merits you have long since formed an accurate judgment and by the exertions to obtain provincial and national assemblies threatens much confusion it is not possible to foresee what the effect will be i own myself afraid that the patriots in france will prove as unskilful and unsuccessful asserters of a free government as those in holland have been a tedious relaxation if not the most serious divisions is to be apprehended if however the house of bourbon is unable to assert her dignity upon this occasion i am clearly convinced that the pride and arrogance of england will rise so high as to demand the demolition of cherbourg and attempt to sever south america from spain nor will this be all she will demand the annihilation of several articles at least of the treaties between france and the united states of america nor will they stop here if they can bind holland in their shackles and france by her internal distractions is unable to interfere she will make war immediately against us they are at present both at court and in the nation at large much more respectful to me and much more tender of the united states than they ever have been before but depend upon it this will not last they will aim at recovering back the western lands at taking away our fisheries and at the total ruin of our navigation at least the united states of america therefore had never more     reason to be upon their guard to complete their constitution of government to unite as one man to meet with courage and constancy the severe trial which in all probability they will be called to undergo in a few years there is some room however to hope that mr pitt and mr fox are outrunning the dutchmen in their disposition for an alliance the friendship of france appears to me to be so necessary to the king of prussia that i cannot yet believe that he will advise the stadtholder to follow the english party so implicitly the state of europe at large is so confused that there is not one politician in the world that i can hear of who pretends to foresee what turn affairs may take with great respect c john adams john adams   december      london thomas jefferson to t jefferson london   december      dear sir— the project of a new constitution has objections against it to which i find it difficult to reconcile myself but i am so unfortunate as to differ somewhat from you in the articles according to your last kind letter  you are afraid of the one i of the few we agree perfectly that the many should have a full fair and perfect representation you are apprehensive of monarchy i of aristocracy i would therefore have given more power to the president and less to the senate the nomination and appointment to all offices i would have given to the president assisted only by a privy council of his own creation but not a vote or voice would i have given to the senate or any senator unless he were of the privy council faction and distraction are the sure and certain consequence of giving to a senate a vote in the distribution of offices you are apprehensive that the president when once chosen will be chosen again and again as long as he lives so much the better as it appears to me you are apprehensive of foreign interference intrigue and influence so am i but as often as elections happen the danger of foreign influence renews the less frequently they happen the less danger and if the same man may be chosen again it is     possible he will be and the danger of foreign influence will be less foreigners seeing little prospect will have less courage for enterprise elections my dear sir to offices which are a great object of ambition i look at with terror experiments of this kind have been so often tried and so universally found productive of horrors that there is great reason to dread them mr littlepage who will have the honor to deliver this will tell you all the news i am c c john adams john adams  0 december      london thomas jefferson to t jefferson london  0 december      dear sir— i last night received the ratification of my last loan and the inclosed resolutions of congress of   th july last for the redemption of prisoners at algiers it is probable you have received it before but as it is in your department to execute it and possible that you may not have received it i thought it safest to transmit it to you as i have now the honor to do herein inclosed mr van berckel son of the minister is arrived at falmouth by the packet but not yet in london by him i expect my dismission the american newspapers already arrived both from new york and boston announce it to have passed in congress the  th of october and now as we say at sea huzza for the new world and farewell to the old one all europe resounds with projects for reviving states and assemblies i think and france is taking the lead how such assemblies will mix with simple monarchies is the question the fermentation must terminate in improvements of various kinds superstition bigotry ignorance imposture tyranny and misery must be lessened somewhat but i fancy it will be found difficult to conduct and regulate these debates ex quovis ligno non fit mercurius the world will be entertained with noble sentiments and enchanting eloquence but will not essential ideas be sometimes forgotten in the anxious study of brilliant phrases will the duke of orleans make a sterling patriot and a determined son of liberty will he rank with posterity among the brutuses and catos corrections and reformations and improvements are much wanted in all the institutions in europe ecclesiastical and civil but how or     when they will be made is not easy to guess it would be folly i think to do no more than to try over again experiments that have been already a million times tried attempts to reconcile contradictions will not succeed and to think of reinstating republics as absurdly constituted as were the most which the world has seen would be to revive confusion and carnage which must again end in despotism i shall soon be out of the noise of all these speculations in europe leaving behind me however the most fervent good wishes for the safety and prosperity of all who have the cause of humanity equity equality and liberty at heart with the tenderest affection and friendship i am and ever shall be my dear sir yours john adams john adams    december      john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square    december      dear sir— two days ago i received the letter you did me the honor to write me on the   th of october with its inclosures the approbation of my conduct in europe expressed in the resolutions of congress of the  th of october does me honor and demands my acknowledgments the permission to return to america and the termination of my commission in holland having removed all difficulties it is my intention to embark with my family in the month of march it would give me great pleasure sir to accept of your polite and friendly invitation to new york but as the health of my family is very tender and their apprehensions of the sea very great it will be necessary for me to embark for boston mr smith and his family will embark for new york as congress have not transmitted him any orders relative to another minister or to a chargé daffaires at this court the presumption is that it is either the intention of congress to have no diplomatic character here or that other persons are destined to fill it in either case mr smiths road is as clear as mine to return home you have before this time received from colonel smith his own account of his journey arrival and reception in portugal     his reception was more flattering than could have been expected and was in every respect i presume fully satisfactory to him but the mission has been attended with consequences affecting his health which there is reason to fear he will have cause to remember for some time a bilious fever or tertian ague contracted in portugal or spain has left him in a delicate state of health which i fear he will not fully remove till he arrives in america the public mind cannot be occupied about a nobler object than the proposed plan of government it appears to be admirably calculated to cement all america in affection and interest as one great nation a result of accommodation and compromise cannot be supposed perfectly to coincide with every ones ideas of perfection but as all the great principles necessary to order liberty and safety are respected in it and provision is made for corrections and amendments as they may be found necessary i confess i hope to hear of its adoption by all the states two days ago a great consternation was spread in the stock exchange by a report of a quadruple alliance of the two empires with france and spain whether this is any more than an artificial circulation to turn the tide of popular terror and vapor like the revived conversations about an invasion of england i know not france undoubtedly has the power to form alliances if she will which will bring the existence of britain and prussia into question but the revival of states general and provincial and the contests which are likely to arise out of them will give the french government business enough for some time most perfectly do i agree with you that america has nothing to fear but a want of union and a want of government the united states now stand in an elevated situation and they must and will be respected and courted not only by france and england but by all other powers of europe while they keep themselves neutral it is suspected by some that the additional troops now recruiting for the army are intended to be sent to canada and nova scotia their ostensible destination is to the west india islands no answer is made to any of my memorials or letters to the     ministry nor do i expect that any thing will be done while i stay there are reports of an intention to send a minister to america and a mr liston i think the name is now at madrid is mentioned but nothing has been said to me upon that subject for some time with great esteem c john adams john adams    december      london thomas jefferson to t jefferson london    december      dear sir— last night i received your letter of the   th mr jarvis and commodore jones are arrived here from new york both charged with large despatches for you mr jarvis sent his packet on by colonel trumbull who departed from hence to paris last thursday commodore jones went off a day or two ago but both will arrive to you before this letter the papers they carry with a renovation of your commission to the court of versailles contain i presume orders and instructions about every thing in holland as my dismission from the service arrived at the same time not a word has been said to me nevertheless nil americani alienum and i have the honor to agree with you in your opinion of the propriety of keeping good our credit in holland i should advise therefore that the interest on m fizeauxs loan at least should be paid and the creditors requested to wait for their capital till further orders can be obtained from congress if they will not consent to that i would pay them principal and interest provided there is money enough in the hands of our bankers and neither you nor they have received contrary orders no authorities from me will be necessary your own letter to messrs willink and van staphorst will be sufficient but if they make any difficulty which i cannot conceive for want of any orders from me i will send them you have received authority to negotiate the redemption of our unfortunate countrymen in algiers to you therefore i send a petition which i received from them a few days ago yours c john adams     wilhem jan willink nic jacob van staphorst    december      amsterdam john adams messrs willink and others to john adams amsterdam    december      being without any of your excellencys esteemed favors unreplied to the purport of the present is to acquaint you that on the   d instant we received a letter from his excellency thomas jefferson minister from the united states at the court of versailles notifying to us that messrs h fizeaux  co of this city had applied to him for   000 florins to pay off so much borrowed by them for account of the united states reimbursable the first proximo punctuality in the discharge whereof mr jefferson conceiving to be highly interesting to the honor and credit of the united states he presses us in the most energetic style to furnish the money informing us he had wrote your excellency to join in enforcing his warm solicitations so that we expect to hear from your excellency on the subject by the british mail detained by contrary winds we sincerely regret the application has been so late that we are called to determine upon this matter without the necessary time to weigh its consequences with the requisite attention besides we are deprived of any communications from the board of treasury respecting it the official channel through which ought to issue the directions for payments of such a nature this remissness on the part of the commissioners even had we plenty of money of the united states places us in the ever disagreeable predicament of assuming unnecessary responsibility wherefore we request your excellency to second our reiterated strong representations to have greater punctuality shown us in future on similar occasions the funds we have in hand of the united states will suffice to face the interest that will be payable by them the  st february next and leave a small surplus to discharge your and mr jeffersons monthly drafts for a short time thus the payment of the   000 florins would be an actual advance of our own cash there being but little or no probability the bonds of the last loan for the united states will sell while there are so many loans open here for different countries whose governments are firmly established and punctuality has been long experienced our zeal and wish to serve the united states   0 will however prompt us to do all that can be expected on the occasion and we shall not fail giving you the earliest intelligence of our determination in the mean time we must entreat your excellency to desist for the present from accepting any further drafts for account of the united states and to confine your disposals of money to your personal wants as we might otherwise be exposed to greater advances than the circumstances of the times incline us to the disagreeableness this intimation is to us is greatly modified by our intimate persuasion that your excellencys truly patriotic principles will induce your acquiescence without reluctance to any measure dictated by a regard for the honor and interest of your country we are very respectfully wilhem and jan willink nic and jacob van staphorst john adams    january      london m fagel to m fagel london    january      sir— the frequent civilities i have received from you have emboldened me to inclose to you a memorial to their high mightinesses and another to his most serene highness which i beg the favor of you to deliver i hope there will not be judged to be any impropriety in this method of conveying these memorials and that you will have the goodness to excuse the trouble of it i should have been happy to have had another opportunity of paying my respects to you and of thanking you for all your politeness upon many and various occasions i have signed two memorials to the states general one in french the other in my own native language and the language of my country you may deliver either of them or both at your discretion i am not critically skilled in french and fear that the composition in that language will not be found elegant but it expresses the sentiments of my heart and therefore i hope it will be accepted wishing every blessing to you and yours i am john adams     john adams memorial to the prince of orange to his most serene highness william the fifth prince of orange and nassau hereditary stadtholder and governor of the united provinces of the netherlands the subscriber minister plenipotentiary from the united states of america has the honor to acquaint his most serene highness that the said united states in congress assembled have given him their permission to return to america after the   th day of february      and have resolved that his mission to the republic of the united netherlands should then determine it is to him a mortifying circumstance that it is not in his power to go in person to the hague in order to take leave of their high mightinesses and of your most serene highness but as he had the honor to be originally accredited by congress to your most serene highness it is his duty in taking leave of the republic and on his departure from europe to pay his respects to your most serene highness in writing he asks leave to express his thanks for all the civilities he has from time to time received at your most serene highnesss court and his sincere wishes for the universal felicity of the republic in general of your most serene highness of your royal consort and illustrious family done at

netherlands high and mighty lords— the subscriber minister plenipotentiary from the united states of america has the honor to communicate to your high mightinesses a resolution of the united states of america in congress assembled of the  th     day of october      by which he is permitted agreeably to his request to return to america at any time after the   th day of february      and by which his commission and credentials to your high mightinesses are on that day to terminate nothing would have been more agreeable to the inclinations of the subscriber than to have passed over to the hague in order to have paid his final respects and to have taken leave of your high mightinesses had not the shortness of the time the severity of the season and the tender state of his health been opposed to his wishes the magnanimity and wisdom with which your high mightinesses in      manifested your friendship to the united states of america contributed to accelerate the general peace of the world which has lasted so long and the candor and goodness of your high mightinesses and of the whole republic to the subscriber as well as to his country have made impressions on his mind which neither time place nor circumstance can ever efface in finishing his course in europe and in taking a respectful leave of your high mightinesses he begs leave to express his ardent wishes for the happiness and prosperity of your high mightinesses and your families and his sincere assurances that in whatever country he may be he shall never cease to pray for the liberty the independence and the universal happiness and prosperity of the whole republic of the united netherlands done at london this twentyfifth day of january ad      john adams h fagel    february      the hague john adams h fagel to john adams translation the hague    february      sir— i have this day been honored with your letter dated london   th january of the present year accompanied with a memorial to their high mightinesses and another to his highness with a request to deliver the same i have ever     experienced so many proofs of your friendship and good will that i should have accounted it an honor and pleasure immediately to have complied with your wishes although i rather wished that you had not taken leave and always entertained hopes to have seen you here once more permit me however to inform you that when i communicated your letter addressed to their high mightinesses to the president and other members they did not put any unfavorable construction upon the memorial of taking leave which in every respect was found obliging and satisfactory excepting that no letter of recall from congress to their high mightinesses accompanied the same which is customary for as a minister is credited by a letter of eredence such an one as was received by their high mightinesses on the   d april      dated the  st january      so in like manner a minister is recalled by a letter of recall upon which a letter of recredence is returned perhaps this may have been occasioned by an omission of the secretary of congress and this prevents my making use of your memorial which ought to be delivered with a letter of recall from congress and your excellency will i trust not be displeased that i find myself obliged to return to you the letter and memorial your excellencys affairs not permitting you to come and take a personal leave it will be satisfactory that a letter of recall from congress be transmitted with your memorial it will ever give me pleasure to learn of your welfare and those connected with you and to find opportunities of giving you proofs of the particular regard with which i have the honor to be c h fagel p s his highness being in the same predicament with their high mightinesses nothing can be done but to wait for a letter of recall from congress john adams    february      london thomas jefferson to thomas jefferson london    february      dear sir— i have received your letter of the  th and had before received the same information from amsterdam     i know not how to express to you the sense i have of the disingenuousness of this plot the difficulty of selling the obligations i believe to be mere pretence and indeed the whole appears to me to be a concerted fiction in consequence of some contrivance or suggestion of mr parker the great speculator in american paper who though i love him very well is too ingenious for me i feel myself obliged to write this in confidence to you and to put you on your guard against the ungovernable rage of speculation i feel no vanity in saying that this project never would have been suggested if it had not been known that i was recalled if i was to continue in europe and in office i would go to amsterdam and open a new loan with john hodshon before i would submit to it the undertakers are bound as i understand it to furnish the money on the new loan they agreed to this upon condition that i would go to amsterdam to sign the obligations the truth is that messrs willink and van staphorst have been purchasing immense quantities of american paper and they now want to have it acknowledged and paid in europe it appears to me totally impossible that you or i should ever agree to it or approve it and as far as i can comprehend it is equally impossible for the board of treasury or congress to consent to it you and i however cannot answer for them but i think we cannot countenance any hopes that they will ever comply with it the continental certificates and their interest are to be paid in america at the treasury of the united states if a precedent is set of paying them in europe i pretend not to sufficient foresight to predict the consequences they appear however to me to be horrid if the interest of one million of dollars is paid this year in europe you will find the interest of ten millions demanded next year i am very sorry to be obliged at this moment of my retirement to give opinions which may be misrepresented and imputed to motives that my soul despises but i cannot advise you by any means to countenance this project but it is my serious opinion that the judgment of congress or the board of treasury ought to be waited for at all hazards if the brokers undertakers and moneylenders will take such advantages of us it is high time to have done with them pay what is due as fast as we can but never contract another farthing of debt with them     if a little firmness is shown in adhering to the resolution of waiting the orders of congress it is my opinion care will be taken in amsterdam that our credit shall not suffer the interest of our commissioners of the brokers undertakers and moneylenders all conspire to induce them to prevent a failure but in my judgment a failure had better take place than this project i shall not write with the same frankness to willinks but i shall give them my opinion that the judgment of congress must be waited for my dear friend farewell i pity you in your situation dunned and teazed as you will be all your philosophy will be wanting to support you but be not discouraged i have been constantly vexed with such terrible complaints and frightened with such long faces these ten years depend upon it the amsterdamers love money too well to execute their threats they expect to get too much by american credit to destroy it i am john adams john adams    february      john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square    february      dear sir— i yesterday received mr remsens letter of the   th of december with the journals and gazettes inclosed at the last conference at whitehall which were last thursday lord carmarthen thought proper to express a wish that this country had some sort of treaty of commerce with the united states of america that it might be no longer necessary to take new measures from time to time which looked hard this observation his lordship made alluding to mr grenvilles motion in the house of commons for making the regulation of the intercourse between america and the west india islands perpetual his lordship then immediately said i presume mr adams that the states will all immediately adopt the new constitution i have read it with pleasure it is very well drawn up all this oracular utterance was to signify to me what has all along been insinuated that there is not as yet any national government but that as soon as there shall be one the british     court will vouchsafe to treat with it you will see by the morning chronicle of the   th of february inclosed that mr grenvilles speech is in the same strain so that we may conclude it to be the concerted language of the cabinet it is unnecessary for me to make any reflections upon it the argument that arises out of it in favor of the new constitution and a prompt acceptance of it is but one among many france and holland furnish as many reasons as england mr jefferson must soon follow my example and return to america if that constitution is not accepted by all the states and what will be the consequence of the clamors of all the officers in france who are creditors of all the notables who may be pleased to cast reflections and of all our creditors in holland for want of payment of interest and principal as they become due must be left to every american citizen seriously to consider in preparing for my departure i have been personally treated with the same uniform tenor of dry decency and cold civility which appears to have been the premeditated plan from the beginning and opposition as well as administration appear to have adopted the same spirit mr fox and mr burke lord camden and the duke of richmond lord hawkesbury and lord north and lord stormont have all behaved alike if this country can make such arrangements that the king of prussia may make a diversion of the french forces by land and the native indians or discontented subjects another of those of spain in south america you may easily believe that england will be eager for war let not our countrymen flatter themselves that they shall be able to maintain peace lord carmarthen indeed said to me that he did not see a possibility of a misunderstanding in europe and that he even hoped that peace would be made between russia and the porte his lordship is in profound ignorance of it i presume if there is really any probability of an alliance of france with the emperor or empress mr jefferson has informed you of his conjectures as well as his intelligence on that point the marquis de la luzerne is now ambassador at this court from france and has already met with humiliations not easily borne by ambassadors monsieur de calonne appears at the levee and drawing room and even at the table of the marquis     of carmarthen on the queens birth day with the french ambassador the chevalier de ternant was presented by the french ambassador to the king and queen and treated with the most marked disgust by both these things are hard to bear i have had some conversation with this minister with whom i made a voyage in      from lorient to boston in the sensible and could wish to have resided longer with him for he will certainly be attentive and able but my embarkation is fixed to the month of march and i hope to be in boston in may with great esteem and regard c john adams john jay    february      new york john adams secretary jay to john adams new york    february      dear sir— as this letter will go by the way of ireland and may be exposed to accidents in the course of its route i decline entering into particulars but as the long recess of congress who are now again convened makes it necessary that the inclosed letters of recall should be transmitted without delay i think it best to send one set by this conveyance and to forward duplicates by another vessel which will sail about the last of the month for bristol your letters by the packet are come to hand and shall be particularly noticed in my next which will go under cover to a friend with directions to him what to do with it in case you should have left england before its arrival massachusetts has adopted the proposed constitution by a majority of nineteen i am dear sir c john jay charles thomson october  th      inclosed by the united states in congress assembled october  th      on a report of the secretary of foreign affairs to whom were referred two letters from the honorable john adams of the   th and   th january last resolved that the honorable john adams the minister plenipotentiary of the united states at the court of london be permitted agreeably to his request to return to america at     any time after the   th day of february in the year of our lord      and that his commission of minister plenipotentiary to their high mightinesses do also then determine resolved that congress entertain a high sense of the services which mr adams has rendered to the united states in the execution of the various important trusts which they have from time to time committed to him and that the thanks of congress be presented to him for the patriotism perseverance integrity and diligence with which he hath ably and faithfully served his country charles thomson secretary john adams    february      john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square    february      dear sir— there is no maxim more clearly settled in all courts and in all negotiations between nations than that sovereign should always speak to sovereign and minister to minister i am not at all surprised therefore although i am much mortified at having my memorials to their high mightinesses and to his most serene highness returned to me with the letter inclosed from mr fagel i should have had a letter of recall signed by the president of congress by their order and addressed to their high mightinesses there is a similar irregularity in my recall from the british court for although my commission is limited to three years yet my letter of credence to his majesty has no limits at all if the omission of a letter from congress to the king upon this occasion should not be taken as an offence it will not be because it is not observed but from motives too humiliating to congress as well as their minister here to be explained there is no alternative now left for me home i must go and leave all europe to conjecture that i have given offence in holland and in england that i have misbehaved abroad though my conduct has been approved at home when the public shall hear that i have gone home without taking leave there will be no end of criticism conjectures and reflections all that now remains for me is humbly to request that congress     would be pleased to send me regular letters of recall after my arrival in america that i may then transmit my memorials to europe and take leave in form to a man who has taken the utmost pains to do his duty and to fulfil every obligation to the smallest punctilio nothing can be more disagreeable than such disappointments especially as in all my letters i have so expressly and repeatedly requested regular letters of recall with great respect c john adams thomas jefferson  0 february      paris john adams t jefferson to j adams paris  0 february      dear sir— i am in hopes daily of receiving a letter from you in answer to my last the delay of the letters which contained the proposition to the board of treasury takes away all probability of their answering in time and i foresee that i shall be closely pressed by circumstances on that point this letter will probably find you near your departure i am in hopes it will be only a change of service from helping us here to help us there we have so few in our councils acquainted with foreign affairs that your aid in that department as well as others will be invaluable the season of the year makes me fear a very disagreeable passage for mrs adams and yourself though we have sometimes fine weather in these months nobody will pray more sincerely than myself for your passage that it may be short safe and agreeable that you may have a happy meeting with all your friends be received by them with the gratitude you have merited at their hands and placed in such a station as may be honorable to you and useful to them adieu my dear sir and accept assurances of the unchangeable esteem and respect with which i am your friend and servant thomas jefferson   0 john adams    february      john jay to secretary jay grosvenor square    february      dear sir— yesterday i had my audience of leave of his majesty i shall not trouble you with any particulars of the previous steps to obtain this audience which you know are always troublesome enough nor with any detail of the conversation farther than the public is immediately interested in it the substance of my address to his majesty was no more than a renewal of assurances in behalf of the united states of their friendly dispositions and of their continued desire to cultivate a liberal intercourse of commerce and good offices with his majestys subjects and states thanks for the protection and civilities of his court and good wishes of prosperity to his majesty his royal family his subjects and dominions  the kings answer to me was in these words mr adams you may with great truth assure the united states that whenever they shall fulfil the treaty on their part i on my part will fulfil it in all its particulars as to yourself i am sure i wish you a safe and pleasant voyage and much comfort with your family and friends this was the answer in ceremony his majesty was then pleased to ask me many questions about myself and my family how long i had been absent from them c which were intended i suppose to be very gracious and flattering but are of no consequence to the public and therefore will be here omitted it now remains to take leave of the queen and the princess the cabinet ministers and corps diplomatique a species of slavery more of which i believe has fallen to my share than ever happened before to a son of liberty and i much fear that the omission of a letter of recall and the offence     taken at it in holland will oblige me to go over to the hague to repeat the same tedious ceremonies there at this season of the year so near the equinox to have the passage from harwich to helvoet to cross twice is a punishment for sins to me unknown i am extremely afflicted my dear sir at the news of your ill health but i hope you will be soon restored for the public at this moment has great need of your experience and abilities with much affection c john adams john adams    february      london to the earl of ailesbury london    february      sir— it was my earnest desire to have obtained an audience of leave of the queen that i might have had an opportunity of presenting to her majesty before my departure for america my most humble thanks for the civilities that myself and my family have received at her majestys court and my best wishes for every blessing and felicity to her majesty and to every branch of her majestys royal family but the indispensable necessity i am under of making a journey to holland before my embarkation for america so presses me in point of time that it is now become impossible to repeat my request of an audience i am extremely sorry for the disarrangement of her majestys health which has deprived me of the honor i solicited for three drawing rooms and must now beg the favor of your lordship to make my most respectful excuses wherever they may be necessary with great respect i remain c john adams a memorial to their high mightinesses the lords the states general of the united netherlands high and mighty lords—the subscriber minister plenipotentiary from the united states of america has the honor to communicate to your high mightinesses an act of the united     states of america in congress assembled by which he is recalled from his mission to your high mightinesses and permitted to revisit his native country the wisdom and magnanimity with which your high mightinesses manifested your friendship to the united states of america in the year one thousand seven hundred and eightytwo contributed to accelerate that general peace of the world which has lasted so long and the candor and goodness of your high mightinesses and of the whole republic to the subscriber as well as to his country have made impressions on his mind which neither time nor place can ever obliterate in terminating his residence in europe and in taking a respectful leave of your high mightinesses he begs leave to express his thanks for all

massachusetts council chamber boston   june      sir— agreeably to the directions of the two branches of the general court i have the honor to inform you that you have been this day elected a delegate from this commonwealth to serve in the congress of the united states for one year to commence on the first monday in november next i am with great esteem c john avery jr secretary  john adams   november      braintree theophilus parsons to theophilus parsons braintree   november      dear sir— from the conversation that passed between you and me when i had the pleasure to see you for a few     moments at this place i am apprehensive that you may think of me for a senator as i find that some other gentlemen have done and continue to do you know very well how ungracious and odious the nonacceptance of an appointment by election is and therefore let me beg of you not to expose me to the necessity of incurring the censure of the public and the obloquy of individuals by so unpopular a measure i have long revolved in an anxious mind the duties of the man and the citizen and without entering into details at present the result of all my reflections on the place of a senator in the new government is an unchangeable determination to refuse it with great respect and esteem i am dear sir c john adams e gerry   march      new york john adams elbridge gerry to john adams new york   march      my dear friend— i find on inquiry that you are elected vicepresident having three or four times the number of votes of any other candidate maryland threw away their votes on colonel harrison and south carolina on governor rutledge being with some other states which were not unanimous for you apprehensive that this was a necessary step to prevent your election to the chair in this point they were mistaken for the president as i am informed from pretty good authority has a unanimous vote  it is the universal wish of all that i     have conferred with and indeed their expectation that both general washington and yourself will accept and should either refuse it will have a very disagreeable effect the members present met today in the city hall there being about eleven senators and thirteen representatives and not constituting a quorum in either house they adjourned till tomorrow mrs gerry and the ladies join me in sincere regards to yourself your lady colonel and mrs smith and be assured i remain c e gerry john adams tuesday april         the vicepresidents speech extract from the journal of the senate of the united states tuesday april         the senate assembled present as yesterday the committee appointed on the  0th instant consisting of mr strong and mr izard to conduct the vicepresident to the senate chamber executed their commission and mr langdon the president pro tempore meeting the vicepresident upon the floor of the senate chamber addressed him as follows— sir—i have it in charge from the senate to introduce you to the chair of this house and also to congratulate you on your appointment to the office of vicepresident of the united states of america after which mr langdon conducted the vicepresident to the chair when the vicepresident addressed the senate as follows— gentlemen of the senate—invited to this respectable     situation by the suffrages of our fellow citizens according to the constitution i have thought it my duty cheerfully and readily to accept it unaccustomed to refuse any public service however dangerous to my reputation or disproportioned to my talents it would have been inconsistent to have adopted another maxim of conduct at this time when the prosperity of the country and the liberties of the people require perhaps as much as ever the attention of those who possess any share of the public confidence i should be destitute of sensibility if upon my arrival in this city and presentation to this legislature and especially to this senate i could see without emotion so many of those characters of whose virtuous exertions i have so often been a witness from whose countenances and examples i have ever derived encouragement and animation whose disinterested friendship has supported me in many intricate conjunctures of public affairs at home and abroad those celebrated defenders of the liberties of this country whom menaces could not intimidate corruption seduce nor flattery allure those intrepid asserters of the rights of mankind whose philosophy and policy have enlightened the world in twenty years more than it was ever before enlightened in many centuries by ancient schools or modern universities i must have been inattentive to the course of events if i were either ignorant of the fame or insensible to the merit of those other characters in the senate to whom it has been my misfortune to have been hitherto personally unknown it is with satisfaction that i congratulate the people of america on the formation of a national constitution and the fair prospect of a consistent administration of a government of laws on the acquisition of a house of representatives chosen by themselves of a senate thus composed by their own state legislatures and on the prospect of an executive authority in the hands of one whose portrait i shall not presume to draw were i blessed with powers to do justice to his character it would be impossible to increase the confidence or affection of his country or make the smallest addition to his glory this can only be effected by a discharge of the present exalted trust on the same principles with the same abilities and virtues which have uniformly appeared in all his former conduct public     or private may i nevertheless be indulged to inquire if we look over the catalogue of the first magistrates of nations whether they have been denominated presidents or consuls kings or princes where shall we find one whose commanding talents and virtues whose overruling good fortune have so completely united all hearts and voices in his favor who enjoyed the esteem and admiration of foreign nations and fellow citizens with equal unanimity qualities so uncommon are no common blessings to the country that possesses them by those great qualities and their benign effects has providence marked out the head of this nation with a hand so distinctly visible as to have been seen by all men and mistaken by none it is not for me to interrupt your deliberations by any general observations on the state of the nation or by recommending or proposing any particular measures it would be superflous to gentlemen of your great experience to urge the necessity of order it is only necessary to make an apology for myself not wholly without experience in public assemblies i have been more accustomed to take a share in their debates than to preside in their deliberations it shall be my constant endeavor to behave towards every member of this most honorable body with all that consideration delicacy and decorum which becomes the dignity of his station and character but if from inexperience or inadvertency any thing should ever escape me inconsistent with propriety i must entreat you by imputing it to its true cause and not to any want of respect to pardon and excuse it a trust of the greatest magnitude is committed to this legislature and the eyes of the world are upon you your country expects from the results of your deliberations in concurrence with the other branches of government consideration abroad and contentment at home prosperity order justice peace and liberty and may god almightys providence assist you to answer their just expectations     thomas jefferson  0 may      paris john adams thomas jefferson to john adams paris  0 may      dear sir— since mine of january   th yours of january  d and march  st have been handed to me the former by mr jones whom i am glad to know on your recommendation and to make him the channel of evidencing to you how much i esteem whatever comes from you the internal agitations of this country and the inactivity to which england is reduced by the state of imbecility in which the madness of the king has terminated will leave the southwestern parts of europe in peace for the present year denmark will probably continue to furnish only its stipulated succors to russia without engaging in the war as a principal perhaps a pacification may be effected between russia and sweden though at present there is little appearance of it so that we may expect that the war will go on this year between the two empires the turks and swedes without extending any further even the death of the emperor should it take place would hardly withdraw his dominions from the war this summer the revolution in this country has gone on hitherto with a quietness a steadiness and a progress unexampled but there is danger of a balk now the three orders which compose the states general seem likely to stumble at the threshold on the great preliminary question how shall they vote by orders or persons if they get well over this question there will be no difficulty afterwards there is so general a concurrence in the great points of constitutional reformation if they do not get over this question and this seems possible it cannot be foreseen what issue this matter will take as yet however no business being begun no votes taken we cannot pronounce with certainty the exact state of parties this is a summary view of european affairs though i have not official information of your election to the presidency of the senate yet i have such information as renders it certain accept i pray you my sincere congratulations no man on earth pays more cordial homage to your worth nor wishes more fervently your happiness though i detest the appearance even of flattery i cannot always suppress     the effusions of my heart present me affectionately to mrs adams col and mrs smith i hope to see you all this summer and to return this fall to my prison for all europe would be a prison to me were it ten times as big adieu my dear friend c thomas jefferson george washington    may      john adams president washington to john adams    may      the president of the united states wishes to avail himself of your sentiments on the following points   whether a line of conduct equally distant from an association with all kinds of company on the one hand and from a total seclusion from society on the other ought to be adopted by him and in that case how is it to be done   what will be the least exceptionable method of bringing any system which may be adopted on this subject before the public and into use   whether after a little time one day in every week will not be sufficient for receiving visits of compliment   whether it would tend to prompt impertinent applications and involve disagreeable consequences to have it known that the president will every morning at eight oclock be at leisure to give audience to persons who may have business with him   whether when it shall have been understood that the president is not to give general entertainments in the manner the presidents of congress have formerly done it will be practicable to draw such a line of discrimination in regard to persons as that six eight or ten official characters including in rotation the members of both houses of congress may be invited personally or otherwise to dine with him on the days fixed for receiving company without exciting clamors in the rest of the community   whether it would be satisfactory to the public for the president to make about four great entertainments in a year on such great occasions as the anniversary of the declaration of independence the alliance with france the peace with great   0 britain the organization of the general government and whether arrangements of these two last kinds could be in danger of diverting too much of the presidents time from business or of producing the evils which it was intended to avoid by his living more recluse than the presidents of congress have hitherto lived   whether there would be any impropriety in the presidents making informal visits that is to say in his calling upon his acquaintances or public characters for the purpose of sociability or civility and what as to the form of doing it might evince these visits to have been made in his private character so as that they may not be construed into visits from the president of the united states and in what light would his visits rarely at teaparties be considered   whether during the recess of congress it would not be advantageous to the interests of the union for the president to make the tour of the united states in order to become better acquainted with their principal characters and internal circumstances as well as to be more accessible to numbers of wellinformed persons who might give him useful information and advice on political subjects   if there is a probability that either of the arrangements may take place which will eventually cause additional expenses whether it would not be proper that these ideas should come into contemplation at the time when congress shall make a permanent provision for the support of the executive remarks on the one side no augmentation can be effected in the pecuniary establishment which shall be made in the first instance for the support of the executive on the other all moneys destined to that purpose beyond the actual expenditure will be left in the treasury of the united states or sacredly applied to the promotion of some national objects many things which appear of little importance in themselves and at the beginning may have great and durable consequences from their having been established at the commencement of a new general government it will be much easier to commence the administration upon a welladjusted system built on tenable grounds than to correct errors or alter     inconveniences after they shall have been confirmed by habit the president in all matters of business and etiquette can have no object but to demean himself in his public character in such a manner as to maintain the dignity of his office without subjecting himself to the imputation of superciliousness or unnecessary reserve under these impressions he asks for your candid and undisguised opinion john adams    may      new york the vicepresidents answer new york    may      the vicepresident has the honor to present his humble opinion on the points proposed for his consideration   that an association with all kinds of company and a total seclusion from society are extremes which in the actual circumstances of this country and under our form of government may be properly avoided   the system of the president will gradually develop itself in practice without any formal communication to the legislature or publication from the press paragraphs in the public prints may however appear from time to time without any formal authority that may lead and reconcile the public mind   considering the number of strangers from many countries and of citizens from various states who will resort to the seat of government it is doubted whether two days in a week will not be indispensable for visits of compliment a little experience however will elucidate this point   under the fourth head it is submitted to consideration whether all personal applications ought not to be made in the first instance to a minister of state yet an appeal should be open by petition to the president who if he judges the subject worthy of it may admit the party to a personal interview access to the supreme magistrate ought not to be rigorously denied in any case that is worthy of his consideration nevertheless in every case the name quality and when these are not sufficient to raise a presumption in their favor their business ought to be communicated to a chamberlain or gentleman in waiting who should judge whom to admit and whom to     exclude some limitation of time may be necessary too as for example from eight to nine or ten for without it the whole forenoon or the whole day may be taken up   there is no doubt that the president may invite what official characters members of congress strangers or citizens of distinction he pleases in small parties without exciting clamors but this should always be done without formality   the entertainments mentioned in this article would much more properly be made by a minister of state for foreign or domestic affairs or some other minister of state or the vicepresident whom upon such occasions the president in his private character might honor with his presence but in no case whatever can i conceive it proper for the president to make any formal public entertainment   there can be no impropriety in the presidents making or receiving informal visits among his friends or acquaintances at his pleasure undress and few attendants will sufficiently show that such visits are made as a man a citizen a friend or acquaintance but in no case whatever should a visit be made or returned in form by the president at least unless an emperor of germany or some other sovereign should travel to this country the presidents pleasure should absolutely decide concerning his attendance at teaparties in a private character and no gentleman or lady ought ever to complain if he never or rarely attends the presidents private life should be at his own discretion and the world should respectfully acquiesce as president he should have no intercourse with society but upon public business or at his levees this distinction it is with submission apprehended ought to govern the whole conduct   a tour might no doubt be made with great advantage to the public if the time can be spared but it will naturally be considered as foreign affairs arrive every day and the business of the executive and judicial departments will require constant attention whether the presidents residence will not necessarily be confined to one place observations the civil list ought to provide for the presidents household what number of chamberlains aidesdecamp secretaries     masters of ceremonies c will become necessary it is difficult to foresee but should not all such establishments be distinct from the allowance to the president for his services which is mentioned in the constitution in all events the provision for the president and his household ought to be large and ample the office by its legal authority defined in the constitution has no equal in the world excepting those only which are held by crowned heads nor is the royal authority in all cases to be compared to it the royal office in poland is a mere shadow in comparison with it the dogeship in venice and the stadtholdership in holland are not so much neither dignity nor authority can be supported in human minds collected into nations or any great numbers without a splendor and majesty in some degree proportioned to them the sending and receiving ambassadors is one of the most splendid and important prerogatives of sovereigns absolute or limited and this in our constitution is wholly in the president if the state and pomp essential to this great department are not in a good degree preserved it will be in vain for america to hope for consideration with foreign powers these observations are submitted after all with diffidence conscious that my long residence abroad may have impressed me with views of things incompatible with the present temper and feelings of our fellowcitizens and with a perfect disposition to acquiesce in whatever may be the result of the superior wisdom of the president  john adams   september      new york james lovell to james lovell new york   september      dear sir— i have not yet answered your letter of the   th of july you guess well i find that i shall have all the unpopular questions to determine and shall soon be pronounced hostis republicani generis what they will do with me i know     not but must trust to providence you insinuate that i am accused of deciding in favor of the power of the prime because i look up to that goal  that i look up to that goal sometimes is very probable because it is not far above me only one step and it is directly before my eyes so that i must be blind not to see it i am forced to look up to it and bound by duty to do so because there is only the breath of one mortal between me and it there was lately cause enough to look up to it as i did with horror when that breath was in some danger of expiring but deciding for the supreme was not certainly the way to render that goal more desirable or less terrible nor was it the way to obtain votes for continuing in it or an advancement to it the way to have insured votes would have been to have given up that power there is not however to be serious the smallest prospect that i shall ever reach that goal our beloved chief is very little older than his second has recovered his health and is a much stronger man than i am a new vicepresident must be chosen before a new president this reflection gives me no pain but on the contrary great pleasure for i know very well that i am not possessed of the confidence and affection of my fellowcitizens to the degree that he is i am not of cæsars mind the second place in rome is high enough for me although i have a spirit that will not give up its right or relinquish its place whatever the world or even my friends or even you who know me so well may think of me i am not an ambitious man submission to insult and disgrace is one thing but aspiring to higher situations is another i am quite contented in my present condition and should not be discontented to leave it having said too much of myself let me say something of you the place of collector would undoubtedly have been yours if the president could have found any other situation for your friend lincoln it was from no lukewarmness to you i am certain but the public cause demanded that lincoln     should be supported and this could not be done any other way if after some time any other permanent place should be found for him you i presume will come in collector he  sailed yesterday in good health for georgia and may heaven prosper him with all happiness honor and success it is a very honorable embassy and will produce great and happy effects to these states i am c john adams john adams    september      new york george walton to george walton new york    september      dear sir— the duplicate via charleston of your letter of the thirtieth of august never reached my hand till a day or two before the nomination took place to the office of judge of the district of georgia as i had the pleasure and advantage of a particular acquaintance with yourself and the misfortune to know nothing at all but by a very distant and general reputation of the gentleman nominated i should have been ill qualified to make an impartial decision between the candidates i feel upon all occasions i own a particular pleasure in the appointment to office of gentlemen who are now well affected to the national constitution who had some experience in life before the revolution and took an active part in the course and conduct of it union peace and liberty to north america are the objects to which i have devoted my life and i believe them to be as dear to you as to me i reckon among my friends all who are in the communion of such sentiments though they may differ in their opinion of the means of obtaining those ends i will not say that an energetic government is the only means but i will hazard an opinion that a wellordered a wellbalanced a judiciouslylimited government is indispensably necessary to the preservation of all or either of those blessings if the poor are to domineer over the rich or the rich over the poor we shall never enjoy the happiness of good government and without an intermediate power sufficiently elevated and independent to     control each of the contending parties in its excesses one or the other will forever tyrannize gentlemen who had some experience before the revolution and recollect the general fabric of the government under which they were born and educated and who are not too much carried away by temporary popular politics are generally of this opinion but whether prejudice will not prevail over reason passion over judgment and declamation over sober inquiry is yet to be determined i am c john adams thomas jefferson  0 april    0 new york john adams thomas jefferson to john adams new york  0 april    0 sir— encroachments being made on the eastern limits of the united states by settlers under the british government pretending that it is the western and not the eastern river of the bay passamaquoddy which was designated by the name of st croix in the treaty of peace with that nation i have to beg the favor of you to communicate any facts which your memory or papers may enable you to recollect and which may indicate the true river the commissioners on both sides had in their view to establish as the boundary between the two nations it will be of some consequence to be informed by what map they traced the boundary  i have the honor to be c thomas jefferson george washington    august    0 united states john adams president washington to john adams secret united states    august    0 provided the dispute between great britain and spain should come to the decision of arms from a variety of circumstances     individually unimportant and inconclusive but very much the reverse when compared and combined there is no doubt in my mind that new orleans and the spanish posts above it on the mississippi will be among the first attempts of the former and that the reduction of them will be undertaken by a combined operation from detroit the consequences of having so formidable and enterprising a people as the british on both our flanks and rear with their navy in front as they respect our western settlements which may be seduced thereby as they regard the security of the union and its commerce with the west indies are too obvious to need enumeration what then should be the answer of the executive of the united states to lord dorchester in case he should apply for permission to march troops through the territory of the said states from detroit to the mississippi what notice ought to be taken of the measure if it should be undertaken without leave which is the most probable proceeding of the two mr adams will oblige the president of the united states by giving his opinion in writing on the above statement george washington john adams    august    0 new york george washington to president washington new york    august    0 sir— that new orleans and the spanish posts on the mississippi will be among the first attempts of the english in case of a war with spain appears very probable and that a combined operation from detroit would be convenient to that end cannot be doubted the consequences on the western settlements on the commerce with the west indies and on the general security and tranquillity of the american confederation of having them in our rear and on both our flanks with their navy in front are very obvious the interest of the united states duly weighed and their duty conscientiously considered point out to them in the case of such a war a neutrality as long as it may be practicable     the people of these states would not willingly support a war and the present government has not strength to command nor enough of the general confidence of the nation to draw the men or money necessary until the grounds causes and necessity of it should become generally known and universally approved a pacific character in opposition to a warlike temper a spirit of conquest or a disposition to military enterprise is of great importance to us to preserve in europe and therefore we should not engage even in defensive war until the necessity of it should become apparent or at least until we have it in our power to make it manifest in europe as well as at home in order to preserve an honest neutrality or even the reputation of a disposition to it the united states must avoid as much as possible every real wrong and even every appearance of injury to either party to grant to lord dorchester in case he should request it permission to march troops through the territory of the united states from detroit to the mississippi would not only have an appearance offensive to the spaniards of partiality to the english but would be a real injury to spain the answer therefore to his lordship should be a refusal in terms clear and decided but guarded and dignified in a manner which no power has more at command than the president of the united states if a measure so daring offensive and hostile as the march of troops through our territory to attack a friend should be hazarded by the english without leave or especially after a refusal it is not so easy to answer the question what notice ought to be taken of it the situation of our country is not like that of most of the nations in europe they have generally large numbers of inhabitants in narrow territories we have small numbers scattered over vast regions the country through which the britons must pass from detroit to the mississippi is i suppose so thinly inhabited and at such a distance from all the populous settlements that it would be impossible for the president of the united states to collect militia or march troops sufficient to resist the enterprise after the step shall have been taken there are but two ways for us to proceed one is war and the other negotiation spain would probably remonstrate to the president of the united states but whether she should or not     the president of the united states should remonstrate to the king of great britain it would not be expected i suppose by our friends or enemies that the united states should declare war at once nations are not obliged to declare war for every injury or even hostility a tacit acquiescence under such an outrage would be misinterpreted on all hands by spain as inimical to her and by britain as the effect of weakness disunion and pusillanimity negotiation then is the only other alternative negotiation in the present state of things is attended with peculiar difficulties as the king of great britain twice proposed to the united states an exchange of ministers once through mr hartley and once through the duke of dorset and when the united states agreed to the proposition flew from it to send a minister again to st jamess till that court explicitly promises to send one to america is a humiliation to which the united states ought never to submit a remonstrance from sovereign to sovereign cannot be sent but by an ambassador of some order or other from minister of state to minister of state it might be transmitted in many other ways a remonstrance in the form of a letter from the american minister of state to the duke of leeds or whoever may be secretary of state for foreign affairs might be transmitted through an envoy minister plenipotentiary or ambassador of the president of the united states at paris madrid or the hague and through the british ambassador at either of those courts the utmost length that can be now gone with dignity would be to send a minister to the court of london with instructions to present his credentials demand an audience make his remonstrance but to make no establishment and demand his audience of leave and quit the kingdom in one two or three months if a minister of equal degree were not appointed and actually sent to the president of the united states from the king of great britain it is a misfortune that in these critical moments and circumstances the united states have not a minister of large views mature age information and judgment and strict integrity at the courts of france spain london and the hague early and authentic intelligence from those courts may be of more importance than the expense but as the representatives of the people as well as of the legislatures are of a different opinion  00 they have made a very scanty provision for but a part of such a system as it is god knows where the men are to be found who are qualified for such missions and would undertake them by an experience of ten years which made me too unhappy at the time to be ever forgotten i know that every artifice which can deceive every temptation which can operate on hope or fear ambition or avarice pride or vanity the love of society pleasure or amusement will be employed to divert and warp them from the true line of their duty and the impartial honor and interest of their country to the superior lights and information derived from office the more serene temper and profound judgment of the president of the united states these crude and hasty thoughts concerning the points proposed are humbly submitted with every sentiment of respect and sincere attachment by his most obedient and most humble servant john adams john adams    april      philadelphia a hamilton to a hamilton secretary of the treasury philadelphia    april      dear sir— i do myself the honor to transmit to you my accounts which remain unsettled for the last two years and eight months of my administrations abroad in the service of the united states i have left a blank for my salary in my own opinion it is but justice that it should be filled up with the sum of two thousand five hundred pounds sterling a year because this was the contract under which i accepted my commission for the peace in      and that for their high mightinesses in      which last continued in force until my return home the resolution of congress which stated the salary of a minister abroad at nine thousand dollars could not reasonably be intended to operate upon ministers and commissions which had been given and accepted upon different conditions such an interpretation of it would make it amount to a breach of public faith moreover i have been well informed by mr gerry who proposed the alteration that the reason of this resolution was a supposition that in that time of peace the expenses of living in  0  europe were reduced this motive was so far from being a just one as applied to me that i found the expenses of living in london about a quarter part dearer than i had ever known them in paris or the hague this therefore was rather a reason for raising my salary to three thousand pounds sterling a year which i actually spent than for reducing it to nine thousand dollars i have been informed by mr barclay that dr franklin charged and has been allowed two thousand five hundred pounds sterling a year till his return and as i am in the same predicament with him it is at least as just that it should be allowed to me indeed it is more so because i certainly was obliged to spend more than that sum and he undoubtedly spent less i have also requested an allowance for a private secretary as the business of my mission to holland as well as that to england lay upon me in addition to my share in all the negotiations with prussia and the other powers of europe as well as the barbary states it may readily be conceived that i had a great deal of business and still more writing to do as copies of all such correspondences must be preserved and therefore i hope the charge for a private secretary will not be thought unreasonable an allowance is asked also for one ministerial or diplomatic entertainment for each year this is done for three reasons   because it is the custom of the whole corps diplomatique   because it seems to be a reasonable custom and   because mr franklin has charged and been allowed for all extraordinary entertainments as i suppose as he told me he had charged them or should charge them an outfit i have asked for amounting to one years salary this will be but a very inadequate compensation to me for the extraordinary expenses i was put to by the variety of services and multiplicity of commissions which were heaped upon me my case is singular and distinguished from that of every other gentleman who has ever been sent abroad in the service of the united states in      congress sent me abroad with two commissions one to negotiate a peace and another to his britannic majesty to negotiate a treaty of commerce with that power under these commissions i went to paris and resided there which obliged me to take a house or apartments ready  0  furnished and establish a household equipage and set of servants there in    0 congress sent me a commission to borrow money in holland to the amount of ten millions of dollars this obliged me to live in holland in      congress sent me a commission to treat with that republic and a letter of credence to the statesgeneral this obliged me to hire a house and completely furnish it because there was no such thing to be hired in holland as furniture as might be done and was done by mr deane mr franklin mr jay and myself at paris my commission for the peace obliged me to make journeys to versailles my commission for borrowing money not only augmented my expenses but gave me more trouble and occasioned more labor and perplexity than all the other services the frequent removals from one country to another the continual change of servants and liveries the wear and tear of baggage and destruction of furniture beside the perpetual plunder i was subjected to in my absence from my house in one country while attending my duty in another have wasted and consumed my salary in such a manner that my family must be deprived of that reward for my time trouble risk and services which all of us were entitled to and which some may have been happy enough honestly to secure i say all of us were entitled to it because congress on the   th september      resolved that their ministers should live in such a style and manner as they might find suitable and necessary to support the dignity of their public character and that besides their actual expenses a handsome allowance be made to each of them as a compensation for their time trouble risk and services if the articles i have submitted are allowed me difficult as it will be to justify myself to my family i shall be content but if not i must crave an allowance of one half per cent as commissions on nine millions of guilders by me borrowed in holland for the united states when congress allows four per cent to the houses of willink and van staphorst and their undertakers upon all these loans which has already amounted to a handsome fortune to each house it would be extremely hard and unreasonable to oblige me who had more trouble with every one of these loans than those houses had—nay who had more trouble with the first of them than they have had  0  with the whole—not only to do this whole business for nothing but live at my own expense while i did it this must be my hard fate if nothing can be allowed me as commissions nor for extraordinary services considerable sums were spent by me at times for secret services and other sums to no small amount were advanced to americans in distress some of them in prison and others escaped but as i have no vouchers for these and i suppose congress would not be willing to set a precedent i make no charge for them although they were advanced out of my own money—part of my salary let me ask the favor of you sir to look over these accounts and then present them to the auditor that they may be settled in some way or other by the next session of congress with great esteem i have the honor to be sir your most obedient and most humble servant john adams henry knox  0 june      philadelphia john adams henry knox to john adams philadelphia  0 june      my dear sir— i embrace the occasion of inclosing some letters to thank you and mrs adams for the comfortable accommodation of your house at bush hill while the inhabitants of this city are panting for breath like a hunted hare we experience in the hall at bush hill a delightful and animated breeze the paragraphs in the connecticut and new york papers relative to your journey indicate envy and blackness of heart who the author of these articles is i know not and it is quite immaterial but eminence must be taxed perhaps the political heresies mentioned in the preface to the american edition of paines pamphlet as coming from a more respectable quarter  may occasion some uneasiness but the author has assured me that the note he wrote to the printer never was intended for publication but as a sort of apology for having detained the book which was a borrowed one longer than the impatience of the printer would admit but if the idea was aimed at your doctrines it ought not to  0  create a moments pain conscious as you are of the invariable pursuit of the public happiness regulated by the sober standard of reason it is not the desultory ebullition of this or that mans mind that can divert you from your object for while human nature shall continue its course according to its primary principles there will be a difference of judgment upon the same objects even among good men the president is expected to arrive here about the   d or   th instant but there is no information from him since the   th of may he has been perfectly received according to the abilities of the places through which he has passed the indian campaign must go forward we have marched and shall march by the latter end of this month two thousand eight hundred men this force will be adequate with the addition of the troops already on the frontiers i am c h knox thomas jefferson    july      philadelphia john adams t jefferson to john adams philadelphia    july      dear sir— i have a dozen times taken up my pen to write to you and as often laid it down again suspended between opposing considerations i determine however to write from a conviction that truth between candid minds can never do harm the first of paines pamphlets on the rights of man which came to hand here belonged to mr beckley he lent it to mr madison who lent it to me and while i was reading it mr beckley called on me for it and as i had not finished it he desired me as soon as i should have done so to send it to mr jonathan b smith whose brother meant to reprint it i finished reading it and as i had no acquaintance with mr jonathan b smith propriety required that i should explain to him why i a stranger to him sent him the pamphlet i accordingly wrote a note of compliment informing him that i did it at the desire of mr beckley and to take off a little of the dryness of the note i added that i was glad it was to be reprinted here and that something was to be publicly said against the political heresies which had sprung up among us c i thought so little of this  0  note that i did not even keep a copy of it nor ever heard a tittle more of it till the week following i was thunderstruck with seeing it come out at the head of the pamphlet i hoped however it would not attract notice but i found on my return from a journey of a month that a writer came forward under the signature of publicola attacking not only the author and principles of the pamphlet but myself as its sponsor by name soon after came hosts of other writers defending the pamphlet and attacking you by name as the writer of publicola thus were our names thrown on the public stage as public antagonists that you and i differ in our ideas of the best form of government is well known to us both but we have differed as friends should do respecting the purity of each others motives and confining our difference of opinion to private conversation and i can declare with truth in the presence of the almighty that nothing was further from my intention or expectation than to have had either my own or your name brought before the public on this occasion the friendship and confidence which has so long existed between us required this explanation from me and i know you too well to fear any misconstruction of the motives of it some people who would wish me to be or to be thought guilty of improprieties have suggested that i was agricola that i was brutus c c i never did in my life either by myself or by any other have a sentence of mine inserted in a newspaper without putting my name to it and i believe i never shall while the empress is refusing peace under a mediation unless oczakow and its territory be ceded to her she is offering peace on the perfect statu quo to the porte if they will conclude it without a mediation france has struck a severe blow at our navigation by a difference of duty on tobacco carried in our and their ships and by taking from foreign built ships the capability of naturalization she has placed our whale oil on rather a better footing than ever by consolidating the duties into a single one of six livres they amounted before to some sous over that sum i am told i know not how truly that england has prohibited our spermaceti oil altogether and will prohibit our wheat till the price there is   s the quarter which it almost never is we expect hourly to hear the true event of general scotts expedition reports give favorable hopes of it  0  be so good as to present my respectful compliments to mrs adams and to accept assurances of the sentiments of sincere esteem and respect with which i am dear sir your friend and servant thomas jefferson john adams    july      braintree thomas jefferson to t jefferson braintree    july      dear sir— yesterday at boston i received your friendly letter of july   th with great pleasure i give full credit to your relation of the manner in which your note was written and prefixed to the philadelphia edition of mr paines pamphlet on the rights of man but the misconduct of the person who committed this breach of your confidence by making it public whatever were his intentions has sown the seeds of more evils than he can ever atone for the pamphlet with your name to so striking a recommendation of it was not only industriously propagated in new york and boston but that the recommendation might be known to every one was reprinted with great care in the newspapers and was generally considered as a direct and open personal attack upon me by countenancing the false interpretation of my writings as favoring the introduction of hereditary monarchy and aristocracy into this country the question everywhere was what heresies are intended by the secretary of state the answer in the newspapers was the vicepresidents notions of a limited monarchy an hereditary government of king and lords with only elective commons emboldened by these murmurs soon after appeared the paragraphs of an unprincipled libeller in the new haven gazette carefully reprinted in the papers of new york boston and philadelphia holding up the vicepresident to the ridicule of the world for his meanness and to their detestation for wishing to subjugate the people to a few nobles these were soon followed by a formal speech of the lieutenantgovernor  of massachusetts very solemnly holding up the idea of hereditary powers and cautioning the public against them as if they were at that  0  moment in the most imminent danger of them these things were all accompanied with the most marked neglect both of the governor and lieutenantgovernor of this state towards me and all together served as a hue and cry to all my enemies and rivals to the old constitutional faction of pennsylvania in concert with the late insurgents of massachusetts both of whom consider my writings as the cause of their overthrow to hunt me down like a hare if they could for this state of things publicola who i suppose thought that mr paines pamphlet was made use of as an instrument to destroy a man for whom he had a regard whom he thought innocent and in the present moment of some importance to the public came forward you declare very explicitly that you never did by yourself or by any other have a sentence of yours inserted in a newspaper without your name to it and i with equal frankness declare that i never did either by myself or by any other have a sentence of mine inserted in any newspaper since i left philadelphia i neither wrote nor corrected publicola  the writer in the composition of his pieces followed his own judgment information and discretion without any assistance from me you observe that you and i differ in our ideas of the best form of government is well known to us both but my dear sir you will give me leave to say that i do not know this i know not what your idea is of the best form of government you and i have never had a serious conversation together that i can recollect concerning the nature of government the very transient hints that have ever passed between us have been jocular and superficial without ever coming to an explanation if you suppose that i have or ever had a design or desire of attempting to introduce a government of king lords and commons or in other words an hereditary executive or an hereditary senate either into the government of the united states or that of any individual state you are wholly mistaken there is not such a thought expressed or intimated in any public writing or private letter and i may safely challenge all mankind to produce such a passage and quote the chapter and verse if you have ever put such a construction on any thing of mine  0  i beg you would mention it to me and i will undertake to convince you that it has no such meaning upon this occasion i will venture to say that my unpolished writings although they have been read by a sufficient number of persons to have assisted in crushing the insurrection of the massachusetts in the formation of the new constitutions of pennsylvania georgia and south carolina and in procuring the assent of all the states to the new national constitution yet have not been read by great numbers of the few who have taken the pains to read them some have misunderstood them and others have wilfully misrepresented them and these misunderstandings and misrepresentations have been made the pretence for overwhelming me with floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous abuse unexampled in the history of this country it is thought by some that mr hancocks friends are preparing the way by my destruction for his election to the place of vicepresident and that of mr samuel adams to be governor of this commonwealth and then the stone house faction will be sure of all the loaves and fishes in the national government and the state government as they hope the opposers of the present constitution of pennsylvania the promoters of shayss rebellion and county resolves and many of the detesters of the present national government will undoubtedly assist them many people think too that no small share of a foreign influence in revenge for certain intractable conduct at the treaty of peace is and will be intermingled the janissaries of this goodly combination among whom are three or four who hesitate at no falsehood have written all the impudence and impertinence which have appeared in the boston papers upon this memorable occasion i must own to you that the daring traits of ambition and intrigue and those unbridled rivalries which have already appeared are the most melancholy and alarming symptoms that i have ever seen in this country and if they are to be encouraged to proceed in their course the sooner i am relieved from the competition the happier i shall be i thank you sir very sincerely for writing to me upon this occasion it was high time that you and i should come to an explanation with each other the friendship that has subsisted for fifteen years without the smallest interruption and until this  0  occasion without the slightest suspicion ever has been and still is very dear to my heart there is no office which i would not resign rather than give a just occasion to one friend to forsake me your motives for writing to me i have not a doubt were the most pure and the most friendly and i have no suspicion that you will not receive this explanation from me in the same friendly light  thomas jefferson  0 august      philadelphia john adams t jefferson to john adams philadelphia  0 august      my dear sir— i received some time ago your favor of july   th and was happy to find that you saw in its true point of view the way in which i had been drawn into the scene which must have been so disagreeable to you the importance which you still seem to allow to my note and the effect you suppose it to have had though unintentional in me induce me to show you that it really had no effect paines pamphlet with my note was published here about the second week in may not a word ever appeared in the public papers here on the subject for more than a month and i am certain not a word on the subject would ever have been said had not a writer under the name of publicola at length undertaken to attack mr paines principles which were the principles of the citizens of the united states instantly a host of writers attacked publicola in support of those principles he had thought proper to misconstrue a figurative expression in my note and these writers so far noticed me as to place the expression in its true light but this was only an incidental skirmish preliminary to the general engagement and they would not have thought me worth naming had not he thought proper to bring me on the scene  his antagonist   0 very criminally in my opinion presumed you to be publicola  and on that presumption hazarded a personal attack on you no person saw with more uneasiness than i did this unjustifiable assault and the more so when i saw it continued after the printer had declared you were not the author but you will perceive from all this my dear sir that my note contributed nothing to the production of these disagreeable pieces as long as paines pamphlet stood on its own feet and on my note it was unnoticed as soon as publicola attacked paine swarms appeared in his defence to publicola then and not in the least degree to my note this whole contest is to be ascribed and all its consequences you speak of the execrable paragraph in the connecticut paper this it is true appeared before publicola but it had no more relation to paines pamphlet and my note than to the alcoran i am satisfied the writer of it had never seen either for when i passed through connecticut about the middle of june not a copy had ever been seen by anybody either in hartford or new haven nor probably in that whole state and that paragraph was so notoriously the reverse of the disinterestedness of character which you are known to possess by everybody who knows your name that i never heard a person speak of the paragraph but with an indignation in your behalf which did you entire justice this paragraph then certainly did not flow from my note any more than the publications which publicola produced indeed it was impossible that my note should occasion your name to be brought into question for so far from naming you i had not even in view any writing which i might suppose to be yours  and the opinions i alluded to were principally those i had heard in common conversation from a sect aiming at the subversion of the present government to bring in their favorite form of a king lords and commons thus i hope my dear sir that you will see me to have been     as innocent in effect as i was in intention i was brought before the public without my own consent and from the first moment of seeing the effort of the real aggressor in this business to keep me before the public i determined that nothing should induce me to put pen to paper in the controversy the business is now over and i hope its effects are over and that our friendship will never be suffered to be committed whatever use others may think proper to make of our names the event of the kings flight from paris and his recapture will have struck you with its importance it appears i think that the nation is firm within and it only remains to see whether there will be any movement from without i confess i have not changed my confidence in the favorable issue of that revolution because it has always rested on my own ocular evidence of the unanimity of the nation and wisdom of the patriotic party in the national assembly the last advices render it probable that the emperor will recommence hostilities against the porte it remains to see whether england and prussia will take a part present me to mrs adams with all the affections i feel for her and be assured of those devoted to yourself by my dear sir your sincere friend and servant thomas jefferson john adams    january      philadelphia to a recluse man philadelphia    january      sir— i received by the last post a sheet subscribed a recluse man inclosed with another in print and have read both with feelings and reflections some of which i should not choose to commit to paper the printed one i had read with much pleasure in its season and felt myself obliged to the writer although i had no knowledge or suspicion of the author  i have sometimes thought of collecting together and printing in volumes all that has been written at me since my return from     europe to my native country if i had more regard for my own glory in the eyes of posterity than for that of my fellowcitizens i should esteem such a monument far preferable to mr ceracchis marble such a torrent could flow only from the foul source of secret enmity to the constitution of the united states united with another stream of ill will to the present constitution of pennsylvania both mingled with foreign politics and domestic envy jealousy and disappointment and all these parties and individuals have done me the choice honor to give to the world and to posterity in the bitterness and agony of their hearts the fullest proofs that they consider me as the first obstacle in their way it gives me pain however to perceive that all their endeavors were ever able to impose for a moment on a man of letters of so much candor sagacity and information as the recluse man the writers in opposition to me have founded their speculations on my defence of the constitutions these volumes will answer for themselves to any one who will inquire of them and will prove that no other books that ever were written except the bible were ever so much belied if you will do me the favor to accept a set of them and the greater favor to read them i will order them to be presented to you the history of my passion for titles is briefly this in      and      there was much inquiry in conversation in boston and its neighborhood concerning the titles which were to be given to the representatives senators and president in the new government many were for majesty to the latter others for highness some for excellency and others for no title at all the title of most honorable was constantly given to the senators in one of the boston papers at least russells centinel and it seemed to be a general opinion that some title or other must be given to the president and senators when i took my seat in senate at new york a committee of both houses reported a plan of receiving the president when he should arrive one part of which was that the vicepresident should receive him at the door of the senate chamber and conduct him to the chair and afterwards address him to inform him that both houses were ready to attend him while he took the oath this report was accepted by the senate after having been accepted by the house upon this i arose in my place     and asked the advice of the senate in what form i should address him whether i should say mr washington mr president sir may it please your excellency or what else i observed that it had been common while he commanded the army to call him his excellency but i was free to own it would appear to me better to give him no title but sir or mr president than to put him on a level with a governor of bermuda or one of his own ambassadors or a governor of any one of our states after i had made my observations a senator arose and said it was an important point and this was the precise moment to settle it he therefore moved for a committee of both houses to consider and report upon it this is the substance of the charge against me for a possion for titles for my own part i freely own that i think decent and moderate titles as distinctions of offices are not only harmless but useful in society and that in this country where i know them to be prized by the people as well as their magistrates as highly as by any people or any magistrates in the world i should think some distinction between the magistrates of the national government and those of the state governments proper there is not however in the united states personally a citizen more indifferent upon the subject or more willing to conform to the public will or wish concerning it if the proofs that have been given me in the newspapers of a deep malice against a man who has spent a life of anxiety hazard and labor in the service of his country have given me pain it has been in some measure compensated by bringing me to the knowledge of the recluse man whose goodness of heart and elegance of composition i shall not soon or easily forget  john adams     alexander hamilton    june      philadelphia john adams alexander hamilton to john adams philadelphia    june      my dear sir— you will find inclosed your account which i take the liberty to send lest by not adverting to the state of it some inconvenience might ensue you are i presume aware that mr clinton is to be your competitor at the next election i trust he could not have succeeded in any event but the issue of his late election will not help his cause  alas alas if you have seen some of the last numbers of the national gazette  you will have perceived that the plot thickens and that something very like a serious design to subvert the government discloses itself with sincere respect and attachment i am dear sir alexander hamilton alexander hamilton   september      philadelphia john adams alexander hamilton to john adams philadelphia   september      my dear sir— i trust you are sufficiently convinced of my respect for and attachment to you to render an apology for the liberty i am going to take unnecessary i learn with pain that you may not probably be here till late in the session i fear that this will give some handle to your enemies to misrepresent and though i am persuaded you are very indifferent personally to the event of a certain election yet i hope you are not so as regards the cause of good government the difference in that view is in my conception immense between the success of mr     clinton or yourself and some sacrifices of feeling are to be made but this is not the only relation in which i deem your early presence here desirable permit me to say it best suits the firmness and elevation of your character to meet all events whether auspicious or otherwise on the ground where station and duty call you one would not give the illdisposed the triumph of supposing that an anticipation of want of success had kept you from your post you observe my dear sir i speak without much ménagement you will ascribe it to my confidence and esteem it is not necessary in any view to multiply words—i forbear it—but allow me to add that it is the universal wish of your friends you should be as soon as possible at philadelphia  i have the honor to be with great respect alexander hamilton george washington wednesday   january      john adams president washington to john adams wednesday   january      dear sir— i would thank you for giving the papers herewith sent a perusal and for the result of it i am now deliberating on the measure proper and necessary to be taken with respect to mr g—t and wish for aid in so doing the critical state of things making me more than usually anxious to decide right in the present case none but the heads of department are privy to these papers which i pray may be returned this evening or in the morning  with very sincere esteem and regard i am always your obedient and affectionate servant george washington     thomas jefferson   february      monticello john adams t jefferson to john adams monticello   february      dear sir— the time which has intervened between the receipt of your favor covering divernois letter and this answer needs apology but this will be found in the state of the case i had received from him a letter similar to that you inclosed as the adoption of his plan depended on our legislature and it was then in session i immediately inclosed it to a member with a request that he would sound well the opinions of the leading members and if he found them disposed to enter into divernois views to make the proposition but otherwise not to hazard it it is only three days since i have received from him information of his proceedings he found it could not prevail the unprepared state of our youths to receive instruction through a foreign language the expense of the institution and its disproportion to the moderate state of our population were insuperable objections i delayed myself the honor of acknowledging the receipt of your letter till i might be able to give you at the same time the result of the proposition it forwarded i have explained this to m divernois in the inclosed letter  which my distance from any seaport and the convenience of your position will i hope excuse my committing to your care i have found so much tranquillity of mind in a total abstraction from every thing political that it was with some difficulty i could resolve to meddle even in the splendid project of transplanting the academy of geneva en masse to virginia and i did it under the usual reserve of sans tirer en conséquence in truth i have so much occupation otherwise that i have not time for taking a part in any thing of a public kind and i therefore leave such with pleasure to those who are to live longer and enjoy their benefits tranquillity becomes daily more and more the object of my life and of this i certainly find more in my present pursuits than in those of any other part of my life i recall however with pleasure the memory of some of the acquaintances i have made in my progress through it and retain strong wishes for their happiness i pray you to     accept with kindness those which i sincerely entertain for you and to be assured of the high respect and esteem with which i am c thomas jefferson thomas jefferson    february      monticello john adams t jefferson to john adams monticello    february      i am to thank you my dear sir for forwarding m divernois book on the french revolution i receive every thing with respect which comes from him but it is on politics a subject i never loved and now hate i will not promise therefore to read it thoroughly i fear the oligarchical executive of the french will not do we have always seen a small council get into cabals and quarrels the more bitter and relentless the fewer they are we saw this in our committee of the states and that they were from their bad passions incapable of doing the business of their country i think that for the prompt clear and consistent action so necessary in an executive unity of person is necessary as with us i am aware of the objection to this that the office becoming more important may bring on serious discord in elections in our country i think it will be long first not within our day and we may safely trust to the wisdom of our successors the remedies of the evil to arise in theirs both experiments however are now fairly committed and the result will be seen never was a finer canvass presented to work on than our countrymen all of them engaged in agriculture or the pursuits of honest industry independent in their circumstances enlightened as to their rights and firm in their habits of order and obedience to the laws this i hope will be the age of experiments in government and that their basis will be founded on principles of honesty not of mere force we have seen no instance of this since the days of the roman republic nor do we read of any before that either force or corruption has been the principle of every modern government unless the dutch perhaps be excepted and i am not well enough informed to except them absolutely if ever the morals of a people could be made the basis of their own government it is our case and he who could propose to govern such a people by the corruption     of their legislature before he could have one night of quiet sleep must convince himself that the human soul as well as body is mortal i am glad to see that whatever grounds of apprehension may have appeared of a wish to govern us otherwise than on principles of reason and honesty we are getting the better of them i am sure from the honesty of your heart you join me in detestation of the corruption of the english government and that no man on earth is more incapable than yourself of seeing that copied among us willingly i have been among those who have feared the design to introduce it here and it has been a strong reason with me for wishing there was an ocean of fire between that island and us but away politics i owe a letter to the auditor on the subject of my accounts while a foreign minister and he informs me yours hang on the same difficulties with mine before the present government there was a usage either practised or understood which regulated our charges this government has directed the future by a law but this is not retrospective and i cannot conceive why the treasury cannot settle accounts under the old congress on the principles that body acted on i shall very shortly write to mr harrison on this subject and if we cannot have it settled otherwise i suppose we must apply to the legislature in this i will act in concert with you if you approve of it present my very affectionate respects to mrs adams and be assured that no one more cordially esteems your virtues than dear sir your sincere friend and servant thomas jefferson james sullivan  0 july      boston john adams james sullivan to john adams boston  0 july      sir— upon contemplating the subject of settling the eastern boundary of the united states and attending to the expression in the treaty of      that the commissioners shall decide what river was intended by the commissioners at paris in      as the st croix i am of opinion that it is necessary to establish the facts that mitchells map was as an authority before the commissioners and that the river thereon marked as the boundary     of the massachusetts was by them intended as the st croix for this purpose i think it will be necessary to obtain the evidence of these facts from the commissioners themselves i have therefore since i had the honor of an interview with you forwarded a letter to governor jay requesting him to give me in writing in form of an affidavit or otherwise as shall be most agreeable to him and most conducive to the national interest his recollection on this subject i have the honor to make the same request to you knowing that you are the best judge of the propriety as well as of the necessity of such a measure and that you will readily do whatever may be properly done in this exigency perhaps one fact is very important that it was not intended by the treaty of      to give any new boundary to the east side of massachusetts i am with great respect c james sullivan john adams   august      quincy james sullivan to james sullivan quincy   august      sir— i received last evening the letter you did me the honor to write me the  0th of july and am ready to give you all the information in my power mitchells map was the only one which the ministers plenipotentiary of the united states and the minister plenipotentiary of great britain made use of in their conferences and discussions relative to the boundaries of the united states in their negotiation of the peace of      and of the provisional articles of the  0th of november      upon that map and that only were those boundaries delineated and the river marked on that map with the name of st croix was the river agreed upon as the eastern boundary of the state of massachusetts and of the united states it was not intended by either party to give any new boundary to the east side of massachusetts but the real eastern boundary of the province of massachusetts bay according to the charter of william and mary was intended to be the eastern boundary of the united states to the foregoing facts i am ready to attest in any manner that may be judged necessary   0 and if mr jay should transmit you an affidavit i shall be very willing to do the same but i can scarcely think it necessary because i cannot believe that any of these facts will be denied or questioned the decease of mr oswald is unfortunate because i am well assured he would have avowed all these facts with the utmost frankness and candor mr whitefoord the secretary to his commission i am confident will readily admit them all mr william franklin the secretary to the american commission knows them dr franklin before his death transmitted to the then secretary of state mr jefferson as i was informed by him a full state of this affair according to his recollection a document which probably colonel pickering has transmitted to you if not it may be useful for you to obtain if from his office lord st helens formerly mr fitzherbert might or might not be informed by mr oswald at the time if he was i have confidence enough in his lordships honor and candor to believe that he will confirm all that i have said benjamin vaughan esq might or might not be informed if he was either by mr oswald or mr whitefoord or any of the american ministers his testimony cannot but corroborate the account i have given wishing you a pleasant voyage and safe return i am dear sir c john adams elbridge gerry   february      cambridge john adams elbridge gerry to john adams cambridge   february      my dear sir— the newspaper which you did me the honor to inclose containing mr pickerings letter to mr pinkney on the subject of mr adets letter to the former i have carefully perused but a further examination of it with the documents and mr adets letter is necessary to obtain a clear idea of the subject that part of it which discusses the claim of gratitude made by france i consider in a certain degree as expedient and dignified but am apprehensive that she will view the discussion in its full extent as having trespassed the line of defence and as tending rather to crimination than     accommodation  should this unfortunately be the case it will only serve to increase our difficulties but what struck me with surprise in this part of the performance at least in what of it relates to the negotiation for peace was a profound silence with respect to your conduct after it was known in europe and acknowledged throughout the united states to have been highly beneficial to your country and honorable to yourself this i presume must be considered by intelligent and candid men as manifesting an intention to place you in the back ground and to leave the public whose confidence and esteem you possess in an eminent degree at a loss for the reason of such an extraordinary measure perhaps i am mistaken in this matter but if not permit me to inquire retired as i am from the political world who are the actors and what is the object of this political drama soon after i began mr pickerings letter i had doubts whether it was written by himself it appearing to me in point of style and system dissimilar to his general performances it then occurred to me that one of the two quondam secretaries must have been the author when i had perused it farther and came to the part first alluded to i conceived that the southern secretary would not have carried his strictures so far against the french that the northern secretary on this occasion would have been less scrupulous and that the circumstantial account respecting mr jay must have been obtained of him and published by a person in his entire confidence neither of which circumstances will probably apply to the southern whilst they both may to the northern secretary my opinion was also strengthened by information respecting the letters of phocion for i have not seen them that whilst the author endeavored to invalidate the pretensions of mr jefferson he made no advances to the support of yours but meditated the plan to bring by surprise mr pinckney into the chair it will be a great gratification to me to ascertain whether my information and conjectures in this instance are in any degree well founded and be this as it may i must consider mr jay as a person of too much honor to have given the information     in the letter for so partial a purpose this matter as it relates to yourself appears to me of a delicate nature some of your friends may conceive that at present silent contempt will be more dignified than any measure that can be adopted whilst others may suppose that an advantage will be taken of silence to establish in the public mind doubts of your eminent services in the negotiation referred to and will propose a statement of facts to accompany in all the gazettes the publication of mr pickerings letter i confess for my own part i am not sufficiently instructed to form an opinion on the subject but am nevertheless earnest in my wishes to see such intrigues frustrated and the meritorious officers of the public triumphant over their ungenerous enemies i remain my dear sir with every sentiment of esteem and respect c e gerry john adams    february      philadelphia elbridge gerry to elbridge gerry philadelphia    february      my dear sir— i received by this days post your favor of the  d no   i had before received no   i shall confine myself in this to no   you are apprehensive that france will view the discussion of gratitude in its full extent as trespassing the line of defence but adet had laid his demands of gratitude so high and all his partisans were in the habit of deafening our people with such rude extravagant and arrogant pretensions to it that it seems to have become necessary to be explicit upon the subject i may say to a friend of your discretion what i believe you will agree in that there is quite as modest a demand of gratitude due from them to us as from us to them i think i can demonstrate that the french nation derived more advantage from the connection than we did—that she owes her independence as much to us as we do ours to her whether she has thrown away her advantages by her revolution or not is for her to consider we had nothing to do with that by treaty or in practice we have imprudently gone too far in our approbation of it and adopted by sympathy too much of her enthusiasm     in it for we were and still are incapable of judging whether it was wise or not useful or not destructive or not our treaty obliged us to no approbation of it or concern in it and our weak ideas and sensations of gratitude have led us into the fundamental error of taking too large a share of interest and sympathy in it the people of this country must not lose their conscious integrity their sense of honor nor their sentiment of their own power and force so far as to be upbraided in the most opprobrious and contumelious language and be wholly silent and passive under it and that in the face of all mankind the profound silence with respect to my conduct which surprises you was all right it was good judgment and sound policy to leave me wholly out of the question because the consequences of that letter of mr pickerings were to be expected altogether good or bad under my administration as it is no irritation against me can arise from this letter mr pickering took his document from records or files in his own office the despatches of mr jay and he comes not down so late as my arrival in paris i was detained at the hague by the negotiation of the treaty with holland it is true i had asserted all mr jays principles two years before in a correspondence with the count de vergennes upon the occasion of the interposition of the two imperial courts with an offer of mediation and proposal of a congress at vienna i had also written to mr jay in my private letters declaring that i never would treat until a commission arrived in paris expressly to treat with the ministers plenipotentiary of the united states of america and urged exhorted and animated mr jay to stand firm in the same resolution whether my letters to him first suggested to him this system or whether his reasoning and mine concurred exactly in the same point is immaterial to me i believe it probable we thought alike but the miserable gloriole of settling this point is no object with me comparable to the importance of keeping me wholly out of sight in my present situation this was not done without consulting me nor without my advice i hope the controversy will never be pushed so far as to necessitate the publication of my despatches upon that occasion pickering and all his colleagues are as much attached to me as i desire i have no jealousies from that quarter      you are mistaken in your conjectures about a northern and southern exsecretary neither had any thing to do in this business pickering himself was the engineer and wolcott mchenry and lee with washington superintending all corrected softened and amended indeed any one that i have mentioned is equal to the task phocion the exsecretary and their connections did not i believe meditate by surprise to bring in pinckney i believe they honestly meant to bring in me  but they were frightened into a belief that i should fail and they in their agony thought it better to bring in pinckney than jefferson and some i believe preferred bringing in pinckney president rather than jefferson should be vicepresident i believe there were no very dishonest intrigues in this business the zeal of some was not very ardent for me but i believe none opposed me they found the people more attached to me than they were or than they expected to find them in pennsylvania partly folly and partly wickedness effected a purpose not conformable to the real wishes of the state as i am assured and unless my selflove and vanity deceive me have good reason to believe i need not hint to you the necessity of keeping me out of sight who is to be governor i should be at no loss if i were at     quincy and could vote but perhaps could do nothing i love to see      and      men in honor i regret infinitely that so many of them are fickle variable weak if not too feebly principled with strong affection john adams john adams wednesday    february      the vicepresidents speech extract from the journal of the senate of the united states wednesday    february      after the consideration of the executive business a motion was made that the senate now adjourn when the vicepresident addressed them as follows gentlemen of the senate—if in the general apprehension of an intention to retire in that most eminent citizen to whom all eyes had been directed and all hearts attracted as the centre of our union for so long a period the public opinion had exhibited any clear indication of another in whom our fellowcitizens could have generally united as soon as i read that excellent address which announced the necessity of deliberation in the choice of a president i should have imitated the example of a character with whom i have coöperated though in less conspicuous and important stations and maintained an uninterrupted friendship for two and twenty years but as a number of characters appeared to stand in the general estimation so nearly on a level as to render it difficult to conjecture on which the majority would fall considering the relation in which i stood to the people of america i thought it most respectful to them and most conducive to the tranquillity of the public mind to resign myself with others a silent spectator of the general deliberation and a passive subject of public discussions deeply penetrated with gratitude to my countrymen in general for their long continued kindness to me and for that steady and affecting confidence with which those who have most intimately known me from early life have on so many great occasions intrusted to me the care of their dearest interests since a majority of their electors though a very small one have     declared in my favor and since in a republican government the majority though ever so small must of necessity decide i have determined at every hazard of a high but just responsibility though with much anxiety and diffidence once more to engage in their service their confidence which has been the chief consolation of my life is too precious and sacred a deposit ever to be considered lightly as it has been founded only on the qualities of the heart it never has been it never can be deceived betrayed or forfeited by me it is with reluctance and with all those emotions of gratitude and affection which a long experience of your goodness ought to inspire that i now retire from my seat in this house and take my leave of the members of the senate i ought not to declare for the last time your adjournment before i have presented to every senator present and to every citizen who has ever been a senator of the united states my thanks for the candor and favor invariably received from them all it is a recollection of which nothing can ever deprive me and it will be a source of comfort to me through the remainder of my life that as on the one hand in a government constituted like ours i have for eight years held the second situation under the constitution of the united states in perfect and uninterrupted harmony with the first without envy in one or jealousy in the other so on the other hand i have never had the smallest misunderstanding with any member of the senate in all the abstruse questions difficult conjunctures dangerous emergencies and animated debates upon the great interests of our country which have so often and so deeply impressed all our minds and interested the strongest feelings of the heart i have experienced a uniform politeness and respect from every quarter of the house when questions of no less importance than difficulty have produced a difference of sentiment and difference of opinion will always be found in free assemblies of men and probably the greatest diversities upon the greatest questions when the senators have been equally divided and my opinion has been demanded according to the constitution i have constantly found in that moiety of the senators from whose judgment i have been obliged to dissent a disposition to allow me the same freedom of deliberation and independence of judgment which they asserted for themselves     within these walls for a course of years i have been an admiring witness of a succession of information eloquence patriotism and independence which as they would have done honor to any senate in any age afford a consolatory hope if the legislatures of the states are equally careful in their future selections which there is no reason to distrust that no council more permanent than this as a branch of the legislature will be necessary to defend the rights liberties and properties of the people and to protect the constitution of the united states as well as the constitutions and rights of the individual states against errors of judgment irregularities of the passions or other encroachments of human infirmity or more reprehensible enterprise in the executive on one hand or the more immediate representatives of the people on the other these considerations will all conspire to animate me in my future course with a confident reliance that as far as my conduct shall be uniformly measured by the constitution of the united states and faithfully directed to the public good i shall be supported by the senate as well as by the house of representatives and the people at large and on no other conditions ought any support at all to be expected or desired with cordial wishes for your honor health and happiness and fervent prayers for a continuation of the virtues liberties prosperity and peace of our beloved country i avail myself of your leave of absence for the remainder of the session william bingham wednesday    february      the senates answer wednesday    february      sir— the senate of the united states would be unjust to their own feelings and deficient in the performance of a duty their relation to the government of their country imposes should they fail to express their regard for your person and their respect for your character in answer to the address you presented to them on your leaving a station which you have so long and so honorably filled as their president the motives you have been pleased to disclose which induced you not to withdraw from the public service at a time when     your experience talents and virtues were peculiarly desirable are as honorable to yourself as from our confidence in you sir we trust the result will be beneficial to our beloved country when you retired from your dignified seat in this house and took your leave of the members of the senate we felt all those emotions of gratitude and affection which our knowledge and experience of your abilities and undeviating impartiality ought to inspire and we should with painful reluctance endure the separation but for the consoling reflection that the same qualities which have rendered you useful as the president of this branch of the legislature will enable you to be still more so in the exalted station to which you have been called from you sir in whom your countrymen have for a long period placed a steady confidence which has never been betrayed or forfeited and to whom they have on so many occasions intrusted the care of their dearest interests which has never been abused from you who holding the second situation under the constitution of the united states have lived in uninterrupted harmony with him who has held the first from you we receive with much satisfaction the declaration which you are pleased to make of the opinion you entertain of the character of the present senators and of that of those citizens who have been heretofore senators this declaration were other motives wanting would afford them an incentive to a virtuous perseverance in that line of conduct which has been honored with your approbation in your future course we entertain no doubt that your official conduct will be measured by the constitution and directed to the public good you have therefore a right to entertain a confident reliance that you will be supported as well by the people at large as by their constituted authorities we cordially reciprocate the wishes which you express for our honor health and happiness we join with yours our fervent prayers for the continuation of the virtues and liberties of our fellowcitizens for the public prosperity and peace and for you we implore the best reward of virtuous deeds—the grateful approbation of your constituents and the smiles of heaven william bingham president of the senate pro tempore b      john adams thursday    february      the vicepresidents reply thursday    february      mr sedgwick reported from the committee that agreeably to order they had waited on the vicepresident of the united states with the answer to his address on retiring from the senate to which the vicepresident was pleased to make the following reply an address so respectful and affectionate as this from gentlemen of such experience and established character in public affairs high stations in the government of their country and great consideration in their several states as senators of the united states will do me great honor and afford me a firm support wherever it shall be known both at home and abroad their generous approbation of my conduct in general and liberal testimony to the undeviating impartiality of it in my peculiar relation to their body a character which in every scene and employment of life i should wish above all others to cultivate and merit have a tendency to soften asperities and conciliate animosities wherever such may unhappily exist an effect at all times to be desired and in the present situation of our country ardently to be promoted by all good citizens i pray the senate to accept of my sincere thanks john adams george washington monday  0 february      john adams president washington to john adams monday  0 february      dear sir— i thank you for giving me the perusal of the inclosed  the sentiments do honor to the head and heart of   0 the writer and if my wishes would be of any avail they should go to you in a strong hope that you will not withhold merited promotion from mr john adams because he is your son for without intending to compliment the father or the mother or to censure any others i give it as my decided opinion that mr adams is the most valuable public character we have abroad and that there remains no doubt in my mind that he will prove himself to be the ablest of all our diplomatic corps if he was now to be brought into that line or into any other public walk i could not upon the principle which has regulated my own conduct disapprove of the caution which is hinted at in the letter but he is already entered the public more and more as he is known are appreciating his talents and worth and his country would sustain a loss if these were to be checked by over delicacy on your part with sincere esteem and affectionate regard i am ever yours george washington thomas mifflin   march      philadelphia john adams thomas mifflin to john adams philadelphia   march      sir— in the year      the legislature of pennsylvania directed a house to be built for the accommodation of the president of the united states and empowered the governor to lease the premises as the building will be completed in the course of a few weeks permit me to tender it for your accommodation and to inform you that although i regret the necessity of making any stipulation on the subject i shall consider     the rent for which you might obtain any other suitable house in philadelphia and which you will be pleased to mention as a sufficient compensation for the use of the one now offered i take this opportunity sir to present my congratulations upon your election to the office of chief magistrate of the united states and to assure you that as far as my constitutional powers and duties extend you may rely upon a zealous and faithful coöperation to advance the honor and to insure the success of your administration i am sir with perfect respect and esteem c thomas mifflin john adams   march      philadelphia thomas mifflin to thomas mifflin philadelphia   march      sir— having been out this forenoon on public business it was not until my return after   oclock that i received the letter you did me the honor to write me on this day the respect to the united states intended by the legislature of pennsylvania in building a house for the president will no doubt be acknowledged by the union as it ought to be for your kind offer of it to me in consequence of their authority i pray you to accept of my respectful thanks and to present them to the legislature but as i entertain great doubts whether by a candid construction of the constitution of the united states i am at liberty to accept it without the intervention and authority of congress and as there is not time for any application to them i must pray you to apologize for me to the legislature for declining the offer for your obliging congratulations on my election to the office of president of the united states and for your kind assurances of coöperation as far as your constitutional powers and duties extend to advance the honor and insure the success of my administration i pray you to accept of my best thanks and fullest assurances of a reciprocal disposition on my part towards the governor and state of pennsylvania with great respect c john adams     p a adet    mars      philadelphie john adams p a adet to john adams philadelphie le    ventose an  ème de la république française    mars      vs monsieur le président— j aurois désiré pouvoir vous présenter mes hommages comme ministre de la république française jose espérer que vous me permettrez de vous les offrir comme particulier jaurois déjà sollicité cette faveur si ma santé ne men eut empêché je ne puis plus différer de vous la demander quoique je sois loin de me bien porter jai des choses extrêmement importantes à vous communiquer je vous prie en conséquence de vouloir bien maccorder un moment dentretien a lheure que vous aurez la bonté de mindiquer je mempresserai de me rendre auprès de vous pour vous assurer de vive voix des sentimens de respect et de vénération que vous mavez inspirés et dont je vous prie dagréer lexpression  p a adet henry knox    march      boston john adams henry knox to john adams private boston    march      my dear sir— i experience a reluctance in addressing you lest i should absorb a certain portion of your time which ought to be used for more important purposes i doubt whether i ought to congratulate you on being elevated to the chief magistracy of the united states for it is questionable very questionable whether there are not more thorns than roses in the situation but i religiously felicitate my country on having you at the helm of government and in doing this i feel the operation of a certain selfishness that our maker interwove in our construction i feel a confidence     in the safety of our political bark the elevation was justly your due and had any other person been chosen the majority of the electors in my poor opinion would either have been ignorant of your character or unworthy of the trust reposed in them your speech on the day of your inauguration appears to have given general satisfaction  the part relative to france is peculiarly pleasing as thereon hopes are entertained that you may devise some decisive and prompt expedient to prevent that rash people from pushing us to extremities a little further and every principle of attachment in this country will be uprooted forever and the public mind prepared to embrace the first opportunity of being avenged for the unprovoked outrages we are suffering whether this crisis can be avoided is with the little information i possess entirely uncertain but it appears highly proper that every experiment which would afford the least hope should be tried if after every effort nothing should be found to be effective the american people would meet with fortitude an event which could not by their chief magistrate be averted or controlled among the expedients which have presented themselves to my mind the one i am about to mention only seems to promise much and i confess i should entertain considerable hopes from it i submit it with respectful diffidence as a suggestion which may not before perhaps have been entertained by you let mr jefferson be sent to france as soon as possible as envoy extraordinary to make those explanations of our situation and disposition towards france and of their mistakes and errors towards us which can be done with perfect truth and which being told in the language of friendship by him would most probably be acceptable their pride would be gratified by the mission of the vicepresident of the united states this circumstance of rank and the high estimation he is held in as the friend of the french revolution would effect all the reconciliation that could possibly be effected by any measure whatever     if the mission should be unsuccessful his report upon his return would unite and brace the public mind to those exertions the case might require in either event the glory and wisdom of the measure would redound to the president of the united states who would be considered as having done all that was possible to serve the interests of his country the measure would be highly acceptable to the great majority of the federalists who wish peace with all the world the party in this country whose zeal for france has been greater than their love for the united states would be delighted with the event for excepting some renegado foreigners it cannot be supposed that many native americans would wish to plunge their country in a war it may be suggested that general pinckneys pride would be hurt by this step i should believe the contrary on so momentous a crisis in the affairs of his country it would be natural for him to be pleased with the countenance of so dignified a person as the vicepresident and one so much known and respected in france it may perhaps be further suggested that the dignity of the united states would be wounded by sending so important a character in the government on such a mission but this objection could not be a sound one when the magnitude of the measure should be considered and that the chief justice was employed in a similar case but the dignity of character is an important requisite in the mission i entertain so good an opinion of mr jeffersons patriotism as to believe he would not hesitate and much less refuse the offer the motive which has induced this suggestion is as pure as it is respectful to you i know not the reasons which might be urged against its adoption but there may exist just and insuperable objections with which i am unacquainted every political measure is susceptible of various views and it is the duty of good citizens to repose themselves with confidence under the protection of their government no person possesses this confidence in a greater degree than i do in the present instance and there is no one who wishes more sincerely that your administration may be prosperous to your country and glorious to yourself i am sir with perfect respect c henry knox     john adams  0 march      philadelphia henry knox to henry knox philadelphia  0 march      dear sir— i received with much pleasure your favor of the   th if i should meet with any roses in my path i shall thank you for your congratulations and when i set my foot on thorns as i certainly shall i shall thank you equally for your condolence but when you assure me that you feel a confidence in the safety of our political bark you give me much comfort and i pray you may not be disappointed it is a delicate thing for me to speak of the late election to myself personally my election might be a matter of indifference or rather of aversion had mr jay or some others been in question it might have less mortified my vanity and infinitely less alarmed my apprehensions for the public but to see such a character as jefferson and much more such an unknown being as pinckney brought over my head and trampling on the bellies of hundreds of other men infinitely his superiors in talents services and reputation filled me with apprehensions for the safety of us all it demonstrated to me that if the project succeeded our constitution could not have lasted four years we should have been set afloat and landed the lord knows where  that must be a sordid people indeed—a people destitute of a sense of honor equity and character that could submit to be governed and see hundreds of its most meritorious public men governed by a pinckney under an elective government hereditary government when it imposes young new inexperienced men upon the public has its compensations and equivalent but elective government has none i mean by this no disrespect to mr pinckney i believe him to be a worthy man i speak only by comparison with others i have it much at heart to settle all disputes with france and nothing shall be wanting on my part to accomplish it excepting a violation of our faith and a sacrifice of our honor but old as i am war is even to me less dreadful than iniquity or deserved disgrace nothing can be done of much moment     in the way even of negotiation without the senate and nothing else without congress your project has been long ago considered and determined on mr jefferson would not go his reasons are obvious he has a station assigned him by the nation which he has no right to quit nor have i any right perhaps to call him from it i may hereafter communicate to you what i have never communicated to any other what has passed upon the subject the circumstance of rank is too much we shall never be respected in europe while we confound ranks in this manner in their eyes the chief justice was too much to send to england i have plans in contemplation that i dare say will satisfy you when they come to be developed i regret the time that must be lost before the senate and representatives can assemble if we wish not to be degraded in the eyes of foreigners we must not degrade ourselves what would have been thought in europe if the king of france had sent monsieur his eldest brother as an envoy what of the king of england if he had sent the prince of wales mr jefferson is in essence in the same situation he is the first prince of the country and the heir apparent to the sovereign authority quoad hoc his consideration in france is nothing they consider nobody but themselves their apparent respect and real contempt for all men and all nations but frenchmen are proverbial among themselves they think it is in their power to give characters and destroy characters as they please and they have no other rule but to give reputation to their tools and to destroy the reputation of all who will not be their tools their efforts to populariser jefferson and to dépopulariser washington are all upon this principle to a frenchman the most important man in the world is himself and the most important nation is france he thinks that france ought to govern all nations and that he ought to govern france every man and nation that agrees to this he is willing to populariser every man or nation that disputes or doubts it he will dépopulariser if he can this is all in confidence from sir your most humble servant john adams     john adams    march      philadelphia john q adams to j q adams philadelphia    march      my dear son— mr murray of maryland your old friend with whom you formed your first acquaintance at the hague is to succeed you  that gentleman has been so long a member of congress and has given such proofs of talents amiable dispositions and patriotic sentiments as qualify him to do honor to the mission as well as to his predecessor it would have been enough to have said that he is well chosen to fill the place for i have the best authority besides my private opinion to say that no place has been better filled than that at the hague since your appointment to that mission you sometimes hint an inclination to return to america and nothing would give me greater pleasure on certain suppositions but my son independence is essential to selfesteem as well as to command the esteem of others and where is your independence if you would return to the bar you might be independent i grant but i would not advise you to return to america yet go to lisbon  and send me as good intelligence from all parts of europe as you have done my entrance into office is marked by a misunderstanding with france which i shall endeavor to reconcile provided that no violation of faith no stain upon honor is exacted but if infidelity dishonor or too much humiliation is demanded france shall do as she pleases and take her own course america is not scared the multiplicity of business in which i am involved is no otherwise irksome to me than as it may endanger my health but i have great confidence in my saddle i pray you to write me as often as you can i am your affectionate father john adams     john adams   april      philadelphia elbridge gerry to elbridge gerry philadelphia   april      dear sir— your favor of the   th ultimo gave me great pleasure the proposal of appointing the vicepresident to go as envoy extraordinary to paris has arrived from so many quarters that i presume the thought is a natural one i will tell you a secret but i wish you to keep it a secret in your own breast i was so impressed with the idea myself that on the  d of march i had a conversation with mr jefferson in which i proposed it to him and frankly declared to him that if he would accept it i would nominate him the next day as soon as i should be qualified to do it he as frankly refused as i expected he would  indeed i made a great stretch in proposing it to accommodate to the feelings views and prejudices of a party i would not do it again because upon more mature reflection i am decidedly convinced of the impropriety of it the reasons you give are unanswerable but there are others it would be a degradation of our government in the eyes of our own people as well as of all europe the vicepresident in our constitution is too high a personage to be sent on diplomatic errands even in the character of an ambassador we cannot work miracles we cannot make nations respect our nation or its government if we place before their eyes the persons answering to the first princes of the government in the low and subordinate character of a foreign minister it must be a pitiful country indeed in which the second man in the nation will accept of a place upon a footing with the corps diplomatique especially envoy such a one ambassador such a one or plenipotentiary such a one the nation must hold itself very cheap that can choose a man one day to hold its second office and the next     send him to europe to dance attendance at levees and drawing rooms among the common majorgenerals simple bishops earls and barons but especially among the common trash of ambassadors envoys and ministers plenipotentiary the nation has chosen jefferson and commanded him to a certain station the president therefore has no right to command him to another or to take him off from that a nation to be consistent must highly resent it it appeared to me in this light when the mission to england was talked of two or three persons proposed to me to go but i positively refused to have any thing said about it and gave the reasons above among many others  indeed i thought it wrong to send the chief   0 justice he was too high to go even as an ambassador but to send him as envoy was unpardonable it must mark us with contempt in all europe but we studiously degrade our government by every ingenious invention and then wonder that our nation and government are despised the satisfaction you express with my little harangue before taking the oath gives me great pleasure i had been so abused belied and misrepresented for seven years together without uttering one syllable in my own vindication and almost without one word in my favor from anybody else that i was determined to give the lie direct to whole volumes at once be the consequence what it would i am my dear sir with great respect john adams john adams    april      philadelphia to the heads of department philadelphia    april      the president of the united states requests the secretary of state  to take into his consideration the following questions  and make report of his opinion in writing viz   whether the refusal to receive mr pinckney and the rude orders to quit paris and the territory of the republic with such circumstances of indignity insult and hostility as we have been informed of are bars to all further measures of negotiation or in other words will a fresh mission to paris be too great a humiliation of the american people in their own sense and that of the world   if another mission be admissible can any part and what parts or articles of the treaty of amity and commerce with     great britain be offered to france or ultimately conceded to that power in case of necessity if demanded by her   what articles of the treaty of alliance and of the treaty of commerce with france should be proposed to be abolished   whether it will be prudent to say anything concerning the consular convention with that power and if it will what alterations in it should be proposed   whether any new articles such as are not contained in either of our treaties with france or england shall be proposed or can be agreed to if proposed by the french government   what documents shall be prepared to send to france as evidence of insult and injuries committed against the commerce of the united states by french ships of war or privateers or by french commissioners agents officers or citizens   in what terms shall remonstrances against spoliations of property capture of vessels imprisonment of masters and mariners cruelties insults and abuses of every kind to our citizens be made   in what terms shall restitution reparation compensation and satisfaction be demanded for such insults and injuries   shall demand be made of payment to our citizens for property purchased by the french government in europe or in the east and west indies  0 shall demand be made of the french government of payment for vessels and cargoes captured and seized whether by ships of war or private ships    shall any commission of inquiry and examination like that with england be agreed to    what articles in the british treaty can be offered to france without compensation and what with compensation and what compensation shall be demanded    shall a project of a new treaty abolishing the old treaties and consular convention be proposed to france    shall such a project with a project of instructions to the minister be proposed and laid before the senate for their advice and consent before they be sent to europe  john adams     thomas mifflin    may      philadelphia john adams thomas mifflin to john adams philadelphia    may      sir— by an act of the general assembly of this state it has become my duty to purchase and import ten thousand stand of arms for the use of the militia but i find that it will be impracticable at present to form an advantageous contract unless i can promise the interference of the american ministers in europe to obtain permission from the respective governments for exporting the arms either from great britain holland or hamburg and unless i can obtain from the united states a remission of the duties on importation as the object is of     national importance and utility i take the liberty of requesting that you will favor me with your sanction upon the first point and that you will be pleased to submit the second point to the consideration of congress i have the honor to be with great respect c thomas mifflin     john adams    may      philadelphia thomas mifflin to thomas mifflin philadelphia    may      sir— i have received the letter you did me the honor to write me on the   th of this month and have maturely considered the subject of it the substance of your excellencys first request is that i would instruct the american ministers in europe to use their influence to obtain permission from the respective governments for exporting from great britain holland or hamburg ten thousand stands of arms for the use of the militia of pennsylvania as this request appears to me to be reasonable and proper i shall readily and cheerfully comply with it whenever your excellency shall be pleased to indicate to me or to the secretary of state the names of the agents proposed to be employed your excellencys second request is that as the proposed importation is an object of national utility i would submit to the consideration of congress the expediency of a remission of the duties payable on such importation on this point permit me respectfully to observe that the recommendations of the president to congress have commonly related to measures of general policy and a deviation from this rule may be attended with inconvenience that an exemption on arms imported for a particular state would operate as a grant to that state and ought of course to be provided for by a special law of the policy of recommending a general repeal of the duties on arms imported into the united states doubts are entertained as a manufacture would thereby be discouraged which it is the public interest to support and encourage  i have the honor to be c john adams     john adams   june      philadelphia john q adams to j q adams philadelphia   june      my dear son— i know not whether i may not have incommoded you and disappointed your plans by the alteration i have made in your destination the mission to portugal appeared to me to be less important to the united states than a mission to prussia the north of europe at present is more interesting to us than the south the neutral powers of denmark sweden and prussia seem to be naturally more allied by sympathy at least with us neutrals than others and i thought your talents sagacity and industry might be more profitably exerted in collecting and transmitting intelligence of the views and designs of those courts and nations than they could be in lisbon where there will be little to do that i can foresee besides sleeping siestas the treaty with prussia is to be renewed and after you shall have completed that you will inform me whether you choose to remain at berlin or go to sweden or denmark i would not advise you to make any permanent establishment at berlin but keep yourself in a posture to remove to some other court when you shall have renewed the treaty i hope your new commission will reach you before you leave holland or england but if unfortunately you shall be at lisbon there is no remedy and you must submit to the trouble of removing again to prussia the part which the king of prussia means to take either during the war or at and after the peace and what his relations are to be in future towards france and england will be important for us to know the emperor of all the russias too and the emperor of germany are important luminaries for the political telescope to observe in short what is to be the future system of europe and how we best can preserve friendship with them all and be most useful to them all are speculations and inquiries worthy of your head and heart you have wisely taken all europe for your theatre and i hope will continue to do as you have done send us all the information you can collect i wish you to continue your practice of writing freely to me and cautiously to the office of state my love to your brother your affectionate father john adams     john adams  0 june      philadelphia elbridge gerry to elbridge gerry philadelphia  0 june      my dear friend— i have this moment written a message to the senate nominating you to be an envoy extraordinary to the french republic knowing as i did mr danas aversion to the sea and his continual dread of his mothers fate i was always apprehensive he would decline and should have nominated you at first if i had not been overruled by the opinions of many gentlemen that mr danas experience in this line and especially his title of chief justice would be great advantages in france as well as among our people in america  i know you must make a sacrifice but i sincerely hope you will not disappoint me i should be very happy to see you here before you embark mr marshall accepts and will be here in a week from this day the voyage i am confident will be for your health my compliments to mrs gerry tell her she must not object if she cannot accompany you she must sacrifice a little as mrs adams did before for six years i pray you to let me hear from you as soon and as often as possible i am your sincere friend john adams john adams  0 june      philadelphia uriah forrest to uriah forrest philadelphia  0 june      dear sir— i received yesterday your favor of the   rd and am very much obliged to you for it the paper inclosed in it is a serious thing it will be a motive in addition to many others for me to be upon my guard it is evidence of a mind soured yet seeking for popularity and eaten to a honeycomb with ambition yet weak confused uninformed and     ignorant i have been long convinced that this ambition is so inconsiderate as to be capable of going great lengths i shall carefully keep the secret as far as it may compromise characters and names  it would afford me great pleasure to make a visit to the city of washington mount vernon georgetown c but the summer will be a busy one and my own health as well as that of your friend mrs adams will oblige us to go northward if we stir from pennsylvania this year i receive very kindly your offer to communicate information to me from time to time i shall stand in need of it from all quarters and shall receive it from none with more pleasure i am sir with great esteem c john adams john adams   july      philadelphia elbridge gerry to elbridge gerry philadelphia   july      dear sir— i wrote you a line yesterday but was so busy i could not enlarge the secretary of state will send you your instructions and as ample a collection of documents as we can prepare mr marshall will sail next week but you may reach amsterdam from boston as early as he will though you cannot sail so soon there is the utmost necessity of harmony complaisance and condescension among the three envoys and unanimity is of great importance in such a negotiation the attention should be to the great objects and smaller matters must sometimes be yielded or neglected it is my sincere desire that an accommodation may take place but our national faith and the honor of our government cannot be sacrificed you have known enough of the unpleasant     effects of disunion among ministers to convince you of the necessity of avoiding it like a rock or quicksand there have been many instances of three ambassadors at a time the dutch at munster had eight in modern times they have not been common and in this case it ought to be considered by the french as it will be considered by the world as a great compliment and a signal mark of respect i wish you to get acquainted at amsterdam with our bankers there messrs willink and van staphorst and in france if you are received there to inquire into the conduct and character of our late and present consuls and their inferior agents and to find out what kind of speculations have been carried on there you will see that mr blount the senator has been speculating with the english but some suspect this to be only a feint and that the real design was upon france or spain or both swan hichborne edwards c in connection with others in this country have been speculating and i fear these speculators have done this country no good as to our being a divided people all nations are divided france is divided so are holland england italy and germany there will ever be parties and divisions in all nations but our people will support their government and so will the french theirs not to expect divisions in a free country would be an absurdity it is probable there will be manœuvres practised to excite jealousies among you both by americans english dutch and french this should not produce too much irritation but should press you closer together you will hear a great deal of affected contempt as well as a great deal of affected esteem and admiration of america neither should affect you much but i cannot enlarge i wish mrs gerry health and comfort and that you may acquire glory enough to compensate for all your cares n b i must give you a hint about economy i would be as plain and cheap as possible in dress equipage lodgings livery and every thing i would not give many feasts to americans decorum must be observed you will be surrounded with projectors and swindlers you will not be deceived by them i am c john adams     john adams    july      philadelphia elbridge gerry to elbridge gerry philadelphia    july      dear sir— i have this moment received your letter of the  0th that man must have more skill in intrigue than any that i have been acquainted with who can sap the foundation of the confidence i have in mr gerry  no such attempt has been made all have confessed to me your honor and integrity some have expressed doubts of your orthodoxy in the science of government others have expressed fears of an unaccommodating disposition and others of an obstinacy that will risk great things to secure small ones some have observed that there is at present a happy and perfect harmony among all our ministers abroad and have expressed apprehensions that your appointment might occasion an interruption of it but all those intimations made no impression upon me since your appointment all have acquiesced and there has never been a word lisped in conversation or in writing against it not one appointment i have yet made has given better satisfaction it is of great importance that harmony should be preserved among all our ministers abroad and i am determined that no randolph appointments shall be made by me i sincerely wish peace and friendship with the french but while they countenance none but enemies of our constitution and administration and vilify every friend of either selfdefence as well as fidelity to the public will compel me to have a care what appointments i make general marshall took leave of me last night and sails today in the grace captain willis for amsterdam he is a plain man very sensible cautious guarded and learned in the law of nations i think you will be pleased with him you will arrive in amsterdam as soon or sooner than he will the secretary of state will send you all the documents you may want i am dear sir with best wishes for your pleasant voyage successful negotiation and glorious return your friend john adams   0 john adams    august      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy    august      dear sir— i have received in course your favors of july   th august  st  d and   th that of july   th only inclosed a letter from mr gerry the mediterranean passports mentioned in your letter of august  st i signed as soon as possible and returned them to you in three packets by the post i saw mr howell at boston providence and quincy but as he said nothing to me on the subject of his salary i thought it unnecessary for me to mention it to him the commissioners have now adjourned for another year i have read the deposition of james wallis and the letter of judge sitgreaves  inclosed in yours of august  d the measures you have taken are the most prudent that could have been taken i believe and no proclamation appears to be necessary for the present a proclamation would excite and spread alarms and make more of the thing than there appears to be in it it is very strange that the officers of justice cannot make discoveries and obtain evidence if there are facts when witnesses talk about agitations and prevailing reports it may be ground for inquiry to an attorneygeneral but certainly armies cannot be levied without witnesses and witnesses may prove crimes and crimes may be punished unless our country is abandoned of god with great regard c john adams p s i thank you for sending the brigantine sophia to the relief of our suffering seamen      john adams    august      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy    august      dear sir— i have received your letter of august   st and the packet from colonel moultrie of south carolina the subject is so voluminous that i have not yet had time to read all the pamphlets the letter i have read  i must refer him to you and the attorneygeneral to consider whether my first opinion is right or not which is that application must be made to the legislature and that the executive power is not by the constitution or any act of congress adequate to the business i ought indeed first to have acknowledged the receipt of your favor of the   th i had considered as maturely as i could the characters and pretensions of all the candidates and had informed the attorneygeneral of the result and had requested him in case mr hall should decline to consider john read as appointed and employ him immediately i now request you to make out and present him his commission  mr hopkinson never applied to my knowledge till after mr halls refusal though he is personally unknown to me i have formed a good opinion of his talents disposition and principles and might have hesitated longer if his application had been in season but from your representation as well as other considerations i see no reason to alter my determination communicated to mr lee with his approbation mr read i think ought to be appointed john adams     john adams    october      east chester timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state east chester    october      dear sir— i arrived here at colonel smiths last night with my family and i shall make this house my home till we can go to philadelphia with safety even if we should be obliged to convene congress at any other place than philadelphia it will be better for mrs adams to remain here with her daughter than to go with me into lodgings i pray you to give me your opinion whether it will be expedient to convene congress at any other place than the usual one and if it is whether new york is not the only convenient place i have assisted in congress at trenton lancaster yorktown and baltimore and know by experience that even tolerable accommodations are scarcely to be obtained at the three first and the last is as much infected at present as philadelphia a proclamation too must be thought on and prepared if you address your letters to me at east chester and recommend them to the care of charles adams esq at new york i shall get them without much loss of time but if a mail could be made up for east chester they might come sooner i know not whether this can be done without appointing a postmaster at this place and i know of no one to recommend in a former letter i requested you to commit to paper minutes as usual of matters to be communicated and recommended to congress at the opening of the session and i now repeat the request i rejoice that i am now within a hundred miles of you that the communications between us may be more frequent and that in case of urgency we may soon meet here or at trenton or at some intermediate place there is a law or resolve requesting the president to write to the governors of the states for information whether they have adopted the amendment of the constitution relative to the suability of states i know not but you may have executed this resolution if not i beg you would write without loss of time lest a noise should be made at the opening of the next session and we should be charged with neglect of duty john adams     john adams    october      east chester timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state east chester    october      dear sir— your favor of the  th and the duplicate of it and that of the  th with their inclosures i received last night dr rush has so many motives to wish that congress may assemble in philadelphia that his testimony must be weighed with certain grains of allowance it is but a small consolation to the senators and representatives of the united states to say that the malignant contagion is but little spread in the city and is chiefly confined to southwark since the inhabitants of southwark as well as philadelphia will have power to fill the galleries of both houses and bring their infection with them such is the aversion of the eastern members to the idea of going to philadelphia on the second monday in november that i am confident there will not be a quorum of either house for many weeks after it the members will be scattered some at home and some at taverns on the road and some in philadelphia all in a very disagreeable awkward and uncertain situation will it not be better then by convening congress at new york to give them an opportunity of judging for themselves of the proper time and making the adjournment to philadelphia their own act the letter from mr william turnbull of carlisle soliciting the treasury of the mint and mr bassetts letter recommending dr james sykes to the same office i return to you that you may file together all the applications and recommendations for that appointment and deliver them to me when we meet to determine the question i thank you for writing to mr hodgdon  on the necessity of additional night watches i am afraid my house will stand a worse chance of escaping the speculations of the villains than any others but i know not what can be done to secure it more than has been done a sentinel at the door if such a watch could be hired would frighten the people of philadelphia more than the plague santhonaxs departure for france will be no relief to our     commerce nor will any negotiations going on or treaties we can make until our vessels arm in their own defence this is my opinion i wish i may be deceived but i believe all frenchmen are of opinion with my old friend the abbé de mably who once said to me il ny a point de morale pour un homme qui meurt de faim they will all i believe agree in this though you and i shall not and add at least in practice il ny a point de traité pour une nation qui meurt de faim i am afraid they will cure our people of their too fond attachments if they have any by very harsh remedies i shall divide my time between new york and east chester till the meeting of congress your letters to the care of my son will soon reach me and the more there are of them the better with great regard c john adams john adams  0 october      east chester oliver wolcott to o wolcott jr secretary of the treasury east chester  0 october      dear sir— i have received your favor of the   th  thank you for your care in writing to mr sands who has furnished me with two thousand dollars for which i gave him duplicate receipts to serve for one according to your desire though i rejoice to learn from your letter that the sickness in the city is diminishing i cannot admit your walk through the principal streets of it to be full proof because it is generally agreed that the principal streets are deserted by the inhabitants you remember the anxieties and alarms among the members of congress in      their continual regret that no power had existed to convene them elsewhere and their solicitude to pass an act to provide an authority in future there will be so much uneasiness among them if that authority is not exerted that there will probably be no congress formed before christmas and a few who will venture into the city will be there in idleness and out of their element     i thank you for the sentiments you have expressed relative to the system to be pursued can you send me a copy of the speech at the commencement of last session i have no copy of it here and perhaps shall find it difficult to procure one i should be glad however to know your opinion whether our envoys will be received or not whether they will succeed or not with hints at your reasons if any intelligence has furnished any the organization of the stamp tax suggests a vexation to me the bill was worth money and money was so much wanted for the public service that i would not put it at risk otherwise i would have negatived that bill not from personal feelings for i care not a farthing for all the personal power in the world but the office of the secretary of the treasury is in that bill premeditatedly set up as a rival to that of the president  and that policy will be pursued if we are not on our guard till we have a quintuple or a centuple executive directory with all the babylonish dialect which modern pedants most affect i pray you to continue to write me as often as possible  with high esteem c john adams john adams    october      east chester oliver wolcott to oliver wolcott jr secretary of the treasury east chester    october      dear sir— i have received your favor of the  0th and thank you for your vigilant attention to the progress or rather to the decline of the fever in philadelphia i request your explicit opinion and pray you if you can to obtain those of mr mchenry and mr lee whether from the prevalence of contagious sickness in philadelphia or the existence of any other circumstances it would be hazardous to the     lives or health of the members of congress to meet in that city on the second monday in november if you cannot with very clear consciences answer in the negative i shall issue a proclamation convening congress at new york for myself i have no apprehension of danger but the members of congress will be more exposed than i shall be and i hold myself intrusted with the care of their health a precious deposit which i will preserve according to the best of my judgment with perfect integrity and with more caution than i would my own it is scarcely worth a question whether they shall be convened at trenton lancaster or any other place i know from painful experience they cannot be accommodated at any of those places the place must be philadelphia or new york si quid novisti rectius imperti i am dear sir as ever with great regard john adams john adams    october      east chester timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state east chester    october      dear sir— i have to thank you for your summary in your letter of the   d of the despatches from mr pinckney mr murray mr bulkely c mr murray arrived in season to renew his old friendship with his predecessor they had spent some weeks together at the hague more than a dozen years ago mr adams had an opportunity to introduce mr murray to his friends and to communicate to him the train of affairs an advantage which mr murray earnestly wished before he sailed from philadelphia mr pinckney has been well acquainted with mr gerry they have always been upon terms of friendship and i doubt not he will be as well pleased as if mr dana had accepted poor portugal has been intimidated into concessions as humiliating to herself as pernicious to the world i am not surprised that m marbois should wish that colonel pickering had not pushed the point of gratitude so far  he may well be     surprised and ought to be grateful that his own letter to vergennes was not quoted at full length nothing could have better illustrated the question of gratitude my youngest son thomas boylston adams has been in paris and instead of being ordered out of france as our jacobinic papers boasted he accepted the day before he returned a polite invitation to dine with one of the directors citizen carnot by whom he was civilly treated and urged to endeavor to reconcile the two countries he was admitted and had a convenient seat assigned him at the ceremony of drawing the lot for the director who was to rote out in short he was treated with great distinction i am disappointed in my hopes of seeing him this season his brother who is a little disconcerted at his removal to berlin which he says is in the heart of germany where he shall not see an american in a year has taken advantage of it to insist upon his company so earnestly that i think he will prevail and i must remain another year at least forlorn we must prepare as exact a statement as our intelligence will justify of the position of our agents civil and military on the mississippi and of the disposition of the spaniards and inhabitants towards them to be inserted in the speech and pray give me your opinion explicitly whether from the prevalence of contagious sickness in philadelphia or the existence of any other circumstances it would be hazardous to the lives or health of the members of congress to meet in that city on the second monday in november if i should not issue a proclamation convening congress at new york i shall take you by the hand in trenton the first week in november in my way to philadelphia i am dear sir with great regard yours john adams p s i return you guardian noels speech to his helpless ward      john adams    october      east chester oliver wolcott to o wolcott jr secretary of the treasury east chester    october      dear sir— i have received your favor of the   th  and thank you for your careful attention to the distemper in philadelphia representations similar to yours are sent me from various quarters that there would be considerable public inconvenience in a convention of congress at any place out of philadelphia is certain and this consideration has great weight that there would be much popular clamor at least much low snarling among the inhabitants of the foul dens in philadelphia is very probable this however would have little weight with me against a measure of general necessity or expediency mr mchenry and mr pickering are of your opinion and this union will have more weight than all the brawlers of philadelphia even though they should be countenanced by the prudent citizens your conjectures concerning the success of our envoys to france appear to me very probable yet i cannot apprehend so much from the personal feelings of talleyrand he received a great deal of cordial hospitality in this country and had not the smallest reason to complain that ever came to my knowledge in any place as a reasonable man he could not but approve of the presidents caution knowing himself to be upon the list of emigrants and knowing the clamor which would be raised by the french minister at the presentation of an illustrious frenchman by any other than himself it is a part of the duty of an ambassador to judge of the persons among his countrymen whom it would be proper to present to government it would have been a slight at least to the french minister to have received a man he had refused to present it would have been offensive to the government of france to have received a man proscribed by their laws there is however little immediate advantage to be expected from this embassy i fear it will be spun out into an immeasurable length unless quickened by an embargo we must unshackle our merchant ships if congress     will not do it i shall have scruples about continuing the restriction upon the collectors what the session of congress will produce i know not but a torpor a despondency has seized all men in america as well as europe the system of terror according to an indian expression has put petticoats on them the treachery of the common people against their own countries the transports with which they seize the opportunity of indulging their envy and gratifying their revenge against all whom they have been in the habit of looking up to at every hazard to their countries and in the end at every expense of misery to themselves has given a paralytic stroke to the wisdom and courage of nations if peace is refused to england they will leap the gulf their stocks are not much higher than those of the french the latter i see in some speech in the council of five hundred have been at forty can these be the general mass of the french national debt old as well as new the french directory i take it for granted must have war war open or understood is their eternal doom i am dear sir with unalterable esteem john adams john adams    october      east chester timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state east chester    october      dear sir— i received your favor of the   th inclosed are some papers i received from the city of washington they are duplicates of such as i received several weeks ago i have delayed an answer because i was not satisfied and wished to take advice after you have examined them i wish for your opinion first whether i ought to sign the warrant of attorney without limitation of time second whether the power ought not to be to scott thornton and white and their successors in the office of commissioners the papers you will please to return to me with your advice i thank you for another abridgment of the public despatches are you not misinformed concerning la forest i have understood that he is in philadelphia and that he arrived there   0 this last summer in the questionable shape of an unaccredited chargé des affaires talleyrand i should suppose could not be for war with this country nor can i apprehend that even the triumvirate as they begin to be called in france will be for a measure so decided a continued appearance of umbrage and continued depredations on a weak defenceless commerce will be much more convenient for their views by all the public papers i receive from abroad it appears that the state of things at present in france is exactly as i have many times written to particular friends in europe the executive directory is divided into a party of three and a party of two the two are the most popular coincide best with the public opinion and agree with a majority in both houses of the legislature this drives the three to the necessity of courting the army and the populace and the question between the three and the two can be decided only by a civil war the worst evil that can happen in any government is a divided executive and as a plural executive must from the nature of men be forever divided this is a demonstration that a plural executive is a great evil and incompatible with liberty that emulation in the human heart which produces rivalries of men cities and nations which produces almost all the good in human life produces also almost all the evil this is my philosophy of government the great art lies in managing this emulation it is the only defence against its own excesses the emulation of the legislative and executive powers should be made to control each other the emulation between the rich and the poor among the people should be made to check itself by balancing the two houses in the legislature which represent these two classes of society so invidious at all times against each other but instead of three lines which i intended to write to you i have slided into a pedantical lecture upon government for which i beg your pardon with great esteem and regard yours c john adams     john adams    january      philadelphia to the heads of department philadelphia    january      the president of the united states requests the secretary of state the secretary of the treasury the secretary of war and the attorneygeneral to take into their consideration the state of the nation and its foreign relations especially with france these indeed may be so connected with those with england spain holland and others that perhaps the former cannot be well weighed without the other if our envoys extraordinary should be refused an audience or after an audience be ordered to depart without accomplishing the objects of their mission   they may repair to holland or   two of them may return home leaving one abroad or   all of them may return to america in the first case will it be prudent to call them all home and in the second to recall the one in any of these three cases what will be necessary or expedient for the executive authority of government to do here in what manner should the first intelligence be announced to congress by message or speech what measures should be recommended to congress shall an immediate declaration of war be recommended or suggested if not what other system shall be recommended more than a repetition of the recommendations heretofore repeatedly made to both houses will it in any case and in what cases be advisable to recommend an embargo what measures will be proper to take with spain what with holland what with portugal but above all what will policy dictate to be said to england and how shall it be said by mr king or to mr liston and how shall it be conveyed to mr king by packet or any ordinary conveyance or by some special trusty and confidential messenger will it not be the soundest policy even in case of a declaration of war on both sides between france and the united states for us to be totally silent to england and wait for her overtures will it not be imprudent in us to connect ourselves with britain in any manner that may impede us in embracing the first favorable moment or opportunity to make a separate peace what     aids or benefits can we expect from england by any stipulations with her which her interest will not impel her to extend to us without any on the brink of the dangerous precipice on which she stands will not shaking hands with her necessitate us to fall with her if she falls on the other hand what aid could we stipulate to afford her which our own interest would not oblige us to give without any other obligation in case of a revolution in england a wild democracy will probably prevail for as long a time as it did in france in such case will not the danger of reviving and extending that delirium in america be increased in proportion to the intimacy of our connection with that nation  john adams     john adams   february      philadelphia james wilkinson to james wilkinson philadelphia   february      dear sir— i have received your favor of the   th december by the miami chief the little turtle and have received and observed him with attention he is certainly a remarkable man he is recovered of the smallpox and what is worse a severe fit of the gout we shall endeavor to make him happy here and contented after his return i thank you for introducing him to me and for the information you have given me concerning him i have also received your letter of the   th december it is very true that i have been tortured for a greater part of the year past with written anonymous insinuations against several persons in conspicuous public stations that they had formed improper connections with spain and among others against yourself it has been frequently asserted that you held a commission and received pay as a colonel in the spanish service this opinion seems to have taken such root upon the mississippi among the people in general that scarcely any man arrives from that neighborhood who does not bring the report along with him they seem to be in such a temper in that region that nobody escapes accusation i have not suffered     these rumors concerning you to make impression upon me but have lamented what i perceived must be the consequence of them among the people of the united states the same jealousy or malice which transmitted them to me i suppose would propagate them elsewhere without much reserve i recollect perfectly well my injunction to you in person to employ all the force within your power both militia and regulars if necessary to oppose the english or any other foreign nation who should presume to attempt a violation of our territory by any expedition through it against their enemies it would be a pleasure to me to nominate your son to a commission as you request but in the first place there is no vacancy in the artillery at present as i am told and secondly it was a rule established by my predecessor that the ensigns should have attained the age of twentyone and i should be severely censured for departing from a military precaution of so high authority i recollect my consenting that you should make an excursion if in your judgment the service would admit of it to the copper country i thank you for the sample you have sent me which i design to have analyzed for yourself sir i will say i esteem your talents i respect your services and feel an attachment to your person as i do to every man whose name and character i have so long known in the service of our country whose behavior has been consistent we may be nearer than we suspect to another trial of our spirits i doubt not yours will be found faithful what measures you may think fit to take to silence the villainous clamors and rumors of your connections with spain and france i know not but no violent ones or military ones will do any good i shall give no countenance to any imputations unless accusations should come and then you will have room to justify yourself but i assure you i do not expect that any charge will be seriously made i am c john adams     john adams   february      philadelphia j m forbes to j m forbes philadelphia   february      sir— i received in season and with pleasure your letter of   th january i must avow that upon the first publication of mr monroes work i was much hurt at that levity with which so many americans and among them some of respectable character had taken an open part against the executive authority of their own government especially when that authority was exercised by a character so universally respected as washington it looked as if americans would be forever incapable of any kind of government your particular obligations to mr monroe for his services to your brother must have made a deep impression on your feelings and the sense you express of them does honor to your heart and will apologize for a conduct which however it will not justify as this is the first instance it may be pardoned but most assuredly a second never will  i am obliged to you for writing to me on this occasion and for the just sentiments and handsome expressions of them to sir c john adams john sevier   february      knoxville john adams john sevier to john adams knoxville tennessee   february      sir— in a letter of this day from the hon david campbell esq one of the judges of the superior courts of law and equity in this state he complains that on the  d instant about ten oclock at night on his own premises and not within the indian line he was arrested by two of colonel butlers officers and conducted a prisoner to his cantonment and there detained until the next day before he was liberated permit me sir with all due deference to observe that no act     hostile to the general government has been committed or attempted by the state of tennessee nor can any transaction of our government warrant the imputation of any thing of the kind our laws are sufficiently wholesome and energetic and also faithfully administered in a manner fully competent and adequate to the suppression of every kind of crimes and enormities that may be committed i do not harbor or entertain a doubt that the president ever gave any orders that will warrant or justify a procedure so despotic and inimical to the liberties of our citizens but on the contrary believe he is entirely uninformed that a transaction of the kind was contemplated permit me to express that it is painful in the extreme that such an event has happened and been exercised on a character that has served with fidelity the united as well as several of the states in very high and dignified stations i therefore request with much solicitude that a stop may be put to such unwarrantable and unconstitutional conduct if not the disorder may progress into an incurable disease i cannot admit or suppose that martial law has any right to be enforced when the civil meets no obstruction or impediment but if such has been directed we hope to be advised in order that we may know in what manner to conduct in future i have the honor to be with great respect c john sevier john adams    february      philadelphia william s smith to william s smith philadelphia    february      sir— i have received the letter you wrote me on the  th of this month and i shall give all the attention to the subject of it which may be necessary it is not new to me you are too precipitate in my opinion in pronouncing an opinion that the general  has been guilty of high crimes c there have not been wanting critics upon your conduct as severe as you have been upon his it is reported not much to the advantage of your reputation or mine that you have been     to detroit for brockholst livingston and company to speculate in lands and claims of those who mean to remain british subjects and to remove to canada and that to cloak your real purposes you gave out that you had been sent by me for ends of government of some sort or other i can scarcely believe that you

britannique qui les ont reçu très favorablement en témoignant beaucoup de satisfaction davoir à agir dans un cas pareil avec les états unis de lamérique et il me semble que le délai que jéprouve affligeant réellement dans un moment aussi pressant résulte précisément de lattente où le gouvernement anglais paroit être de voir lamérique du nord décidée à rompre définitivement avec la   0 france par le désir quelle a de faire cause commune et de coöpérer ensemble à lindépendance absolue du continent entier du nouveaumonde comme lesprit de justice générosité et attachement de mes compatriotes vers les états unis se trouve mieux exprimé dans le document qui me sert de pouvoir autant que dinstruction jai voulu y joindre une copie complète persuadé que cette démarche amicale et franche servira plus efficacement à accélérer la décision     comptant toujours sur la réserve indispensable dans tout ce qui ne regarde pas directement les états unis si quelque article de ceux qui sont contenus dans cette instruction ou toute autre chose qui soit relative eut besoin dexplication d pedro josef caro un de mes compatriotes commissaire aussi des colonies hispanoamericaines et chargé de

commettans et compatriotes de létat actuel des négotiations à nous confiées ainsi que de la situation politique de leurope je vous prie de vouloir bien lui faciliter toutce dont il auroit besoin pour cet important objet et pour se rendre incessament à la province de santa fé de bogotà je ne vous dissimule pas monsieur le président mes inquiétudes sur lentrée prochaine des troupes françaises en espagne crainte quun mouvement convulsif dans la métropole ne produise pas des secousses anarchiques dans les colonies et que labominable système de la france ne sintroduise chez nous faute davoir pris des mesures promptes et efficaces pour lempêcher dii avertant enfin jespère que le petit secours dont nous avons besoin pour commencer et qui se réduit à six ou huit vaisseaux de ligne et quatre ou cinq mille hommes des troupes nous le trouverons facilement tant en angleterre que dans lamérique    mes souhaits seroient que la marine fut anglaise et les troupes de terre américaines veuille la

homme distingué qui par son courage rendit son pays indépendant et qui par sa sagesse lui donna après un gouvernement bien balancé en sauvant ainsi la liberté nous profiterons sans doute de vos savantes leçons et je me réjouis de vous apprendre davance que la forme de gouvernement projeté est mixte avec un chef héréditaire du pouvoir exécutif sous le nom dynca et ce que jaime davantage pris dans la même famille un sénat composé de familles nobles mais non héréditaire et une chambre des communes élue parmi tous les autres citoyens qui auront une propriété compétente telle est lesquisse de

johnson philadelphia    april      dear sir— i have received your letter of—i cannot recollect what date because i referred it immediately to the secretary of the treasury who has under consideration all proposals of that kind yours will be carefully and impartially attended to with all others i perceive by the steadiness and firmness of your handwriting that you are still a young man having occasion at present for a little more youth than i possess i wish you would advise me how to acquire it or come yourself over to macedonia and help us with yours i am a solitary individual of      men all the rest have departed i am however very steadfastly your friend john adams john adams    june      philadelphia george washington to george washington philadelphia    june      dear sir— i have this morning received with great pleasure the letter you did me the honor to write me on the   th of this month  although a visit to the city of washington would give me great pleasure and chiefly for the opportunity it would afford me of paying my respects at mount vernon yet i cannot but     consider the execution of the plan as very uncertain i thank you sir for your obliging invitation and shall certainly wish to spend as much time as possible under the refreshing shade of your vine the approbatory addresses are very precious to me as they discover more union among the states and greater unanimity among the people than was expected my administration will not certainly be easy to myself it will be happy however if it is honorable the prosperity of it to the country will depend upon heaven and very little on any thing in my power i have no qualifications for the martial part of it which is like to be the most essential if the constitution and your convenience would admit of my changing places with you or of my taking my old station as your lieutenant civil i should have no doubts of the ultimate prosperity and glory of the country in forming an army whenever i must come to that extremity i am at an immense loss whether to call out all the old generals or to appoint a young set if the french come here we must learn to march with a quick step and to attack for in that way only they are said to be vulnerable i must tax you sometimes for advice we must have your name if you will in any case permit us to use it there will be more efficacy in it than in many an army mrs adams and miss smith join with me in presenting our best respects to yourself mrs washington and miss custis with the highest esteem c john adams john adams   july      philadelphia james mchenry to j mchenry secretary of war philadelphia   july      dear sir— it is my desire that you embrace the first opportunity to set out on your journey to mount vernon and wait on general washington with the commission of lieutenantgeneral and commanderinchief of the armies of the united states which by the advice and consent of the senate has been signed by me the reasons and motives which prevailed with me to venture     on such a step as the nomination of this great and illustrious character whose voluntary resignation alone occasioned my introduction to the office i now hold were too numerous to be detailed in this letter and are too obvious and important to escape the observation of any part of america or europe but as it is a movement of great delicacy it will require all your address to communicate the subject in a manner that shall be inoffensive to his feelings and consistent with all the respect that is due from me to him if the general should decline the appointment all the world will be silent and respectfully acquiesce if he should accept all the world except the enemies of this country will rejoice if he should come to no decisive determination but take the subject into consideration i shall not appoint any other lieutenantgeneral until his conclusion is known his advice in the formation of a list of officers would be extremely desirable to me the names of lincoln morgan knox hamilton gates pinckney lee carrington hand muhlenberg dayton burr brooks cobb smith may be mentioned to him and any others that occur to you particularly i wish to have his opinion of the man most suitable for inspectorgeneral and adjutantgeneral and quartermastergeneral his opinion on all subjects must have great weight and i wish you to obtain from him as much of his reflections upon the times and service as you can wishing you a pleasant journey and a speedy return in improved health i am with great esteem  c john adams     john adams   july      philadelphia george washington to george washington philadelphia   july      dear sir— mr mchenry the secretary at war will have the honor to wait on you in my behalf to impart to you a step i have ventured to take and which i should have been happy to have communicated in person if such a journey had been at this time in my power  as i said in a former letter if it had been in my power to nominate you to be president of the united states i should have done it with less hesitation and more pleasure my reasons for this measure will be too well known to need any explanation to the public every friend and every enemy of america will comprehend them at first blush to you sir i owe all the apologies i can make the urgent necessity i am in of your advice and assistance—indeed of your conduct and direction of the war is all i can urge and that is a sufficient satisfaction to myself and the world i hope it will be so considered by yourself mr mchenry will have the honor to consult you upon the organization of the army and upon every thing relating to it with the highest respect c john adams     john adams   july      philadelphia timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state philadelphia   july      the president of the united states requests the secretary of state to give directions for preparing letters to the consulgeneral and all the other consuls and viceconsuls of the french republic throughout the united states revoking their exequaturs and a proclamation announcing such revocation to the public the proclamation to be published and the letters expedited as soon as the law shall be passed declaring the treaties and convention no longer obligatory  john adams john adams george washington the secretary of war to general washington mount vernon subjects respectfully submitted to the consideration of the general of the armies of the united states by the secretary of war    will it be proper that the president should forthwith proceed to appoint the officers to the army proposed to be immediately raised by the bill pending before congress to augment the army of the united states and for other purposes or will it be expedient to defer until the principal part of the troops are enlisted the appointment of all the general officers of the said army excepting the inspectorgeneral and such staff officers as may be necessary to the formation and discipline of regiments or will it be better that the whole of the officers be immediately appointed in order that as little time as possible may be lost in forming and disciplining both officers and men for actual service noticing only to those officers who may not be immediately wanted that their pay c will not commence till called upon to do duty with the army       will it be expedient that the president should appoint as soon as proper characters can be selected the officers to the ten thousand troops of the provisional army and that they should be furnished with such instructions and orders as will enable them to proceed to enlist the men whenever the president shall declare by proclamation or otherwise that the measure has become necessary   may advantages be expected to result from the appointment of field officers in the respective states to take the command of such volunteer companies therein as may offer their services to the president and be accepted as to render such appointments advisable george washington    july      general washingtons answer    july       st if the bill pending in congress for augmenting the present force of the united states should pass into a law it becomes the duty of the president to carry that law into execution promptly of course all such officers as are necessary for the purpose of recruiting inspecting the recruits superintending their discipline c at the several places of rendezvous must be appointed without delay the necessity of appointing the higher grades is not so urgent but in my opinion the sooner these are also fixed on and their acceptances known the better not however to be called out nor to receive the pay and emoluments of office until their services are required which circumstances must decide  d it would be inexpedient i conceive to appoint but very proper to fix upon the general and field officers colonels commandants at least for the provisional army without much delay and know whether they would accept the appointments that are announced to them to proceed further might excite alarm and give rise to remarks which would be more than a counterpoise to the facility intended to be answered by it  d if two things could be combined and the evidence thereof pretty well ascertained the measure would certainly be advantageous these are that the field officers should be composed of proper and fit men and acceptable to the companies but if     both cannot be attained the first is most important and ought to be preferred george washington henry knox   august      boston henry knox to the secretary of war  boston   august      sir— i have received your letter dated on the   th ultimo informing me that the president of the united states by and with the advice and consent of the senate had been pleased to appoint me a majorgeneral in the army impressed as i am with the conviction that our country is about to enter into a contest in which its existence as an independent nation will be involved i should promptly have accepted the appointment however inconvenient to my private affairs had not the following paragraph of your letter peculiarly arrested my notice it may be proper to mention that the nominations to the senate for general officers of the established and provisional army were presented on the same day and in the order in which they appear in the annexed list and that in registering them in this department the same order will be observed the names placed before mine in the list are those of generals hamilton and pinckney it is to be presumed that you are not uninformed of the military precedence i sustained in the late war relatively to those gentlemen general hamilton was a captain in the year      in the corps of artillery which i commanded and in the latter part of the same year i had the rank of brigadiergeneral in      he was appointed an aiddecamp to the commanderinchief with the incidental rank of lieutenantcolonel which was his highest grade i was established a majorgeneral from november      the precise state of general pinckneys rank is not at present recollected he was a colonel the greater part of the war and     obtained the rank of brigadiergeneral either by actual appointment or by virtue of the general resolve respecting brevet rank in the year      it is therefore important previously to my answering affirmatively or negatively as to an acceptance that you inform me on these points whether the order of names as specified in the list is intended to establish the priority of rank or whether the former relative rank is intended to govern according to the heretofore established principles and invariable practice those principles determine explicitly that all appointments made in the same grade and on the same day are to be governed by the former relative rank it is far from my intention to deny the perfect right of the supreme executive to direct the precedence of all officers in the same grade in the manner he shall please in such a case however it would be essential that the priority should be decidedly specified for if such specification should be wanting no military tribunal would consider the order of names as a sufficient cause to destroy or reverse the former situations if the rules for deciding rank founded upon the resolves or laws of congress under the confederation and which have since continued to operate as a part of the military code have been repealed or annulled it would be acceptable to me to be informed by you when and by what authority the repeal was effected if these rules should be suspended or violated in the present instance for a special purpose the assertion is ventured that recourse must be had to them again as the laws whereby to decide the ranks between officers of the same grade who under various circumstances of claim may be brought into the army about to be raised anxiously desirous of endeavoring to serve my country and its government in a cause altogether pure and just i shall ever regret any circumstance which may oppose insurmountable obstacles to the measure unless upon terms which would constantly excite sensations of public degradation i have the honor to be c h knox   0 john adams    august      quincy james mchenry to j mchenry secretary of war quincy    august      sir— i have received only this morning your letter of the  th of this month its contents are of much importance i desire that you would inform general washington that i consider him in the public service from the date of his appointment and entitled to all the emoluments of it he is at liberty to receive all or any part at his discretion and is fully authorized to appoint his aids and secretaries when he shall think fit one secretary at least is indispensable immediately and he ought to be allowed his pay and rations  calling any other general officers into service at present will be attended with difficulty unless the rank were settled  in my opinion as the matter now stands general knox is legally entitled to rank next to general washington and no other arrangement will give satisfaction if general washington is of this opinion and will consent to it you may call him into actual service as soon as you please the consequence of this will be that pinckney must rank before hamilton if it shall be consented that the rank shall be knox pinckney and hamilton you may call the latter too into immediate service when you please any other plan will occasion long delay and much confusion you may depend upon it the five new england states will not patiently submit to the humiliation that has been meditated for them if north declines the adjutancy i am prepared to appoint another and a better i am sir your most obedient servant john adams     francisco de miranda

me sont parvenus tout récemment tant de la part de nos agens à madrid que de celle des commissaires mes compatriotes qui sont partis pour lamérique du sud me confirment dans cette opinion et je vois avec plaisir que langleterre sentant enfin que son salut et son bonheur futur dépendent absolument dune alliance et dun attachement intime avec lamérique est résolue en déposant tout esprit de jalousie et de monopole commercial à coöpérer avec vous en faveur de cet important objet dont le succès assurera non seulement le bonheur réciproque mais encore la gloire immortelle des trois parties

acceptance will you be so good as to attend to this subject as soon as possible and forward the acceptance to me for my signature and conveyance to the governor if that is sufficient i do not remember that the acceptance of congress is necessary major jackson of the artillery has applied to me says he has not received his commission and is out of employment i have received very unpleasant information of the principles and conversation of one of the majors of the new corps of artillerists  i wish you would inquire into the character of that marylander i wish to know also by what rule

and return them i think it will be advisable that your excellency should communicate them to the attorneygeneral of the state and the districtattorney mr davis at boston that both those gentlemen may write to the attornies who act for the state and the district in maine an investigation ought to be set on foot but i am not alarmed at such information having received much of it in other places which has not amounted to any thing serious in the end  mrs adams joins me in respects to your excellencys lady she has not been out of her chamber since she first entered it after our arrival and is still very weak with great regard c john adams john adams    august      trenton timothy pickering t pickering secretary of state to john adams trenton    august      sir— i inclose a letter which i received last evening under cover from m pedro josef caro accompanied by a letter from mr king intended as an introduction to m caro but the latter having missed a passage to the united states in the british cutter which sailed from falmouth to new york on the  0th     of april and circumstances requiring his arrival in south america with as little delay as possible he forwarded the packet to me a copy of the translation of his letter to me i have the honor to inclose under the same cover to me were inclosed two letters one for colonel hamilton the other for general knox which i forward by this post to those gentlemen  i am with perfect respect c timothy pickering pedro josef caro  0 may      falmouth no   inclosed pedro josef caro to the secretary of state translation falmouth  0 may      sir— the annexed letter of the hon mr king to you will serve as a credential in my favor in presenting myself to you with the important mission it announces an unforeseen accident has frustrated my voyage hence to your continent in his majestys cutter which sailed for new york on the  0th april last and a combination of circumstances requiring my arrival in south america with as little delay as possible i have received instructions immediately to depart by the shortest route of the leeward islands and am ordered to communicate it to the government through the medium of you by transmitting the pamphlet which i inclose and which i should have conveyed personally i pray you to be pleased to deliver it into the     hands of his excellency the president and as eventually some answer may be practicable in so interesting a business general francis de miranda our compatriot and principal agent of all spanish america in union a person extremely well known and in particular to the hon mr king whose intervention is as to both parties safe and secret will remain in london i also hope you will have the goodness to receive the first tribute of my respects in the spanish language and style as i am unable to render it in english and that you will not confide the secret to interpreters that are not known remaining with the greatest respect c pedro josef caro rufus king    february      no   inclosed rufus king to the secretary of state    february      extract two points have within a fortnight been settled in the english cabinet respecting south america if spain is able to prevent the overthrow of her present government and to escape being brought under the entire control of france england between whom and spain notwithstanding the war a certain understanding appears to exist will at present engage in no scheme to deprive spain of her possessions in south america but if as appears probable the army destined against portugal and which will march through spain or any other means which may be employed by france shall overthrow the spanish government and thereby place the resources of spain and of her colonies at the disposal of france england will immediately commence the execution of a plan long since digested and prepared for the complete independence of south america if england engages in this plan she will propose to the united states to coöperate in its execution miranda will be detained here under one pretence or another until events shall decide the conduct of england the revolution of spain is decreed the attempt will be made and its success is scarcely doubtful the president may therefore expect the overture of england and     will i am persuaded act upon it under the influence of that wise and comprehensive policy which looking forward to the destinies of the new world shall in the beginning by great and generous deeds lay deep and firm the foundations of lasting concord between its rising empires if possible i will bring together and seasonably arrange and send to you such information as i have been able to procure upon this interesting and very consequential subject having found out and acquired the confidence of certain jesuits natives of south america who with a view to its independence are and for several years have been in the service and pay of england i have often conversed with them and seen the reports which they have prepared for their employers these communications throw much light upon the population the revenues the oppression and the temper and character of the spanish americans rufus king   april      london no   inclosed rufus king to the secretary of state extract london   april      south america must soon pass through a revolution we have an immense interest in the event as well as in the manner in which it shall be effected in a former letter i have communicated to you the views and intentions of england who will not promote the revolt in case spain shall be able to save herself from a revolution and keep the french out of portugal and though there seems little probability that this will be the case england since the arrival of miranda here but without his knowledge has informed spain not only that she will not countenance or assist the spanish colonies in becoming independent but that she will join her in resisting the endeavors of others to accomplish it provided that spain will oppose the views of france against her own dominions and those of portugal at the same time that this communication has been made to spain an expedition has been prepared and the correspondent arrangements at trinidad have been ordered for the     purpose of beginning the revolution of south america in this event as i have before intimated to you england will at philadelphia open herself to and ask the coöperation of the united states miranda who is impatient with the delays that he experiences as well as ignorant of the provisional decisions of this cabinet has concluded to send his friend and associate mr caro to philadelphia with a letter for the president and i have given him a letter to identify and introduce him to you conjecturing the intentions of france and knowing with precision those of england we shall be the better able in season to consider and regulate the conduct that it shall be proper for us to pursue john adams    august      quincy james mchenry to j mchenry secretary of war quincy    august      sir— i have received your letter of august  0th i believe though the 0 is obscure general knox is gone to the eastward as i understand to return in ten or fifteen days but if he were in boston i could not send him either your official or private letter as neither contains sentiments that i can approve  my opinion is and has always been clear that as the law now stands the order of nomination or of recording has no weight or effect but that officers appointed on the same day in whatever order have a right to rank according to antecedent services i made the nomination according to the list presented to me by you from general washington in hopes that rank might be settled among them by agreement or acquiescence believing at the time and expressing to you that belief that the nomination and appointment would give hamilton no command at all nor any rank before any majorgeneral this is my opinion still i am willing to settle all decisively at present and have no fear of the consequences by dating the commissions knox on the first day pinckney on the second and hamilton on the third if this course is not taken and the commissions are all     made out on the same day i tell you my opinion is clear that hamilton will legally rank after hand and i fear even after lee you speak to me of the expediency of attempting an alteration in the rank of the gentlemen in question you know sir that no rank has ever been settled by me you know my opinion has always been as it is now that the order of names in the nomination and record was of no consequence general washington has through the whole conducted with perfect honor and consistency i said and i say now if i could resign to him the office of president i would do it instantly and with the highest pleasure but i never said i would hold the office and be responsible for its exercise while he should execute it nor has he ever intimated a desire of the kind he has always in all his letters said that these points must ultimately depend on the president the power and authority are in the president i am willing to exert this authority at this moment and to be responsible for the exercise of it all difficulties will in this way be avoided but if it is to be referred to general washington or to mutual and amicable accommodation among the gentlemen themselves i foresee it will come to me at last after much altercation and exasperation of passions and i shall then determine it exactly as i should now—knox pinckney and hamilton there has been too much intrigue in this business with general washington and me  if i shall ultimately be the dupe of it i am much mistaken in myself i can sympathize with you in your ill health and the sickness     of your family my dear mrs adams has been at the point of death and although a little recovered is still extremely weak and low i am c john adams   0 john adams  0 august      quincy john jay to john jay quincy  0 august      sir— i had last night the pleasure to receive the letter your excellency did me the honor to write me on the   st instant     inclosing the resolutions of the senate and assembly of new york and their unanimous address i can scarcely imagine any event that could do me more honor or give me greater satisfaction the unanimity of new york of vast importance in the union is a happy omen of success and prosperity to this country i pray you sir to accept of my sincere thanks for the affectionate and obliging manner in which you have communicated to me this important proceeding of your legislature with great respect sir esteem and affection john adams john adams   september      quincy james mchenry to james mchenry secretary of war quincy   september      sir— i pray you to put on the list of captains of infantry mr philip church of new york who is very handsomely recommended by general hamilton and whom from a personal acquaintance with him i believe to be well qualified  i inclose to you also a letter and documents from his excellency governor jackson of georgia which i pray you to consider and answer according to those arrangements which you have made for the general service we ought to give all the attention in our power to georgia which is not only much exposed but of much importance in the defence of the nation inclosed also are recommendations of aaron mann of providence and william hunt of massachusetts john adams   september      quincy alexander hamilton to alexander hamilton quincy   september      sir— i have received your favor of the   d of august recommending colonel tousard to be inspector of artillery     i have no reason to suspect that your entire confidence in his honor and fidelity is misplaced but as his native country is france and his speech betrays his origin i am very apprehensive that in a french war neither the army nor the people would be without their jealousies and suspicions which might be very injurious to the service i shall take the subject into consideration and your judgment will have great weight there has already been so much uneasiness expressed on account of the french officers in the artillery that i expect much difficulty john adams   september      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy   september      sir— i return you mr adamss  letters nos         and

island and if you have not that you would be so good as to answer it as soon as you conveniently can or if you think it more proper that you would send the papers to me and i will answer them it is high time we had an officer and garrison on that island there are recruits enough in boston marblehead portland and vermont as i am informed the long continued sickness of mrs adams distresses me very severely she has been out of her chamber but three times since she came home and then to ride half a mile only your amiable family i hope enjoy perfect health p s what is your opinion of dumouriezs tableau spéculatif de leurope whether a general war or a universal peace should take place in europe i think it is plain that in either case we ought to be prepared at all points especially with our floating citadels for no peace they can make however universal it may be can be lasting john adams    september      quincy james mchenry to j mchenry secretary of war quincy    september      sir— i have received your favor of the  th and approve of your determination to make out the commissions in the order of knox on the first day pinckney on the second and hamilton on the third this being done you may call generals knox and hamilton into service as soon as you please your request to be informed whether i attach any portion of the intrigues which i alluded to if any have been employed to you is reasonable and i have no scruple to acknowledge that your conduct through the whole towards me has been candid i have suspected however that extraordinary pains were taken with you to impress upon your mind that the public opinion and the unanimous wish of the federalists was that general hamilton might be first and even commanderinchief that you might express this opinion to general washington more forcibly than i should have done and that this determined him     to make the arrangement as he did  if this suspicion was well founded i doubt not you made the representation with integrity i am not and never was of the opinion that the public opinion demanded general hamilton for the first and i am now clear that it never expected nor desired any such thing the question being now settled the responsibility for which i take upon myself i have no hard thoughts concerning your conduct in this business and i hope you will make your mind easy concerning it i have the honor c john adams john adams    september      quincy james mchenry to j mchenry secretary of war quincy    september      sir— i have received your favor of the  th and return you the blank commission signed and all the papers inclosed in yours as to major brooks i know not how a man can talk of fighting french bloodhounds who has been capable of saying since his appointment that things were going very well before the arrival of the despatches of the envoys but the publication of those despatches had ruined every thing he must have a very loose head if he has an honest heart i will leave it to you and mr stoddert to determine this affair according to your best judgments the gentleman is to me a total stranger if     you think it safe to trust him i will if not arrange him some other way general norths letter i do not admire i mean neither to plead stipulate nor negotiate with him about his acceptance i had no idea of impressing him into the service he may accept or reject his appointment as he pleases unequivocally i shall give him no other command or appointment upon his future behavior will depend his future appointments i pray you to reply to the corps of horse of warren county north carolina according to your own ideas the others are approved by your humble servant john adams john adams    september      quincy oliver wolcott to o wolcott secretary of the treasury quincy    september      sir— i have received your favor of the  th and thank you for a letter of credit on general lincoln for       of which i shall receive from time to time such sums as i shall have occasion for and give receipts as you propose my steward is at trenton ferry on the pennsylvania side of the river at the ferry house the distress of the poor at philadelphia is so great that i pray you to subscribe and pay for me under the title of a friend and to let nobody know but yourself from whom it comes five hundred dollars john adams    september      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy    september      sir— i return mr adamss letter no   0 with the inclosure and dr rushs letter of september  st which i received in yours of the  th of this month i am not at all mortified at the delay of the treaties with prussia or sweden having no ardent desire of any treaties till the crisis in europe is more decided     general marshall or bushrod washington will succeed judge wilson if you have not some other gentleman to propose who in your opinion can better promote the public honor and interest marshall is first in age rank and public services probably not second in talents although i have an ancient esteem for judge rush and the doctor it is not sufficient to make any alteration in my judgment in this case as virginia has no judge at present she is as much entitled as pennsylvania to attention john adams    september      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy    september      sir— i have received your favor of the   th i wish i understood better than i do the conduct both of general pinckney and mr gerry i shall not be guilty of so much affectation of regard to science as to be very willing to grant passports to dupont de nemours or any other french philosophers in the present situation of our country  we have had too many french philosophers already and i really begin to think or rather to suspect that learned academies not under the immediate inspection and control of government have disorganized the world and are incompatible with social order mr king judges correctly of the american government that it has no disposition to give any encouragement to the mission of the directory i hope he conjectures equally well of the english inclosed is a letter received last night from mr higginson of september   th which i recommend to the consideration of the heads of department     john adams    september      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy    september      i had the honor of your letter of the   th last night and have read the inclosures dr rushs letter gives me pleasure because the number of disappointed candidates is diminished by it by one mr sitgreavess letter is frank candid and agreeable but although this gentleman has merit and talents held in high esteem by his country as well as by me i cannot help thinking that a few years of service in stations less exalted than the bench of the united states may reasonably be expected from him mr lees letter deserves great attention the name the connections the character the merit and abilities of mr washington  are greatly respected but i still think that general marshall ought to be preferred of the three envoys the conduct of marshall alone has been entirely satisfactory and ought to be marked by the most decided approbation of the public he has raised the american people in their own esteem and if the influence of truth and justice reason and argument is not lost in europe he has raised the consideration of the united states in that quarter of the world he is older at the bar than mr washington and you and i know by experience that seniority at the bar is nearly as much regarded as it is in the army if mr marshall should decline i should next think of mr washington it is true that some regard to states ought to be always remembered but pennsylvania has always had a judge virginia has had none since the resignation of mr blair as far as states can have reasonable pretensions therefore those of virginia are at least equal to those of pennsylvania thus the subject appears to me if you are of a different opinion i pray you to inform me or if any more meritorious candidate than mr marshall occurs to you i hope you will mention him to sir c john adams     john adams    september      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy    september      dear sir— i have received your letter of september  0th and return you the commission for a judge of the supreme court signed leaving the name and date blank you will fill the blank with the name of marshall if he will accept it if not with that of bushrod washington i cannot blame the former if he should decline of the latter i have always heard the most agreeable accounts  i have also received your letter of the   st with its inclosures and the extract from general marshalls letter i am of his opinion that the world has seldom seen more extraordinary letters than those of talleyrand john adams  0 september      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy  0 september      i have received your favor of the   th and have read carefully all the inclosures such as ought to remain in your office i return inclosed in this there is nothing that requires any remarks from me because i think all is well considered and well done it may not however be amiss to observe to mr adams that he need not be solicitous about his success in making treaties with prussia and sweden at present that i am fully convinced as he is that both will affect to refuse any treaty upon the terms in his instructions this will not alarm me at all and if both powers finally refuse to agree to any stipulations without the articles in     contemplation we shall not be very uneasy our commerce is of more consequence to them than theirs to us and with or without treaties we shall have all we want but we should be very improvident at the moment of being forced into a war to bind ourselves to permit france and her colonies to be supplied with every thing even our own produce in prussian and swedish or danish ships john adams the constitutions prize must be tried and fairly determined by law i hope and believe that care will be taken that no suspicions of plundering any thing may arise john adams   october      quincy benjamin stoddert to b stoddert secretary of the navy  quincy   october      dear sir— i have received your favors of the  0th   st and   th of september i am sorry that captain barry has not fully answered your expectations but i hope you will soon send him out again the hurricanes are now passed and there is no longer danger from them we must sweep the west india seas and get as many of the french seamen as they are called whether they are italians spaniards germans or negroes as we can seamen are so scarce that they cannot send out large privateers i thank you for your humane and wise directions to the navy agent at norfolk the captives ought to have able and honorable counsel and i rely upon the impartial justice of our tribunals for their honorable acquittal if the law and the truth require it the suppression of ships papers is a suspicious fact if they have cruised and plundered americans there cannot be much hesitation i cannot conceive there can be any difficulty in procuring evidence to show clearly the guilt or innocence of the ship   00 john adams   october      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy   october      dear sir— inclosed is a duplicate of a letter from miranda with some estimates read it and think of it a number of questions and considerations occur we are friends with spain if we were enemies would the project be useful to us it will not be in character for me to answer the letter will any notice of it in any manner be proper i shall send it by mr humphreys with mr gerrys papers  john adams   october      quincy george washington to george washington quincy   october      sir— i received yesterday the letter you did me the honor to write me on the   th of september  you request to be informed whether my determination to preserve the order of the three majorgenerals is final and whether i mean to appoint another adjutantgeneral without your concurrence i presume that before this day you have  0  received information from the secretary of war that i some time ago signed the three commissions and dated them on the same day in hopes similar to yours that an amicable adjustment or acquiescence might take place among the gentlemen themselves but if these hopes should be disappointed and controversies should arise they will of course be submitted to you as commanderinchief and if after all any one should be so obstinate as to appeal to me from the judgment of the commanderinchief i was determined to confirm that judgment because whatever construction may be put upon the resolutions of the ancient congress which have been applied to this case and whether they are at all applicable to it or not there is no doubt to be made that by the present constitution of the united states the president has authority to determine the rank of officers i have been for some time prepared in my own mind to nominate mr dayton to be adjutantgeneral in case of the refusal of mr north several others have occurred and been suggested to me but none who in point of science or literature political and military merit or energy of character appear to be equal to him if you have any other in contemplation i pray you to mention him to the secretary at war who may fill up his commission immediately in case mr north declines i hope your own health and mrs washingtons are perfect mine is very indifferent and mrs adamss extremely low confined to the bed of sickness for two months her destiny is still very precarious and mine in consequence of it  with great respect c john adams  0  john adams  0 october      quincy charles lee to c lee attorneygeneral quincy  0 october      the session of congress approaches faster than i can prepare for it in the afflicted state of my family and tottering state of my frame i request you to consider whether congress can meet in philadelphia with safety to their persons and also to  0  write me your sentiments of the particulars which ought to be inserted in the speech i shall be obliged by the long continued sickness of mrs adams and her consequent weakness to remain here till the last moment and set out only soon enough to meet  0  congress on the first monday in december which will make it desirable to me to receive your sentiments as early as possible that i may make some arrangements in season  john adams john adams    october      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy    october      i received last night your favor of the  th the letter for our minister at berlin shall be forwarded as you desire and thank you for despatching the instructions to the collectors and the commission to mr bushrod washington there were two young gentlemen nephews to the general who were at college when my family was in philadelphia and  0  sometimes visited us who appeared to me to be promising young men i wish you would suggest to mr mchenry to make some inquiry about them and find out whether they are proper for any appointment in the army or otherwise and whether they are desirous of public employment the delicacy which has restrained the family may do injustice to them and the public if some precautions are not taken john adams    october      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy    october      i have received yours of the  th and thank you for the intelligence from the southward the effervescence at madrid as well as the news from naples coincides with mr kings letter and the news from trieste confirms or rather favors the account that bonapartes destination was the adriatic not egypt but we must wait for further éclaircissements mr sullivans letter gives me apprehension that our friend benson has been stretching himself in order to be perfectly upright until he has bent backwards but according to the law and to the testimony we must submit to the decision but the very map they have made is a demonstration to me that our claim is just  john adams    october      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state private quincy    october      dear sir— i received your answer to the address from virginia concinnate and consummate my secretary gave a hint of it to mrs adams and she insisted upon his bringing it to her bedside and reading it to her she desires me to tell you that weak and low as she is she has spirit enough left to be delighted with it she says it is the best answer to an address that ever was written you may well suppose that i who am so severely reflected upon by these compliments am  0  disposed enough to think them extravagant i however think the answer excellent and wish you had to answer all the saucy addresses i have received i do not intend to answer any more of the disrespectful ones  john adams    october      quincy rufus king to rufus king quincy    october      the inclosed letter from the secretary of state i pray you to convey in safety and as soon as may be to berlin i ought not to omit this opportunity to thank you for the pamphlets you have sent me from time to time they not only entertain and amuse me but i flatter myself are useful our country seems to be as we used to say in      unanimous and firm they are much more so now than they were then new york and pennsylvania were always a little chancelantes but they will be kept tolerably steady there are strong pillars in both but watchman what of the night where is all tending i am weary of conjectures will princes ever be more wise or people more temperate or united or aristocrats more willing to acknowledge a superior john adams    october      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy    october      i have received your favor of the   th and return you three warrants signed which you may fill up for general collot mr schweitzer and the person mentioned in mr kings letter if he is to be found i could trust the heads of department with this power rather than my own judgment but i think we ought to give the  0  act a strict construction and therefore doubt the propriety of delegating the authority  i am cheerfully of mr wolcotts opinion that the secretary of state ought to be the person intrusted with the taking of the proofs permitted to be given by aliens to establish their innocence in order to obtain licenses to remain in the united states for all cases within a reasonable distance from the seat of government and hereby authorize and request you to insert the secretary of state accordingly  inclosed is a power to you to attend to the business of the navy office in the absence of mr stoddert john adams    october      quincy john jay to john jay quincy    october      i received last night your favor of the   th of november with a copy of an act of the legislature of the state of new york for the further defence of the state and for other purposes i shall transmit these papers to the secretary at war that a proper consultation may be had upon their contents and a final arrangement made according to rules which generally obtain in such cases in the mean time that no moments may be lost i shall not hesitate to comply with your excellencys request so far as to authorize general hamilton to concert with you the plan of laying out the money in question to the best advantage and to appoint him to superintend the execution of it i must however at the same time make a reservation of this condition namely that this act of the executive authority of the united states shall not be understood to have any influence on any  0  question or questions which may hereafter come before the legislature of the united states and may be proper only for their determination john adams    october      quincy alexander hamilton to alexander hamilton quincy    october      i received last night a letter from his excellency governor jay inclosing a copy of an act of the legislature of new york for the further defence of that state and for other purposes the governor observes that it appears to be the intention of that act that the money appropriated in it   0000 shall be laid out only in the manner which the national government will recognize as useful and advisable and his excellency proposes to my consideration whether it would not be expedient to authorize majorgeneral hamilton as a national officer in whom great confidence may be placed to concert with the governor the plan of laying out the money to the best advantage and to appoint the general to superintend the execution of it i have not hesitated to comply with the governors request saving all rights of the legislature of the united states accordingly i hereby request you to concert with his excellency to superintend the execution of it at least until some other arrangements shall be made if any other should hereafter be thought expedient with great esteem c alexander hamilton  0 october      new york john adams alexander hamilton to john adams new york  0 october      sir— the very obliging manner in which you were pleased to assure me of the appointment of my nephew philip church and the actual appointment of my relation captain hamilton to a lieutenancy in the navy which i just learn from the marine department are circumstances from which i derive much pleasure which i consider as conferring upon me a personal obligation and for which i beg you to accept my very cordial acknowledgments with perfect respect and esteem a hamilton  0  john adams  0 october      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy  0 october      dear sir— there are many things which deserve to be maturely considered before the meeting of congress i shall mention two or three at present concerning which i pray you to take as early measures as possible to obtain the advice of the heads of departments one of them is whether it will be expedient for the president to recommend to the consideration of congress a declaration of war against france this question supposes that france shall not have declared war against the united states otherwise i suppose there will be no room for a question another inquiry is whether any further proposals of negotiation can be made with safety and whether there will be any use or advantage in europe or america by uniting minds more in our favor by any such measure in a message to both houses of congress on the   st day of june last the president expressed his opinion of the impropriety of sending any ministers to france without assurances that they shall be received in this opinion he perseveres but the question is whether in the speech the president may not say that in order to keep open the channels of negotiation it is his intention to nominate a minister to the french republic who may be ready to embark for france as soon as he or the president shall receive from the directory satisfactory assurances that he shall be received and entitled to all the prerogatives and privileges of the general law of nations and that a minister of equal rank and powers shall be appointed and commissioned to treat with him if any measure of this kind should be thought admissible who shall be the man patrick henry judge patterson mr senator ross mr senator stockton i mention these because while they are staunch americans they have not been marked or obnoxious to the french no public speeches have been printed of theirs which have been pointed against the french or shall we fix upon a man without regard to this as bayard of delaware harper sitgreaves c or shall we fix upon one in europe as king smith or murray    0 another thing i wish to be considered is whether it will not be necessary to lay before congress all the papers sent from mr gerry by mr humphreys and if it will i pray you to have copies of them made for both houses i have the honor to be c john adams elbridge gerry  0 october      cambridge john adams elbridge gerry to john adams cambridge  0 october      dear sir— i have the honor to inform you that there has lately been published in the boston gazettes a letter signed timothy pickering addressed to p johnson esq of prince edward county virginia dated the   th of september last wherein mr pickering speaking of the despatches of the envoys says that m talleyrand affects an utter ignorance of the persons designated in the despatches by the letters w x y and z and in his letter of may  0th with solemn grimace requests mr gerry immediately to communicate to him the names for which those letters stand and mr gerry although he knew that talleyrand was much better acquainted with x y and z than he was himself having complied with this insulting     request m talleyrand makes a formal record of their names c had mr pickering waited until my return he would i presume have been convinced by my despatches of the impropriety of forming his judgment by the representations only of m talleyrand who had by the publication of the despatches of the envoys become my antagonist he would have seen that i could not with propriety have refused a compliance with that insulting request as he styled it that the publication of the despatches of the envoys had rendered me peculiarly obnoxious to the minister because by my communications only it appeared that he had had connection with the intriguers that the french government who were supposed to be implicated in this affair had a right to demand of me through their minister such information as might be necessary to confirm his report respecting the names of the intriguers and that in such a critical state to have refused the information to have thus provoked the french government and to have furnished it with a pretext for indignant measures against myself would have been a rash and unwarrantable act mr pickering was not well informed when he asserted that the despatches of the envoys were not published in france for they were published in some of the northern departments of the republic neither is he warranted in his assertion that i knew that talleyrand was much better acquainted with x y and z than i was myself i presumed that this was the case with respect to y but z i had known in the united states when driven from st domingo and i knew nothing more of his connection or of xs with m talleyrand than what has been communicated to the public mr pickering proceeding states that there is one other important fact relative to this business not mentioned in the despatches from the envoys which ought to be universally known and of the truth of which he has incontrovertible evidence it is this the company at the private dinner to which mr gerry was invited by m talleyrand consisted of x y and z after rising from table x and y renewed to mr gerry in the room and in the presence though perhaps not in the hearing of talleyrand the money propositions which the envoys had before rejected c this important fact notwithstanding the incontrovertible     evidence which mr pickering speaks of never existed i dined with m talleyrand but twice once at his table and once at my own whilst the other envoys were in paris x y and z were at his table and y and z at mine with fifteen or twenty other persons at each dinner how then it can be said that i was invited by m talleyrand at a private dinner and that the company consisted of x y and z i am yet to learn the proposition which x and y then made was i think relative to the loan only be this as it may it was instantly rejected by my declaring that we had neither power nor funds for the purpose this was subsequent to the dates of the letters of the envoys nos   and   in which we had detailed our conferences with x and y on the money propositions nevertheless had the envoys supposed this fact necessary to have been added to our voluminous communications on the same subject i was ready to adopt the measure and to have made it as universally known as the latter i shall make sir no further comments on the letter referred to because i am persuaded that your excellency will be convinced of the errors pointed out and will be disposed in the most public and prompt manner to do me justice and because i presume that mr pickering will readily promote the same measure i have the honor to be with great respect c elbridge gerry john adams    october      quincy james mchenry to james mchenry secretary of war quincy    october      sir— i received on saturday your favor of the   th when i dated the commissions of the majorgenerals on the same day i had made up my mind that if an acquiescence by amicable agreement in the opinion of general washington should not take place i would confirm his judgment whatever it might be if i could have been at philadelphia to receive him i should have invited general washington to that city long ago i cannot go to that city nor to trenton very soon  mrs adamss     health is so low and her life so precarious that it will be impossible for me to force myself away from her till the last moment the last has been the most gloomy summer of my life and the prospect of the winter is more dismal still for if i should not have a more melancholy separation to endure before i set out for the southward i must then leave my family here and pass a dreary winter alone at the seat of government at all events however i must be at the opening of congress or give up nothing shall wait for me that you send me here if you and the generals judge it necessary to appoint the officers of battalions before we can have an opportunity to nominate them to the senate you may fill up the commissions with the blanks you have or if you have not enough send new ones by the post as is every day done from the offices of state treasury and of the navy and i will sign them without loss of time as to recruiting service i wonder whether there has been any enthusiasm which would induce men of common sense to enlist for five dollars a month who could have fifteen when they pleased by sea or for common work at land i have no attachment to one more than another of the candidates for appointments the general officers are so well acquainted with the characters that i shall have no hesitation to appoint such as you and they recommend it may be well however to let the secretaries of state treasury and navy and the attorneygeneral if convenient see the list that if they have any objection they may mention it or if any idea to suggest they may propose it there has been no national plan that i have seen as yet formed for the maintenance of the army one thing i know that regiments are costly articles everywhere and more so in this country than any other under the sun if this nation sees a great army to maintain without an enemy to fight there may arise an enthusiasm that seems to be little foreseen at present there is no more prospect of seeing a french army here than there is in heaven  i am c john adams     john adams    october      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy    october      the inclosed letter to me from mr gerry  i received last night and pray you to have it inserted in a public print it will satisfy him and do no harm to any one it explains some circumstances advantageously he came to me upon the publication of your answer to the address and seemed uneasy at some expressions in it i read him the extract of general marshalls letter to you which was in the words you have employed he gave me the same explanations as are contained in this letter i advised him to put them on paper in the form of a letter to you or if he chose it to me and i would transmit it to you john adams    october      quincy alexander hamilton to alexander hamilton quincy    october      sir— i have received the letter you did me the honor to write me on the  0th and am glad to have the opportunity of consenting to the appointment of officers who will do so much credit in their stations to the service as i believe captain church and lieutenant hamilton will do in theirs i have received from hauteval a packet of addresses one of which is inclosed i do not think them of consequence enough to suppress them john adams    october      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy    october      i have received your favor of october   th and pray you when you see general pinckney to congratulate him for me on his arrival but i would not wish him to think of a journey here to see me i shall see him i hope ere long at trenton or philadelphia the two letters returned in yours are important the first     has made a great impression on me  inclosed is another letter which i pray you to decipher and return as soon as possible but do not write me any letter to arrive in quincy or boston after the  0th of november john adams   november      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy   november      sir— yesterday mr woodward came up and presented me with the inclosed memorial which he says was presented by dr logan to the french minister and was procured for him by mr richard codman mr woodward told me that dr logan told him that three persons only knew of his intentions to visit france and these three were mr jefferson mr genet and mr letombe that genets letters procured him his passport for paris mr woodward is of opinion that genet is still the principal conductor under hand of all the french affairs in this country i send the papers and these particulars to you that you and the other heads of department may make your reflections upon them the power of declaring war by the french constitution is vested in the two councils although the directory have made war upon switzerland rome and other powers without any declaration by the councils yet they may have reasons of prudence to restrain them towards the united states and complaisant as the councils may be supposed to be to the directory it may not be so easy to obtain from them a declaration of war against us the object of logan in his unauthorized embassy seems to have been to do or obtain something which might give opportunity for the true american character to blaze forth in the approaching elections is this constitutional for a party of opposition to send embassies to foreign nations to obtain their interference in elections logan told woodward that all was going very well in america the towns about boston were all petitioning against arming when the despatches arrived and     ruined all to such a degree that a jacobin was become infinitely more odious than ever a tory had been in the revolutionary war  timothy pickering   november      trenton john adams t pickering secretary of state to john adams private trenton   november      sir— i have been honored with your letter of the   th ultimo inclosing mr gerrys of the  0th i am sorry that i cannot comply with your proposition to have it inserted in a public print for i must then subjoin such remarks as will expose his quibbles and further wound his feelings i shall go further and display not his pusillanimity weakness and meanness alone but his duplicity and treachery you will start at the two last words i verily believe they are correctly applied and that the testimonies of general pinckney and general marshall whose veracity will not be questioned will support the imputation i verily believe sir that his conduct would warrant his impeachment and if he should not be impeached not his innocence but political expediency alone may prevent it if mr gerry should insist on the publication of his letter let him publish it himself i shall then take such notice of it as truth and the honor of my country require i am sir c timothy pickering     john adams    december      philadelphia elbridge gerry to elbridge gerry philadelphia    december      dear sir— i have received your favor of   th of november i sent your letter to me of the  0th of october from quincy to the secretary of state and requested him to publish it he has returned it to me and declines publishing it i return it to you inclosed as i think it will be attended with no good effect if i should publish it you will judge for yourself whether it is necessary for you to publish it my opinion and advice and request are that you would not because things stand at this time well enough but the publication of that letter may involve controversies that had better remain at rest although i am well satisfied that your conduct was upright and well intended yet i find that general marshall has left with colonel pickering his journal from day to day and your conduct as there represented will be very unpopular in several points your separate and secret conferences with talleyrand your advocating a stipulation for a loan to be paid after the war will do no good to you or to the public pinckney and marshall will attest to the correctness of the journal and will be believed indeed i do not know that there is any thing in it that you would deny at least i wish you to wait until you see the communications i shall make to congress i hope all will be still and calm i should hate to have any dispute excited about what is past my compliments to mrs gerry and the little family and believe me as ever your friend and servant john adams john adams    december      philadelphia william s smith to william s smith philadelphia    december      dear sir— before you receive this you will probably receive a letter from the secretary of war informing you that the general officers have proposed either you or mr hammond to be a lieutenantcolonel commandant this event has embarrassed me i know not what to do i know not whether the senate     will not negative the nomination if i make it nor whether you will accept the appointment if they should advise and consent to it upon this occasion i must be plain with you your pride and ostentation which i myself have seen with inexpressible grief for many years have excited among your neighbors so much envy and resentment that if they have to allege against you any instance of dishonorable and dishonest conduct as it is pretended they have you may depend upon it it will never be forgiven or forgotten he whose vanity has been indulged and displayed to the humiliation and mortification of others may depend on meeting their revenge whenever they shall find an opportunity for it they are now taking vengeance on you with a witness if i were to nominate you to any thing more than a regiment according to reports and spirit that prevail i have no doubt you would be again negatived by the senate if i nominate you to a regiment i still fear it will not pass it is a great misfortune to the public that the office i hold should be disgraced by a nomination of my soninlaw which the senate of the united states think themselves obliged to negative if the disgrace should be repeated it will be a serious thing to the public as well as to me and you and our children i pray you then to write me without loss of time whether you wish me to make the nomination and whether you will accept it if made and consented to  my love to my daughter and miss caroline     john jay   january      albany john adams john jay to john adams albany   january      dear sir— i this morning laid before the legislature of this state your answer to their address for the kind and honorable mention made of me in it be pleased to accept my warmest acknowledgments to be thus laudari a viro laudato and to receive such spontaneous and decided manifestations of sincere   0 and cordial esteem and friendship are events too interesting and pleasing not to excite correspondent emotions our affairs in relation to france are by too many thought to have assumed a less menacing aspect such and similar errors are and will be encouraged when the directory refused to receive and ungraciously dismissed general pinckney that singular measure viewed in all its relations led me to apprehend that the continuance of existing differences by putting them in capacity to elect war or peace with us according to future circumstances was deemed necessary to some of their meditated plans they must have foreseen that improper conduct towards our minister would impair their interest in the affections of this country and therefore i conclude that the object for which it was done must in their opinion have been of more importance than that sacrifice i presume that the rejection of our three envoys is imputable to the same motives and that the unexpected degree of indignation and irritation which it produced induced the directory to endeavor to moderate and restrain our resentments by pacific and delusory professions in order still to keep things in a state of perplexing uncertainty various circumstances and considerations incline me to think it not improbable that their views of domination comprehend all america both north and south and that they wish to place the united states in a situation favorable and auxiliary to those views considering the state of spain and even of portugal i ascribe the forbearance of france in not attempting to conquer and disorganize them to the obvious difficulty of embracing their american territories until she shall by war or by peace have withdrawn the british fleets from the ocean and if possible have rendered the united states compliant from the representations of their agents and partisans in this country the directory have doubtless entertained too sanguine expectations and from the firmness of our government and the general declarations of our people they may perceive that their calculations have not been accurate i nevertheless think it probable that they will continue to be in many respects deceived and that their efforts to deceive and seduce will continue unremitted while they persist in multiplying difficulties and complaints and aggressions and in repelling the negotiations     necessary to settle differences amicably it is impossible that their real designs can be otherwise than hostile you are called my dear sir to the government of this nation at a time when our peculiar circumstances and dangers demand the combined efforts of great talents great fortitude and great prudence your measures have hitherto afforded matter for brilliant pages in our history and they have inspired a confidence which will greatly facilitate the operation and success of your future ones with great and sincere respect esteem and affectionate regard c john jay john adams    january      timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state    january      the president of the united states requests the secretary of state to prepare the draught of a project of a treaty and a consular convention such as in his opinion might at this day be acceded to by the united states if proposed by france it is his desire that the secretary of state would avail himself of the advice and assistance of all the heads of department in the formation of this composition to be completed as soon as the pressure of other business of more immediate necessity will permit the necessity of inviolable confidence will be obvious  timothy pickering    january      john adams t pickering secretary of state to john adams private    january      sir— on examining the alterations you have directed in the report on mr gerrys communications one appears to me to     leave unfounded and unconnected many of my observations and on a very important point mr gerry in his letter of october  st has expressed an opinion of most mischievous tendency he says before the arrival of the despatches of the envoys the minister appeared to me sincere and anxious to obtain a reconciliation this strange opinion so repugnant to the whole tenor of his own communications will nevertheless be quoted by the enemies of our country in france as well as america in proof of the sincerity of the french government and lead many to propagate the idea that but for the imprudent act as they will call it of publishing the despatches a reconciliation might have taken place mr gerrys opinion as above expressed is also a reflection on the president on congress and on all who had any agency directly or indirectly in causing that publication as manifesting a want of prudence and foresight and hazarding a war between the two countries mr gerrys opinion is of so pernicious a tendency i conceived it to be my duty to combat it and demonstrate that it was unfounded not by an allusion but by a direct reference to it i therefore beg leave to submit this matter once more to your consideration before the new copy is completed his feelings and consequence in the community are of no moment in competion with the public interest and but for the latter i would gladly keep out of sight every thing indicating any error in his proceedings the passage in question i have thus expressed in the report   because mr gerry after all the demonstrative proofs of which he was possessed to the contrary says in his letter of  st october      before the arrival of the despatches of the envoys the minister appeared to me sincere and anxious to obtain a reconciliation this very extraordinary opinion is opposed not only by the whole detail of facts exhibited in the despatches of the envoys but by mr gerrys own correspondence several pages then follow contrasting the evidences of talleyrands sincerity before and after the publication of the despatches and having a direct reference to the passage in question the language may perhaps be softened but the substance     seems to me very important to retain it might have this form   because mr gerry in his letter of  st october      has expressed his opinion that before the arrival of the despatches of the envoys the minister appeared to him sincere and anxious to obtain a reconciliation an opinion which a candid examination of the despatches of the envoys and of mr gerrys own correspondence will show to be erroneous the president will see that three motives urge me to submit these thoughts to his attention one to counteract a mischievous opinion that has no foundation  dly to vindicate his honor and that of congress from the imputation of rashness or indiscretion in the publication of the despatches and  dly a desire that the secretarys report may appear connected and the train of reasoning through several pages have some relation to their proper object  i am c timothy pickering rufus king    january      london john adams rufus king to john adams london    january      dear sir— some weeks past i had the pleasure of receiving your letter of the   th of october  the inclosure was immediately forwarded though from the obstructions which interupted the passage to hamburgh i fear it was a long time on its way to berlin we are still uncertain what is likely to be the situation of europe during the approaching summer and on this topic i can only refer to my despatches to colonel pickering it would be     hardly decent to express what i think of the weakness corruption and indecision of most of the continental governments the aristocracies are as unwise and as base as their princes and if europe shall be rescued from the barbarism with which philosophy is about to overwhelm it it will be effected by the moderation and the virtues of the people who in spain italy and throughout germany are less guilty and more meritorious than their magistrates and rulers this is a melancholy prospect and one that may appall though it ought not to discourage the boldest minds the firmness courage and the resources of england joined to the docility of the people and to the wonderful ease with which the laws are adapted to the new and dangerous condition of surrounding circumstances are the highest eulogium of its constitution afford a rational hope of ultimate security and confirm what has been so well proved in the best work that has been written upon the intricate subject of government amidst this mighty storm it is my greatest pleasure and the source of the most gratifying pride to mark the increasing attention with which europe continues to observe and to applaud the able and dignified administration of the american government which in its open and manly proceedings towards france has not only done much for its own security but more for that of europe than many portions of it have had the courage to do themselves this homage is involuntary for everywhere throughout europe strong though illfounded prejudices existed against us and our institutions with unfeigned respect and attachment i am c rufus king john adams    february      philadelphia george washington to george washington philadelphia    february      dear sir— although i received the honor of your letter of the  st of this month  in its season i determined to postpone my answer to it till i had deliberated on it and the letter from barlow inclosed in it as well as a multitude of other letters and documents official and inofficial which relate to the same subject and determined what part to act i yesterday determined to nominate mr murray to be minister     plenipotentiary to the french republic this i ventured to do upon the strength of a letter from talleyrand himself giving declarations in the name of his government that any minister plenipotentiary from the united states shall be received according to the condition at the close of my message to congress of the   st of june last as there may be some reserves for chicane however murray is not to remove from his station at the hague until he shall have received formal assurances that he shall be received and treated in character barlows letter had i assure you very little weight in determining me to this measure i shall make few observations upon it but in my opinion it is not often that we meet with a composition which betrays so many and so unequivocal symptoms of blackness of heart the wretch has destroyed his own character to such a degree that i think it would be derogatory to yours to give any answer at all to his letter tom paine is not a more worthless fellow the infamous threat which he has debased himself to transmit to his country to intimidate you and your country that certain conduct will be followed by war and that it will be a war of the most terrible and vindictive kind ought to be answered by a mohawk if i had an indian chief that i could converse with freely i would ask him what answer he would give to such a gasconade i fancy he would answer that he would if they began their cruelties cut up every frenchman joint by joint roast him by a fire pinch off his flesh with hot pincers c i blush to think that such ideas should be started in this age  tranquillity upon just and honorable terms is undoubtedly the ardent desire of the friends of this country and i wish the     babyish and womanly blubbering for peace may not necessitate the conclusion of a treaty that will not be just nor very honorable i do not intend however that they shall there is not much sincerity in the cant about peace those who snivel for it now were hot for war against britain a few months ago and would be now if they saw a chance in elective governments peace or war are alike embraced by parties when they think they can employ either for electioneering purposes  with great respect and regard to you and your good lady and late miss custis i have the honor to be sir c john adams henry knox   march      boston john adams henry knox to john adams secret and confidential boston   march      my dear sir— although i have often entertained the intention of writing to you yet as i had nothing more to communicate than assurance of my sincere attachment and the warm approbation which appeared to possess the best mind of the great majority of the people i could not bring myself to intrude upon time so precious to your country but when your recent nominations to france seem for a moment to have divided in a degree the federal opinions and when sentiments are uttered by some subversive of the confidence which ought to be placed in our president i can no longer be silent i have no doubt uninformed as the public are that their entire reliance on your superior knowledge of the state of europe and wisdom to embrace every proper occasion will be perfectly satisfactory to ninetynine persons out of a hundred who are attached to the happiness glory and freedom of their country but the hundredth part or rather certain persons who have an influence over the mind of that part and who affect to suggest to correspond with and even to influence the conduct of certain characters in the executive departments loudly fault the measure of the nomination they say the most confidential     persons in the executive departments and in the legislature were not consulted and therefore the propriety of the measure may be questioned and they doubtless derive their information from the said persons who are in philadelphia the persons here who are mostly dissatisfied are the same styling themselves federalists who in the first instance expressed themselves with equal virulence against the british treaty they have had some influence but in the present case will find it more limited than formerly your knowledge of characters will readily suggest who they are the main object in writing this letter is to assure you with all possible sincerity of my perfect conviction that the great body of the federal interest confide implicitly in your knowledge and virtue that those qualities are fully adequate to the important existing crisis and that in every division of opinion they will adhere and cling to you in preference to all others in addition to this general opinion i may with humility say that the measure itself for many obvious reasons is one of the most dignified decisive and beneficial ever adopted by the chief magistrate of any nation soaring above all prejudice and regarding the happiness of the nation as the primary object of his administration and in the pursuit of which he nobly hazards his reputation until the mists of ignorance or party shall subside i am with sincere respect c henry knox points which on the   th of march      received the presidents assent as ultimata   that france should stipulate to indemnify the citizens of the united states for the spoliations committed on their commerce by the armed vessels and citizens of france and by the adjudication of her courts in prize causes   that as the vessels of the united states were not bound by treaty to have on board what the french call a rôle déquipage all captures and condemnations of american vessels and property for want of a rôle déquipage be considered as unlawful and null and that in submitting to a board of commissioners who may be appointed to adjust mutual claims all those arising from captures and condemnations for want of the rôle     déquipage be expressly excepted as not admitting of any dispute but for which compensation shall be made by france the only question concerning them being the amount of the damages sustained by american citizens to be ascertained in the manner to be agreed on   that the united states will not stipulate to guarantee any part of the dominions of france charles lee    march      philadelphia john adams c lee attorneygeneral to john adams philadelphia    march      dear sir— the inclosed from my friend marshall on wednesday last was received by me and it is with no small pleasure i find his opinion correspondent with my own respecting the appointment of murray you will perceive from the date that the subsequent modification of the embassy was not known to him when he wrote his letter being entirely of a private nature i should not have sent it to you but that i presume it will afford you satisfaction to know that a measure which excited so much agitation here has met the approbation of so good a judge as mr marshall  nothing new has been heard concerning the insurgents since you left the city the report of the marshal agrees substantially     with the letters and affidavit which were shown to you by the secretary of state on monday evening wishing you a safe journey c charles lee john adams    march      quincy charles lee to c lee attorneygeneral private quincy    march      sir— esteeming very highly the opinion and character of your friend general marshall i thank you for inclosing his letter of the  d of march in yours of the   th which i have received the nomination of murray has had one good effect at least it has shown to every observing and thinking man the real strength or weakness of the constitution and where one part of that weakness resides it has also produced a display of the real spirit of the parties in this country and the objects they have in view to me it has laid open characters some of these will do well to study a little more maturely the spirit of their stations but vanity has no limits arrogance shall be made to feel a curb if any one entertains the idea that because i am a president of three votes only i am in the power of a party they shall find that i am no more so than the constitution forces upon me if combinations of senators generals and heads of department shall be formed such as i cannot resist and measures are demanded of me that i cannot adopt my remedy is plain and certain i will try my own strength at resistance first however this is free and entre nous john adams    march      quincy james mchenry to j mchenry secretary of war quincy    march      sir— i have received in your favor of the   th major general pinckneys list arranged in concert with governor davie this list has my approbation and you may announce as soon as possible to the persons their appointments   0 i expect that all the vacancies in the army be first communicated to me and the candidates with their recommendations be transmitted to me before commissions are sent them or appointments announced to them inclosed is a letter from benjamin beale jr which i request you to consider he cannot accept a lieutenancy and i cannot blame him his age education travels manners and irreproachable character merit a captaincy if any one is vacant mr hastings has been with me i wish you to examine his recommendations and weigh his pretensions he is a warlikelooking officer and served the whole revolutionary war major lillie also has been here his merits must be attended to there is also a mr burbeck who must be provided for in the artillery he has talents and experience which no other man in the united states possesses in compositions which are important in that line of service a soldier from his birth he shall be so till his death if it depends on sir your most obedient servant john adams p s i return general pinckneys letter and list i desire too that mr barrons commission as captain of artillery be sent him immediately the new england officers i am told are impatient for their commissions i desire that all the commissions may be sent to the officers throughout the states without loss of time john adams   april      quincy benjamin stoddert to b stoddert secretary of the navy quincy   april      i have received your favor of the   th ultimo and have signed the commission to lieutenant haswell and sent it on with the letter to mr j c jones i return you the copies of captain truxtuns correspondence with general desfourneaux which is conducted on our part with dignity and propriety excepting perhaps that the respect to french property on board neutral vessels and to unarmed french vessels might as well have been concealed i thank you for your comfortable opinion that the insurrection     in northampton will be suppressed without bloodshed no intelligence could be so agreeable to me  john adams    april      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy    april      i regret that i cannot have an opportunity of receiving general maitland and colonel grant and conversing with them on several subjects of importance  they will i hope and presume communicate to you all that will be necessary for us to know relative to a certain topic but i wish to know their sentiments concerning surinam curaçao c and the neutral ports that harbor privateers cayenne too and even cuba are subjects of speculation in certain cases that are very supposable i hope mr kings public despatches to you were written in better spirits than his private letter to me you will please to return it to me mr king was you know at times a little subject to croaking i fear however in this case he has too much reason the people in europe see little difference between the new and the old state of things the highest and the lowest of mankind are desperately corrupt and wicked and the middling people are almost destroyed john adams    april      quincy james mchenry to j mchenry secretary of war quincy    april      sir— last night i received your favor of the  th the proceedings detailed in it appear to have been well considered and prudently pursued but the sordid spirit which produced this as well as the former insurrection in pennsylvania and which has given so much trouble to the government anxiety to the nation and burden on the treasury ought to excite more general     indignation than it has done i return all the papers and pray you to keep me informed of the progress of the business  inclosed is a letter from major badlam and mr h g otis recommending mr benjamin bass leeds to be a lieutenant for which i believe he is well qualified i wish that a plan may be considered for numbering the regiments and arranging the rank of the lieutenantcolonels commandants and sent to me for my consideration i think the best way will be to determine the rank of the lieutenantcolonels and number the regiments at first according to the number which designates the rank of their commanding officer this will be a good precedent to get rid of the practice which has too long prevailed of beginning at one extremity of the union and proceeding to the other john adams    april      quincy james mchenry to j mchenry secretary of war quincy    april      sir— i received yesterday your favor of the  th if there is no room for mr hastings as a major which i believe there is not you may consider whether there is place for him as a captain if there are not candidates of superior claims he may be offered a captaincy and if he declines that another may be appointed it is not upon the act of the  d of march ultimo that i ground the claim of an authority to appoint the officers in question but upon the constitution itself  whenever there is an office that is not full there is a vacancy as i have ever understood the constitution to suppose that the president has power to appoint judges and ambassadors in the recess of the senate and not officers of the army is to me a distinction without a difference and a constitution not founded in law or sense and     very embarrassing to the public service all such appointments to be sure must be nominated to the senate at their next session and subject to their ultimate decision i have no doubt that it is my right and my duty to make the provisional appointments major lillie has made me a visit and i was well pleased with his appearance and conversation he did not appear to me to be an altered man i learn from others that he has been like many worthy men extremely unfortunate in trade and his misfortunes have sometimes affected his spirits but an appointment in the army upon which his heart is set it is believed by colonel rice will restore him completely to himself there is some weight however in your objection that two majors are more than the proportion of one state with a view to this objection i wish to be informed of the candidates for his office from other states i wish to know whether the jonathan williams you mention is the gentleman who lived in france when i was there and now in macphersons house on the schuylkill if it is the same although i have not known much of his military character his other qualifications are respectable perkinss lieutenancy for burbeck i presume was on the supposition that himself should be captain and both stationary for life on the castle by all that i can learn burbeck is well qualified for a captaincy and has merited it if very long services without reproach are merit it is my intention that all the commissions shall be dated on the same day and that neither the officers from the carolinas and georgia nor any other officers shall lose any advantage in rank by the circumstance of others receiving their commissions sooner i do not intend however that any regulation of rank shall be made until it has been laid before me let especial care be taken that no directions concerning rank be given out by general officers until i shall have an opportunity to consider and approve them i congratulate you on general macphersons good conduct and success i have the honor c john adams inclosed is a letter from oliver whipple requesting to be a colonel which you will please to note among the applications     john adams    april      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy    april      sir— i received yesterday your favor of the  th with mr kings letters of the  0th and   th of january with the inclosure in the former these papers i have read with more than common interest and anxiety and however sanguine i may be in my disposition or prone to determine my judgment on the first view of a subject in this case i must own myself puzzled and in doubt the whole affair leads to the independence of the west india islands and although i may be mistaken it appears to me that independence is the worst and most dangerous condition they can be in for the united states they would be less dangerous under the government of england france spain or holland all together and least of all under the same powers in parcels or divisions as they are now this opinion however is liable to so much uncertainty that no great dependence can be placed upon it  upon the projects proposed by the british ministry a great number of questions arise  will not the projected partial limited and restrained independence of st domingo excite alarms and jealousies in spain and holland such as will attach them and subject them entirely to france and in denmark and sweden so as to make them more timid if not more complaisant to france will it not involve us in a more inveterate and durable hostility with france spain and holland and subject us more to the policy of britain than will be consistent with our interest or honor these questions may all be useless because the independence of st domingo and consequently of all the other islands in the west indies and of the spanish dutch and portuguese possessions on the continent     may be brought about without our interference and indeed in opposition to all we can do to prevent it the project of a joint company is certainly liable to all the objections which occurred to mr king and although the english government would meet with no difficulty we should certainly find it very difficult to manage my own ideas are these  st that it would be most prudent for us to have nothing to do in the business  d that if we should meddle we had better leave the independence of the island complete and total in commerce as well as legislation to the people who assert it the inhabitants of the island  d that if this is not the sense of the english we had better leave the whole management of the affair to them  th that if they think fit they may stipulate that we shall have a right to accede to the treaty they make when we can within a certain period of one two or three years  th that we should accede to it provided the senate advise and consent as soon as it shall be determined that no negotiation with france is likely to take place with effect  th that we remain faithful to our promise to open our commerce with the island as soon as privateering shall cease  th although these are my prevailing opinions and inclinations i am by no means fixed in them or bigoted to them  th i wish you to consult the heads of department upon all these points and if any other principles are more agreeable to them and you i shall be disposed to concur in any rational expedient which can be reconciled to justice and sound policy which may be concerted with mr liston      john adams    april      quincy benjamin adams to

impossible for me to appoint my own relations to any thing without drawing forth a torrent of obloquy if i were to nominate him without previous recommendations from the senators and representatives

your other favor of the   th contains matter of more importance i own that the navy has not afforded to our commerce that complete protection which might have been expected from it considering the vast inferiority of all the french force both of public and private ships in the west indies although i would never hurt the feelings of officers or excite questions which might affect their reputations or move suspicions without necessity yet i am prepared to agree to your arrangement about nicholson  i am not yet prepared to say whether talbot or sever or some other ought to be appointed to command the constitution talbot i am told was not bred a seaman though an excellent officer i apprehend that ship wants an officer of complete nautical skill uriah forrest    april      georgetown john adams uriah forrest to john adams georgetown    april      dear sir— i feel how improper it is in so inconsiderable an individual as i am to be intruding on your time much more obtruding opinions and advice i shall however hazard your censure and be guilty of the impropriety which stares me in the face i feel how much the happiness of this country depends on the confidence the people have in the government and i feel that yourself must be the rallying point of confidence the public sentiment is very much against your being so much away from the seat of government from a conviction that when you are there the public vessel will be properly steered and that these critical times require an experienced pilot the people elected you to administer the government they did not elect your officers nor do they however much they respect them think     them equal to govern without your presence and control in a country like ours when the people get divided into parties as we have become there will always be found men on the governing side not satisfied with their proper share of power and who getting yielded to them more than is their due increase in their own consequence and claims until they fancy themselves exclusively entitled to direct are we free from such characters are there not even in the soundest states in the union men of influence and fair fame not at all tinctured with jacobinism but filled with a certain kind of ambition who believe that with some other person as chief magistrate they would have more power than with the present i hope the influence of such men has not reached any of the departments of government i speak the truth when i say that your real friends wish you to be with your officers because the public impression is that the government will be better conducted i have sincerely regretted mrs adamss indisposition and now as sincerely rejoice to learn that she has recovered you will not think of bringing her into philadelphia though it would give me great pleasure to hear you were about going to take her to some healthy situation in the neighborhood of it i wish the time had arrived for you to remove here where i am sure mrs adams would be very much benefited by the healthiness of the situation i hope you will pardon this liberty i can have no motive that is personal to myself i feel as every man ought to feel for the public happiness i believe that the seeds of more than two parties in this country have been scattered but i trust they will not sprout i am sure it is in your power alone to prevent their growth and i must add that you owe it to the public to prevent it in thus adding i am not unmindful of the great debt which the public owe to you  i have the honor to be c uriah forrest     john

 when i first read this i was apprehensive that some embarrassment might soon arise in consequence of it we have given our word that the commerce should be open by proclamation as soon as privateering should be suppressed in the island and the fulfilment of our promise may be claimed but on further consideration i hope and presume that general   0 maitland will settle this point without any difficulty to us i am very glad that you did not detain general maitland till you could hear from me upon the whole i think the negotiation has been conducted with caution and prudence and the result

last war or in any other war are only to be taken into consideration as presumptive evidence of merit and may at any time be set aside by contrary proof services and rank in civil life and in time of peace i think ought not to be forgotten or neglected for they are often of more utility and consequence to the public than military services the officers i think ought not to be flattered with any positive assurance of rising in succession the right authority and duty of government to depart from the line of succession     in clear cases of unusual merit of extraordinary services or uncommon talent ought always to be asserted and maintained and constantly to be held up to the view of the army inclosed is a letter from joseph woodward recommending baldwin and brown to be lieutenants

pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy   may      i have received in your letter of the  0th april the very handsome apology of mr henry and the letter of chief justice ellsworth from halifax of march   st in several conversations with judge ellsworth i mentioned to him governor davie as one among several whom i had in contemplation to appoint in the place of governor henry if he should decline as was apprehended by many the character of this gentleman for abilities integrity and sound political principles inclined my judgment in his favor although personally a stranger to me i am very glad the chief justice communicated the idea to him and that he has not rejected it i pray you to make out his commission and send it to him and communicate the intelligence to mr murray as soon as possible i return you the letters of the chief justice and mr henry the latter of which i think you would do well to publish patrick henry    april      virginia inclosed patrick henry to the secretary of state charlotte city virginia    april      sir— your favor of the   th ultimo did not reach me till two days ago i have been confined for several weeks by a     severe indisposition and am still so sick as to be scarcely able to write this my advanced age and increasing debility compel me to abandon every idea of serving my country where the scene of operation is far distant and her interests call for incessant and long continued exertion conscious as i am of my inability to discharge the duties of envoy c to france to which by the commission you send me i am called i herewith return it i cannot however forbear expressing on this occasion the high sense i entertain of the honor done me by the president and senate in the appointment and i beg you sir to present me to them in terms of the most dutiful regard assuring them that this mark of their confidence in me at a crisis so eventful is an agreeable and flattering proof of their consideration towards me and that nothing short of an absolute necessity could induce me to withhold my little aid from an administration whose ability patriotism and virtue deserve the gratitude and reverence of all their fellowcitizens with sentiments of very high regard c p henry john adams   may      quincy benjamin stoddert to b stoddert secretary of the navy quincy   may      the combination of a very few ideas has been sufficient to excite apprehensions that the west india islands would soon become a scene of piracy the dissolution of all principles of morals government and religion the formal repeal of the ten commandments by which it is become as lawful to covet steal kill as it is to profane the sabbath or commit adultery the proclamation of liberty to the negroes in the west india islands and the policy of one or more nations of europe to erect predatory powers in the west indies to be employed against the united states as the barbary powers in europe have long been supported and encouraged against the small maritime states have long ago raised suspicions and forebodings that the most desperate wretches in europe would be allured to the islands and give direction to the mass of african bones and sinews which is now in liberty and idleness or trained to military discipline     the buccaneering establishment on the key near matanzas must be broken up i wish the secretary of state to represent this intelligence to the spanish minister at philadelphia and to our minister at madrid i am glad the secretary of state intends to write to the governor of the havana i am heartily disposed to concur with you in the most spirited counsels and active exertions which the laws will authorize to check and to punish this execrable establishment  timothy pickering  0 may      philadelphia john adams t pickering secretary of state to john adams philadelphia  0 may      sir— i have the honor to inclose mr listons note of the  th requesting the usual exequatur for thomas barclay esq and benjamin moodie esq whom his britannic majesty has appointed the former consulgeneral for the eastern states and the latter consul for north and south carolina and georgia mr barclay is the gentleman who was the british commissioner for settling the question of the st croix boundary regularly the commissions of those gentlemen should be produced the allowance of the exequaturs being predicated on the inspection of the consuls commissions after a very indulgent but fatiguing trial of nine days during which the jury were kept together of john fries on a charge of high treason the jury at ten oclock last evening brought in their verdict guilty i have just learned that the jury decided without debate or the least difference in sentiment i before knew that the two judges were perfectly agreed as to the treasonable matter and the guilt of the prisoner the prompt verdict of the jury is the more remarkable as there were two or three of them in the party in opposition to the government but the nature of friess offence and the evidence of his guilt were so clear as to     remove or prevent doubt in the mind of every impartial man thus the case is represented to me for i was not present at the trial the length of the trial was owing chiefly to the examinations of many witnesses a number of whom being germans interpreters were necessary this conviction is of the highest importance to vindicate the violated laws and support the government it was therefore anxiously expected by the real friends to the order and tranquillity of the country and to the stability of its government among such men i have heard of but one opinion that an example or examples of conviction and punishment of such high handed offenders were essential to ensure future obedience to the laws or the exertions of our best citizens to suppress future insurrections the examples appear singularly important in pennsylvania where treason and rebellion have so repeatedly reared their heads and painful as is the idea of taking the life of a man i feel a calm and solid satisfaction that an opportunity is now presented in executing the just sentence of the law to crush that spirit which if not overthrown and destroyed may proceed in its career and overturn the government with great respect c c timothy pickering oliver wolcott    may      philadelphia john adams o wolcott secretary of the treasury to john adams philadelphia    may      sir— after a very labored trial fries who led the armed party at bethlehem has been convicted of treason he continued tranquil until the verdict of the jury was returned when and since he has been much affected his composure during the trial was not owing to stupidity for though an illiterate man he is not deficient in sagacity he confidently expected to be acquitted and his hopes are supposed to have been founded on the opinion of mr lewis who on all occasions since the commencement of the trial has declared that the offence did not amount to treason both of the judges were decided in their definitions of the crime and the evidence was complete both as to the acts done and of the intention to prevent the execution of the law it is admitted on all hands that the trial has been     fair and impartial the jury was respectable and two of them were persons upon the bias of whose political sentiments calculations favorable to the prisoner were made the jury received the charge at about six oclock in the evening when the court adjourned till ten at the time appointed the verdict was returned guilty i am told this morning of a circumstance which proves that the jury were governed by humane delicate and honorable sentiments when they retired it was agreed that without previous argument among themselves the opinion of each person should be given by ballot by this trial it was found that the jury were unanimous thus has ended a trial which has excited the greatest attention and upon the issue of which the tranquillity of this part of the country has greatly depended fries said after the trial to mr wood one of the chief clerks of my office who is also a clerk of the prison that great men were at the bottom of this business i do not know his meaning b mcclenachan of the house of representatives was certainly an agitator among the insurgents but i do not know nor do i believe that the insurgents had any general views other than to defeat the execution of the act of assessment in general the people are ignorant strongly prejudiced against the measures of government vindictive in their resentments and i fear incapable of being influenced except by their fears of punishment i have the honor c oliver wolcott john adams    may      quincy uriah forrest to uriah forrest quincy    may      i received on saturday your friendly letter of    april and i thank you for it and should be very happy if it were in my power to comply with your advice not so much on account of any real public utility as in compliance with what you call the public sentiment i have reason to believe however that this sentiment is chiefly in philadelphia and georgetown the people elected me to administer the government it is true and i do administer it here at quincy as really as i could do at philadelphia the secretaries of state treasury war navy     and the attorneygeneral transmit me daily by the post all the business of consequence and nothing is done without my advice and direction when i am here more than when i am in the same city with them the post goes very rapidly and i answer by the return of it so that nothing suffers or is lost your speculative conjectures concerning the views of parties on the chief seat of the synagogue are founded in human nature in attentive observation of life and on actual facts what then they give me no anxiety mrs adams it is true is better but she is still in a state so delicate and has such returns of that dreadful disorder which kept her on the brink of the grave almost all the last summer that it would be a presumptuous imprudence little less criminal than deliberate suicide for her to attempt to go one hundred miles south of this latitude before the violent heat of summer shall be passed  john adams john adams    may      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy    may      sir— i have received your favor of the  th and considered the copy of instructions to mr king  which have been examined and unanimously approved by the heads of department i am very well satisfied with them on the whole though i wish that in the tenth article you would introduce another idea in corroboration  as a principal means of annoying a maritime nation     would be our privateers so our strongest motive and fullest justification for using it would be that our extensive commerce spreading and branching all over the seas is more exposed than that of any other nation to depredations both of pirates and maritime powers i pray you to send a copy of these instructions to mr adams at berlin and give him fresh instructions to agree with prussia and sweden both in this instruction relative to the article of contraband of war or to agree to the old article of contraband in our former treaties with those powers i am determined to make no farther difficulty with either of these powers about the article of contraband provided they will agree to the old one as i presume you have a copy of your draught of instructions to mr king i shall keep the one you inclosed to me john adams    may      quincy james mchenry to j mchenry secretary of war quincy    may      sir— i have received your letter of the  th may and since there appears a difference of opinion concerning the construction of the constitution and the law  and as i see no necessity for an immediate appointment i am content to suspend it for the present perhaps till the meeting of the senate i think well of mr williams as a gentleman of science and literature as a good citizen and brave man but his military knowledge is new to me i wish to know if in early life he was one of paddocks artillery company at present i am much     inclined to appoint him or rather nominate him as major and the others as captains as you have proposed i am happy in an opportunity to appoint mr izard as well as mr barron my sentiments of lillie you know and ragsdales recommendations are of the first and best kind inclosed are all the papers returned john adams    may      quincy james mchenry to j mchenry secretary of war quincy    may      i have received your favor of the  0th and have read the letter of brigadiergeneral macpherson to you of the  d and the letters of mr chapman and mr eyerly to him with great pleasure i pray you to present to general macpherson and the officers and troops under his command in the late expedition  my thanks for the prudence caution fortitude and perseverance with which they have conducted this service so necessary to their country although undoubtedly disagreeable to a happy and successful conclusion this you will do in any manner and at any time which you shall judge most proper and convenient i return you all the papers as proper to be lodged in your office john adams    may      quincy charles lee to c lee attorneygeneral quincy    may      i thank you for your favor of the  0th i am told that mr lewis is of opinion that friess crime amounts not to treason can you give me a minute of his reasons      john adams    may      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy    may      i last night received your favor of the  0th mr listons note of the  th was not inclosed as you intended mr barclay i know and his exequatur will be ready mr moodie i know not nor do i know or suspect any objection to him i thank you for the account of the trial of fries which if it was attended to by as numerous a concourse of people in philadelphia as it would have been in some other parts of the united states must have made a deep and lasting and extensive impression on the public mind the issue of this investigation has opened a train of very serious contemplations to me which will require the closest attention of my best understanding and will prove a severe trial to my heart the motifs des guerres c are received john adams    may      quincy a st clair to a st clair governor of the n w territory quincy    may      sir— i thank you for your favor of april  th and especially for the pamphlet inclosed with it i have read it with great pleasure as a masterly refutation of its antagonist in the style and manner of a gentleman and seasoned with no more than was useful and agreeable of attic salt happy am i to find such just sentiments countenanced encouraged and prevailing in the northwestern territory although your wish that my writings were more generally read is very flattering to me i am nevertheless not very confident that they will do much good mankind will not learn wisdom by experience in matters of government they get rid of all such systems by slight sarcasms   0 and say that theory is in favor of democracy i say that theory is altogether in favor of mixed governments as well as experience but i am not about to write a lecture john adams    may      quincy oliver wolcott to o wolcott secretary of the treasury quincy    may      i thank you sir for your favor of the   th which i received last night the termination of the trial of fries is an important an interesting and an affecting event i am unable to conjecture the grounds of mr lewiss opinion and wish i had a sketch of them is fries a native or a foreigner is he a man of property and independent or is he in debt what has been his previous life industrious or idle sober or intemperate it is of importance to discover if possible the great men alluded to by fries in his observation to mr wood as at the bottom of this business and the evidence of any agitation among the insurgents ought to be collected it is of moment also to ascertain whether the insurgents had any general views or extensive communication with others of similar dispositions in other counties or correspondence with other states we ought also to inquire whether fries is the most culpable among the guilty if that can be known it highly concerns the people of the united states and especially the federal government that in the whole progress and ultimate conclusion of this affair neither humanity be unnecessarily afflicted nor public justice essentially violated nor the public safety endangered john adams    may      quincy benjamin stoddert to b stoddert secretary of the navy quincy    may      sir— i have received your favor of the  0th and read mr sewalls latter of   th april and your answer  the reasoning in the latter is so satisfactory that i have determined to send it on to mr sewall tomorrow nevertheless i think with you that some of our fast sailing vessels might be employed to     advantage in a cruise on the coasts of spain and france during the hurricane season in the west indies nor do i think we ought to wait a moment to know whether the french mean to give us any proofs of their desire to conciliate with us i am for pursuing all the measure of defence which the laws authorize us to adopt especially at sea with as much zeal and to as great an extent as if we knew the first vessels would bring a declaration of war against us from paris john adams    may      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy    may      sir— your favor of the   th is received i have no doubt that an offence committed on board a public ship of war on the high seas is committed within the jurisdiction of the nation to whom the ship belongs how far the president of the united states would be justifiable in directing the judge to deliver up the offender is not clear  i have no objection to advise and request him to do it i am quite of your opinion of the prudence of withholding from the public mr henrys letter and not insisting on governor davies formal acceptance at present for the reason you adduce  i think however we ought to be informed that he will accept when his acceptance shall become indispensable     john adams    may      quincy william s smith to william s smith quincy    may      i have received your letter of the   th and the bundle of papers inclosed with a great deal of pain the thing has not a good appearance mr shieflin would have done better to have addressed his letter and papers to me than to you who are not the secretary of war  you are suspected and have been accused of improper speculations in the neighborhood of detroit and in connection with characters whose friendship does you no honor these indian pretensions are suspected to have been excited by you and your associates i send you back all the papers if you will take upon yourself to send them to the secretary of war you may i will not if you desire the command of detroit you must solicit it of the secretary at war the commanderinchief of the army or majorgeneral hamilton i will not interfere with the discipline and order of the army because you are my soninlaw john adams    may      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy    may      sir— i received last night your favor of the   th the misfortune of the hero is much to be regretted  the necessary orders i presume will be despatched to her at jamaica but i am not sufficiently informed of her situation to be able to judge what those orders ought to be the anonymous letter you inclosed is curious enough if it is required of me to procure satisfaction for every family ruined by the french upon pain of assassination i believe mr assassin may do his work      charles lee    may      philadelphia john adams c lee attorneygeneral to john adams philadelphia    may      sir— i had the honor to receive your letter of the   th but not having been present at the trial of fries it was not in my power to give you a minute of mr lewiss reasons for the opinion that the crime of fries was not treason without applying to mr rawle on the subject who has given me a short note of which a copy is inclosed  the reasons were thought by the court insufficient and so they seem also to me you have no doubt been informed that a new trial has been granted to fries i understand that after the conviction it became known to the prisoners counsel that one of the jury had on several occasions expressed that he thought fries and all concerned with him deserved to be hanged this judge iredell conceived to be enough to show that the juror was disqualified to pass upon the prisoner judge peters was of a different opinion but ultimately concurred in it rather than to allow the condemnation to rest on his own judgment  mr carpenter who takes the debates of congress in short hand has taken all the proceedings on this trial which are in the press and will speedily be published a copy shall be transmitted for your more particular information so soon as it shall be in my power with perfect respect i am sir c charles lee     john adams    may      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy    may      sir— i received yesterday your favor of the   st i thank you for the intelligence and rejoice that our affairs with algiers are no worse your other letter of the same date arrived at the same time i have read the papers relative to mr daniel hawley and agree with you in opinion that there is evidence of unskilfulness in business at least enough to justify us in looking for a more adroit consul or agent or both in havana a place of great importance to us i return all the papers i also return the paper relative to ferdinand stevenson and his pardon the judgment of judge griffin and the secretary of the treasury acquiesced in by you will be sufficient to justify me in this kind of work  which is always so easy and pleasant that we may be sometimes in danger of doing too much of it john adams   june      quincy james mchenry to j mchenry secretary of war quincy   june      sir— i have received your favor of the   th may and have read the inclosures the discipline of the army will require the punishment of death for desertion in many cases and none perhaps will deserve it more than that of richard hunt and i should not hesitate to sign the warrant for his execution serious as is the act of depriving a fellow of his life but i wish to know whether the officers who composed the courtmartial were commissioned and if not what evidence we shall rely upon of the appointments in case the legality of this business should be examined by a grand jury  i wish the members of courtsmartial would consider themselves     counsel for the prisoner and admonish him against the plea of guilty and even assert that if he persists in it they would still examine witnesses to the fact of desertion  john adams   june      quincy benjamin stoddert to b stoddert secretary of the navy quincy   june      i thank you for the details in your favor of the   th may captain truxtun has deserved well of his country and will as he ought have their thanks as well as yours and mine but i should have been much easier on account of the safety of our commerce if he had remained longer in the west indies the merrimac has been detained by contrary winds but i believe is now gone talbot has arrived and came up in his boat to see me i was rejoiced at the sight of him and have full confidence in his capacity and activity his appointment to the command gives good satisfaction as i am informed we shall do nothing with st domingo until we hear again from stevens the annihilation of privateering in the island must be an indispensable condition of future intercourse we can do nothing but in concert with maitland and what his reception may be is uncertain the english in my opinion have made much mischief for themselves as well as for us in that island the hopes of our merchants of great profit from the trade will be found too sanguine and the evils in store seem not to be foreseen john adams   june      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy   june      sir— i return you all the letters of mr king and mr humphreys which were inclosed with your letter of may  0th encourage mr king i pray you in your letters and instructions to him to persevere with all the decision which may be consistent with decency and politeness in denying the right of     british menofwar to take from our ships of war any men whatever and from our merchant vessels any americans or foreigners or even englishmen there is no principle under heaven by which they can justify taking by force even from an american merchant vessel even a deserter from their army or navy much less private seamen if they have a right we have the same i know not whether the exercise of it would not be most useful to us their merchant ships are more numerous than ours and they have more foreigners swedes italians portuguese spaniards danes dutch c than we have if our menofwar had a right to take them we might easily man our navy but the thing has no principle john adams    june      quincy james mchenry to j mchenry secretary of war quincy    june      i return you the papers inclosed in your letter of the  st i have carefully read the proceedings of the courtmartial on ensign david fero it will be necessary for the legislature at their next session to make some provisions for cases of standing mute the best possible jurisprudence in this case in my opinion is to order the refusal to plead to be recorded and then proceed to trial in all respects as if the defendant had pleaded not guilty i would not even refuse to hear him in his own defence or by counsel and would swear and examine all witnesses and admit every species of evidence in his favor offered by himself or any of his friends as freely and fully as upon the general issue i should have been better pleased if the courtmartial had extended all this patience and candor to mr fero the result would i believe have been the same however and although i do not see my way clear to confirm the sentence of the courtmartial  i have no scruple to conform to your opinion and dismiss ensign david fero from the service     john adams    june      quincy oliver wolcott to o wolcott secretary of the treasury quincy    june      sir— inclosed is a petition from john sylvester for a pardon a copy of the record of his conviction a petition which he presented to governor sumner and a certificate and request signed by a large number of respectable and worthy citizens of plymouth in his favor my answer to his relation who brought me the petition was that the crime was of so serious a nature that whatever might be my disposition i dared not to pardon it without serious deliberation and the best advice i promised him however to transmit the papers to the secretary of the treasury and attorneygeneral and request their opinions this promise i now perform by praying you to take the opinion of the heads of department if you think it necessary or at least of the attorneygeneral and transmit to me the result of your and their deliberations if you should recommend a pardon i request you to send one on for signature to sir c  john adams john adams    june      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy    june      sir— i received yesterday your important letter of the  th the form of a proclamation is sufficient i believe for the purpose and i have signed it that it may be completed and published at a proper season without loss of time i am glad the heads of department did not form a definitive opinion on the very important question whether it will be expedient to renew the commerce without a concurrence of the british  my judgment inclines the same way at present with theirs but we had better wait for further information i am afraid that the jealousy and avidity of the english will do an     injury to themselves as well as to us but we cannot help it my opinion is that if the powers of st domingo will not admit british ships of war or commerce into their ports the british government ought to be contented with sufficient assurances of the neutrality of that island during the war between england and france and not insist on defeating the connection between the united states and st domingo it is my earnest desire however to do nothing without the consent concert and coöperation of the british government in this case they are so deeply interested that they ought to be consulted and the commerce of the island is not worth to us the risk of any dispute with them no time ought to be lost in transmitting to dr stevens instructions concerning the part he is to act and the language he ought to hold i fully agree with you and the heads of department in the opinion of the propriety of the sentiments suggested by you to be communicated to him dr stevenss letters public and private have opened the politics of st domingo in a very intelligible manner the whole is so natural that it is easily to be believed john adams    june      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy    june      sir— i received last night your favor of the   th which with all its inclosures shall be sent to the attorney of the district that he may investigate the facts and make report to me every complaint of the kind from the british minister shall be treated with great respect and examined with the utmost candor  being from inclination as well as a sense of duty disposed to cultivate the best understanding as well as to do ample justice in all cases to his nation john adams    june      quincy john davis to john davis district attorney of massachusetts quincy    june      sir— inclosed is a letter from the secretary of state of the   th of june a note of the british minister to him of the   th     a copy of instructions for the private armed vessels of the united states and of the act further to protect the commerce of the united states and a blank copy of a bond i pray you sir to make inquiry into this transaction and to inform the owners of the ships complained of and make report to me and also to return me the papers when you have made the use of them you may have occasion for as it is my determination to demand of the british government satisfaction for all insults and injuries committed by british subjects on american citizens natural equity as well as sound policy requires that i should do all in my power to give satisfaction when insults and injuries are committed by american citizens on british subjects by punishing the authors of them john adams    june      quincy james mchenry to j mchenry secretary of war quincy    june      sir— i return you the selection of two majors from north carolina and that of officers for south carolina and georgia with the letters of generals pinckney and washington with that of mr steele i am satisfied with these recommendations and approve the selections i return the proceedings of the courtmartial in the cases of the deserters the absolute necessity of examples in such cases as that of richard hunt is very deeply impressed on my mind and i should not dare to pardon him if the proceedings are all regular by the constitution the president has power by and with the advice of the senate to appoint officers and by the same constitution the president shall commission all the officers of the united states a question occurred to me whether the signature of the commission is not the act of appointment and whether any other evidence of appointment will be admitted by the courts of law in short whether there can be an officer without a commission i pray you to lay the proceedings of the courtmartial and the foregoing constitutional questions before the heads of department and request their opinions if they are unanimous i shall order the execution i have interlined six words in the form of the warrant which i return i should be sorry that such an instrument should go out of my hands with my signature to it with any   0 interlineations if you return a fair copy to me with the advice of your colleagues i shall sign it john adams    june      quincy oliver wolcott to o wolcott secretary of the treasury quincy    june      sir— in your letter of the   th you hint that attempts are making to draw into question the solidity of the public credit but you have not explained the particulars and i am at a loss to conjecture the facts which you may allude to  public credit can never be steady and really solid without a fixed medium of commerce that we have not such a medium you know has been my opinion for several years the fluctuations of our circulating medium have committed greater depredations upon the property of honest men than all the french piracies to what greater lengths this evil may be carried i know not the massachusetts legislature are authorizing a number of new banks the cry is the immense advantage to agriculture credit cannot be solid where a man is liable to be paid a debt contracted today by one half the value a year hence john adams    june      quincy james mchenry to j mchenry secretary at war quincy    june      sir— i have received your letter of the   th and have read count rumfords letter to mr king for five or six years past i have been attentive to the character of this gentleman and have read some of his essays from these i have formed an esteem for his genius talents enterprise and benevolence which will secure him from me in case of his return to his native country a reception as kind and civil as it may be in my power to give him but you know the difficulties those gentlemen have who left the country as he did either to give or receive entire satisfaction i should not scruple however to give him any of the appointments you mention  and leave it with you     to make such proposals to him through mr king within the limits you have drawn in your letter as you should think fit i return mr kings letter and inclose one from mr william williams a very respectable personage recommending rufus tyler to be an officer in the army john adams   july      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy   july      sir— i thank you for the favor of your letter of   th june and the copies inclosed of despatches from stevens and maitland which i suppose it is unnecessary for me to return the necessary alterations in the proclamation  will of course be made by you with the advice of the heads of department harmony with the english in all this business with st domingo is the thing i have most at heart the result of the whole is in my mind problematical and precarious toussaint has evidently puzzled himself the french government the english cabinet and the administration of the united states all the rest of the world know as little what to do with him as he knows what to do with himself his example may be followed by all the islands french english dutch and spanish and all will be one day played off against the united states by european powers i think we have committed one great mistake in exchanging prisoners with guadaloupe we have lent a thousand men to that island some of whom have been taken three times by our cruisers we should soon exhaust the islands of seamen if we brought all to america john adams   july      quincy benjamin stoddert to b stoddert secretary of the navy quincy   july      inclosed is a letter from the president and professor of divinity of our university recommending william frothingham to be a chaplain on board of some frigate i know not whether the     commanders of our ships have given much attention to this subject but in my humble opinion we shall be very unskilful politicians as well as bad christians and unwise men if we neglect this important office in our infant navy john adams   july      quincy james mchenry to j mchenry secretary of war quincy   july      sir— as it is an excellent principle for every man in public life to magnify his office and make it honorable i admire the dexterity with which you dignify yours by representing an army and means adequate to its support as the first thing necessary to make the nation respected genius in a general is oftener an instrument of divine vengeance than a guardian angel stoddert i warrant you instead of representing the navy as the fourth and last article necessary for national respectability would have felt the importance of his office enough to have stated a navy as the first and most indispensable it would not be necessary for me to decide the controversy between you if it should be i should be at no loss my answer would be ready i have read the plan for providing and issuing of military supplies inclosed in your favor of the   th of june i suppose i may keep it in order to recur to it upon occasion i wish to be informed whether this is proposed to be adopted by congress into a law i presume the presidents authority alone is not adequate to the establishment of it i wish it to be considered by the secretary of the treasury and by yourself as closely as possible before it is recommended the discipline of the army and the national economy are deeply interested in it the secretary of state has had experience which ought to be consulted upon this occasion      john adams   july      quincy silas talbot to silas talbot quincy   july      sir— i have this moment received your favor of this days date by mr tarbell and had before received your note i can give no answer to any of your propositions nor determine any thing concerning officers or men until i know who is to command the constitution your refusal to accept the commission has ruined all my designs it was altogether unexpected to me i know not the facts at present with precision enough to decide between your pretensions and those of captain truxtun if i must appoint captain little i must appoint all his officers or at least consult him which of them to take with him and which to remove from the constitution if i should appoint sever i must do the same i know of no other captain at hand in short i see no possibility of getting the constitution to sea unless you go in her under a fortnight or three weeks if so soon if she must remain in harbor so long it will be better to send the boston to sea and complete her crew out of the constitution but in this case i cannot appoint little to the command of the constitution it will be impossible for me to arrange any thing without a personal conference with you if you would accept the commission altered so as to leave the question of rank undecided to be determined hereafter by a council of officers this should be done assurances have been given you as i understand by mr stoddert that you should not be ordered to serve with truxtun without absolute necessity these assurances i am willing to confirm i am however fully of opinion that i must see you before i can do any thing if you cannot come here i would meet you anywhere but it will take time and trouble to concert time and place so that i believe you had better come here if you can tomorrow morning as early as possible or next day or leave it till thursday i have this day forwarded to captain little his sailing orders     and instructions received only this morning from the secretary of the navy if he is completely ready in all other respects i am willing to fill up his complement from the constitution but the service on which the constitution is ordered is at least as pressing as the other and perhaps more so i have the honor to be with great esteem john adams john adams   july      quincy benjamin stoddert to b stoddert secretary of the navy quincy   july      sir— the constitution  employs my thoughts by day and my dreams by night captain talbot has written to you in his letter of the  th of june which i return his candid and impartial opinions according to the information he received but beale was absent by the advice of his physicians and hull was present i mean no insinuation by this against mr hull whose character is in my mind fair and his conduct irreproachable no lieutenant in the service stands fairer in my mind  but i see no reason for discouraging beale by turning him out of the ship for i believe him to be equal to hull in every respect even in age i believe beale to have had great injustice done him by little passions and a miserable caprice which i will not explain at present because i shall probably though not certainly consent to his removal more because he and his father grandfather and greatgrandfather have been my neighbors and to avoid suspicion of partiality for that cause than for any other reason  mr knox i have made a lieutenant with an express condition that he should not serve on board this ship mr pitts resignation i have requested captain talbot to accept so that the midshipmen will now be according to his mind i would have no great difficulty with midshipmen or lieutenants there is not one among them i would not instantly remove if the service could be benefited by it but the refusal of talbot to accept his commission is a serious affair it was wholly unexpected to me i supposed he had his commission     before and that all was settled you have not laid the papers before me i can only judge of the pretensions of truxtun and talbot or talbot and truxtun by the general idea i have of the times and circumstances of their appointments in some of which i may be mistaken talbot says there are captains at hand i know not to whom he alludes unless they are sever and little but the devil has been at work with his malignant whispers about sever as well as about beale and the merchants of boston expect that little will be the nelson of the united states and they will be very loth to release him pardon the impunity  of the expression talbot is very satisfactory to officers and men to the merchants and politicians of boston and the state and the loss of him will occasion a very serious alarm i would go on board the ship every day and converse with talbot but custom requires that the welkin must be rended and the world alarmed if i set my foot on board and talbot cannot leave the ship as to dobel i have not yet found one human being who reports in his favor i have employed as independent and impartial men as the world affords to sound the opinions of merchants and others and not one word of approbation of his appointment has yet reached me talman although he has his appointment of lieutenant shall not go on board of this ship against the judgment of the officers his character is respectable but his talent for command is doubted by others as well as those who spoke of him to talbot with great anxiety on account of this ship i am c john adams john adams    july      quincy james mchenry to j mchenry secretary of war quincy    july      i have received your letter of the  th of this month and have read the letter from majorgeneral hamilton and the proceedings of the courtmartial in the case of joseph perkins all circumstances considered i think this instance the least capable of a pardon of any which has been laid before me i have thought it my duty to sign the warrant for his execution and return it inclosed with all the other papers my own opinion     is that a commission is not the exclusive evidence of appointments to office but as chicanery may start popular objections if the heads of department have any serious doubt in the case of richard hunt you may submit this to them also  john adams    july      quincy james mchenry to j mchenry secretary of war quincy    july      i agree with you in your opinion expressed in your favor of the   th that both an army and navy establishment are essential to the present and future interests and greatness of the united states and that we must run the risks which other nations have run it appeared to me that offices were created and salaries made necessary in the plan for supplying the army which would require the interposition of congress but if the powers already given to administration are sufficient i am satisfied  i wish only that the heads of department may be satisfied and that no embarrassments may be brought upon them which they are not previously apprised of     john adams    july      quincy thomas mifflin to thomas mifflin quincy    july      i have received the letter your excellency did me the honor to write me on the  th of this month with the copy of chief justice mckeans letter to your excellency and two letters of mr liston these last i shall transmit to the secretary of state to be restored to the writer of them according to the idea of your excellency with the best apology that the subject will admit of for the freedom which has been improperly taken with his correspondence by opening the letters the safety and honor of nations is so much concerned in the universal respect that is or ought to be shown to the despatches of ambassadors that it is to be regretted that any of our citizens should have been guilty of the fault of opening these  john adams    july      quincy james mchenry to j mchenry secretary of war quincy    july      i have received your favor of the   th and have considered the opinions of the heads of department  i wish that courtsmartial may be advised to be as cautious as possible in all their proceedings especially in cases of life because the discipline of the army will depend much upon this habit but the crime of richard hunt is of so deep a die that i have not seen my way clear to avoid the signature of the warrant for his execution which is here returned yet if you and general hamilton think that one example may suffice for the purposes of public justice the execution of hunt or pierce may be respited      john adams    july      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy    july      i have received your favor of the   th and have read mr daviss  letter inclosed in it of june    my own opinion coinciding with yours and his i have signed and now inclose the pardon of john scotchler not however without some serious apprehensions of the consequences of tenderness for cases of such dangerous example john adams  0 july      quincy timothy pickering to t pickering secretary of state quincy  0 july      sir— i have your favor of the   th received only last night i sent you lately mr listons two letters with one from governor mifflin and a copy from chief justice mckean i will not comment on the letters of mr liston nor examine whether all his sentiments are just or politic  but i heartily reprobate the outrage on the british government in violating the seals of its accredited minister to the united states and am desirous of taking such notice of it as the respect we owe not only to the government of great britain but to ourselves demands i pray you therefore to refer this business to the attorney of the district in the absence of the attorneygeneral with instructions to make a diligent inquiry and strictly to prosecute the persons he may find guilty of any breach of the law of nations or the land the publication of these letters is a crime in somebody i know not whom  i am c john adams     john adams    july      quincy benjamin stoddert to b stoddert secretary of the navy quincy    july      sir— it always gives me pain when i find myself obliged to differ in opinion from any of the heads of department  but as our understandings are not always in our own power every man must judge for himself in the case of captain talbot i am perfectly clear in my own mind that he has been a captain in the navy of the united states from the time of his appointment in      to this hour that a legal title and an estate in his office was then vested in him and that he has never been divested of either the suspension of his pay and subsistence was no deprivation of his office any more than shaking off the apples is cutting down the tree the principle is well known and established in a multitude of cases sequestration of the uses and profits of lands or tenements by the acts of the legislature is not a destruction of the title or a divestment of the estate suspensions of the functions are no deprivation of the offices the dukes of norfolk for ages were disqualified to discharge their functions on account of their catholic religion yet they remained dukes of norfolk and their titles and offices descended from generation to generation without any degradation of rank president washington made the distinction at the time and instead of discharging or dismissing captain talbot from his office or annulling his appointment only informed him that in consequence of an act of congress his pay and subsistence must be suspended or must cease for the present but at the same time expressed his desire that he would still stand ready to engage again in the service when he should be called had president washington continued in office he might have given talbot the command of a ship and ordered him his pay and subsistence without a fresh nomination to the senate and so might the successor to the office of president nothing can be inferred from my nomination of him but my desire to give satisfaction to the senate and the public had the senate   0 refused their advice and consent i might have desisted from my intention of employing him but the repetition of their consent is certainly no diminution of his title but had talbot been expressly dismissed and his appointment annulled for no fault by president washington it would have made no alteration in my opinion talbot upon being called into service again ought to have his former rank which he held under the same constitution of government and in the same department of the public service far be it from me to depreciate the merits services or talents of captain truxtun i respect i esteem and especially since his late glorious action i love the man his gallant behavior and splendid conquest of the insurgente have won him laurels which i hope he will live to wear for many years after i shall be no more but this meritorious conduct makes no alteration in my judgment in the state of this question it is no more an argument for promoting him over talbot than it is for promoting him over the heads of nicholson and barry which no man will advocate or propose if he is to be promoted as a reward for a great action his promotion ought to be as impartial as possible to all other officers one ought not to be singled out as a victim to be slighted and wounded alone it is impossible to finish this letter without saying something of talents services and general merit in all these points in my opinion talbot will not suffer by a comparison with any naval officer in the service delicate as this subject is i must hint at a few particulars which appear not to be sufficiently known exploits of twenty years age in history are little attended to by the present generation talbots talents and services in civil life as a representative in congress as an agent for the liberation of our seamen in the west indies and even in fitting out our ships lately are of very respectable character but his services last war far outweigh all the services which were ever performed by truxtun to the united states during his whole life i should regret sincerely and extremely the loss of captain truxtun to the navy and to the united states and i confidently hope and believe he will not think of a resignation but if it must come to such a crisis that i should be compelled to say which officer i would retain in the service i should not hesitate a moment to say it must be talbot truxtun     is a new man in the service of the united states talbot has served them very long there are two principles which produce a tenaciousness of rank one is a sense of honor and consciousness of dignity which cannot bear disgrace or degradation the other is a selfish vanity and aspiring ambition which is desirous of rising at any rate and leaping over the heads of all others who are higher talbot is in my opinion undoubtedly in the first case and i sincerely hope truxtun will not prove himself in the last talbot cannot descend without disgrace and loss of reputation and confidence in the world truxtun stands on safe ground and will lose no character or confidence by not rising he has not even a colorable or plausible pretence for rising whatever an unthinking undiscriminating popularity may say i will not be the dupe of that popularity i promised you some hints of talbots services in may      he was elected a captain of a company by the legislature of rhode island when he raised a full company and marched to the camp near boston where he continued until the enemy were driven away in      he then marched with the army for new york but upon his arrival at new london with the army he was drafted with two hundred men to man commodore hopkinss squadron which had just arrived there from a cruise the draft was made to help the fleet bound from new london to newport the better to defend the ships in case they should fall in as was expected with two british twenty gun ships cruising off newport the squadron arrived without seeing an enemy at newport when he left the fleet and embarked in a small vessel with his soldiers and landed in the city of new york in the course of the campaign of      some fire ships were equipped at new york with the view of endeavoring to destroy the british fleet and army lying then at a particular place when they were ready for service the commanderinchief sent for talbot and requested him to take charge of a combustible brig to which he readily consented though it was considered so hazardous an undertaking that it was with great difficulty that others could be procured to command the rest john thomas talbots ensign followed his example and took charge of a second and was burned to death in the flames of his vessel     talbot did not receive orders to execute the design of his ship until three of the british ships of war moved up the north river seven miles above the city in the night preceding the battle of haerlem he received directions to run down upon the ships of war in the north river and destroy them if possible which were promptly attempted to be put in execution an hour before daylight by getting the fire ship under way and running down and boarding the asia on her starboard bow when he set fire to her and with the greatest difficulty made his escape through the flames into the boat where his men had been placed to take him off the fire ship was grappled to the asia for some time but at length by the activity address and intrepidity of british seamen was disengaged so that the asia was not burned but the attempt threw the ships crew into such confusion and alarmed them so much that all the ships of war and their attendants in the north river cut and ran down to their old station below the city the morning after this the battle of haerlem was fought and as the enemy had not those ships to cover their left flank as had been intended washington gained the advantage of that day after leaving the fire ship talbot made his escape to the jersey shore in a boat receiving the fire of all the ships as he passed them in escaping through the flames his clothes were all burned and his body too to that degree that he did not see the light for fourteen days congress on a representation of this service thought proper to grant him a commission as major in the army of the united states and to make him a grant of a sum of money as a compensation for the clothes which were burned on his back rapid promotions and splendid rewards were not so easily obtained in those days you see as they have been in some instances of late years at the latter end of the siege of fort mifflin on mud island which was always allowed to have been well defended talbot was second in command and in the afternoon previous to the evening of its evacuation when the cannonade and fire of musketry were very severe he received a musket ball through his left wrist the pain of which must have been to most men insupportable he bound it up and continued at his post till sunset when he was shot down by another ball which entered near his left hip and yet remains in his left groin     in      at the battle of rhode island under general sullivan he commanded in the light advanced corps and commenced the action of that day in person and such was his conduct during the battle and activity in procuring boats for landing the army on the island previous to the battle that sullivan mentioned him very honorably to congress in the communication of the events of that expedition in the same year after the expedition before alluded to the british stationed a large galley in the passage between rhode island and the main mounting eight twelvepounders which cannon had been taken out of the flora frigate that was sunk in the harbor and were marked with her name as this galley totally stopped all supplies for the army by water and prevented all our navigation from providence and taunton rivers which was very considerable and annoyed all vessels bound to those places talbot determined to remove her if possible and accordingly requested of general sullivan who commanded the army fifty men to be drafted for the purpose the general after some hesitation complied talbot embarked these on board a small sloop at providence called the hawk which mounted only two threepounders cut away the boarding nettings drove the enemy from their quarters and took possession sword in hand of the galley which was commanded by a british lieutenant of the navy with fortyeight men after this talbot weighed her anchors ran out of the harbor and carried her safe to connecticut where he landed the prisoners before dark the next day for this service the legislature of rhode island passed a law that a sword should be presented to him at the expense of that state and congress thought proper as a reward for the same service to promote him to the rank and to give him a commission of lieutenantcolonel in the service of the united states the british never posted any other armed vessel in the passage which remained open and free ever after some time after this talbot made arrangements and sailed twice from providence with three hundred men on board a large merchant ship mounted on a stage above her deck for the purpose of boarding a sixtyfour gun ship that lay in the bay but the wind at both times failed him and it became so calm that he was obliged to return without effecting his purpose as the enemy always got information of his movements they were     after this so much afraid of being boarded that they took a regiment on board from the island and kept them until they learned that his plan was laid aside in      congress directed general gates who succeeded general sullivan to provide an armed vessel for the protection of the bays and coast about rhode island accordingly a sloop was equipped named the argo mounting ten sixpounders but as this sloop when equipped could not be manned general gates requested talbot to take the command of her as he was at that time popular with the seamen at first he declined because the command of a small sloop was not equal to that which a lieutenantcolonel ought to expect but he was at length prevailed on by the general as it was desirable to have the sloop manned general gates can certify the most important services performed by the argo while under his command the number of cannon which he took in the several prizes is said to have amounted to ninetysix twenty of them twelvepounders the rest sixes and fours some of the privateers he took were double his own force and all of them of superior force in a battle fought with the privateer ship dragon of fourteen guns which continued four hours and a half with great vigor on both sides the ship did not surrender until her mainmast was shot away just above the deck and tumbled into the sea in this battle he had twentyone men killed and wounded and when the enemy surrendered the argo was on the point of sinking the water in her hold being above the gunroom floor congress as a reward for his services in this action and five others fought in the argo some of them not much less severe thought proper to appoint him a captain in the navy for while he commanded the argo he was furnished with no other than a lieutenantcolonels commission thus i have given some intimations of the principles and facts which i have taken pains to collect on which i have acted in giving talbot a commission to take rank from the day of his appointment as a captain in the navy in      which words here underscored i pray you to insert in his commission in your office as they are the only alteration i have made in it after all human events are all uncertain truxtun may resign which i sincerely hope he will not and upon my honor i think he ought not and talbot may be unfortunate consequent     censures will probably be freely cast upon me i am prepared to meet them let them come as thick as they may however i may regret them i shall never repent of the measure that produced them because it has been the result of mature deliberation impartial consideration of the whole subject and conscientious opinion that it is right after a detention of nine days by contrary winds the constitution took the advantage of a brisk breeze and went out of the harbor and out of sight this forenoon making a beautiful and noble figure amidst the joy and good wishes of many thousands of good federalists  i have the honor c john adams p s although this letter is committed to your discretion prudence will dictate that some parts of it be considered as confidential         appendix a william vans murray   july      the hague john adams no i william vans murray to john adams  the hague   july      dear sir— the papers some of which i have received as late as  th may and one of   th may have after so long a pause of uncertainty thrown me into a tumult of feelings almost to tears i see with a pride sustained by active domestic sources of greatness the rising energies of america spreading over that surface of the public mind which reflection had matured into a mass of stability fit to support all the passions that are generous and lofty among the causes of exultation the addresses are certainly all important i circulate them here and they open the eyes of even the wilful as to the longtold tale and inveterate error that the people and the executive are at variance the prospects which these things open upon this government give them infinite solicitude their ally is deaf to their sufferings and if war openly comes on i verily believe they do not know whether they are to share in it or not they will struggle complain argue and remonstrate against joining france both because they hate her and rejoice at our energy and because it will put almost a last stroke to their commerce perhaps colonies knowing the absolute power of france over all their means and foreseeing a period when the question might be decided against their neutrality respecting the united states all my wishes have been bent towards the preparation of a state of things internally here that might eventually drive the french out of this country in this wish the theories of the old and the new governments are not at all taken into view nor are their merits among the motives i have felt to do this it is my duty which makes it becoming in me sir to tell you i have conversed with some of the important men among the moderates in the month of may as soon as i knew very secretly that they intended through general daendels to overturn the     directory and councils if they could get the leave of france i discovered that their object ultimately was to get possession of power new organize the whole country in its public men and if possible in any lucky concurrence of external things liberate the country from the french whom they abhor i wrote to mr king stating the views to which i thought these men if successful in oversetting the usurpers of   d january might be brought my object in writing was this in all their solicitude against france the principal obstruction to a radical concert was the fear of the interference of great britain to restore the stadtholder that fear removed and external events concurring and they seemed coming as war on the rhine internal convulsions in france ruptures in italy they seemed to be in a fair course to even success i stated to him that while the parties here and one hundred and fifty thousand men voted for the constitution were afraid of this interference all their measures for independence would be checked and they would remain absolutely french that if great britain could by some means settle that fear and the moderates succeeded as they did on the   th june and other events that seemed probable occurred the government which would be formed among the moderates would do all in their power to so prepare things that they might successfully avail themselves of opportunity my letters arrived safely and nothing was hazarded on my part on the   d of may i was called upon by the second man in the party a conversation the preceding evening at a ball of the french minister was the proximate cause for i had enjoyed with him some confidential conversations before in this interview this gentleman after telling me that he wished to converse fully with me in confidence and that what i should hear from him should not go further than to you sir the secretary of state and mr king opened himself fully he told me that if daendels succeeded he went the   th at night they meant to overturn the present men whom he represented as peculators and as men who exhausted every thing in enormous bribes to arrange their internal affairs and the first moment in their power to drive out the french that opportunities would occur in the war if it was renewed and that they meant to embroil parties in france if there was a chance of convulsion there but that the great obstacle was the temper of england towards them that this apprehension once settled by a secret understanding they could join her and the united states against france that this understanding ought to take place soon because they would then work all their means to the grand object from the start of the new administration which he hoped would be formed in a little time i then read to him part of my letter to mr king from a presscopy on this subject he said that was all he wished in many parts of his conversation he was excessively moved by mournful and indignant feelings i told him i should write to mr king that we were so distant i did not see the necessity of writing to the president you will see sir that i have not overrated this interview when i tell you that the gentleman was the name which you will find at the bottom of this page his name i have not informed mr king of nor any one     could this nation be once roused and drive the french out the spirit of revolt from her would spread over all the affiliated countries and the most important events succeed as to the restoration of the stadtholder that is in my mind a secondary consideration and for themselves and it is not improbable that his restoration would take place the expulsion of the french must be the groundwork of every measure whether for his restoration or any thing else and would be highly important to the united states i mention this to you sir because i think it my duty to tell you every thing of consequence which i cannot and ought not to trust to the inspection of so many men above a hundred who claim the privilege of inspecting the despatches in the office and i think it important enough to trouble you with because it is a likeness of the men now in power and i believe a true view of their wishes but great britain will not give up the stadtholder i do not know that she need the question however is whether she would see this whole country eventually divided by france or in the full possession of france or so placed as that it might either have a constitution different from its old form and probably also the stadtholder taking him back upon terms of their own after the french should be dispossessed and without her interference prussia would take care also of this restoration it is probable though now she abandons all her friends and great britain by her project last summer in fact gave him up i apprehend that the war will break out again we know nothing of bonaparte and his fleet that can be deemed authentic except that they are near malta the rupture between genoa and the court of turin is a thing intended by our great ally and will lead to the speedy downfall of sardinia who in the latter end of april actually set on foot a negotiation at paris to obtain a handsome retreat if it was the declared intention of france to revolutionize his country france tries to avoid such appearances with an ally and though a miserable substitute for a manly and noble resistance yet it had some policy in it for it brought her to renounce openly her design and enabled him to defeat the insurgents who had been stimulated by france and who for a month thought themselves deserted it is singular but he will join france if war comes on with the emperor such is his abject state living with a certainty of being cut up if the french republic exists a year some part of the subject of this letter which will be i fear sir very toilsome to you may require a vindication my own opinion is that the evil ones of the world have a decided superiority over the good by that jacobinical and secret intrigue by which vast plots are ripened in the dark and because the good will not go into the dark to work i believe that an enemy is to be opposed in the recesses of the mine which is ready to heave into air the fortress as well as on the open plain in broad day and that their mode of fighting must furnish the model by which the fashion of resistance is to be adopted in fact sir that a diplomat of strict honor and with views the most correct in the present scenes in europe must counterwork in the manner that they work that to resist this horrible illuminism this darkness visible he must himself if possible be an illuminé i submit this delicate question to you sir who have yourself worked in the midst of difficulties the greatest i trust that i feel the full force of the truth that there is something in honest intentions and in true simplicity   0 of design that without cunning excels it yet the experience at this day of every horrible scene that has occurred for ten years past from the first step of revolution to the last convinces me that this truth is applicable in sound interpretation to the principles and intentions of a system and that though bad means are not sanctified by a good end yet that no good means will equal bad means conducted by immense combination without they are combined and excited in a manner resembling that in which the bad are this for my vindication should i have appeared to you to be doing something secretly which i have mentioned in this letter i have the pleasure to inform you that mr adams was well on   d june i have the honor to be with my felicitations among the crowd who address you and the most sincere respect and most perfect esteem dear sir your most obedient servant w v murray william vans murray    july      the hague john adams no ii william vans murray to john adams the hague    july      dear sir— in a late despatch in june to the secretary of state i mentioned mr pichon late secretary to genet and fauchet last a secretary in the bureau of foreign affairs on the american side of the office at paris and now french secretary of legation here i promised this gentleman in the third interview about three weeks since for i wished to make him talk freely knowing that his opinions have helped to mislead the french government that his name should not be mentioned in any way that might be known to the world at his own request since that i have not seen him till today i this morning received a note from him informing me that he had some intelligence to communicate exceedingly interesting to both of us and wished an hour to be named i gave him the time before the hour one the chargé des affaires champigny drove up and was with me loosely talking about rastadt and the war which is now again bursting forth between france and germany after his departure the visit as to time being perfectly out of course mr pichon came for a fortnight before i had expected that they would probably attempt to use me as a vehicle of overtures to be made to the government for the purpose of distracting and dividing and of reviving that hope which has so much been our disease i am not much out in my expectations mr pichon after some time detailed to me the substance of the inclosed paper as intelligence respecting mr gerry lamenting the unhappy quarrel c c and endeavoring to predispose me to mr talleyrand assuring me that he was solicitous for accommodation the conversation was long and made up on my part of the gross insults which we had too long borne and the injustice which we had suffered and of the spirit which now animates the councils and the nation of america and the current of opinions that bore down every art and obstacle on his part of conceding to much i said of lamenting the rest of praises of the instructions for their profound wisdom and conciliatory and magnanimous tone in fine i     considered this interview as probably bringing into motion part of their plan respecting my humble self in about two hours he told me that he had as he before informed me translated the instructions which i lent to him sent them to mr talleyrand with remarks and had this morning received mr talleyrands answer which if i pleased he would read it was he said a copy i perceived it was in mr pichons own hand which i know after his reading of it and tracing with much concern the point in which all negotiation must stop he put it into my hands i asked him if i might keep it because i could not read french as fluently as he repeated it he assented this was probably also what he wished i told him that we were now armed and arming that the bills for the sortie of our cruisers and for suspension of intercourse which i had newspaper copies of in my pocket and which i lent to him had passed without debate or opposition so mature was the public mind on these points that i regretted mr gerrys stay at paris because i added that this might divide the public mind as to the chance of honorable accommodation and of course might delay those vigorous measures which became our government after such moderation lest their patience might be misconstrued as the internal parties of america had been that we were so very far off it was now impossible for us to be kept in a wavering state and that from the decided tone of the government supported throughout by the nation it would be no very easy matter that the conduct of government and the people notwithstanding mr gerrys stay was a proof that nothing now but acts of justice could restore harmony that as to the mode i was no judge that my government could alone judge i carefully avoided dropping a word that in the most distant manner held up an idea of communicating this paper or of treating it in any way but as an affair of mere conversation and for my private perusal nothing was said to prevent my communicating it he repeated his wishes that whatever had passed might not reach the public i assured him it should not that i remembered my promise to him that with him i lamented the state into which the two nations appeared approaching but saw no way out of it at present that you had done all that became the dignity and independence which you watched over that i personally had the honor of knowing the perfect sincerity of your heart upon the endeavor to adjust but that i was no judge of the mode to be pursued and that i hoped we should still be armed and prepared and protect our commerce by defensive measures he said we were right in placing every thing in a state of defence and of protecting our commerce and of preventing their or any privateers from molesting our waters and limits but his regret was that just as things began to take a turn such as he knew mr talleyrand wished there should be nobody at paris to treat i again recurred to the patience of the envoys and the impropriety so i thought it of mr gerrys stay he recurred then to the powers joint and several and said that our government broke off the negotiation though a man appointed by it mr gerry was competent to treat and on the spot before it knew the result i then called his recollection to mr talleyrands note in march which begins by criminating the american government charging insincerity and absolutely dismissing the majority of the envoys though all there when once in paris were alone one commission and that joint and several meant to guard against contingencies of death in any one or more in so distant a scene and voyage     as i saw his drift was to lead me into such opinions as might induce me to write to government that a new expectation might be excited the motive of which i do not hesitate to declare i believe to be merely to divide and bewilder and to relax our energy and as i wished to show him that i had no hopes myself of adjustment—on his lamenting the present crisis and wishing that it could yet be averted i observed to him that while i regretted that this crisis was imposed upon us in defence of our honor independence and commercial interests i saw no means in the present state of things by which this could be accomplished that his government ought to have reflected last march upon one thing in particular which would always if not attended to render afterthought embarrassing if not useless in any nation in europe that had a delicate negotiation with america it was the distance of america u s from france that when a negotiation so situated had been after mature efforts on our part broken off and the ministers gone it was not possible to intimate any fresh ideas to the american government as they could to any government in europe by couriers in ten days and hence a radical breach of negotiation with america must from the policy of america arising from that distance always produce those decisive measures there which had from selfpreservation been lately adopted that the moment it was announced by you sir that all hopes had ceased the government and nation rose up to a point infinitely beyond the lethargy of hope and took ground that changed the subjectmatter for negotiation that the united states had not declared war that i knew of but that she had taken her ground c c he talked about parties that france could not hurt us but that our parties might i told him that that was the error which could not be explained if facts acts and laws had not already explained it permit me now sir shortly to state what i believe to be the real object of this whole interview france alarmed at our attitude war bursting out again wishing to amuse america with a new chime of bells has fixed on this secretary because he knew me in philadelphia as the instrument to try the pulse and me as the vehicle of her wretched policy nothing has ever come from me to lead her to suppose that i am her man—that much at least i may permit myself to boast to you sir—but still she thinks that on that account she could get me into an informal negotiation and impose upon me so far as to credit these airs of tenderness and induce me by these means to hazard a few hopes in favor of amicable adjustment that two opinions might yet rise in the united states and that at all events some ground would be prepared for the impressions which she trusts mr gerry may make on his return if nothing more mr gerry acts wisely in resisting entering into negotiation or affecting to assume the power yet they and the french americans at paris will try every art to impress the public mind in america that every thing could be done by any man with powers that mr talleyrand has at last brought the directory into a temper to treat c c i could not refuse a member of our corps an interview he asked for in a note and indeed i was curious to see the advances of proud and conscious debility as i was determined that i would not write at all upon the subject to government nor to any one but to you sir entirely for yourself and he will never know that i have written i would not give this visit any importance in mr pichons eyes by any hesitation and i thought i might get something what i     did not know nor expect precisely i have not dared at such a time sir to step between your measures and their object nor need you fear that i shall if this affair takes a more formal attempt i shall listen but to get what i can and then declare myself incompetent and that having no power and not having any security i shall not dare to meddle nor to write to government upon the subject that they are competent to acts of justice and sincerity without negotiation i am well aware of the consequence of my doing any thing like listening to formal proposals without this declaration on my part because it would lead them perhaps to write to america that great hopes were entertained of an amicable adjustment and mention the overtures to which i should have listened the use sir it has struck me in this interview is in this fact if it be true that the copy is really from mr talleyrand that the sending of mr pichon here is a measure of solicitude for he is a useful and active secretary on american affairs at paris and above all this interview and the letter of mr talleyrand and mr pichon giving it to me prove that they are deeply alarmed that energetic measures have stunned them and that the steady and dignified pursuit of them will attain their great end from letters which i receive today from paris of the   th and from three other letters to two others which i have heard read today of the   th stating in fact the substance of the inclosed and mr talleyrands advances i have no doubt that they will exert themselves to show how amicable they are how hasty we are but i thank god sir that nature has worked to her proper issues in america and that these tricks will be straws against a storm it is my misfortune sir to trouble you with long letters and in a toilsome character one thing more sir and i cease to lengthen this believe me to be deeply impressed first with a sense of duty that shows me i have no right to meddle on this subject and secondly that in sending the inclosed with my remarks solely sir to you and to no other man in the world i hazard no false inferences from what i do no dangerous effects from the transmission and that i do it to prove should it be necessary to you that this mode of proceeding is among the arts which they will doubtless practice in various shapes and that you ought to know the fact as it will console you to have proof that though they have no sincerity that can be depended on one moment they are in some degree humbled you will perceive sir that i do not mention this even to the secretary of state for in his office some men go occasionally to read despatches who might from good or bad motives use this paper to foolish or wicked ends general joubert who commands the french army here was last night ordered to depart for mayence hatry comes here as the french expect to begin active and offensive operations against germany the negotiation at seltz between exdirector neufchateau and count cobenzel ended in heat they separated hostilely even the congress at rastadt it is understood must be by this time broken up and the campaign is expected while germany has been dozing at rastadt the french have accomplished what a brilliant campaign could hardly have effected for the papacy has been overturned switzerland possessed the kingdom of sardinia put into their hands and malta taken bonaparte it is believed must be on his route to leghorn if nelson does not secure him on the other hand switzerland is unquiet and will seize any     moment favorable to resist this country is wretched and would i believe resist if great britain would remove her fears her fears however are excited now by a suspicion that france may either throw her into departments or partition her with prussia who as far as i can learn is not yet a party to the coalition the name which i lately had the honor to communicate in another long letter on a separate piece of paper was not put into any public despatch because of my fears that it might somehow leak out and would be rapidly borne here to the death of the person and of others i beg you to excuse the laborious length of this letter and of that and to believe me to be with the most perfect respect and attachment c w v murray ch mau talleyrand   july      m pichon inclosed c m talleyrand to m pichon    messidor an     july      jai reçu citoyen votre lettre du   de ce mois avec la copie des instructions données au nom du président des états unis à les envoyés je suis surpris comme vous que leur conduite et leur mémoire du    nivose ayent cadré si peu avec cette pièce je ny vois que deux clauses impératives—ne permettre aucun secours pendant la guerre—néxiger et ne faire aucune soumission sur les procédés reprochés de part et dautre des hommes vraiment concilians eussent levés ces difficultés notre intention est toujours de mettre un terme à un état de choses si contraire aux intérêts des deux pays vous savez que le rapprochement eut été effectué de bonne heure si des mesures irritantes de la part des états unis neussent constamment suscité des obstacles jai fait le  0 prairéal à m gerry des propositions qui navaient été suspendues que par la connoissance des étranges communications de philadelphie je lui ai successivement remis des notes sur chacune des questions de détail qui doivent être résolues je nai cessé de manifester le désir dactiver la dégociation et les doutes seules de m gerry sur la validité de ses pouvoirs ont entrainés des lenteurs cest au moment où je me flattais davoir fait des progrés que le directoire apprend de philadelphie la publication dun acte intitulé acte tendant à protéger efficacement le commerce et les côtes des états unis cette piece que vous verrez dans les papiers publics vous expliquera la sensation quelle a produite cest ainsi que dincidens en incidens et toujours par le fait du gouvernement des états unis les deux nations seloignent lorsquil paraìt quelles vont se rapprocher m gerry dun autre còté navance rien il élude les discussions sur les notes que je lui remets il persiste à retourner dans les états unis et laisse conjecturer quil nattend aucune autorisation pour traiter définitivement je pense que si le gouvernement américain a les intentions quil professe ostensiblement il doit sabstenir de toute provocation nouvelle et envoyer un plénipotentiaire favorablement connu en france nous serons peutêtre plutôt daccord que les anglais ne se limaginent     william vans murray    july      the hague john adams no   william vans murray to john adams  the hague    july      dear sir— i had this evening a visit from the name is on a loose paper after informing me of the exertions of mr schimmelpenninck and admiral de winter at paris the agents of this government to recall france to a just respect for the commercial interests of this country he told me from a letter from the latter which he showed me that france had not commanded the commissary of marine at flushing to embargo our ships at that port there are none i think there though the embargo is certain all through the french ports that this intelligence would please our government because it promised some respect to trade in this country he asked my opinion of some parts of the letter which he read in french as it was in dutch in which the admiral mentions mr talleyrands solicitude to conciliate the united states i told him not to rely a moment upon these professions begging him on the contrary to bend all his force to show france that it is her interest to let holland be at peace with the united states he said that should be done and had been endeavored that they were absolutely ruined if they should be in the war i told him that i had written a few sheets on that question which i would send him which i shall do privately were it known to come from me though not a treatise it would work the other way with france the reason of my caution in folding up the name is because of what i shall now mention he gradually led me to the subject of my letter to you sir of   th july  in which i mention that a personage had called on me and proposed to me to write to mr king on the following proposition namely that if great britain would declare that she would not interfere with the internal government here they his party would drive the french out of the country provided that the war that was probable were renewed and any chance presented itself he spoke explicitly of the name which i mentioned connected with the interview in may and which i find certainly that i have not overrated in mentioning it sir to you after some time he told me i need not conceal any thing on that subject that he knew all and was a party to the plan and then named one other a man of the very first talents i think in this country and a man of high and excellent principles and said we all are of the same views i then spoke with absolute freedom to him and told him what i had written to mr king and that i had communicated to you sir in confidence even the name he seemed a little alarmed i told him it would be perfectly safe with you and that it was on a loose paper and that in case of accidents as death it would still be sacred he avowed the highest respect for you and mentioned that his friends the moderates many of whom had the pleasure of knowing you personally were much attached to you i told him that not having seen the person with whom i had the interview in may since i could not     communicate the result of my correspondence but that i now would to him and told him that i suspected that great britain would not give the pledge required he at last said he thought she might yet if a fair occasion offered in fact sir i now know that the men who overturned the directory on the   th june did it partly with this view and principally they have with some hazard liberated the arrested members of   d january in doing which they risked the suspicions of france but they have so managed as to have her consent and yet her confidence tremendous will be the blow if she discover a thread of this affair i hear nothing more from mr pichon mr gerry is yet at paris and great pains are taken to circulate into merchants counting houses here information pretended to be drawn from him that if he had power he could treat to advantage in the mean time no act on their part assures us of sincerity on the contrary every act of government is a contradiction to this sort of news namely a very strict embargo on our vessels in all the french ports since about the  0th instant when from private intelligence i heard of it by letters of the  th from paris i would pray sir for every gentleness towards this nation consistent with the honor of the american government they are government and all charmed with our spirit and energy and in fact consider it secretly as a common cause in which they are interested that we should succeed i have requested mr bourne to give notice of the law for suspending intercourse though i am not officially informed if i find that my intelligence that the bill passed  st june is not a law and it came to me through various channels that it is a law i shall take on myself the mistake by publishing notice that the unofficial intelligence which i now believe still to be true is premature so as to prevent any consequences from mr bournes notice i have the honor to be c w v murray p s    july i have just received letters from several correspondents which lead me to doubt whether the bill for suspending intercourse be passed into a law and have written to mr bourne to stop the notice that measure i resolved on after a belief that it had passed because of the endeavors made here and from paris to lead our trade into a disbelief of the embargo which i knew had taken place in the french ports and because some vessels here of the united states wished to go both to france and her islands william vans murray   august      the hague john adams no   william vans murray to john adams  the hague   august      dear sir— i have the honor to inclose you a duplicate and to inform you that the same language has been held to me since and that this government     have assured me of their conviction that the letter inclosed in this leyden paper marked x may be considered as evidence of an amicable disposition  as they say they have taken pains to ascertain that point from motives of selfinterest these motives i believe sir        0 them i do not believe in     since          of this letter mr gerrys answer i have not yet seen mr talleyrands reply to it i have in manuscript in the same way as the inclosed may show the answer i hear demanded a retraction of the arrêtés against our trade the reply avoids all of that irritating language which is scattered with a supercilious air in the letter though in a degree and manner more humble and it announces an amicable spirit a determination to remain tranquil and that orders had been given to the privateers in the west indies to act within the limits of the laws this order mr t considers as a pledge of amity without saying any thing of the laws themselves it renounces all demands of loans and assures mr gerry of a disposition to treat on fair terms in a manner the most direct and in a tone infinitely below any thing which they have used to any nation all this i     as merely arts hoping to  0    0 negotiation to         your              and         with england their privateers in the mean time are i understand to act as usual in europe against us because they do so against the vessels of other nations i hear that mr gerry has left paris for america from the tenor of these letters i presume that the french consider him as charged to deliver them and perhaps more it is because i presume that he does not so consider himself that i trouble you sir with this communication that you may be as early as possible apprised of these letters which i          as a public mode of              pichon admits that as a proof of their sincerity an american war would be highly unpopular in france and that the colonies are in danger if it come on i stated the preference which you would give to great and solid acts of justice rather than to promises of amity and a course of proceeding in which they twice had the offer of the hand of amity letters will come from paris to america as they do hither full of absolute falsities of demands by mr g and concessions on their part happening to have seen the       00 of m talleyrand i have been enabled to contradict part of the misstatements the haste in which i am obliged to write i beg you sir to accept as some apology for the very great freedom in blots c w v murray     william vans murray  0 august      the hague john adams no   william vans murray to john adams the hague  0 august      dear sir—           the inclosed paper was given to me this morning by mr vander goes the minister of foreign affairs it is authentic though not authenticated and proves that the dutch minister at paris has acted as i stated lately to the secretary of state he made a verbal application to know if his government could not be instrumental in acting as the intermediary between the united states and france now that all diplomatic communication had ended in a day or two after mr talleyrand gave him the inclosed written answer this proves a solicitude to which the energy of the american government sustained by union among the people has given birth it will be in the power of the government to take a wide survey of the question and to make a very dignified use of the subjectmatter of this paper the subjectmatter has been published in the papers here this proceeded i believe from france  i have the honor to be c w v murray inclosed communication confidentielle le ministre des relations extérieures a communiqué officiellement au ministre batave schimmelpenninck que le directoire de la république française a reçu avec satisfaction loffre de mediation entre la république et les états unis le ministre des relations extérieures ajoute à cette communication que le directoire a témoigné recemment de la manière la plus éclatante ses dispositions conciliatoires quil ne croyait pas quelles seroient plus longtemps méconnues à philadelphie et quil attendait que lopinion éclairée des américains répondant aux voeux quil a manifesté provoqueroit à son tour une explication définitive et des arrangemens convenables william vans murray   october      the hague john adams no   william vans murray to john adams  the hague   october      dear sir— the inclosed is from m talleyrand to m pichon who left this place the   th september for paris in many interviews which this gentleman     sought with me with much solicitude i had repelled the idea that the assurances declared by you sir in your message in june had been given in any of mr talleyrands letters that i had seen to this i added among many other remarks that nothing but a formal and explicit assurance of respectful reception worthy the minister of a free independent and powerful nation would in my opinion as an unauthorized individual be considered by you sir as the assurances which you had spoken of that i did not know any thing of the intentions of government in the future but that it was an error in his government to flatter itself with the idea that you would accept assurances by implication or any of any sort which were blended with any kind of indication of the political complexion of envoys or any advice or hint upon the choice that i did not know whether if assurances were given they would produce negotiation but that without them there would be no negotiation certainly that the assurances if given would not be a favor but only an assurance that rights which had been twice refused should be enjoyed that an explicit declaration could never be necessary upon such a point except in cases where the right had been expressly refused that this right implied among all equal powers had been twice expressly denied and that of course an explicit declaration announcing it became necessary to the dignity of the american government and nation he appeared at last to fall in with these ideas and in the next interview which was the second week in september he told me he had stated my remarks to mr talleyrand but that he did not see how this declaration could be made to whom and through whom i told him that i would communicate to you sir any such declaration if formally and officially made though i was unauthorized to open my lips on the subject and knew that it was taking on myself great hazard and incurring a risk of being open to the imputation of meddling at such a crisis before he went away from the hague it struck me i ought to guard myself by a written note on the point of being unauthorized i therefore wrote the inclosed with the remarks respecting the assurances unless the purity and disinterestedness of my motives are appreciated by you sir i shall consider these informal endeavors to coöperate in what i thought to be your plan and consistent with your policy as the greatest errors of my life i thought that some point honorable to the government over which you preside might be gained nothing hazarded before mr pichon went to paris he told me that he daily expected an answer upon the points of our conversation on the  th and  th instant september namely on the assurances tonight i received from the hands of the french military postmaster here the original of the inclosed under cover from one signed by mr pichon in which he says this from the minister mr talleyrand is the one which he waited some days for here and which crossed him on the road and was sent back to paris whence he sends it to me to be confidentially mentioned to you sir the mysteriousness of concealing these conversations and communications even from the chargé des affaires here is unaccountable to me   0 unless it has arisen from first the peculiar origin of these conversations and communications and secondly from their pride mr pichon i understood from himself had these in view when he was sent here for he told me at the spanish ministers that his being sent here and mr la forests being entirely given to mr talleyrand and the american dispute having been put altogether into mr talleyrands management lately were among the proofs of the intentions of his government to settle amicably he speaks english well i speak french badly and am thus not qualified for long and rapid conversations on important subjects in that language he has more talents and knowledge particularly on american affairs than the present chargé who speaks a little english and who has the character of an enragé secondly their pride is concerned in concealment unless these indirect measures should procure what they aim at a new negotiation on the last idea i have urged that the declaration must be as public as the two former refusals and as solemn as your message the inclosed then sir is sent to you such as it is it is not the declaration it is from the minister of exterior relations of france to the secretary of french legation such as it is i feel it my duty to inclose it with this exposition to you in a private letter taken with other things it may perhaps throw some light it cannot throw any shade i hope over the present lustre of the public mind warm and burning as it does with a holy flame if it be at all useful i shall rejoice it does not strike me on mature reflection as being in any event either in war or in negotiation capable of doing mischief because sir to you only and to colonel pickering in private letters have i stated these things in america and to mr adams at berlin pretty fully the substance of my informal proceedings and to mr king a few hints in strict confidence in europe i enjoy great pleasure in having received from mr adams a concurrence of opinions on the points which i have stated to him on this subject i am sensible that i run some hazard in thus communicating to you sir such things but i thought that you would on the whole wish to know all that i could collect and in the manner that i have taken the liberty of privately communicating it  i have the honor to be c c w v murray ch mau talleyrand paris m pichon m

conversations avec m murray ces conversations dabord purement amicales ont pris un caractère par lapprobation que je vous ai transmise le    fructidor je ne regrète pas que vous ayez confié une copie de ma lettre à lhonneur de m murray cette pièce qui netait destinée que pour vous seul ne contient rien qui ne soit conforme à la pensée du gouvernement je suis intimement convaincu que si une fois les explications sétablissent avec confiance entre les deux cabinets lirritation cessera une foule de malentendus disparaitront et les nœuds de lamitié se resserreront dautant plus solidement que de part et dautre on reconnaîtra la main qui a voulu les dissoudre mais je ne vous cache pas que vos lettres des   et   vendemiaire que je reçois à linstant me surprennent beaucoup ce dont m murray doute encore a été déclaré très explicitement avant même que le message du président au congrès du   messidor  dernier fut connu en france je lavais écrit à m gerry notamment le    messidor et   thermidor je le lui ai répété avant son départ un paragraphe entier de la lettre que vous avez reçu de moi en date du    fructidor et dont la copie est entre les mains de mr murray est consacré à développer davantage la détermination fixe du gouvernement français daprès ces bases vous avez eu raison davancer que tout plénipotentiaire que le gouvernement des états unis enverra en france pour terminer les différends qui subsistent entre les deux pays serait incontestablement reçu avec les égards dûs au représentant dune nation libre indépendante et puissante  je ne puis me persuader citoyen que le gouvernement américain ait besoin de déclarations ultérieures de notre part pour se déterminer à prendre afin de renouer les négociations les mesures que lui suggèrera son désir dacheminer les différends vers un terme pacifique si des malentendus de part et dautre ont empêché les explications qui ont eu lieu darriver à ce terme il faut croire que ces malentendus dissipés rien nopposera désormais dobstacles aux dispositions réciproques les instructions du président à ses envoyés à paris dont je nai eu connoissance que par la copie que vous en a remis m murray et que jai reçu le    messidor  annoncent si elles contiennent toute la pensée du gouvernement américain des dispositions qui nont pu quajouter à celles où a toujours été le directoire et malgré les actes ulterieures de ce gouvernement malgré les mesures irritantes et presque hostiles auxquelles il sest porté le directoire a montré quil persistait dans les sentimens qui sont consignés tant dans ma correspondance avec m gerry que dans la lettre que je vous ai écrite le    fructidor et que jai répétés plus haut dune manière on ne peut plus explicite portez donc citoyen à mr murray ces expressions positives pour le

much beyond appearances these do not please me but i am told that i shall be better pleased in a few days meantime a certain noble lord now a little beclouded has not failed to take the necessary advantage of his success in obtaining the provisional treaty without the knowledge or the participation of the great and good ally of america for arguments sake i admit the fact what then john adams

whenever he may please to attend the debates of the house attest george r minot clerk   there was certainly a wide difference between receiving sixtynine votes the whole number and only thirtyfour less than half mr hamilton has made it a matter of reproach to mr adams that he complained of unfair treatment in not having an equal chance of the electoral vote by leaving the votes to an uninfluenced current what he did complain of and very reasonably too was the secret effort made to reduce the votes for him everywhere to such a degree as to leave him the representative of a minority that this was assiduously done by mr hamilton himself is clear from his own letters now published but mr adams had different evidence in his hands at the time from hartford john trumbull an impartial witness gave him his idea of the action had in connecticut in the following terms— in the choice of v p you had certainly no rival all that could be done by your enemies was to deprive you of a number of votes many of your friends were duped on that occasion i will inform you how it was managed in connecticut on the day before the election colonel webb came on express to hartford sent as he said by colonel hamilton c who he assured us had made an exact calculation on the subject and found that new jersey were to throw away three votes i think and connecticut two and all would be well i exclaimed against the measure and insisted that it was all a deception but what could my single opinion avail against an express armed with intelligence and calculations so our electors threw away two votes where they were sure they would do no harm very justly does mr adams remark in one of his letters to trumbull—i have seen the utmost delicacy used towards others but my feelings have never been regarded these labors were not confined to connecticut and new jersey hamiltons works vol v p     see also vol vi of this work p       it is a singular fact that this should be the only answer to the

unequivocal evidence of the secret hostility of mr hamilton and his immediate friends he had already heard of but had not seen the letter to mr higginson mr jefferson far more keensighted in stratagem had hit the truth two months earlier since the publication of mr hamiltons works not a doubt can remain that he did in secret endeavor to take advantage of the mode of voting indiscriminately for president and vicepresident in order to bring in mr pinckney the candidate designed for the vicepresidency by surprise over the head of mr adams whom the great body of the party unquestionably intended to make president the immediate consequence of this attempt was to spread distrust in the ranks of the federal party and to insure the scattering of so many votes that mr pinckney was defeated even for the vicepresidency he falling behind mr jefferson the candidate of the opposite party for president but for mr hamiltons efforts this misfortune to the party would not probably have happened mr hamiltons own opinion of the propriety of using the old clause of the constitution to such ends became afterwards clear enough when he applied it to the case of aaron burr even then however he rested his objections quite as much upon expediency as upon the far more serious moral obstacles see hamiltons works vol vi pp                     gibbss federal administrations vol i p  0     randolphs jefferson vol iii p       this was a letter of john quincy adams to his mother containing the following passage relating to the new appointment he had received from general washington the appointment to the mission to portugal i find from your letter was as i had before concluded unknown to my father i have already written you upon the subject and i hope my ever dear and honored mother that you are fully convinced from my letters which you have before this received that upon the contingency of my fathers being placed in the first magistracy i shall never give him any trouble by solicitation for office of any kind your late letters have repeated so many times that i shall in that case have nothing to expect that i am afraid you have imagined it possible that i might form expectations from such an event i had hoped that my mother knew me better that she did me the justice to believe that i have not been so totally regardless or forgetful of the principles which my education had instilled nor so totally destitute of a personal sense of delicacy as to be susceptible of a wish tending in that direction i have indeed long known that my father is far more ambitious of my advancement far more solicitous for the extension of my fame than i ever have been or ever shall be myself but i have hitherto had the satisfaction to observe that the notice with which my country and the government have honored me and the confidence which they have been pleased repeatedly to repose in me have been without the smallest agency of my father other than the recommendation which his services carried with them   adets visit was not in a public capacity he solicited a private interview and i consented the purport was to clear up his character but it was of no consequence i shall not write about it he is now soliciting permission to call on me to take leave before his departure it is hardly consistent to grant it but i wont make difficulties and give them handles about such trifles j a to his wife   april   with the exception of the extreme federalists who as mr hamilton says lamented it as temporizing see an indication of their feeling in general schuylers letter to mr hamilton hamiltons works vol vi p     gibbss federal administrations vol i p           this experiment has not been found dangerous in the later history of the country it bids fair to become the rule and not the exception   in holland   mr j q adams had been appointed by president washington to go as minister to portugal   mr jefferson has given his account of this conference in his ana it seems to have been drawn up in      from recollections associated with a memorandum made at the time but no means are furnished by which to distinguish the original from the additions he mentions madison gerry and pinckney as the three persons named for the mission mr adams gave in   0  his version of the same conference formed much in the same way excepting that his original memoranda date in   0  four years later he mentions madison or jefferson as one of the three though he speaks of other characters having been considered in the course of the conversation and this exactly conforms to the earlier record   the date of this letter relieves the statement here made from all suspicion of especial motive it thus forms a complete answer to a charge made three years later by mr hamilton in his well known attack upon mr adams in that pamphlet is an attempt to connect with a private letter made public by a violation of confidence on the part of tench coxe an imputation of unworthy motives in writing it which is the only circumstance that gives the affair any importance it now clearly appears that mr hamilton was mistaken yet inasmuch as an impression seems to have prevailed elsewhere than with mr hamilton that mr adams against the uniform tenor of his preceding life and contrary to all probabilities had solicited the mission to england at the time here spoken of it will not be out of place to add to this letter to mr gerry bearing date three years before the charge was thought of an extract from a fragment written in   0  originally intended as an answer to mr hamilton touching the same point it is scarcely conceivable in what this assertion originated there has been no moment since mr adamss return to america that he would have accepted an appointment to england on any terms he returned weary and satiated with the diplomatic course he returned voluntarily there is little doubt his commission would have been renewed to the court of london if he had desired it but so far from wishing it he resigned all his commissions in europe and instead of asking leave to return home he wrote the then secretary of state mr jay that he was determined to return     mr adams had also other reasons against any appointment abroad and these were the same that president washington suggested according to mr hamilton mr adams however never knew till he read it in this pamphlet that the thought had ever occurred or been proposed to president washington the letter to mr jay above referred to is found in this volume p     the only circumstance which mr adams can recollect connected with this subject is this a gentleman once came to him and said that he had come to propose to him a thing that appeared to him in a very serious light a negotiation was in contemplation with england the people and congress were anxious some gentlemen of the senate one in particular had desired him to see the vicepresident and propose to him to accept an appointment and by way of inducement said that mr adams would have an unanimous vote in the senate mr a laughed at the idea of an unanimous vote and said that he knew his own station in society so well as to know that unanimous votes were luxuries which were never to fall to his lot that in some former parts of his life he had tasted the delicious flavor but it was never to gratify his palate again but he said to the gentleman that he absolutely forbid his name to be mentioned on the occasion for that he would refuse it if he should be nominated even if the miracle should be wrought in the senate of an unanimous vote in his favor and he assigned the same reasons which are hinted at above   the same form addressed to the secretaries of the treasury and of war and the attorneygeneral   it has been affirmed that mr adams decided all questions with little regard to his cabinet the sequel will show that although he settled principles for himself he was elaborate in the submission of all the details to their consideration and ready to follow their advice so long as his confidence in them lasted   it is to be regretted that the limits of this work will not permit of the insertion of the opinions of the cabinet officers often quite long upon the various topics on which they were consulted by mr adams in the present instance in particular though the first to develop the difference of policy between the president and the two principal ministers which afterwards caused the disruption of the cabinet it is only possible to give a meagre abstract of their views it should be borne in mind that they had been at first decidedly opposed to any further measures of a conciliatory character towards france that in this they had been overruled by the president and that they had found no support for their opinion in the quarter to which they habitually looked for direction—mr hamilton but for this accidental coincidence in the views of the president and mr hamilton it is not unlikely that the breach would have commenced at this moment so little did the ministers feel under any obligations to sympathise with the responsible head of the administration mr wolcotts answer to the above questions is to be found at large in mr gibbss memoirs of the administrations of washington and john adams vol i pp  0     a work more valuable for the original documents it contains than for the spirit in which it is written the answer of mr pickering is equally long but much less ambiguous it advocates further negotiation as decidedly demanded by the country but it would dispense with all fraternizing words it points out certain alterations in the former treaties with france which might be made as concessions to place her more on the same footing on which great britain had been placed by jays treaty and specifies others as demands to be made of her the  th  0th and   th questions are answered affirmatively the following ones in the negative to the   th and last involving an important principle he says a project of instructions for negotiating a treaty with spain was laid before the senate in      and approved the peculiar situation of the united states and especially of the executive branch of the government in relation to france would render our adoption of that precedent highly expedient if we could trust to the fidelity of all the members of the senate there was no inducement of passions or interest to betray the instructions to spain but any instructions alike communicated for negotiating a new treaty with france would reach the directory sooner than we could send them to our minister mr mchenry is still more decided for further negotiation and for an offer to modify every commercial inequality between france and england he is adverse to any changes in the old treaties with france excepting only the mutual guaranties he answers the  th question in the negative to the  th he proposes the same course pursued in the case of great britain to the  th he recommends mild and calm terms he proposes in the ninth case that the claims be urged but not demanded he takes the affirmative of the  0th and   th the negative of the   th and   th questions and concludes by saying in the exercise of this branch of executive power it will be found the best course to reduce the coöperation of the senate to the appointment of the negotiator and the ultimate fiat or negative much i believe has been already done to this end and it may not for any partial reason be expedient to relinquish the ground which has been gained mr lee favors a new mission and every equalization of commercial rights between the united states and france and england even to the surrender of the principle of free ships free goods in the french treaty he also suggests changes in the old treaties thinks a discussion of the consular convention not necessary but if entered into at all proposes modifications he thinks the terms used in remonstrance should be those of candor and conciliation but explicit argumentative and independent the demands for reparation should also be moderate and reasonable the  th question is answered in the negative the  0th and   th in the affirmative in reply to the   th he suggests the offer made in his answer to the first france retaining her priority of date as to all articles in the treaties of      not modified he favors the idea of abolishing these treaties but would not propose it to france lastly he says no to the   th question for three reasons the third of which is— because no project consistent with the honor and interest of this country can be proposed at this time which will be satisfactory to the senate and to france too they are so wide in their ideas and principles that if ever they meet it must be in process of time which is constantly producing new events a project of this kind then if laid before the senate and approved by them would increase the chance of disappointment in the mission in proportion as the powers of negotiation are restrained and the sentiments of the senate are publicly known in the critical situation of things the best mode seems to be to communicate in explicit instructions what stipulations the envoy may make and what he must not agree to if proposed by france the aversion of two of the cabinet officers to the very proposal of a mission is now clearly seen in their own letters mr hamilton was obliged to speak plainly to check them on the  0th of march he wrote thus to wolcott i ought my good friend to apprise you for you may learn it from no other that a suspicion begins to dawn among the friends of the government that the actual administration is not much averse from war with france how very important to obviate this it also appears from the hamilton papers that mr pickering had already received from the president a check upon his eagerness to accumulate matter for irritation with france in advance of the assembling of congress that he immediately and secretly appealed from this judgment to mr hamilton who in reply hesitatingly counselled acquiescence this was done in less than four weeks after mr adamss induction into office see the letters between these parties indicating their disposition at this time hamiltons works vol vi pp                           this letter to governor mifflin had been submitted to the secretary of the treasury and his report dated on the   th of may concurred in by the secretary of state is incorporated almost entire in this reply   mr adams delicately avoids to state the main reason which was the resistance of his cabinet officers to the nomination which of these parties—mr gerry or the reluctant officers—proved by their conduct the most to have deserved his confidence is for posterity to judge from the evidence presented to it without partiality or prejudice   general forrest had communicated to mr adams from memory having heard it read the substance of one of the many letters circulated at this time by mr jefferson under the strongest injunctions that no copy should be allowed to be taken it is worth while to contrast the opinion here expressed of mr j with the uneasiness felt by mr hamilton and his friends lest mr adams should be led by that gentleman fortunate would it have been for all the parties if the idea of leading mr adams had not been always uppermost in their minds hamiltons works vol vi pp      0    i shall rely on your candor and goodness for a fair opportunity of removing every impression which in this age of intrigue and illiberality might be attempted to sap the foundation of your confidence in me i do not know that the attempt will be made but must expect my share of political persecution extract e gerry to john adams  0 july   the letter and deposition gave notice to the government of enlistments making in north carolina for some secret purpose mr pickering in his letter says i answered the judge that the papers would be submitted to your consideration and that perhaps you might think it proper to issue a proclamation to check the evil and warn the people of their danger i shall write advice of this discovery to the judges and district attorneys of south carolina and georgia and probably to the governors of the three southern states that they cooperate in counteracting such pernicious designs the instructions given by the secretary of war to the officer commanding the troops in tennessee may supersede the necessity of any other measures and by all these steps perhaps a proclamation may be rendered unnecessary   this is in answer to mr pickerings letter of the   th in which he says recent intelligence of the wretched condition of numbers of our seamen cast ashore by french privateers at st jago de cuba a place of no trade who for want of means of returning were constrained to enter on board the privateers joined to the former accounts of the ill treatment of others and their imprisonment by victor hugues determined me with the concurrence of the secretary of war to send the sophia on this voyage without more delay she will sail this day   it contained an offer to convey to the united states the title to a large tract of land in georgia   as agent of the united states before the board of commissioners upon british debts   president of the city council of philadelphia an attempt had been made to break open the house   this letter is printed in gibbss federal administrations vol i p       in the original organization of the departments a remarkable variation from the general system of accountability to the president had been made in the case of the secretary of the treasury who has ever since made his reports directly to the legislature and not under the supervision of the president mr adams appears to have considered this measure as another step in the same direction   mr wolcotts reply is to be found in mr gibbss work vol i p     he promised an argument on the last topic but he never sent it there is an opinion given upon it by the attorneygeneral in which he quotes five precedents without perceiving that these might be used as confirming the presidents view   this alludes to a passage in mr pickerings letter touching the translation and publication of his despatch to general pinckney of the   th of january preceding he says all the members of the legislature were furnished and officers of government m ségur and some others wish the case of gratitude had been touched more lightly general pinckney however thinks all that is said upon it was necessary the friends of vergennes says mountflorence do not like the facts laid to his charge m marbois would have wished colonel p had not so deeply pressed that matter   this was an address from noel the minister of the french directory in holland to the batavian convention designed to influence the adoption of the constitution by the people   printed in mr gibbss work vol i       no answers have been found to these questions on the part of the secretary of state or of the treasury the secretary of war in his reply dated the   th of february thought that there was a general aversion to war in the minds of the people of the united states and a particular dislike on the part of a portion of them to a war with france hence an express declaration was unadvisable as subjecting the country to all the chances of evil from the vengeance of an excited and victorious nation a mitigated hostility would therefore be most advisable which might leave a door open for negotiation this might consist of a truly vigorous defensive plan with a countenance still kept up to negotiate should therefore one or more of the commissioners remain in europe it might be well to leave them there not to lose the appearance of a disposition to negotiate if however they should all return it would be too humiliating to send them back in this view the measures proposed to congress should be   to give permission to merchant vessels under proper guards to arm for defence   to authorize the president to prepare as fast as possible twenty sloops of war from sixteen to twenty guns each   to authorize him to complete the three remaining frigates   to authorize him in case of open rupture to provide a number of ships of the line not exceeding ten   to declare the treaties of alliance and commerce suspended   to provide for an immediate army of sixteen thousand men and an auxiliary one of twenty thousand   to bring into action all the sources of revenue and to authorize an immediate loan the presidents message predicated on these measures should recite all the inducements in a grave and dignified tone an embargo did not seem to be eligible with regard to other nations it was not expedient to enter into any formal engagements with any of them yet it might be well to sound great britain about a loan about convoys and a coöperation in case of open rupture pointing to the floridas louisiana and the south american possessions of spain all on this side of the mississippi with new orleans to be ours in case of conquest it might be well too to make a provisional negotiation for ten ships of the line to have effect in case the president should receive the authority to provide so many a confidential messenger to be employed to communicate these instructions to the minister mr king the appointment of a day of national fast proper and expedient the attorneygeneral assuming that the envoys had been refused an audience thought all communications to congress should be by message the envoys ought to be recalled by an order of the president the president should recommend a declaration of war an embargo should not be laid except by way of reprisal on french vessels in our ports only an intimate connection with great britain to be avoided yet through a confidential messenger instructions might be given to mr king to make stipulations to open our ports to british privateers and to prohibit all trade with france our own merchant ships might arm an additional force to the army to seize upon new orleans in case spain should follow france the exequaturs to the french consuls to be revoked this opinion bears date the  th of march the presidents own opinion of the policy to be pursued towards great britain is sufficiently indicated by the form of the questions mr pickering invited mr hamilton to encourage an alliance offensive and defensive but mr hamilton was too wary to commit himself precipitately though clearly favoring the idea as an ultimate measure he especially urged the procuring a dozen british frigates to be sent to our coast to pursue the directions of this government see the letter of mr pickering and the answer hamiltons works vol vi p     p       mr forbes out of a sense of personal obligations for the rescue of his brother from prison and perhaps from death signed the address of the americans at paris to mr monroe upon his recall which paper in his view of the conduct of the executive that gentleman made great use of to sustain himself   wilkinson   colonel smith had served in the army during the war he received from the congress of the confederation the appointment of secretary of legation to the mission to great britain he there married the only daughter of mr adams his tastes were all for military life but after the failure of the expedition under general miranda in which he was engaged he retired to the interior of new york from whence he was sent as a representative to congress in      he died in        this letter is material in connection with the letter to the same person of the   th december of this year see p     and the note   no answer to these questions by the secretaries of state or of the treasury is found mr wolcott furnished a draft of a message which may have been his answer and which was adopted and sent to congress on the   th mr mchenry specifies two things as demanded by the french directory   a bribe of fifty thousand pounds sterling for the ministers and four of their corps   a loan for national purposes as a condition precedent to the suspension of the order to capture our vessels these demands being wholly inadmissible and no better being likely to be offered a full disclosure to congress of all the facts seems to be advisable and proper the objections to this course are   danger to the personal safety of the ministers   it may make an insurmountable bar to any future negotiation   it may be premature as circumstances might yet change the designs of the directory the first objection is thought to have but a slight foundation as the french seem to have expected publicity the second is better founded but the president in communicating to congress under an injunction of secrecy the requisition of the french devolves the responsibility of divulging it on congress as to the third there seems to be no just ground to suppose any favorable change in the directory as likely as to the second question mr mchenry would avoid an open declaration of war but instead of it proposed a defensive plan like that sketched out in his answer to the queries of the   th january the attorneygeneral thought it would be dangerous to the safety of the envoys in france if the disclosure of the facts were made known before their departure should be ascertained he was therefore not in favor of making the communications at this time to the second question he gave an affirmative answer provided the declaration were not made until the envoys were known to have left france mr pickering without the privity of any one as he says communicated by two separate letters of the   th to mr hamilton all the secret information of the government in one he answers a short letter of the   d urging the communication of the papers to congress and he darkly suggests the policy of a treaty offensive and defensive with great britain and proposes that provisional orders to that end should be sent to mr king in the other he incidentally mentions the fact that the president decided to keep back the despatches on the ground suggested by the attorneygeneral hamiltons works vol vi pp        notwithstanding the presidents decision a call was made by congress for the despatches on the  d of april and they were sent in the next day in this case writes the keeneyed jefferson there appeared a separate squad to wit the pinckney interest which is a distinct thing and will be seen sometime to lurch the president it is in truth the hamilton party whereof pinckney is only made the stalkinghorse see his letter to james madison randolphs jefferson vol iii p       m caro did not come being in great haste to return home he sent a letter a translation of which is appended to mr pickerings letter    august      he also addressed a letter to the same effect to mr adams which as repetition is omitted   inclosed with this adroit letter came the copy of a paper formally executed by three persons styled commissaries of an assembly of deputies of towns and provinces of south america held at madrid in spain on the  th of october      the purport of it was to mature a plan to effect the

part furnish the naval force not exceeding twenty ships of the line and the money whilst the united states should supply a land force of five thousand infantry and two thousand cavalry during the whole war that might ensue in case of success great britain was to have for her share the west india islands the exclusive supply of her own manufactures to south america and the exclusive right of transit over the isthmus the united states on their part were to be guaranteed the possession of florida and all the territory east of the mississippi general hamilton expected and desired to command the land force a fact which supplies a motive for the enlargement of the army and the desire of the command at this time quite independent of any apprehension of a french invasion general knox was likewise engaged in it and mr pickering was undoubtedly and mr mchenry probably privy to the whole movement it fell through because mr adams declined to give any reply to this appeal of general

dictating to the executive of the union he naturally desired the selection of such persons for his staff as were agreeable to him and as he could trust and this he must have had at any rate all that seems beyond this in his action was the work of others see the note to page     of this volume   mr adams has been censured for the sudden manner of making this nomination he had written to general

expected it see his letter to mr mchenry  th july sparkss washington vol xi p     such was the state of the popular feeling that had it been longer postponed another species of censure would have arisen from many of the very persons who as it was blamed his precipitation the difficulty seems to have been that he did not wait for the conditions as it respected other nominations which were maturing for him through the agency of general washington mr hamilton had been leading to this as early as the  d of june when he specified his own appointment see his letter to general washington of that date hamiltons works vol vi p       the law was passed on this day  th of july        these queries and answers do not seem to have been published before   this letter is inserted as essential to

informed of the extent of the sympathy which general miranda had succeeded in enlisting among some leading federalists miranda had been in the united states previous to the close of the revolution had been inspired there with the desire of effecting the independence of south america and had established many friendships in the army which he continued to cherish with that view   benjamin brooks of

though not probably meant for him the facts as now disclosed do not entirely acquit him of participation in the censure the purpose of this note will be to show that the remark itself was entirely just and to a much greater extent than mr adams himself had any conception of the proof to sustain each of the following propositions is furnished from the testimony of the parties themselves mr wolcott who seems to have had no share in the matter though by no means partial to mr adams admits in two successive letters that the difficulty grew out of mismanagement see the letters in gibbss

expressing any displeasure at this clandestine attempt to control the president in his favor wrote a letter on the  th of july fortifying the argument of mr pickering and disparaging the judgment of the president and sent it by the hands of the presidents own messenger mr mchenry who certainly was cognisant of its purpose this was to direct all the appointments to be made by the president sparkss washington vol xi appendix p       general washington although anxious to secure the services of mr hamilton and to give him the post he had himself selected in a preceding letter of the  d of june that of inspectorgeneral did not contemplate making him the second in command his design had been to make mr pinckney second and mr hamilton third in rank and this for reasons which he explained directly to mr pickering and as delicately as possible to mr hamilton himself with this last letter mr adams was made acquainted hamiltons works vol vi p     sparkss washington vol xi pp      0          mr pickering on first receiving a report of general washingtons state of mind from mr mchenry was disposed to claim for his letter of the  th the merit of turning the scale for mr hamilton but apparently discouraged for the moment by the contents of general washingtons reply to him dated the   th he communicated the substance of it to mr hamilton on the   th and sounded his disposition to give way hamiltons works vol vi p     p   0   mr hamilton replied on the   th expressing a reluctant assent to the possible priority of knox but objecting to the precedence of pinckney and concluding with a proposition that the relative rank might be left open for future settlement this letter though received by mr pickering in season to meet the wishes both of the president and of general washington was by him suppressed until after the list of officers as originally arranged by general washington had been sent to the senate in that list mr hamiltons name had been placed first although it is now clear that general washington did not mean to settle his rank by the act hamiltons works vol vi pp         the senate did not however know this when they ratified the nominations there is reason to believe they were left with the impression that he did intend it  0 general washington was prevailed upon to overcome his fears of the consequences of placing hamilton first in his list by the representations made to him through the channel of mr mchenry that such was the declared will of the federal characters of congress this he expressly states in his letters to general knox sparkss washington vol xi pp         hamiltons works vol vi p   0    general knox wrote a warm remonstrance in it among other things he says i have understood that when the list was presented to the senate some members from a mere sense of justice were desirous that the seniority i held the last war should be considered but they were silenced by the observation that the list was yours and therefore it could not be altered to you it was declared to be the public estimation sparkss washington vol xi appendix p        general washington on the  th of august sent this letter to mr hamilton with a letter of his own delicately intimating a disposition favorable to knox this hint had the effect of procuring a reluctant acquiescence of mr hamilton in any arrangement which washington might deem for the general good hamiltons works vol vi pp             the president did not consider the order of nominations to the senate as in itself deciding the priority of the officers named and so doubtful was mr pickering of the issue that it led to a renewal of efforts to rouse general washington to interfere as he was looked to finally to control the president to this end mr pickering wrote on the   st of august to stimulate mr hamilton to take such steps with the general as he might think proper to fix him in the station which the essential interests of the country require hamiltons works vol vi p     on the other hand mr hamilton on the   th wrote to stimulate mr pickering to make the general well understand that new england would rather see high command in his hands than in those of general knox vol vi p        it is to be noted that mr hamilton in addressing general knox many months after the decision endeavored to throw off the responsibility of it from himself upon others be persuaded also he says that the views of others not my own have given shape to what has taken place and that there has been a serious struggle between my respect and attachment for you and the impression of duty hamiltons works vol vi p  0     it likewise appears that mr pickering in a letter of the same date as that last cited covered the confidential letter of miranda to mr hamilton of the  th of april announcing the successful progress of his enterprise in england and the reply of the latter to miranda dated the   d of august besides describing a plan of coöperation announces that we are raising an army of about twelve thousand men and that he is appointed second in command mirandas application to the president had been received by him on the   th of august he knew the fact that mr hamilton had received a letter but nothing more hamiltons works vol vi pp         the curious reader is left carefully to compare these propositions with the letters quoted to verify them and then form his own opinion whether mr adams was right or wrong in saying there has been too much intrigue in this business with general washington and me he is also to judge how far the project of miranda contributed to stimulate the desire of mr hamilton and his friends to secure for him the virtual command of the army   mr hamilton in his letter says of this application in behalf of his nephew under these circumstances very contrary to the general rules by which i govern myself i take the liberty to request his appointment as a personal favor to myself and i venture to undertake for him that he will not discredit it the appointment will also lay himself and all his friends under a particular obligation let me at the same time beg you to be persuaded sir that i shall never on any other occasion place a recommendation to office on a similar footing   j q adams   mr pickering had written on the   th of august as follows mr adamss idea of a contingent stipulation with sweden respecting neutral ships neutralizing the goods on board strikes me as very eligible and as he observes will prevent our becoming the victims to the rule that free ships make free goods if our enemy does not adhere to it   a striking confirmation of this suspicion is found in mr pickerings letter to mr jay in which he gives mr mchenrys report to him of the visit to mount vernon it seems that mchenry admitted that general washington was some time balancing between the priority of colonel hamilton and general pinckney weighing the high respectability and importance of the latter in the three southern states against the superior talents of the former the latter finally preponderating the fact is fully established by washingtons own letters since printed hamiltons works vol vi p   0 mr pickering goes on to claim the decision as the result of his letter of the  th sent in advance of mr mchenry which he says general washingtondid not mention to that gentleman but he did not probably know of the secret letter sent by mr hamilton through mchenry himself—a letter the objects of which mchenry must have understood and which his desire for hamiltons success undoubtedly fortified through his conversation hence the probability is that the position finally taken by general washington was the result of all three influences combined hamiltons works vol vi pp           mr pickering had written thus dupont de nemours and some other french philosophers a delegation from the national institute had applied through sir joseph banks for passports from the english government the directory having given them passports to go to the united states with the view to improve and extend the sciences mr king understands the intention of the mission is to form an establishment high up the mississippi out of the limits of the united states and within the boundaries of spain mr king supposes that neither the american nor english government will be disposed to give any encouragement to this mission of the directory   bushrod washington   mr washington was appointed mr marshall declined in his letter to the secretary of state dated    september he says i pray you to make my respectful and grateful acknowledgments to the president for the very favorable sentiments concerning me which are indicated by his willingness to call me to so honorable and important a station as that of a judge of the united states the considerations which are insurmountable oblige me to decline the office i can assure you that i shall ever estimate properly both the dispositions of the president and the polite and friendly manner in which you have communicated them   the navy department had been organized in the month of may preceding and mr stoddert of maryland had been made the first secretary   this was a ship of twentyfour guns sent into hampton roads by captain nicholson on a suspicion of piracy mr stoddert was inclined to believe the vessel filled with french refugees under british protection in his letter he says i have written to the navy agent at norfolk to liberate on parole the officers and owners if they are confined unless there are stronger reasons than i am informed of to suspect them of piracy and to tell them they have nothing to apprehend if innocent and i have desired him to recommend them to able and honorable counsel which i have no doubt will meet with your approbation   on the   th mr pickering acknowledges the reception from mr humphreys of the despatches of mr gerry and others but he takes no notice of the questions   sparkss washingtons writings vol xi p  0  a marked difference is visible in the tone and sentiment of this letter and of that addressed to mr hamilton on the   th of july vol xi p     in the latter general washington clearly designates mr pinckney as the next to him in command in the former he says he intended the rank to be in the order of the names on his list in the one he complains of any variation from his list as an infraction of the condition of his acceptance in the other he distinctly alludes to the president as having a right to use his pleasure in the last resort one explanation of this change is to be found in the gradual action of third persons upon general washington by naming individuals known to be much disliked by him as likely to obtain appointments   this letter was probably the consequence of one addressed to mr adams by mr wolcott on the   th of the preceding month wherein an earnest effort was made to heal a misunderstanding which was widening into a breach between the president and general washington on the   th mr wolcott wrote to mr hamilton urging him to remain quiet and expressing the conviction that the embarrassment might have been entirely avoided in this mr wolcott is doubtless correct and by his more skilful tact mr adams was ultimately induced to concede the point but an imperfect draft of a letter designed to be a reply to mr wolcott remains among the papers which shows how accurately mr adams understood the true position which general washington had at first intended to occupy and the uses that had been made of both as explaining his views and feelings the greater part of it is not without interest mr wolcotts letter is printed in full in mr gibbss work vol ii pp      oliver wolcott    september      quincy john adams quincy    september      i have received your favor of the   th and read it over and over again with all the attention i am master of the long continued dangerous sickness of my best friend and her still precarious destiny have thrown my mind into a state of depression agitation and anxiety which will not admit of a full discussion of the various points on which you and i appear to differ in opinion i will hint at a few things which i see in a different light from that in which you have placed them in the first place i am under no apprehension at all for the honor personal influence or character of the chief of our nation whether he places general knox first or general hamilton if he thought for one moment that both those generals together could hurt his honor diminish his personal influence or injure his character he would resign his office at once this point therefore i hope is settled between you and me forever you are perfectly correct in your opinion that general washington has never disclosed a wish to interfere with any of the powers constitutionally vested in the president however perfect the concert between the president and commanderinchief it will remain for time to discover whether such jealousy rivalry and animosity will not be produced by the conflicting passions of powerful individuals as no authority in this country can possibly compose that is to say in other words it is a problem whether our constitution can possibly command an army and conduct a war whether general washington was or was not nominated to command the armies without any previous consultation or notice is nothing to the present questions nor has any one that i know of any motive or authority to inquire into this point i had evidence enough to convince me that he expected it that he wished it and that he would accept it otherwise i never would have nominated him that general washington formed a list out of names that i had committed to paper to be laid before him is true that after mature deliberation he settled the rank which in his judgment the officers in question ought to enjoy i do not admit and cannot believe it was never the advice of general washington as i understood it that the inspectorgeneral should be the first majorgeneral he never expressed any such idea to me his list contained no such idea when mr mchenry proposed to me to nominate him to the senate as first majorgeneral i positively refused to do it on the contrary in the letter from general washington to general hamilton which mr mchenry showed to me and which has never escaped my memory general washingtons expectation and inclination that general pinckney should be the first majorgeneral was not equivocal and besides he expressly says after all the whole must depend upon the president not one circumstance ever indicated that general washingtons advice or wish was that general hamilton should be first majorgeneral on the contrary his expectation and desire were clear to me that pinckney should be first† as to the expectation of the public i have had longer experience and better opportunities to know both than you have and i am not so clearly of your opinion general washingtons list gave no command to hamilton but as inspectorgeneral the commanderinchief might occasionally give him command it was plain to me from his list that general washington meant to leave the rank to be settled by friendly agreement among the gentlemen or by subsequent orders of the lieutenantgeneral or by a subsequent appeal to the president i am persuaded that no personal considerations distinct from the public interest have influenced general washington and i know that none have influenced me general knox is no favorite of mine any more than general hamilton i have no kind of attachment to him or affection for him more than for hamilton he never was my intimate nor my friend and he has no kind of attachment to me more than hamilton if you are not informed i am that knox never served my interest fame or promotion more than hamilton nay further i know he has opposed me more than ever hamilton did although in the earlier part of his life i contributed more than any man perhaps to recommend him merely on public principles to general washington lee c who first promoted him so rapidly knox however went through the war with honor and dignity and he is universally acknowledged to be brave cool attentive and able at all times and good humored as well as alert active and undaunted in the day of battle i know not why such an officer should be disgraced or degraded the resolutions of the old congress are not the only grounds nor the principal ground of my opinion that as matters now are circumstanced hamilton is the last in rank of the majorgenerals the office of inspectorgeneral gives no rank the rank of majorgeneral given him in his nomination and commission will give him rank before brigadiers but after every majorgeneral commissioned on the same day the rank of majorgeneral and the office and command of majorgeneral are different things as the case now stands hamilton will rank after lee and hand as well as pinckney and knox this is not my intention this may be remedied by dating the commissions of lee and hand after that of hamilton it is true but if something is not done you will find the pretensions of lee and hand set up i have seen more of general washingtons letters upon this subject than you have or mr mchenry and in my opinion it would be more discreet to say less about him upon this occasion than has been said i am not of your opinion that either knox or hamilton will refuse whatever may be their relative rank† if i were sure that both would refuse it should make no alteration for be assured i stand in no awe of either you seem to consider the affair as a measure of finance and if i was fully convinced that the appointment of hamilton would produce economical regulations of any great consequence it would have great weight with me for be assured there is not a democrat in the world who affects more horror than i really feel at the prospect of that frightful system of debts and taxes into which imperious necessity seems to be precipitating us if i should consent to the appointment of hamilton as second in rank i should consider it as the most responsible action of my whole life and the most difficult to justify hamilton is not a native of the united states but a foreigner and i believe has not resided longer at least not much longer in north america than albert gallatin his rank in the late army was comparatively very low his merits with a party are the merits of john calvin—   some think on calvin heavens own spirit fell   while others deem him instrument of hell i know that knox has no popular character even in massachusetts i know too that hamilton has no popular character in any part of america i have given so much attention to your representation that i have dated the commissions to knox pinckney and hamilton all on the same day in hopes that under the auspices of general washington the gentlemen may come to some amicable settlement of the dispute the rank of the other majorgenerals as well as of the brigadiers must be settled by the date of their commissions i shall do all in my power to persuade knox to accept this hasty letter written in deep affliction is fit only to be private and confidential but i hope it will appear wherever yours appears  the words are for after all it rests with the president to use his pleasure see the whole letter sparkss washington vol xi pp        † see page     note for a summary of the evidence on this point  this seems to imply a knowledge of general washingtons letters to general knox of the   th july and the  th of august in which the former clearly shows that the appointment of hamilton to be second was not his original purpose see sparkss washington vol xi pp         † in this he proved mistaken general knox did decline to serve under

vol ii p     pp        mr mchenrys letter is dated the   th of november it urges the composition of such a message as would lead congress to a declaration of war with france it suggests the mention of the surrender by spain of two posts on the east bank of the mississippi and a recommendation of the investment in the president of full power to take possession of louisiana and the floridas on behalf of spain in case of danger of their being seized by the french mr lees answer is dated the   th of october and relates to the place of meeting of congress he recommends baltimore in case the fever should continue in philadelphia in a later paper he dilates mainly upon the alien and sedition laws   this relates to the decision of the commissioners of whom mr egbert benson was one upon the boundary named as the river st croix in the treaty of        as mr pickering has quoted this note it is deemed but just to insert it in the present collection but at this distance of time the praise appears to savor too much of partisan feeling the sharp reply to the address placed mr adams on the one side in the attitude of combat with the opposition and on the other involved him with mr gerry the course marked out at the close of the letter commends itself to the judgment in all similar cases but addresses and answers have very properly gone entirely out of vogue   this was in answer to the following application by mr pickering i have now the honor to inclose some copies of an order for requiring the departure of aliens pursuant to the act of congress passed the   th of june last if the form of the order meets your approbation i respectfully submit to your consideration whether during your absence from the seat of government it may not be expedient to authorize the heads of departments to confer and decide on such alien cases as shall appear to require despatch should you think the law admits of this delegation of authority and it should at the same time appear to you expedient you will be pleased to sign and return the blank orders now inclosed   a second letter of the same date suggested that in case of the presidents having a doubt of the expediency or legality of delegating the power under the alien law he should sign orders for the three persons designated and it further mentioned the opinion of mr wolcott which mr adams confirms   this letter is of great importance as showing not only the state of mr adamss mind at this time upon the most disputed question during his administration but the early knowledge of it on the part of his cabinet officers who yet complained of his sudden determination in the nomination of mr murray four months later it now seems to explain the cause of the measures of counteraction to which they resorted instead of sending any answer or entering into a discussion of the questions involved a consultation was had denominated by mr jefferson a military conclave from the presence of some of the general officers then assembled at philadelphia and especially of mr hamilton at which a draught of a message was prepared obviously designed to preclude the presidents action upon the suggestions herein contained this draught was probably made by mr wolcott under the dictation of mr hamilton and it is conceded by mr gibbs to have been intended to leave no loophole for retreat yet mr hamilton must at the time have had in his hands rufus kings private letter to him from london assuring him that there would be no war and that france would propose to renew negotiations the failure of this attempt to coerce the president his substitution of a sentiment directly the opposite of the one submitted to him for adoption and the subsequent appeal to the federal members of congress to force the party into a declaration of war which likewise failed are treated more at large in another part of this work randolphs jefferson vol iii p     gibbss federal administrations vol ii p      hamiltons works vol vi p

the above letter on the same subject in order fully to perceive the purpose of its framers   mr mchenry in his letter had urged the president to come to the seat of government for the purpose of facilitating the organization of the new military forces   at this day it seems to be matter of astonishment that the truth of this proposition should not have been universally recognized it is difficult to resist the belief that an organization was by some contemplated as mr adams described it to appoint a general over the president sedgwick to hamilton hamiltons works vol vi p       see

elections of the country through a foreign agency but for mr jeffersons privity it is not probable that it would even then have been so unfavorably interpreted it was the characteristic of that gentleman to give clandestine encouragement to every movement and to be always surprised at the effect which followed the almost inevitable disclosure of his agency yet there is reason to believe that

the proof in such a case i would not nominate him to be a lieutenant but no such fact or proof has been presented to me   on the   th of july the senate confirmed the entire list of nominations as

when his name was proposed to the general officers for the commission of lieutenantcolonel he affirms that they declined to recommend him to the president the fact is that they reported him as one of two candidates in case he could clear himself from the charges made against him colonel smith sent his defence he was thereupon nominated to the senate by mr adams very unwillingly because he thought the place beneath his deserts and only after having consulted him through the above letter with the view of his declining it the opposition of colonel pickering was still carried on but the senate this time received colonel smiths defence and they confirmed the nomination without a division pickerings review p     j a to his wife ms    dec      journal executive proceedings senate u s vol i p  0  it is believed that no similar instance of disclosure of and interference with the action of the president by a cabinet officer in his confidence has ever occurred under the present form of government it is due to mr pickering to add that without appearing to have carefully analyzed the moral objections to his course of proceeding he expressed serious misgivings at one time about its propriety see his letter to j jay hamiltons works vol vi p   0   this is dated more than a month before the nomination of mr murray it followed the refusal to cut off in the message to congress all further opening for negotiation as proposed by the cabinet in november preceding and the letter of the  0th october before that suggesting the names of individuals who might in certain contingencies be nominated to negotiate see page  0  yet the cabinet officers professed complete surprise when mr murray was nominated the truth is that the struggle of the three cabinet officers had been all the while by every means to prevent that act and their disappointment at the failure through the steadiness of mr adams was in proportion   the following indorsement is in mr adamss handwriting answered orally   th by refusal to comply in colonel pickerings review printed in      he gives what he affirms to be all the corrections made by mr adams in his report that pointed out in this letter is not among them as no wilful misstatement was probably intended the inference is that he examined the revised copy to which he alludes this is the more likely as he himself admits that the parts he found struck out were of much less consequence than at first sight he had supposed they certainly do not correspond to mr adamss recollections of what they had been any more than to the tone of his own letter of november  th or to his later recollection of mr adamss reply to him at the time which he has made so emphatic by his mode of printing i am not going to send to congress a philippic against

motives had been very far from judicious in his mode of attempting to bring round a reconciliation between the two countries he had written to his brotherinlaw mr baldwin in march that the election of adams produced the order of the  d of march which was meant to be little short of a declaration of war thus making the president responsible for all the losses which took place under that decree merely because he had been selected by the people acting in their own legitimate sphere for the chief executive office and in a later letter of the   th july to james watson which had been submitted to the president even in stating the withdrawal by the french government of their most offensive acts he had urged peace measures not on their own merits but under the menace that a refusal would be considered as a declaration of war and it would be a war of the most terrible and vindictive kind these were not of the class of arguments likely to conciliate mr adams waits state papers vol iv p

concluded thus the city troops of horse marched towards northampton on thursday last we hear nothing to lead to an opinion that there will be any opposition   they arrived in a sloop of war from england their business respected st domingo the unsettled condition of which had excited great feeling both in great britain and the united states and led to much negotiation between them   mr mchenry had written finding that the two companies of horse whose services had been relied upon could turn out about sixty men only and that the opposition in northampton c had assumed a more threatening aspect i conceived it necessary to submit to the heads of department and attorneygeneral the expediency of my calling upon the governors of pennsylvania and new jersey to hold in readiness to march against the insurgents a respectable body of militia   mr mchenry had expressed a doubt whether under the act referred to the president had power to do more than fill vacancies in the army and navy which had happened during that session of the senate see the issue in the note to the letter of    may p       mr kings letters give an interesting account of his conferences first with lord grenville and afterwards with the same person mr pitt and mr dundas upon the difficulties and dangers growing out of the revolution of st domingo and the decision of the british government to send general maitland and colonel grant to negotiate with general toussaint   the main feature of these projects was to agree to one port viz portauprince as the sole port of entry for the trade of great britain and the united states to be placed within the control of a joint commercial company formed by the two governments   mr liston was vested with full powers to concert with the government of the united states the arrangements which might be mutually advantageous this joint action proposed by great britain in the affairs of st domingo seems at one time to have seriously threatened the dangers to the neutrality of the united states pointed out in the above letter on the  th of february mr pickering had written to mr hamilton for instructions what to do but his letter not having been published its substance can only be gathered by inference from the reply whilst mr hamilton promises a fuller answer the next day he designates the policy to be pursued towards the revolutionary chief toussaint to be no committal on the independence of st domingo no guaranty no formal treaty—nothing that can rise up in judgment it will be enough to let toussaint be assured verbally but explicitly that upon his declaration of independence a commercial intercourse will be opened c on the  0th of february mr pickering repeats his request for advice as he is about to draft instructions to the consulgeneral dr stevens the brotherinlaw of mr hamilton just appointed to go to st domingo it does not appear that he ever received any answer this may have been owing to the decision respecting mr murray which dissipated all prospect of executing through the president any of his policy in a confidential letter five days later after lamenting what he calls the fatal nomination of mr murray mr pickering goes on to say that the president will certainly do no act to encourage toussaint to declare the island independent mr liston the british minister however had obtained a very different impression of the intentions of the american government and was privately announcing an opposite system in the mean time mr adams seems to have known nothing of these secret consultations hamiltons works vol vi pp         vol vii p     article vi   it seems that a kinsman samuel adams of newington n h had written a letter inquiring whether there had not been some mistake and he was not the person for whom this appointment had been designed at the bottom of the sheet benjamin adams had added a recommendation of the writer for some other situation which occasioned the above reply   to superintend the construction of the frigates then building   in this letter general forrest spoke the genuine sense of probably not less than five sevenths of the federal party mr adamss answer scarcely meets the argument yet taking the cabinet as it was the only effect of a change of practice must have been to hasten its dissolution without giving time to establish a better one in the public confidence before the end of his term   this was a production of mr pickerings entitled by him observations on the sketch of proposed regulations for the trade of the island of st domingo received from the minister plenipotentiary of his britannic majesty to the united states of america   this is a copy of the articles points on which there is an understanding between the governments of great britain and the united states of america in consequence of the foregoing proposed regulations   it is understood that great britain and the united states have a common interest in preventing the dissemination of dangerous principles among the slaves of their respective countries and that they will mutually and sincerely attend to that interest to guard both against the danger here alluded to in consequence of the proposed intercourse with st domingo   that any infringement of the contemplated regulations which may be agreed upon with toussaint and which will constitute the basis of the determination of the two nations respectively to open a commercial intercourse with st domingo or any hostility commenced or manifestly intended on his part against either shall lead to an immediate suspension of intercourse with that island on the part of both nations while the laws of the united states authorize such a suspension on their part   that it is the interest of both nations to induce general toussaint to refuse an asylum to any french armed vessels in the ports of st domingo such an asylum being deemed incompatible with the safety of the proposed commercial intercourse   that it is the positive object of both nations by pacific arrangements to put an end in toto or as nearly as possible to all maritime operation or exertion of any kind in the island of st domingo   that the american consulgeneral in that island shall be instructed to assist in carrying into effect the proposed regulations   that no commercial vessel of either nation shall be permitted to enter the port or ports to be opened as before proposed until the day to be fixed according to the fifth article of the regulations to be proposed to general toussaint   as the present political state of st domingo is subject to constant change and fluctuation and as even its situation at the moment is not perfectly ascertained it is understood that the whole of the present arrangement shall be open to such future discussion and decision as the nature of the case in the opinion of the respective governments may demand timothy pickering oliver wolcott james mchenry ben stoddert charles lee  0 april        owing to the immediate departure of general maitland the papers were drawn up by mr pickering with the assent of the other cabinet officers and sent without referring them to mr adams subject to his ultimate decision however to approve or reject the propositions made   mr mchenry recommended that the relative rank at the close of the revolutionary war of all such officers as had served in that war should govern liable to exceptions in cases of extraordinary service or merit on the   d of april mr mchenry had addressed a letter to mr hamilton requesting his opinion on this subject the reply does not appear but it is fair to infer that it was the same as that presented by mr mchenry to the president as his own hamiltons works vol v p   0   mr stoddert in furnishing the information that such an establishment as is here described was about to be formed at a spot about sixty miles from the havana and was threatening the trade to spanish america advised the equipment of one frigate and two or three smaller vessels with a land force of three hundred men to break it up in case the governor of the island should decline to act   in absenting himself from the seat of government during the recess of congress mr adams did no more than his predecessor general washington there can be little doubt that the habit of cabinet officers assuming responsibility and consulting with persons outside to counteract the action of the president when not agreeable grew out of this practice a remarkable instance of it in washingtons time is found in the case of the nomination of mr rutledge to be chief justice see gibbss federal administrations vol i p       0   to negotiate a treaty with russia   the tenth article stands as follows  0 the twentythird article of our treaty with prussia forbade the commissioning of privateers to take or destroy the trading vessels or to interrupt the commerce of the contracting parties in case a war should arise between them but in the renewal of the prussian treaty if it should be renewed this article is to be omitted the lawfulness of privateering will not be questioned but all possible precautions should be taken to prevent abuses the policy of privateering is peculiarly applicable to the united states our public naval force is and for some time to come will be inconsiderable but we are strong in the number of our seamen in private wealth and in the uncommon enterprise of our citizens hence a principal means of annoying a maritime commercial enemy would be our privateers   this was upon the question raised in the letter of the   th of april see page     it now appears that mr mchenry consulted mr hamilton who confirmed him in his opinion hamiltons works vol v p     he had also consulted the attorneygeneral mr lee who considered an office created during the session of the senate and not filled by appointment by and with the advice and consent of the senate as a vacancy happening during the session which the president cannot fill during the recess by the powers vested in him by the constitution without a legislative act of congress enabling him to do it this legislative act was passed on the  d of march      entitled an act authorizing the president of the united states to fill certain vacancies in the army and navy he therefore thought the president had the power of appointment mr mchenrys letter says nothing of his having consulted mr hamilton   to quell the disturbances in northampton county pennsylvania   the following abstract was sent by the attorneygeneral in answer to this application copy of mr rawles note of mr lewiss reasons for the opinion that the crime of fries was not treason united states v fries the substance of mr lewiss argument as to the question of treason in this case was as follows treason consists in resisting by force or means of intimidation the government and laws of the country to resist the execution of a single law is not treason unless it is the militia law it is treason to resist the militia law because the militia is the ultimate remedy to be employed by the executive authority to enforce all laws and therefore if the militia law cannot be enforced it may disable the executive from enforcing any of the laws mr adams afterwards obtained from messrs lewis and dallas a full statement of their argument this has been already printed in whartons state trials pp        this was an application to know whether a convoy or any public protection would be afforded to the american commerce with bilbao in spain   the district judge of south carolina had declined to deliver up to sir hyde parker a seaman who had been engaged in a mutiny and murder of the officers of the british frigate hermione   mr pickering says in his letter i have this moment received your favor of the  th instant and will make out governor davies commission but for the very reason that he is the governor of north carolina and it is important to that state and to the union that such a man should hold the reins of government there i beg leave to suggest the expediency of not requiring his immediate acceptance of the commission because it would vacate his office of governor while it remained uncertain whether he would be ever called to proceed on his mission to france perfect silence on the subject at present appearing to me most eligible i further beg leave to ask whether it will not be eligible to suspend the publication of governor henrys letter until it shall be necessary to make public governor davies appointment   mr shieflin was an indian agent and the complaint was aimed at the secretary of war mr mchenry for his treatment of the indians   a ship of five or six hundred tons laden with masts and timber intended for the regency of algiers   of anonymous letters in every variety of tone there are numbers among the papers of the adamses both father and son as the one above alluded to is brief it may serve for a specimen of a class president adams myself and family are ruined by the french if you do not procure satisfaction for my losses when a treaty is made with them i am undone forever and you must be a villain to your country assassination shall be your lot if restitution is lost to america through your means or if ever you agree to a peace without it the subsistence of thousands who have lost their all depends upon it a ruined merchant alas with ten children made beggars by the french   see page     note   on the same point mr pickering writes on the   th to the surprise and chagrin of many mr lewiss motion for a new trial in the case of john fries has prevailed   a pardon   see the letter of mr hamilton to the secretary of war of the  0th of april stating the case of hunt and urging a confirmation of the sentence hamiltons works vol v p     another also at a later period urges upon mr mchenry to bestow great pains upon satisfying the president that severity was indispensable it bears the same date with mr mchenrys hamiltons works vol v p       in this case the man pleaded guilty and but a single witness was examined in a later letter of the   th mr mchenry says i think it probable that some of the officers composing the court at least were of the twelve new regiments and consequently without commissions the fact was that not a single officer had received a commission   an extremely moderate judgment of the proceedings it would seem that this court was constituted by the sole authority of the captain commandant that the prisoner prior to the qualification of the members was asked if he had objections to any of them that he did object to the commandant and two members and that this objection having been overruled by them he then refused to plead in great britain a decision upon such premises would have subjected the members to severe penalties in the commonlaw courts for an instance see vol ii p  0  note   on the fifth of july a report was made upon this case and signed by the four secretaries concluding as follows— as the crime is of a dangerous tendency and as the tender of service in the navy cannot be accepted consistently with public policy we are respectfully of opinion that a pardon ought not to be granted   an elaborate paper was drawn up by mr pickering upon the unfavorable aspect of general maitlands negotiation with toussaint which was concurred in by all the cabinet officers   a complaint against two american privateers for stopping an english vessel and breaking the seals of british despatches on board   a part of mr wolcotts letter is printed in mr gibbss work vol ii p       mr mchenry proposed to offer to count rumford a vacant commission of lieutenantcolonel and inspector of artillery or to make him an engineer and superintendent of the proposed military school   a mistake was made in the proclamation as to the time of opening the ports of cape françois and portauprince to vessels sailing from the united states   in transmitting the plan alluded to which was the work of general hamilton mr mchenry had ended his letter in this way— being a nation and not of the lowest order there are three things essential to the maintenance of our proper grade among the powers of the earth   an army and means adequate to its support   a system calculated to keep its wants regularly supplied   genius in the general who commands it if we can combine these three things with a navy and i hope we can we shall have nothing to fear from without or within herein is visible the germ of the difference of opinion between the president and three of his cabinet directed by mr hamilton which made itself visible at a later period the former rested upon the navy the latter upon the army as the principal means of defence both favored a military school hamiltons works hamilton to mchenry vol v p   0 mchenry to hamilton p  0  hamilton to king vol vi p       frigate   isaac hull afterwards celebrated as the commander of this ship   mr stoddert had recommended his removal to another vessel on account of personal difficulties among the officers   so in the copy but obviously an error   this question was submitted by mr mchenry in a long letter addressed to his colleagues mr wolcott drew a distinction between civil and military commissions and thought the members of this court were military officers without commissions mr pickering thought the appointment of an officer might be complete without a commission—this being only the best evidence of it mr stoddert agreed with mr pickering in his opinion but objected to all the later proceedings in hunts case on another account when the proceedings were first presented to mr mchenry it did not appear on the face of them that two thirds of the members present had concurred as required in a sentence of death by the  th article of the appendix to the rules of war they were returned to general hamilton who caused the omission to be supplied by an interlineation in the sentence and the president of the court and the judge advocate added their certificate that more than two thirds of the members did concur and that the omission so to state it was accidental mr stoddert thought that the president and judge advocate had no right by themselves to assume such an authority but he thought that the original omission might not vitiate the proceeding if it had not been the practice established in courtmartials heretofore to insert the form the celebrated case of marbury v madison and the act of mr jefferson in annulling the appointment of justices of the peace by withholding their commissions will occur to the mind of every reader   see page     for mr adamss first letter on this subject mr mchenry thought the powers amply sufficient but he promised to submit the question to the members of the cabinet for their mature opinions none such are to be found among mr adamss papers   mr listons messenger isaac livesey had been arrested in bucks county pennsylvania on a well grounded charge of horse stealing his trunks had been forced and the letters of mr liston opened by the officers apparently without any ill intent   see page     note for the substance of these opinions   this suggestion seems to have been adopted by general hamilton in the case of hunt hamiltons works vol v p       john davis district attorney of massachusetts afterwards for a long period judge of the district court   they were addressed to mr russell president of the british frontier in upper canada they are curious as imputing to the administration a design to encourage the revolt of toussaint against france in st domingo when mr pickering expressly declares that the president would do no such thing hamiltons works vol vi p     see page     note whartons state trials p       two indictments were drawn but the grounds being found insufficient the prosecution was discontinued   the opinion of mr stoddert fortified by that of the attorneygeneral had been that through the reduction of the navy in      silas talbot one of three officers discharged from service had lost his right of precedence of captain truxtun who had been retained so that on his restoration to the service in      he was to be considered as a junior captain   mr stoddert replied to this letter— the alteration directed shall be made in the register of captain talbots commission and i beg leave to add without any regrets arising from my opinion on that subject being overruled i never doubted that talbot had merit equal to any man in our service c c i believe the world will think the determination a proper one it shall not be my fault if any inconvenience to the service is produced by it   it is material to an accurate knowledge of events during this critical period to record the date of reception of these letters this and the succeeding one were received by mr adams at quincy on the  th of october      being written partly in the cipher of the department of state of which mr a had no key he sent them on the  0th to philadelphia to be deciphered with a charge to mr pickering to keep their contents within his own bosom mr p returned them deciphered on the   th with a letter speaking of the first as in different points of view very interesting the effect on mr adamss own mind is expressed in his reply   th october      page      to enable you sir to burn the name i have put it on a piece of paper separate it was admiral de winter   this letter was transmitted by mr pickering in a letter dated   th october two days after nos   and   had been sent deciphered  spoors president of the directory   mr murray mistakes the date it was his letter of the  st   a portion of this letter has never been deciphered neither is there any record of its date of reception probably it was about the middle of november before mr adams left quincy   inclosed with this came a number of the nouvelles politiques of the  d of august published at leyden containing the letter of m talleyrand to mr gerry of the    messidor    july which had been published at paris on the   th with introductory remarks betraying a sense that the french government had gone too far in permitting the negotiation to bebroken off the following passage is underlined in ink— il est certain que notre gouvernement paroît avoir mis autant dempressement à ouvrir des négociations amicales avec le troisième envoyé américain quil a témoigné dindifference ou même de froideur avant le départ de ses deux collègues messrs pinckney et marshall   the first portion of this letter relates to a matter of no public interest   indorsed on the cover of this letter in the handwriting of mr adams received from the post jan         the reason why this date is important may be gathered by comparing the charge of mr pickering based upon mr adamss implied approbation of all the sentiments of his report of the   th of the same month see pickerings review p       there is no date of reception marked on this letter but it must have been received by the early part of february as the inclosure which accompanied it made the basis of the nomination of mr murray to the senate on the   th of that month mr joel barlows letter from paris dated five days earlier is recorded as received by general washington on the last day of january with these lights it is amusing to observe the extent to which party spirit drove mr jefferson from the truth in his conjectures as to the motives in making that nomination see his letter to james madison randolphs jefferson vol iii p     sparkss washington vol xi p       it is due to mr murray to say
