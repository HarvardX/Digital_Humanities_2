that all who will without restraint may drink may largely drink even till their bowels burst pleading no right but merely that of thirst at the pure waters of the living well beside whose streams the muses love to dwell verse is with them a knack an idle toy a rattle gilded over on which a boy may play untaught whilst without art or force make it but jingle music comes of course little do such men know the toil the pains the daily nightly racking of the brains to range the thoughts the matter to digest to cull fit phrases and reject the rest to know the times when humor on the cheek of mirth may hold her sports when wit should speak and when be silent when to use the powers of ornament and how to place the flowers so that they neither give a tawdry glare nor waste their sweetness in the desert air to form which few can do and scarcely one one critic in an age can find when done to form a plan to strike a grand outline to fill it up and make the picture shine a full and perfect piece to make coy rhyme renounce her follies and with sense keep time to make proud sense against her nature bend and wear the chains of rhyme yet call her friend some fops there are amongst the scribbling tribe who make it all their business to describe no matter whether in or out of place studious of finery and fond of lace alike they trim as coxcomb fancy brings the rags of beggars and the robes of kings let dull propriety in state preside over her dull children nature is their guide wild nature who at random breaks the fence of those tame drudges judgment taste and sense nor would forgive herself the mighty crime of keeping terms with person place and time let liquid gold emblaze the sun at noon with borrowed beams let silver pale the moon let surges hoarse lash the resounding shore let streams maeander and let torrents roar let them breed up the melancholy breeze to sigh with sighing sob with sobbing trees let vales embroidry wear let flowers be tinged with various tints let clouds be laced or fringed they have their wish like idle monarch boys neglecting things of weight they sigh for toys give them the crown the scepter and the robe who will may take the power and rule the globe others there are who in one solemn pace with as much zeal as quakers rail at lace railing at needful ornament depend on sense to bring them to their journeys end they would not heaven forbid their course delay nor for a moment step out of the way to make the barren road those graces wear which nature would if pleased have planted there vain men who blindly thwarting natures plan never find a passage to the heart of man who bred amongst fogs in academic land scorn every thing they do not understand who destitute of humor wit and taste let all their little knowledge run to waste and frustrate each good purpose whilst they wear the robes of learning with a slovens air though solid reasoning arms each sterling line though truth declares aloud this work is mine vice whilst from page to page dull morals creep throws by the book and virtue falls asleep sense mere dull formal sense in this gay town must have some vehicle to pass her down nor can she for an hour ensure her reign unless she brings fair pleasure in her train let her from day to day from year to year in all her grave solemnities appear and with the voice of trumpets through the streets deal lectures out to every one she meets half who pass by are deaf and the other half can hear indeed but only hear to laugh quit then ye graver sons of lettered pride taking for once experience as a guide quit this grand error this dull college mode be your pursuits the same but change the road write or at least appear to write with ease and if you mean to profit learn to please in vain for such mistakes they pardon claim because they wield the pen in virtues name thrice sacred is that name thrice blessed the man who thinks speaks writes and lives on such a plan this in himself himself of course must bless but cannot with the world promote success he may be strong but with effect to speak should recollect his readers may be weak plain rigid truths which saints with comfort bear will make the sinner tremble and despair true virtue acts from love and the great end at which she nobly aims is to amend how then do those mistake who arm her laws with rigor not their own and hurt the cause they mean to help whilst with a zealot rage they make that goddess whom they would have engage our dearest love in hideous terror rise such may be honest but they cannot be wise in her own full and perfect blaze of light virtue breaks forth too strong for human sight the dazzled eye that nice but weaker sense shuts herself up in darkness for defense but to make strong conviction deeper sink to make the callous feel the thoughtless think like god made man she lays her glory by and beams mild comfort on the ravished eye in earnest most when most she seems in jest she worms into and winds around the breast to conquer vice of vice appears the friend and seems unlike herself to gain her end the sons of sin to while away the time which lingers on their hands of each black crime to hush the painful memory and keep the tyrant conscience in delusive sleep read on at random nor suspect the dart until they find it rooted in their heart against vice they give their vote nor know at first that cursing that themselves too they have cursed they see not till they fall into the snares deluded into virtue unawares thus the shrewd doctor in the spleenstruck mind when pregnant horror sits and broods over wind discarding drugs and striving how to please lures on insensibly by slow degrees the patient to those manly sports which bind the slackened sinews and relieve the mind the patient feels a change as wrought by stealth and wonders on demand to find it health some few whom fate ordained to deal in rimes in other lands and here in other times whom waiting at their birth the midwife muse sprinkled all over with castalian dews to whom true genius gave his magic pen whom art by just degrees led up to men some few extremes wellshunnd have steered between these dangerous rocks and held the golden mean sense in their works maintains her proper state but never sleeps or labors with her weight grace makes the whole look elegant and gay but never dares from sense to run astray so nice the masters touch so great his care the colors boldly glow not idly glare mutually giving and receiving aid they set each other off like light and shade and as by stealth with so much softness blend it is hard to say where they begin or end both give us charms and neither gives offense sense perfects grace and grace enlivens sense peace to the men who these high honors claim health to their souls and to their memries fame be it my task and no mean task to teach a reverence for that worth i cannot reach let me at distance with a steady eye observe and mark their passage to the sky from envy free applaud such rising worth and praise their heaven though pinioned down to earth had i the power i could not have the time whilst spirits flow and life is in her prime without a sin against pleasure to design a plan to methodize each thought each line highly to finish and make every grace in itself charming take new charms from place nothing of books and little known of men when the mad fit comes on i seize the pen rough as they run the rapid thoughts set down rough as they run discharge them on the town hence rude unfinished brats before their time are born into this idle world of rhyme and the poor slattern muse is brought to bed with all her imperfections on her head some as no life appears no pulses play through the dull dubious mass no breath makes way doubt greatly doubt till for a glass they call whether the child can be baptized at all others on other grounds objections frame and granting that the child may have a name doubt as the sex might well a midwife pose whether they should baptize it verse or prose even what my masters please bards mild meek men in love to critics stumble now and then something i do myself and something too if they can do it leave for them to do in the small compass of my careless page critics may find employment for an age without my blunders they were all undone i twenty feed where mason can feed one when satire stoops unmindful of her state to praise the man i love curse him i hate when sense in tides of passion borne along sinking to prose degrades the name of song the censor smiles and whilst my credit bleeds with as high relish on the carrion feeds as the proud earl fed at a turtle feast who turned by gluttony to worse than beast eat till his bowels gushed upon the floor yet still eat on and dying called for more when loose digression like a colt unbroke spurning connection and her formal yoke bounds through the forest wanders far astray from the known path and loves to loose her way it is a full feast to all the mongril pack to run the rambler down and bring her back when gay description fancys fairy child wild without art and yet with pleasure wild waking with nature at the morning hour to the larks call walks over the opening flower which largely drank all night of heavens fresh dew and like a mountain nymph of dians crew so lightly walks she not one mark imprints nor brushes off the dews nor soils the tints when thus description sports even at the time that drums should beat and cannons roar in rhyme critics can live on such a fault as that from one month to the other and grow fat ye mighty monthly judges in a dearth of lettered blockheads conscious of the worth of my materials which against your will often you have confessed and shall confess it still materials rich though rude enflamed with thought though more by fancy than by judgment wrought take use them as your own a work begin which suits your genius well and weave them in framed for the critic loom with critic art till thread on thread depending part on part color with color mingling light with shade to your dull taste a formal work is made and having wrought them into one grand piece swear it surpasses rome and rivals greece nor think this much for at one single word soon as the mighty critic fiats heard science attends their call their power is owned order takes place and genius is dethroned letters dance into books defiance hurled at means as atoms danced into a world me higher business calls a greater plan worthy mans whole employ the good of man the good of man committed to my charge if idle fancy rambles forth at large careless of such a trust these harmless lays may friendship envy and may folly praise the crown of gotham may some scot assume and vagrant stuarts reign in churchills room o my poor people o thou wretched earth to whose dear love though not engaged by birth my heart is fixed my service deeply sworn how by thy father can that thought be borne for monarchs would they all but think like me are only fathers in the best degree how must thy glories fade in every land thy name be laughed to scorn thy mighty hand be shortened and thy zeal by foes confessed blessed in thy self to make thy neighbors blessed be robbed of vigor how must freedoms pile the boast of ages which adorns the isle and makes it great and glorious feared abroad happy at home secure from force and fraud how must that pile by ancient wisdom raised on a firm rock by friends admired and praised envied by foes and wondered at by all in one short moment into ruins fall should any slip of stuarts tyrant race or bastard or legitimate disgrace thy royal seat of empire but what care what sorrow must be mine what deep despair and selfreproaches should that hated line admittance gain through any fault of mine cursed be the cause whence gothams evils spring though that cursed cause be found in gothams king let war with all his needy ruffian band in pomp of horror stalk through gothams land kneedeep in blood let all her stately towers sink in the dust that court which now is ours become a den where beasts may if they can a lodging find nor fear rebuke from man where yellow harvests rise be brambles found where vines now creep let thistles curse the ground dry in her thousand valleys be the rills barren the cattle on her thousand hills where power is placed let tigers prowl for prey where justice lodges let wild asses bray let cormorants in churches make their nest and on the sails of commerce bitterns rest be all though princes in the earth before her merchants bankrupts and her marts no more much rather would i might the will of fate give me to choose see gothams ruined state by ills on ills thus to the earth weighed down than live to see a stuart wear her crown let heaven in vengeance arm all natures host those servants who their maker know who boast obedience as their glory and fulfill unquestioned their great masters sacred will let raging winds root up the boiling deep and with destruction big over gotham sweep let rains rush down till faith with doubtful eye looks for the sign of mercy in the sky let pestilence in all her horrors rise wherever i turn let famine blast my eyes let the earth yawn and ere they have time to think in the deep gulf let all my subjects sink before my eyes whilst on the verge i reel feeling but as a monarch ought to feel not for myself but them i will kiss the rod and having owned the justice of my god myself with firmness to the ruin give and die with those for whom i wished to live this but may heavens more merciful decrees never tempt his servant with such ills as these this or my soul deceives me i could bear but that the stuart race my crown should wear that crown where highly cherished freedom shone bright as the glories of the midday sun born and bred slaves that they with proud misrule should make brave freeborn men like boys at school to the whip crouch and tremble  o that thought the laboring brain is even to madness brought by the dread vision at the mere surmise the thronging spirits as in tumult rise my heart as for a passage loudly beats and turn me where i will distraction meets o my brave fellows great in arts and arms the wonder of the earth whom glory warms to high achievements can your spirits bend through base control ye never can descend so low by choice to wear a tyrants chain or let in freedoms seat a stuart reign if fame who has for ages far and wide spread in all realms the cowardice the pride the tyranny and falsehood of those lords contents you not search englands fair records england where first the breath of life i drew where next to gotham my best love is due there once they ruled though crushed by williams hand they rule no more to curse that happy land the first who from his native soil removed held englands scepter a tame tyrant proved virtue he lacked cursed with those thoughts which spring in souls of vulgar stamp to be a king spirit he had not though he laughed at laws to play the boldfacd tyrant with applause on practices most mean he raised his pride and craft often gave what wisdom often denied never could he feel how truly man is blessed in blessing those around him in his breast crowded with follies honor found no room marked for a coward in his mothers womb he was too proud without affronts to live too timorous to punish or forgive to gain a crown which had in course of time by fair descent been his without a crime he bore a mothers exile to secure a greater crown he basely could endure the spilling of her blood by foreign knife nor dared revenge her death who gave him life nay by fond fear and fond ambition led struck hands with those by whom her blood was shed called up to power scarce warm on englands throne he filled her court with beggars from his own turn where you would the eye with scots was caught or english knaves who would be scotsmen thought to vain expense unbounded loose he gave the dupe of minions and of slaves the slave on false pretenses mighty sums he raised and damned those senates rich whom poor he praised from empire thrown and doomed to beg her bread on foreign bounty whilst a daughter fed he lavished sums for her received on men whose names would fix dishonor on my pen lies were his playthings parliaments his sport bookworms and catamites engrossed the court vain of the scholar like all scotsmen since the pedant scholar he forgot the prince and having with some trifles stored his brain never learned or wished to learn the arts to reign enough he knew to make him vain and proud mocked by the wise the wonder of the crowd false friend false son false father and false king false wit false statesman and false every thing when he should act he idly chose to prate and pamphlets wrote when he should save the state religious if religion holds in whim to talk with all he let all talk with him not on gods honor but his own intent not for religion sake but argument more vain if some sly artful high dutch slave or from the jesuit school some precious knave conviction feigned than if to peace restored by his full soldiership worlds hailed him lord power was his wish unbounded as his will the power without control of doing ill but what he wished what he made bishops preach and statesmen warrant hung within his reach he dared not seize fear gave to gall his pride that freedom to the realm his will denied of treaties fond oerweening of his parts in every treaty of his own mean arts he fell the dupe peace was his coward care even at a time when justice called for war his pen he would draw to prove his lack of wit but rather than unsheathe the sword submit truth fairly must record and pleased to live in league with mercy justice may forgive kingdoms betrayed and worlds resigned to spain but never can forgive a raleigh slain at length with white let freedom mark that year not feared by those whom most he wished to fear not loved by those whom most he wished to love he went to answer for his faults above to answer to that god from whom alone he claimed to hold and to abuse the throne leaving behind a curse to all his line the bloody legacy of right divine with many virtues which a radiance fling round private men with few which grace a king and speak the monarch at that time of life when passion holds with reason doubtful strife succeeded charles by a mean sire undone who envied virtue even in a son his youth was froward turbulent and wild he took the man up ere he left the child his soul was eager for imperial sway ever he had learned the lesson to obey surrounded by a fawning flattering throng judgment each day grew weak and humor strong wisdom was treated as a noisome weed and all his follies let to run to seed what ills from such beginnings needs must spring what ills to such a land from such a king what could she hope what had she not to fear base buckingham possessed his youthful ear strafford and laud when mounted on the throne engrossed his love and made him all their own strafford and laud who boldly dared avow the traitorous doctrines taught by tories now each strove tundo him in his turn and hour the first with pleasure and the last with power thinking vain thought disgraceful to the throne that all mankind were made for kings alone that subjects were but slaves and what was whim or worse in common men was law in him drunk with prerogative which fate decreed to guard good kings and tyrants to mislead which in a fair proportion to deny allegiance dares not which to hold too high no good can wish no coward king can dare and held too high no english subject bear besieged by men of deep and subtle arts men void of principle and damned with parts who saw his weakness made their king their tool then most a slave when most he seemed to rule taking all public steps for private ends deceived by favorites whom he called friends he had not strength enough of soul to find that monarchs meant as blessings to mankind sink their great state and stamp their fame undone when what was meant for all they give to one listening uxorious whilst a womans prate modeled the church and parcelld out the state whilst in the state not more than women read highchurchmen preached and turned his pious head tutored to see with ministerial eyes forbid to hear a loyal nations cries made to believe what cannot a favorite do he heard a nation hearing one or two taught by statequacks himself secure to think and out of danger even on dangers brink whilst power was daily crumbling from his hand whilst murmurs ran through an insulted land as if to sanction tyrants heaven was bound he proudly sought the ruin which he found twelve years twelve tedious and inglorious years did england crushed by power and awed by fears whilst proud oppression struck at freedoms root lament her senates lost her hampden mute illegal taxes and oppressive loans in spite of all her pride called forth her groans patience was heard her griefs aloud to tell and loyalty was tempted to rebel each day new acts of outrage shook the state new courts were raised to give new doctrines weight stateinquisitions kept the realm in awe and cursed starchambers made or ruled the law juries were packed and judges were unsound through the whole kingdom not one pratt was found from the first moments of his giddy youth he hated senates for they told him truth at length against his will compelled to treat those whom he could not fright he strove to cheat with base dissembling every grievance heard and often giving often broke his word o where shall helpless truth for refuge fly if kings who should protect her dare to lie those who the general good their real aim sought in their countrys good their monarchs fame those who were anxious for his safety those who were induced by duty to oppose their truth suspected and their worth unknown he held as foes and traitors to his throne nor found his fatal error till the hour of saving him was gone and past till power had shifted hands to blast his hapless reign making their faith and his repentance vain hence be that curse confined to gothams foes war dread to mention civil war arose all acts of outrage and all acts of shame stalked forth at large disguised with honors name rebellion raising high her bloody hand spread universal havoc through the land with zeal for party and with passion drunk in public rage all private love was sunk friend against friend brother against brother stood and the sons weapon drank the fathers blood nature aghast and fearful lest her reign should last no longer bled in every vein unhappy stuart harshly though that name grates on my ear i should have died with shame to see my king before his subjects stand and at their bar hold up his royal hand at their commands to hear the monarch plead by their decrees to see that monarch bleed what though thy faults were many and were great what though they shook the basis of the state in royalty secure thy person stood and sacred was the fountain of thy blood vile ministers who dared abuse their trust who dared seduce a king to be unjust vengeance with justice leagued with power made strong had nobly crushed the king could do no wrong yet grieve not charles nor thy hard fortunes blame they took thy life but they secured thy fame their greater crimes made thine like specks appear from which the sun in glory is not clear had thou in peace and years resigned thy breath at natures call had thou laid down in death as in a sleep thy name by justice borne on the four winds had been in pieces torn pity the virtue of a generous soul sometimes the vice has made thy memory whole misfortunes gave what virtue could not give and bade the tyrant slain the martyr live ye princes of the earth ye mighty few who worlds subduing cannot yourselves subdue who goodness scorned wish only to be great whose breath is blasting and whose voice is fate who own no law no reason but your will and scorn restraint though it is from doing ill who of all passions groan beneath the worst then only blessed when they make others cursed think not for wrongs like these unscourgd to live long may ye sin and long may heaven forgive but when ye least expect in sorrows day vengeance shall fall more heavy for delay nor think that vengeance heaped on you alone shall poor amends for injured worlds atone no like some base distemper which remains transmitted from the tainted fathers veins in the sons blood such broad and general crimes shall call down vengeance even to latest times call vengeance down on all who bear your name and make their portion bitterness and shame from land to land for years compelled to roam whilst usurpation lorded it at home of majesty unmindful forced to fly not daring like a king to reign or die recalled to repossess his lawful throne more at his peoples seeking than his own another charles succeeded in the school of travel he had learned to play the fool and like pert pupils with dull tutors sent to shame their country on the continent from love of england by long absence weaned from every court he every folly gleaned and was so close do evil habits cling till crowned a beggar and when crowned no king those grand and general powers which heaven designed an instance of his mercy to mankind were lost in storms of dissipation hurled nor would he give one hour to bless a world lighter than levity which strides the blast and of the present fond forgets the past he changed and changed but every hope to curse changed only from one folly to a worse state he resigned to those whom state could please careless of majesty his wish was ease pleasure and pleasure only was his aim kings of less wit might hunt the bubble fame dignity through his reign was made a sport nor dared decorum show her face at court morality was held a standing jest and faith a necessary fraud at best courtiers their monarch ever in their view possessed great talents and abused them too whatever was light impertinent and vain whatever was loose indecent and profane so ripe was folly folly to acquit stood all absolved in that poor bauble wit in gratitude alas but little read he let his fathers servants beg their bread his fathers faithful servants and his own to place the foes of both around his throne bad counsels he embraced through indolence through love of ease and not through want of sense he saw them wrong but rather let them go as right than take the pains to make them so women ruled all and ministers of state were for commands at toilettes forced to wait women who have as monarchs graced the land but never governed well at secondhand to make all other errors slight appear in memory fixed stand dunkirk and tangier in memory fixed so deep that time in vain shall strive to wipe those records from the brain amboyna stands  gods that a king could hold in such high estimate vile paultry gold and of his duty be so careless found that when the blood of subjects from the ground for vengeance called he should reject their cry and bribed from honor lay his thunders by give holland peace whilst english victims groaned and butchered subjects wandered unatond o dear deep injury to englands fame to them to us to all to him deep shame of all the passions which from frailty spring avarice is that which least becomes a king to crown the whole scorning the public good which through his reign he little understood or little heeded with too narrow aim he reassurd a bigot brothers claim and having made timeserving senates bow suddenly died that brother best knew how no matter how  he slept amongst the dead and james his brother reigned in his stead but such a reign  so glaring an offense in every step against freedom law and sense against all the rights of natures general plan against all which constitutes an englishman that the relation would mere fiction seem the mock creation of a poets dream and the poor bards would in this skeptic age appear as false as their historians page ambitious folly seized the seat of wit christians were forced by bigots to submit pride without sense without religion zeal made daring inroads on the commonweal stern persecution raised her iron rod and called the pride of kings the power of god conscience and fame were sacrificed to rome and england wept at freedoms sacred tomb her laws despised her constitution wrenchd from its due natural frame her rights retrenched beyond a cowards suffrance conscience forced and healing justice from the crown divorced each moment pregnant with vile acts of power her patriot bishops sentenced to the tower her oxford who yet loves the stuart name branded with arbitrary marks of shame she wept  but wept not long to arms she flew at honors call the avenging sword she drew turned all her terrors on the tyrants head and sent him in despair to beg his bread whilst she may every state in such distress dare with such zeal and meet with such success whilst she may gotham should my abject mind choose to enslave rather than free mankind pursue her steps tear the proud tyrant down nor let me wear if i abuse the crown whilst she through every age in every land written in gold let revolution stand whilst she secured in liberty and law found what she sought a savior in nassau end of the second book
