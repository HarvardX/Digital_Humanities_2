an account of the success of inoculating the small pox in great britain  with a comparison between the miscarriages in that practice and the mortality of the natural smallpox  humbly dedicated to her royal highness the princess of wales  by james jurin md secretary to the royal society fellow of the college of physicians and reader of anatomy at surgeonshall  si quid novisti rectius istis candidus imperti london printed for j peele at lockes head in paternoster row      price sixpence  to her royal highness the princess of wales madam the great and undeserved honor you have been pleased to grant me of laying these papers at the feet of your royal highness justly demands the most thankful acknowledgement inasmuch as it must be a means of preserving me from the censures or suspicions of those whom my own character little known in the world may not satisfy of the impartiality and regard to truth which i have observed therein for it will not surely be imagined that i should presume to offer to so great so good and so discerning a princess any account of a matter of so much consequence to mankind but what is in all respects just and true to the best of my knowledge  it is madam by such an account that the practice of inoculation must stand or fall if upon a fair and exact balance of the good and ill success of it it appear in the main to be beneficial to mankind it will in time in despite of clamor and unreasonable opposition be reckoned among the many blessings for which these nations under the divine providence are indebted to the illustrious house of brunswick and if it prove the contrary i need not say that neither the name and powerful patronage of your royal highness nor the happy success it has been attended with on the growing hopes of britain will be able to protect it for if this should be the case i am well assured that the same noble and godlike motive of doing good which has hitherto prompted you to countenance this practice will then no less powerfully induce you to abandon and discourage it i am with the greatest submission respect and duty  madam your royal highnesss most obedient most faithful and most devoted servant j jurin  an account of the success of inoculating the small pox in great britain etc the disputes about the practice of inoculating the small pox like many of our other differences have been carried to so great a height that it is difficult for any one to write upon this subject without being drawn into controversy even though he delivers only matter of fact or the undeniable consequences drawn from it and that with the greatest impartiality and the strictest regard to truth though such a procedure one would imagine should so far entitle the writer to the good nature and protection of the world as to secure him from the attacks of either party especially as in acting thus he cannot favor or prejudice either of them any otherwise than as the facts themselves declare for or against them at least those who contend only for truth ought never to be out of humor with him who indifferently furnishes either side with the proper materials for the support of their opinion or the conviction of its being not to be maintained  with this design i laid before the world a little letter to dr cotesworth piece the last year and intend god willing to continue so doing from year to year till the practice of inoculation shall either be established on a firm and lasting foot or shall be justly exploded the fate thereof being as i conceive only to be determined by matter of fact and experience faithfully related  in order to be able to do which i have used my best endeavors with the assistance of my friends to procure the most authentic accounts i was able and i shall be thankful to all persons who at any time hereafter will be pleased to send me well attested relations of any particulars relating to the success of this practice bad as well as good all which they may be assured shall be justly represented  to impose upon the world in any particular is disingenuous and base but to deceive them in an affair so nearly concerning the lives of mankind is a wickedness worthy of the utmost abhorrence and detestation i hope none that know me will think me capable of any thing so criminal and as for others i beg they will not too easily give credit to flying reports with which the world is too often amused without any just foundation but that in case of doubt about any thing which i shall here deliver they will be pleased to give themselves the trouble of perusing the materials in my hands which i shall carefully preserve and be ready to show them for their satisfaction as vouchers of my fidelity  this controversy though drawn out into many particulars seems principally to turn upon the two following points    whether the distemper given by inoculation be an effectual security to the patient against his having the small pox afterward in the natural way   whether the hazard of inoculation be considerably less than that of the natural small pox if these two points were effectually settled there would i suppose be an end of the dispute at least among physicians for if either of them be fairly determined in the negative the practice of inoculation must on all hands be given up and on the other hand if the test of experience should plainly declare for the affirmative side of both these questions i doubt not but that every gentleman who has the honor to serve his country in the capacity of a physician will have integrity and humanity enough to declare himself honestly and openly in favor of the practice at least he will consider whether it will be for his reputation when his friend and his patient shall put his life or the lives of his children into his hands to amuse himself with theological disputes and scruples whether it be lawful to save them for if the practice of inoculation be really found to be a means of preserving life it will not be easy to make the world believe that it is criminal to use it  as to the first therefore of these questions though it will require a considerable length of time and a much greater number of experiments than have yet been made before it can be absolutely determined yet thus much may at present be said that our experience as far as it goes has hitherto strongly favored the affirmative side for though many trials have been purposely made by physicians and others both upon children and grown persons who have had the small pox by inoculation in causing them not only to converse with but to handle to nurse and to lie in the same bed with others sick of the natural small pox yet there is no instance as far as i have been able to learn of any one person either in turkey new england or here at home who has received the small pox by inoculation that has afterward had it in the natural way if any such case shall hereafter come to my knowledge i shall not fail to lay it faithfully before the world though it is to be observed that a single instance or two of this kind out of a very great number of persons inoculated ought not in reason to overthrow the practice for it cannot be expected that a person who receives the small pox by inoculation should be safer from having it again than one that has undergone it in the natural way and we are not certain that the small pox does never though perhaps exceeding rarely happen twice naturally to the same person for my own part i have never known it but my ingenious friend mr isaac massey apothecary whom i the rather name because he is known to be no friend to inoculation has assured me that he saw the same person twice undergo the natural small pox this however undoubtedly happens very seldom but if it does happen in the natural way it may happen likewise after inoculation and consequently a person who has received the distemper by this means must content himself with no greater a degree of security than if he had undergone it naturally  but if the person inoculated does not receive the distemper in any degree from that operation as sometimes falls out in such a case we have no reason to be surpised if he afterward happen to be taken with it in the natural way inoculation like all other applications in physic or surgery will not always produce the intended effect and no wonder we know from a thousand instances that of several persons equally exposed to the same contagious disease part shall escape and part be infected and the same person exposing himself in the same manner at different times to the same danger shall escape at one time and be seized at another the same has happened twice in the case of inoculation two children who had been inoculated without any manner of effect as is attested not only by the physician dr nettleton but by the certificates of the parents themselves were afterward seized with the small pox when it raged epidemically where they were they had it favorably and recovered the relation sent up to me with the certificates by dr nettleton was published some months ago in the daily journal and is reprinted at the end of this paper the originals being still in my hands and these are all the cases of this kind that are come to my knowledge except a like case of mr de grave the surgeons daughter an account of which under the fathers own hand has been published by mr maitland  in order to come to some determination of the second question viz whether the hazard of inoculation be considerably less than that of the natural small pox it is necessary in the first place to know what is the proportion between the numbers of those that undergo the small pox in the natural way and those that die of them with this view i have proved in my piece letter to dr cotesworth published last year that at least a fourteenth part of mankind die of the natural small pox and i have i think rendered it probable that of persons of all ages undergoing that distemper there die at least two in seventeen these deductions are drawn from the consideration of the bills of mortality for    years past and from an actual account of a great number of persons that underwent that disease as taken in several places by a careful enquiry from house to house i have there shown that there died one in between five or six or about two in eleven i shall now repeat that account with several others which have since been communicated to me by persons of credit in the following table  sick of the small pox died in halifax        in a part of the parish of halifax stretching toward bradford        in another part of the same parish        in barsland ripponden sorby and another part of halifax parish about four miles from the town   0    in bradford        in leeds         in wakefield        in rochdale        in asbton under line a small market town in lancashire including two neighboring villages        in bolton lancashire  0     in macclesfield  0

  total             the result is that as far as these accounts can inform us there dies nearly one out of six persons sick of the small pox in the natural way or more accurately five out of thirty one which proportion we must content our selves with for the present till by obtaining accounts from more places we may by the largeness of the numbers come nearer to the true proportion  such therefore being the hazard of dying of the small pox in the natural way we come now to consider what is the hazard of dying of the inoculated small pox in order to which we offer the following lists of persons inoculated which we hope may be depended upon as having taken all possible care to obtain the best accounts that we could  the first contains the number of persons inoculated to the end of the year      with the names of the persons that performed or directed the operation and the places where it was done  persons inoculated in the years                in and about london by claudius

several age there expressed that were inoculated with the effect of the operation  in order to make which the better understood as well as for the information of those readers who may have occasion to make use of this practice i shall here give some account of what is to be done and what is usually observed in inoculation as i have extracted it from a careful examination and comparison of the several relations transmitted to me with regard  st to the subject to be inoculated  d the preparation  d the choice of the infectious matter  th the operation  th the sickening or the symptons preceding the eruption  th the eruption  th the running of the incisions    great care ought to be taken to inoculate none but persons of a good habit of body and free not only from any apparent but as far as can be judged from any latent disease for which reason every prudent person will in this case have the advice and opinion of his own physician whether the subject to be inoculated be in a fit condition to undergo the small pox that so he may not have that distemper and a bad constitution or perhaps another disease to struggle with at the same time of which there have been several fatal instances through the neglect of this caution in some cases indeed it has fallen out that the person inoculated has by this means got free of another disease under which he labored before as sometimes happens likewise in the natural way though the contrary is much more frequent    the body especially if plethorick ought to be prepared by proper evacuations as bleeding purging vomiting etc though in many cases there will be occasion for very little or none of these it being sufficient to enjoin a temperate diet and proper regimen but this must be left to the judgment of the physician    the utmost caution ought to be used in the choice of proper matter to communicate the infection it should be taken from a young subject otherwise perfectly sound and healthful who has the small pox in the most favorable manner when the pustules are perfectly maturated and just upon the turn or soon after two or three of them should be rippd with a glovers needle or small lancet and a couple of small pledgets of lint or cotton are to be well moistened with the matter and immediately put into a little vial or box and carried in the warm hand or bosom of the operator to the house of the person to be inoculated    the incisions are usually made with a small lancet in the brawny part of both arms or in one arm and the opposite leg cutting just into or at most through the cutis or true skin for the length of a quarter of an inch half an inch or at most an inch this being done one of the pledgets moistened with the infectious matter is to be laid upon each incision and to be kept on by means of a bit of sticking plaster laid over it for about four and twenty hours after which all may be taken off and the incisions dressed with common diachylon or with only warm cabbage or colewort leaves once a day at first and afterward when the discharge is considerable twice a day till they heal or only with a linen roller to defend them from the air    the person inoculated sometimes receives the small pox without any previous sickness as often happens in the most favorable sort in the natural way but the greater part begin to be a little feverish and have more or less of the usual symptoms preceding the natural small pox most commonly upon the eighth day from inoculation though pretty often upon the seventh and very rarely a day or two sooner or later    the patients are sometimes taken with flushing heats which disappear again in a little time about the  th or  th day but the eruption of the pustules happens generally within a day or sometimes two or three after the sickening viz most commonly on the ninth day less frequently on the  0th and still less on the  th or   th in a few cases it has appeared on the  th or   th in one case on the   th in one on the   th in one on the  th and in another on the  d the last patient but one had the confluent sort and died the last was very full of the distinct kind and recovered    the incisions begin to grow sore and painful about the  th or  th day and about the  th  th or  th they begin to digest and run with a thick purulent matter which gradually increases till about the turn of the distemper during which time the wounds grow wide and deep afterward the running gradually abates and they usually heal up in about a month sometimes in three weeks though in some they continue running five or six weeks or something longer the greater the discharge is by the incisions the more favorable the distemper is found in other respects when the inoculation does not take effect the incisions heal up in a few days like a common cut where children happen to have issues before inoculation they begin in a few days to run in a much greater quantity than usual and continue so doing in the same manner as the incisions during the state of the distemper after which they return to their ordinary course  in this table by having an imperfect small pox is meant the having some slighter eruption of but a few days continuance but this attended with an inflammation and running of the incisions for the usual time and generally preceded by some of the common symptoms of the small pox this being esteemed by the accounts from turkey and our own experience at home as far as it goes to be an effectual security against having the small pox afterward in the natural way  under the article of no effect are comprehended not only all those persons upon whom the operation produced no effect of any kind but also those upon whom the eruption was so slight and the running of the incisions so little in quantity or of so short a duration as to render it justly doubtful whether it would amount to a security or no two of these were known to have had the small pox before and were inoculated only for experiment sake and several of the rest underwent the operation upon a doubt whether they had had the small pox before or no the distemper which they had undergone in the natural way having been so slight and so favorable as to make their parents themselves or their physicians to suspect that it was not the true small pox but there were some upon whom inoculation did not produce the distemper though there was no suspicion of their having had it before  under the head of dying after inoculation is comprised every person as far as i have been been able to learn that has either by the friends or adversaries to this practice been suspected to have died of inoculation  ages persons inoculated had the small pox by inoculation had an imperfect small pox by inoculation no effect suspected o have died of inoculation und   year

0  00 total       0 0     0   from this table it appears    that of     persons inoculated   0 have received the small pox from that operation to which if it be thought proper to add the five who had an imperfect small pox by inoculation the whole number will be        that the operation has of ner failed of taking effect upon those of more advanced ages than upon young children as was naturally to be expected from the reasons mentioned above it being more likely that persons of such ages have had the small pox before than children    that however more favorable the natural small pox generally is to children than grown persons yet inoculation has been attended with better success in the latter than in the former and in particular that out of  0 or    persons of  0 years of age and upwards that have had the small pox by inoculation not one has miscarried    that   is the number of persons who have been suspected to have died of inoculation so that if this operation was really the cause of all their deaths the hazard of dying of the inoculated small pox must be that of   in   0 or     that is of one in    or  0  but the curious reader will doubtless expect that i should give him some farther information in order to enable him to judge whether or no all these persons really died of inoculation this i shall endeavor to do with all the fidelity that a case of so much importance requires and with such impartiality as to give no just cause of offense to either of the contending parties with this view i shall here set down the name of every person that has been suspected by the one side to have died of inoculation and on the other hand i shall communicate the accounts of those cases as they have been transmitted to me by the gentlemen concerned in inoculating those persons subjoining every ones name to his own account    the first is the case of the honorable mr william spencer aged about three years who was inoculated in town april  d      and died on the   st of the same month the eruption appeared on the  th day he had a fair and full eruption of pustules of different sorts observing the common periods and symptoms of inoculation and after the greatest part of the pustules were dried off he was seized on a sudden on the   st day of a convulsive fit of which he died the occasion of his death may be farther inquired into from the printed account mr maitland vid maitlands answer to dr waggstaffe    miss rigby aged a year and six months was inoculated in london april         she had a fair eruption of pustules appearing on the eighth day and a much more favorable disease than her sister who recovered but one of her arms swelled and imposthumated as is usual sometimes in the natural small pox and whether it was by that or breeding her teeth for she cut some teeth about that time is uncertain however she continued sickly feverish and hectic and died about   weeks after the inoculation n b mr maitland declined the inoculating her with her sister but the father having had a favorable account of this practice from the turkey merchants would have it done and there was another unlucky circumstance in this affair mr maitland was seized with a violent fever for the space of three weeks from the day she was inoculated which he thinks might in some measure have occasioned the soreness of her arm no such thing having happened where he has been able to attend mr maitland    lord bathursts servant aged    was inoculated in london april  0      he was lately come from the country into my lords house where five of his lordships children were then sick of the small pox he was ill for some few days before he was inoculated and his complaints were such that twas apprehended twould be the small pox therefore he was removed to a nurses in swallowstreet piccadilly who provides for persons in that way by mr meads directions he was blooded and vomited and took several cordial powders whereby being restored to health it was thought proper to inoculate him the small pox appeared on him the  th day after inoculation of the favorable distinct kind whereby his complaints were allayed but returning the next day with bilious vomitings frequent stools and a delirium a great many of the fluxed kind then appeared these continued more or less upon him notwithstanding all the medicines which dr arbutbnot and afterward dr med in conjunction wih him did prescribe he died on the  th day from the eruption his lungs were found inflamed and mortified sergeant amyand    miss rolt aged between   and  0 years was inoculated in london together with a child of between   and   years of age both with the same matter sept         then both began to sicken on the eighth day from inoculation and on the  0th the small pox appeared on both of the distinct kind the boy recovered miss rolt the day before the eruption complained of great pains in her shoulders elbows and knees and the fever continuing the small pox fluxed upon her the  d day from the eruption sir hans sloane and dr arbuthnot attended her she went through the distemper with ease the small pox began to turn on her the  th day but twas not dried all over till the   th the fever that arose then occasioned her being blooded and soon after several tumors appeared in the neighborhood of several joints which were opened the fever still continued and more suppurated tumors were daily appearing which were discharged as soon as possible sometimes she was troubled with a diarrhoea whereby as well as by the suppuration of  0 or  0 boils that were opened she was spent so that she died the   th of november following that is   weeks after the inoculation her incisions continued running to the last by all accounts she had a bad habit of body she struggled with the jaundice the year before during six months it showed its head again in the spring but was soon conquered and as i have been informed of late she recovered of the measles but  0 weeks before she was inoculated had i been informed of this before as well as of her irregular life no ways suited to one of her years i would hardly have adventured the inoculation on her though all that time she seemed to me in a perfect state of health and perfectly recovered of the measles which she had had in the most favorable manner sergeant amyand    miss brooksbank aged    months was inoculated at ealand near halifax in june      she died suddenly on the   th day from the eruption vid dr nettletons and the parents account at the end of this paper    miss betty a court   years of age inoculated at ivychurch near salisbury sept  0       she may very well be said to be born an infirm child for it is notoriously known that her mother was so ill almost all the time of going with her that her midwife often despaired of her life as believing she would not go out her time the child two or three months after she was born was seized with an ophthalmia in both eyes and after that she had a humor to a great degree which broke out under her chin her throat being very raw from ear to ear which by purging cutting an issue etc went off but still at spring and fall she was subject to these humors but to a less degree than at first her issue by the negligence of the nurse was dried up some considerable time before the child was inoculated as mr a court himself told me and that the child had something of these humors broke out upon her not above   weeks before the operation was performed i was assured by the servants in the house  she was inoculated with her four brothers and a servant maid all with the same matter from a boy about   or   years old that had a kind sort i heard nothing of any of their complaints till the eighth day and then one had a pain in his head another in his back one was taken with a shivering another with a vomiting and in short every one of them had something or other of the symptoms of the small pox except the maid servant misss complaint was chiefly in her head and back the next day after the symptoms came on she was flushed in her face rather like an erysipelas than the small pox and in    hours after that the pustules appeared very thick in her face her right arm and right thigh and seemed to come on pretty well they were as full on her breast the abdomen and inside of the thighs yet they continued always flat and languishing without coming to maturity notwithstanding all the doctor could do to raise them the fever increased on her every day and she grew more and more restless though her incisions discharged after a wonderful manner for all round each arm from her shoulders to her elbows they ran like large blisters being as thick of pustules as they could stand under the dressings which gave us some faint hopes she might get over it till a day or two before she died the pustules on her face her right arm and thigh turned the  th and  th day but then the second fever came on and it getting ground every day she continued in a languid state and grew weaker and weaker till she expired which was the   d day from the incisions mr goldwyer  a daughter of mr a courts   years of age was inoculated under a very ill habit of body and subject to inflammatory cutaneous eruptions from its birth persecuted always by a hectic heat the child was thin and weak too weak indeed to withstand the malignity of the confluent kind she labored under but the four sons inoculated at the same time with matter taken from the same person had diseases of the distinct kind and are recovered though not the most proper persons for this operation dr hele physician in salisbury    francis bacon esquire    years of age was inoculated at earlbam near nowich with his sister sept   th      the incisions did not inflame but healed in about  0 days like a common cut no fever nor any sort of eruption followed he was kept in breathing sweats in bed the  th and  0th day a day or two after he was purged and so a  d and a  d time  on the  st of october a second attempt was made with matter taken from his sister the success was the same he was purged again as before and released from his confinement during this whole proceeding he slept very well had a very good appetite and made not the least complaint till upon taking the air in a very sharp day toward the latter end of october he grew feverish that night with pains in his head and limbs his pulse was strong his urine high colored with a good sediment he was not very hot nor thirsty but inclinable to sweat the greatest uneasiness he felt was from a decayed tooth which he was forced to have drawn this disorder went off in   days by natural sweats all that was given him was   or   papers of pulv e chel cancr comp with castor etc he being sometimes a little low spirited a faintness remained upon him four or five days after the fever went off with want of appetite but upon taking a little rhubarb once or twice he soon recovered his stomach and seemed perfectly well when he returned to cambridge about the middle of november the only difference i observed in him was that he was paler than usual which i imputed to a long tedious confinement and a spare diet together with some little anxiety from the disappointment he had met with what happened at cambridge i shall say nothing to leaving that part to the physician that attended him i shall only observe that this young gentleman has been very subject to fevers attended with nervous symptoms and that a person nearly related to him who saw him in both cases told me that this last illness differed in nothing except in the violence of the symptoms from a fever he was seized with about three years ago dr offley  this young gentleman was taken ill of a nervous fever such as he had been ill of several times before about christmas last and died on the  th of jannary no spot nor eruption of any kind appeared upon him but a little before his death a great quantity of blood and matter gushed out at his nostrils mrs bacon mr professor green dr ashenhurst    mary waller five years and a half old was inoculated near gosport oct         together with two other children all with the same matter the other two sickend on the  th day the small pox appeared on the  th and they did very well but this child sickend at the completion of the  th day and the eruption appeared on the sixth she had the confluent kind all over her with many purples and died on the   th day after she was inoculated from the vid page    earliness of her sickening and the eruption it is not improbable that she had taken the infection the ordinary way before this opinion is farther strengthened by the following circumstance a maid was violently seized with the small pox in the common way a little before the operation and continued there two days in a narrow room her breath smelling strong of the infection and the child was sometimes with her to what is said may be added that the child was leprous mr waller    miss brailsford aged   years died the   th day after inoculation of a worm fever the small pox were all shald and gone off dr dover  from the facts here laid down i am sensible the inoculators will raise several objections against the estimate of the hazard of inoculation which i have given above and to do them justice i am obliged to lay what are or may be their arguments before the world    they will maintain that the  th  th and  th cases ought to be left out of the computation because the patients were unhealthy subjects and therefore no argument can be drawn from their dying to increase the hazard of those who shall be inoculated in perfect health pursuant to the caution above given and consequently that the hazard to heathful persons can at most be reckoned to be no more than that of six in   0 or     that is of one in    or       they may object that the seventh case is entirely out of the question the person having been well so long after the operation and in his last illness which happened near three months after the second inoculation having had no manner of appearance of the small pox nor any other symptons as appears by the acknowledgement of his nearest relations and others but what he had had more than once in former fevers except only the eruption of blood and matter from his nostrils a little before his death which often happening in other cases seems not to be justly chargeable upon inoculation especially at so great a distance of time from that operation    they may justly plead that in a comparison between the hazard of the natural and inoculated small pox either only such as die in the course of the distemper ought to be set down on both sides or that if in the case of inoculation i will charge the consequences of the operation in occasioning other diseases of which the patients happen to die after the small pox are entirely gone off that i ought to do the same in the case of the natural small pox it being notorious that this distemper frequently occasions other diseases of which the patients die a considerable time after and if i cannot do this in the natural way because the death of the patient is in this case set down in the weekly bills etc to the other apparent disease then i ought to omit all such cases in the way of inoculation and consequently the  d as likewise the  th and  th for this reason besides the others before given ought to be left out of the estimate    they may likewise object to the  st  d and  th instances from the circumstances mentioned in the account of those cases and consequently will not allow of more than one case where the patient can be justly said to have died of inoculation and perhaps even that will be disputed  how far these several objections are of weight is submited to the determination of those who must and will judge for themselves that is to every intelligent reader who being thus apprizd of the facts may easily by striking off such of the instances given above as he thinks reasonable form to himself a judgment of the hazard of life in this operation and to such therefore i leave it but to save him some little trouble i shall only observe that if upon the reasons here mentioned he sees cause to except one person out of the number of those that are suspected to have died of inoculation the hazard must then be estimated to be that of one in    or     if he except the hazard will be two one in    or    three one in    or    four one in    or    five one in   0 or     six one in     or     seven one in   0 or     eight one in   0 or      it may perhaps be expected from me by some persons that in giving account of the miscarriages of inoculation i should not confine my self barely to loss of life but that i should likewise relate all the lesser accidents as the breaking out of boils etc that have followed upon that practice where the patient has escaped with his life but to such i must reply that in a design to make a comparison between the hazard of the distemper in the natural way and when given by inoculation it would be improper and useless to insert such an account if it could be obtained on the one side unless it were done likewise on the other and every physician knows that such like accidents frequently happen upon having the natural small pox which it would be next to impossible to make a perfect collection of and as impracticable to set that collection in such a light as would be requisite in order to make a comparison between it and the accidents owing to inoculation for this reason i limit my comparison to the hazard of life itself and see no reason to doubt but that such way of having the disease as less endangers life must be likewise more favorable in all other particulars this is affirmed by the practisers of inoculation and their adversaries i think do not offer to deny it  before i conclude it may not be improper to take some little notice of an article lately inserted in one of our public papers that in the year      there died of the small pox within the bills of mortality      persons and that in the year      the year of inoculation there died      exceeding the former number by   0   with what view this was published is best known to the authors of that and some other such like articles but the use that i have heard made of it in conversation is that inoculating the small pox contributed very much to the spreading of the distemper and consequently to the great increase of the mortality abovementioned  to obviate which i must take notice in the first place that by the accounts now lying before me it appears that in the year      there were    persons inoculated within the bills of mortality and in the year      which this writer calls the year of inoculation the number inoculated was    just five more than the year before    that as there died of the natural pox      persons in the year      the whole number sick of the same disease that year must have been by the proportion laid down before of six and something more to one about  0000 persons and consequently the spreading of the distemper by means of inoculation could bear no greater a proportion to the natural propagation of it than that of    to  0000 or of one to  00 for it will not i suppose be pretended that the small pox given by inoculation is more infectious than the natural sort i believe every person who has been acquainted with both will think it less so in proportion as it is more favorable  lastly if i have not already taken up more of the readers time upon this head than the thing is worth i would desire him to cast his eye upon the following account of the mortality of the small pox for several years before inoculation was introduced among us in some of which he will find it greater and in others nearly equalito the last  out of every thousand persons that were buried there died of the small pox  in the year                                  0        0     0           0                     the consideration of the bills of mortality puts into my head another remark which i must beg leave to make  for these ten years last past there have died of the small pox within the bills of mortality at a medium      souls per annum let us now consider a little what may be the consequence in case inoculation should hereafter become a general practice if we allow all the opposers of inoculation contend for we shall find but one in    to die of inoculation and in the natural way we have shown it to be one in six it follows that if we substitute inoculation for the natural way the number of the dead would be reduced seven parts in eight and consequently  000 persons that are yearly cut off within the bills of mortality alone and those generally in the beginning or prime of life might be preserved to their king and country let the warm opposers of inoculation lay their hands upon their hearts and consider whether the saving of so many lives be contrary to any precept of law or gospel we have been told indeed and from the pulpit too that this practice came from the devil but if it prove thus beneficial and salutary to mankind i for my part shall make no scruple of ascribing it to a greater and a better author and undoubtedly all sober and thinking persons will judge and believe that the making known to the world a method of preserving their lives from one of the most terrible diseases in nature can be owing to no other than the kind and tender providence of the great creator and preserver of mankind  part of a letter from dr nettleton to dr jurin halifax oct         sir i was very much surpised to find it inserted in several of the news papers of the last post as a current report that i had been lately called to a patient who was inoculated about a year ago and who is since dead of the natural small pox and i could not omit this first opportunity to assure you that the said report is entirely false none who have been inoculated having died of the natural small pox afterward neither have we any reason to think worse of the practice here than when i writ to you last though we were far from expecting that any thing in this world should be so complete as to be free from all inconveniences and misfortunes the method has not been attended with any disaster in these parts excepting only one which i suppose gave rise to these reports in the public papers and of which i shall give you a very particular relation for i should be highly blameable if i did either conceal or misrepresent any circumstance relating to a matter of so great consequence to mankind  about four months ago mr brooksbank of ealand desired me to inoculate the small pox upon a daughter of his aged about    months the distemper being then in the neighborhood and several having died in the natural way it was accordingly done and also upon some others at the same time who did very well but in this child the symptoms were very severe and when the pustules appeared they were very numerous though distinct and not so kindly as we could expect to the eleventh day the pustules crusted and were many of them gone and the child was very cheerful and brisk and played about the room insomuch that we all concluded the danger to be over ut she died suddenly in the night without any notice of her being worse whether her death was from the small pox or some other cause occasioning some sudden convulsion or suffocation i will not presume to determine   a second letter from the same gentleman to dr jurin halifax nov         sir there have been some occurrences here in the method of inoculation which have been misrepresented of which it is necessary the public should have a true and impartial account it was altogether a mistake to affirm that one who had been inoculated a year ago was lately dead of the natural small pox but it is very true that one who had the small pox by inoculation did die and also that two others whom we attempted to inoculate but without effect had the distemper afterward in the natural way the facts are contained in the following certificates which will be attested upon oath by the parties concerned whenever it shall be required  we have reason to believe that the death of the child hereafter mentioned was owing to some other cause besides the small pox but if to avoid dispute we yield that point it must then be acknowledged that out of seventy four who had the small pox by inoculation hereabouts one has died all the rest are at this time alive and in good health  we have been told by all those who have writ upon the subject of inoculation that it may sometimes fail and produce nothing at all in which case it can be no more security against the distemper than if nothing had been done most of those who have been inoculated here have been as much exposed as these two children who have taken the infection since but we have not yet found that any who had the small pox by this method though in the lowest degree ever had it again in the natural way if any such thing should happen i shall not fail to advise you of it there has nothing occurred here so far as i know that can possibly be represented to the disadvantage of the practice besides what is contained in the enclosed papers  i am sir your most obedient humble servant thomas nettleton   ealand nov        these may certify that in february       the small pox was inoculated upon two of our daughters the one about five and the other four years of age who had as far as we could judge the true small pox through which distemper they got with very great ease some time after the same operation was performed upon a boy of ours aged about three years but without any effect the child was not in the least disordered had no appearances upon his skin neither did the places of incision swell or inflame as in the other children so that we then concluded it would avail him nothing about five months ago the distemper being then in the neighborhood and several having died of it in the natural way we had the small pox inoculated upon a daughter of ours aged about    months with this child the distemper was more severe than usual she was very full though the pustules were distinct she went on as well as we could expect and on the eleventh day was very cheerful and brisk free from heat or thirst and the small pox were many of them crusted and gone off insomuch that we thought her out of danger however that night she died suddenly even before any alteration for the worse was perceived by those that attended her this unhappy event may possibly expose us to the censure of the world but the consciousness of having done our duty in using the most likely means to preserve life in a time of common danger makes us easy and content about ten days after this our son abovementioned upon whom the inoculation had no effect was seized in the natural way had a very kindly sort and recovered very well the distemper was at that time very rife in two or three neighboring families insomuch that none escaped who had not had it before amongst these there were six persons who had the small pox by inoculation some of which were constantly and the rest frequently in company with those that were sick of the natural sort without being any way affected  to the truth of the above we subscribe  to the above written particulars attest the nurse and maid who attended the children during their illness joseph brooksbank eliza brooksbank eliza i brooksbank eliza x mellar    halifax nov        these may certify that at our request in february       the small pox was inoculated upon two of our children the one a boy aged about   years the other a girl about   years old the girl in a weeks time began to be very feverish and ill and after   or   days the small pox appeared they rose very round and large though but few in number and she soon recovered the boy was no ways affected had no manner of illness that we could perceive nothing appeared upon his skin neither did the places that were cut look red and angry as they did in the girl but about a week or ten days after his sister recovered he fell ill of the small pox had more in number and was much worse than she was but after some time recovered very well  as witness our hands test martha micheli thomas thorp william clark phebe clark  p s it is to be observed that these two children were not inoculated with the same matter the girl was from one that had a very favorable kind in the natural way the boy was from one that was inoculated but i had the misfortune to come too late the pustules were withered and almost gone and the matter was chiefly taken from the incision in the arm i did not think necessary to mention this particular in the account i gave of this boy formerly because i could not conclude from one trial any thing certainly it is now very well known that the matter taken from the pustules of the inoculated small pox will convey the distemper as well as the natural but i believe that which runs from the incisions will not i can give no account how the operation happened to fail in mr brooksbanks boy for two other children were inoculated at the same time with the same matter in whom it succeeded very well     errata page  0 line   read dr page    line    read    finis advertisement all persons concerned in the practice of inoculating the small pox are desired to keep a register of the names and ages of every person inoculated the place where it is done the manner of the operation the days of sickening and of the eruption the sort of small pox that is produced and the event  where the true small pox is not produced by inoculation it will be of use to take particular notice whether the patient had any other kind of eruption what symptoms preceded or attended it whether the incisions inflamed and run and for what time their running continued  in case any person shall happen to die after inoculation either in the course of the small pox or after they are gone off it is desired that a particular relation of the case may be made and attested if it be judged necessary by the nearest relations of the party deceased or by other credible persons that were witnesses to the fact  they are entreated to send these accounts or an extract from them comprehending all persons inoculated from the beginning to the end of the present year to dr jurin secretary to the royal society some time in january or at farthest in february next that so the result of them may be published early in the spring
