congreve in easy dialogue is fletchers praise he moved the soul but had not power to raise great johnson did by strength of judgment please yet doubling fletcher s force he wants his ease in differing talents both adorned their age one for the study the other for the stage but both to congreve justly shall submit one matched in judgment both oermatchd in wit in him all beauties of this age we see etherege s courtship southern s purity the satire wit and strength of manly wycherley dryden mr addisons character of the old bachelor see the tatler no    in the character which gives name to this play there is excellently represented the reluctance of a battered debauchee to come into the trammels of order and decency he neither languishes nor burns but frets for love the gentlemen of more regular behavior are drawn with much spirit and wit and the drama introduced by the dialogue of the first scene with uncommon yet natural conversation the part of fondlewife is a lively image of the unseasonable fondness of age and impotence  sir richard blackmores character of the mourning bride see his preface to prince arthur fol       this poem has received and in my opinion very justly universal applause being looked on as the most perfect tragedy that has been wrote in this age the fable as far as i can judge at first sight is a very artful and masterly contrivance the characters are well chosen and well delineated that of zara is admirable the passions are well touched and skilfully wrought up the diction proper clear beautiful noble and diversified agreeably to the variety of the subject vice as it ought to be is punished and oppressedinnocence at last rewarded nature appears very happily imitated excepting one or two doubtful instances through the whole piece in which there are no immodest images or expressions no wild unnatural rants but some exceptions being allowed all things are chaste just and decent  this tragedy as i said before has mightily obtained and that without the unnatural and foolish mixture of force and buffoonery without so much as a song or a dance to make it more agreeable by this it appears that as a sufficient genius can recommend itself and furnish out abundant matter of pleasure and admiration without the paultry helps above named so likewise that the taste of the nation is not so far depraved but that a regular and chaste play will not only be forgiven but highly applauded  major packs sentiments in his essay on study congreve of all the moderns seems to me to have the rightest turn for comedy in all his plays there is a great deal of lively and uncommon humor and such as yet for the most part is a picture of true life besides he has raised the vein of ridicule and made the stage which had been too much prostituted to the mob edifying to persons of the first condition and as his fable is diverting so is it wrought according to the strictest rules  the following epistle of rightly improving the present time written to lord cobham is here printed from a manuscript of the author with which i was obliged by a person of the first rank the public having been notoriously abused by a very erroneous copy surreptitiously obtained by one lewis in covent garden and vended under the cover of a dodd and e nutt  verses to the right honorable the lord viscount cobham of improving the present time sincerest critic of my prose or rhyme tell how thy pleasing stowe the name of his lordships seat in buckinghamshire employs thy time say cobham what amuses thy retreat or stratagems of war or schemes of state do thou recall to mind with joy or grief great marlbros actions that immortal chief whose slightest trophy raised in each campaign more than sufficed to signalize a reign does thy remembrance rising warm thy heart with glory past where thou thy self had part or do thou grieve indignant now to see the fruitless end of all thy victory to see the audacious foe so late subdued dispute those terms for which so long they sud as if britannia now were sunk so low to beg that peace she wonted to bestow be far that guilt be never known that shame that england should retract her rightful claim or ceasing to be dreaded and adored stain with her pen the luster of her sword or do thou give the winds afar to blow each vexingthought and heartdevouring woe and fix thy mind alone on rural scenes to turn the levelled lawns to liquid plains to raise the creeping rills from humble beds and force the latent springs to lift their heads on watery columns capitals to rear that mix their flowing curls with upper air or do thou weary grown these works neglect no temples statues obelisks erect but catch the morning breeze from fragrant meads or shun the noontide ray in wholesome shades or slowly walk along the mazy wood to meditate on all that is wise and good for nature bountiful in thee has joined a person pleasing with a worthy mind not given the form alone but means and art to draw the eye or to allure the heart poor were the praise in fortune to excel yet want the way to use that fortune well while thus adorned while thus with virtue crowned at home in peace abroad in arms renowned graceful in form and winning in address while well you think what aptly you express with health with honor with a fair estate a table free and elegantly neat what can be added more to mortal bliss what can he want that stands possessed of this what can the fondest wishing mother more of heaven attentive for her son implore and yet a happiness remains unknown or to philosophy revealed alone a precept which unpracticed renders vain thy flowing hopes and pleasure turns to pain should hope and fear thy heart alternate tear or love or hate or rage or anxious care whatever passions may thy mind infest where is that mind which passions never molest amidst the pangs of such intestine strife still think the present day the last of life defer not till to morrow to be wise to morrows sun to thee may never rise or should to morrow chance to cheer thy sight with her enlivening and unlooktfor light how grateful will appear her dawning rays as favors unexpected doubly please who thus can think and who such thoughts pursues content may keep his life or calmly lose all proofs of this thou may thy self receive when leisure from affairs will give thee leave come see thy friend retired without regret forgetting care or striving to forget in easy contemplation soothing time with morals much and now and then with rhyme not so robust in body as in mind and always undejected though declined not wondering at the worlds new wicked ways compared with those of our forefathers days for virtue now is neither more or less and vice is only varied in the dress believe it men have ever been the same and ovids golden age is but a dream william congreve the true copy of an affidavit made before one of his majestys justices of the peace for the city of westminster that four ladies whom the deponent does not care to name repair nightly to a certain convenient place near st jamess to meet their gallants of the first rank whom your deponent will not name but so far describe them that two of them are sallow and two of the ruddy complexion and that he verily believes they were most abominably painted  the ladies when they begin their gambols call their gallants by the fond nicknames of hercules cupid pit and the gardener after a plentiful service of the most costly fare they begin their tricks which they play like the tumblers in bartholomewfair upon a carpet strip is the word nay your deponent has known them strip a gentleman who came accidently into the house at first they begin pretty courtly at least in their expressions as madam by your leave or so which the ladies are so good as seldom to deny afterward it is shameful to describe the tricks that are played by this lewd pack by an established rule each lady has the choice of her gallant in her turn and some have been known so unreasonable after they have had three to call for a fourth your deponent has seen a lady on her back a man otop of her and a lady otop of him and he avers it has been known that a court valet has stripped them all sometimes they are thrown on their backs sometimes on their bellies now higgledy piggledy and anon they are all otop of one another and if any one is called upon they are obliged to show all of the same nature is their discourse your deponent has often overheard them talking of their a  es with the same familiarity as their faces i have a black one says one and named the thing directly mine is better than yours says the other and names her thing must i be laughed at says a third because i have a red one there is one monstrous thing that your deponent is almost ashamed to mention after six a lady has asked if they could do no more nay a certain lady has been known to play all the tricks over by her self your deponent likewise avers that he has full proof after the ladies have been tired with their gallants they have called for fresh ones in short the aforesaid ladies have not only spent their pinmoney but their husbands estates upon hercules cupid pit and the gardener and when they want more money they commonly pawn their jewels etc  westminster ss jurat coram me t t ps the above information is a faithful description of the game of quadrille not to be
