some thoughts upon the subject of commerce with france  by the author of the review  job     suffer me that i may speak and after that i have spoken mock on  london printed for j baker at the blackboy in paternoster row      price   d  some thoughts upon the subject of commerce with france i could by no means foresee when i formerly published my thoughts about trade that it should come to be so popular a controversy as it is now  i am very glad however as things have since happened that as my opinion of the trade with france was always the same and for the same reasons that it is now so that i did put that opinion in print so many times and so long ago that i have left no room for malice it self without shameful prevarication to charge me with having changed my hand or my heart in the matters of trade the time will come when i shall make it appear as plain in other matters also  six year and nine year ago and when the ministry who then governed affairs had locked and barred all the doors of trade against france  i ventured to tell them in so many words that vide review vol i and vol iv pa     if they had been in their trading senses they would have traded with france all the while they fought with france i told them then plainly that we cheated the nation of the profits of an advantageous trade by prohibiting our lead and our corn going to france under the weak and foolish pretense of not supplying the enemy with bullets to shoot at us and not supplying the enemy with corn for their magazines when at the same time we sold both our lead and our corn to the neuteral powers who at a double price sold them to france so that the enemy got our lead and our corn for bullets and magazines and we only cheated our selves of the profit vide review vol     i complained then that the dutch had the wit to have an open trade with france all the time of the war and became thereby able to carry on that war while at the same time they got from the french in trade part of that money they spent upon them in the field whereas we shut our selves out of the trade and the profits too though we were able to get by it as well as they and wanted the gain as much as they  i published then in print an account of a calculation of the gain we made from france after the peace of ryswick when by the opinion of some eminent merchants then and still flourishing in london and who can witness if they please on what foot this calculation was made this nation cleared  0000 pounds per month by the trade to france from whence came that wonderful flux of french pistoles among us which suprised our people and raised that ridiculous clamor of the oysterbarrel and of their being sent over to bribe our parliament men the truth of which was nothing but this that our prodigious export of goods to france so much overballancd their import upon us that they were obliged to supply the balance in gold the parliament was obliged to reduce the said pistoles from    s   d to    s and the quantity was so great that if our accounts at that time did not err above eleven hundred thousand of them were melted down at the tower and coined into guineas vide review vol   n      all these things gentlemen i printed in the review there they stand as witnesses for or against me if i have gone from my opinion changed my sentiments of things or written against my self let it appear if i have not why am i causelessly bullyed and insulted by vile mercenaries and ignorant journeymen scribblers whose fathers as job says were not fit to be set with dogs of the flock and who do it only because they think they please you in filling your mouths with scandal and reproach but further yet  these things though written against the late measures and in the time of a whig government they could hear then and not dislike not quarrel at or insult me for writing if the ministry themselves found it clasht with their proceedings yet they were always so generous and so just to me as to allow me a freedom of speech when i spoke my real sentiments of things believing that i spoke what i thought i had good ground to support and if they had not allowed me that liberty i should have ventured their displeasure and have taken it the day being yet to come that i ever withheld speaking what i thought was needful to say and what i knew i could defend the truth of for fear of any mans face or power in the world upon which principle i still act as appears by my standing fast to my said opinion in a time when it procures me such a tumult of popular rage even among those who i thought had some reason to have used me better  but how comes it to pass that what i might say then with so much freedom i must not speak a word of now whence comes this change of your taste i affirm and dare tell you i can prove to your faces trade is the same there is not one addition or alteration to any part of the trade which does not more and more confirm what i said then and make it just to be said now how comes it to pass that a man could be a whig and say this four five and six year ago and must be a tory if he says it now what gentlemen have you transferred your reason and judgment of things to the tories are the tories come down to make the right judgment of trade and are the whigs gone from it you will not allow this sure what then can be the matter  i will tell you plainly the matter and prove it when i have told it the partystrife between the gentlemen out of power and the gentlemen in power has cursed be the misfortune hooked in the affair of trade into the quarrel and your commerce is now become a part of your politics  the consequence of the thing unhappily for the nation is this that whatsoever part the public managers take the private party managers oppose it has happened that the ministry have made a treaty of commerce immediately a loud cry is raised against trading with france as if we were to continue the interdiction of commerce after the war was over and were still to have a war of trade though the war of state was at an end now if you please let the tables be turned take it the other way had the ministry chosen the other part and made no treaty of commerce i undertake to prove that it had been the same thing and the same lowdcry had been raised and that by the very same people about neglecting the matters of trade and taking no care when they made a peace to open the trade again as other of the confederates had done for themselves  i am sorry to speak this scandalous truth but the fact is so plain and can be so easily proved even upon names and sirnames of persons and is already made so public by other hands that my saying it will be no discovery  i have nothing to do here with any remarks upon these proceedings there will be a time for it but at present it shows us by what means and for what reason with what view and for what end the affair of trade is dragged in as it were by the hair of the head into the miserable partystrife which this nation is involved in  by this means what i might have said four year ago without any reproach what i might print then in the very teeth of a ministry then in power without displeasing them is made party treason to be spoken now and that liberty which i took even at the hazard of displeasing the government i must not be allowed now lest it be a service to the government and all this by tumult rabble and roaring not by reason and evidence  but blessed be the author of truth that has made it eternal like himself and as no man ought to be afraid of speaking truth so no wise man will ever be ashamed of speaking truth however unpopular and disobliging it may be or to the damage of what party of men soever provided only that it be seasonable necessary truth and such is this i am upon i am very sure of it  what has trade to do with your politic squabbles and what business have party men with the commerce of the nation trade is neither whig nor tory church or dissenter highchurch or lowchurch in all the broils and tumults that have exercised these unhappy nations about putting in and putting out trade has stood always neuter till now there may have been parties in the parishes in the wardmotes commoncouncils and commonhalls of the city and so upward to the privy council convocation and parliament but we never till now brought them upon the exchange there was never any whigwalk and torywalk highchurchwalk and lowchurchwalk upon change that ever i knew of till now  certainly it is the interest of the whole nation to lay aside this part of the strife parties have ruined our peace our charity our society already and almost our religion too if we let them ruin our trade also what have we left well may the poor people wear wool in their hats when they go to vote for parliament men i wish it may direct them to choose such men as may put a speedy end to this breach for if parties come to govern our trade all our commerce will be at an end and by consequence our woollen manufactures  we see it every day and i believe neither party will deny it that the heats on both sides are such among our parties that as if they resolved to oppose one another in every thing right or wrong what one party proposes however rational and just the other will oppose only because these do it and at another time the same party shall espouse the very thing which they opposed and be the authors and promoters of it themselves let the passing bills in parliament prove this both parties have brought in the same bills when they have been in power which they have voted against when brought in by the other party in the time of their being in power take the alternative both parties have voted against those bills when they have been out of power which they themselves have brought in when they have been in power the bills for quallifying members for excluding officers for regulating elections the triennial and the occasional bills are all evidences of what i say  this is the present case and when it will be otherwise god only knows but run to what extremes you please and push your own disasters as far as you please i am resolved in all i shall say on the subject of trade to speak of it as it ought to be spoken of viz as a thing entirely unconcerned with parties or with any of our divisions whether it be with or against popular opinion with or against those people who i hope mean well or with or against the government or ministry is not the question to me what i say now i said before i always said and say again if we are in our trading senses we ought to open the trade to france and my reason is the same as it was before neither the trade or the reason of the trade has suffered the least alteration we ought to carry on the french trade because we are able to do it to our advantage and we who are a nation depending upon trade ought to trade with every nation we can get money by  i hope no body will think so grossly as to suppose that i should mean by this that we ought to trade to france whether it be to our advantage or no  it remains for me therefore to examine next upon what foot of trade we now stand with france and how it appears that the trade may now be carried on to our advantage  i have nothing to do here with the question so much canvassd lately in print between the writers of both sides viz whether the trade to france was always to our advantage or no i acknowledge i was always of opinion that it was not i mean as to the balance of trade i was bred to the french trade from a youth and have known my share of the particulars of it and i know their import was always very heavy when our duties upon them were low our gust to their wines brandy silks and fashions high and the number of sorts of goods great which we dealt with them in  yet i must own since i have seen what has been alleged on both sides i am more inclined to think that what has been said on that side as to our former advantage by the trade is more probable than i thought it before and i crave leave for a small digression to show what has so inclined me not that i design to enter into the dispute about it at all but merely hint at what i have observed in it which i had not considered before  it must be allowed that our exportations to france in woollen manufactures were very great i will not enter into particulars here they are published on both sides many times over besides the woollen goods our allom corn fish lead shot castiron wrought iron and brass blocktin pewter skins druggs coal but especially leather rise up to very great sums  our foreign trade or what is called exports by certificate were likewise very great and oftentimes much greater than any of the accounts i have yet seen printed viz our plantation goods such as sugars cottons indico ginger pimento tobacco etc our east india turkey and spanish west india goods as cochenele indico gauls dyers woods cottonyarn grograms oil spanish wool as also elephants teeth beeswax drugs and the like  but if these are not allowed to balance the imports from france as i say again i thought always they did not yet the two following circumstances which i borrow from another public hand do incline me to believe they might and this is all i shall say to what is past  these circumstances are   the carrying on the whole trade in our own shipping the advantage of which i must acknowledge   the advance of the price of the goods sent from hence to france which are for the most partsold upon the account of the english stocks  i have seen what is suggested by others on these heads viz that the french are so increased in shipping that they will now bring their own goods hither and that as much of the trade is carried on by commission from france hither as by commission from hence to france which are to me of no force nor is it true in fact the drapers in cornhill will readily testify in the linen trade which is the case alleged that they always gave commission to morlaix for their dowlas and lockrams  as to our freight out being carried for a small matter it is true it was so in such ships as went for wines for what goods they could get but as the bulk of our goods went to ports which the wine and brandy did not come from and from ports in england which the wine and brandy did not come to this cannot be the case our corn coal and lead goes chiefly to dunkirk roan diep and other ports of normandy from whence no wines are brought  but i am not disputing with any body i am neither to defend the mercator or confute the british merchant let them fight on their own way i am giving my own thoughts only which i shall do as impartially as i can  i must ingeniously acknowledge that i formerly received my opinion of the balance of the french trade being  00000 l per an to our loss from the accounts given then about town and into parliament when i my self was in trade which made it be received at that time as a common opinion and as such i printed it in the review which some people are mighty well pleased to quote upon me now and this common opinion was derived from the paper which past for current truth in those times called a scheme etc  but i have really been amazed to see that scheme detected of such manifest fraud proved to be wholly false and designedly to be imposed upon the nation even to stripping it stark naked from all manner of covering and not one word said in its defense so that the authors on that side are careful to publish that they had no hand in it vide british merchant n    upon these things can any man blame me then that i acknowledge the error which i among other people fell into by taking that account for true and that i am not now of the opinion that the trade to france was so much to our loss as i then printed it to be  these are the circumstances which i say have inclined me to believe that our trade to france fully balanced our trade from france in former times  if any man suggests that private ends and advantages have biased my opinion that suggestion is false and malicious i contemn the slander and defy them to prove the least circumstance of it  but the face of things is now changed the trade looks quite another way ever since the first war and whatever it might be before it is certain that now the trade to france must be to our advantage and that prodigiously compared to what it was and this is the reason that it has ever since that time been my stated opinion and i have always professed it and printed it that it is our wisdom to open the trade to france for the time to come and nothing but stupidity and a trademadness can prevent it this i say is the reason for the alteration of my opinion in that case without the least private view or the least regard to who is for or against it  i cannot but think if men were inclined to do me any justice either in this or any thing else that my having printed this as my opinion several times and several years ago before any parties concerned themselves about it ought to defend me against the malice of those who suggest my doing it now upon the influence of others but reason and justice are not loud enough to be heard in the noise and clamor of this day time will make men cooler and i must wait till then  the question therefore now before us is very short and plain  viz whether it is our interest to open a trade to france and whether we shall be gainers by it if we do it on the terms of the treaty of commerce which is now proposed to us i shall speak only my own thoughts of it  i have examined as nicely as i can the whole treaty i will not say that several things might not have been added to it to make it more to our advantage than it is but the question then will be whether it was rational to expect greater advantages could be submitted to by the french if indeed we had been masters of france and had only one side of a treaty to make viz to set down what terms the french king should be obliged to yield to without conceding any thing to them on our part then it should not have been a treaty but an act of parliament enacting in what manner the french should trade with us as we do with ireland which had it been our case i should have taxt the ministry with great indolence and neglect of our interest that they had not forbd the french making any kind of woollen manufacture atall and taken off all duties on the importation of ours they should have caused all woollen manufactures from holland flanders germany swisserland etc to have been prohibited etc they should have caused the french to send no more ships to the east indies turkey or canada and have caused martinico and quebec to have been surrendered to us as they did newfoundland and st christophers  i do acknowledge these are all articles in which the treaty of commerce might have been made better than it is  they might also have continued all the high duties on french goods in england as they now stand and which are in the nature of prohibitions and made the whole coast of france a free port to the english and many other things might have been done  but take the treaty as a convention between two nations in which we were to provide for the equity and justice of trade to settle the equallities of commerce between them with due regard to the proportions of things and the circumstances of the respective nations for the accommodation of the subjects of both and either nation being free and without dependence upon the other i say if we take the treaty thus as really it ought to be taken i must confess and i must speak my mind freely and plainly whoever it offends i do not see how the treaty could be made between the two nations upon more equal terms than it is if i did i should not be backward to speak it  nay on the contrary i do think that the french king has struck such a blow by this treaty to the manufactures of wool among his own people that if he stands long to the conditions of it all the undertakers of woollen manufactures in france must be ruined and undone  it might indeed have taken away some of the clamor at this treaty if there had been some little advantage given to the portugal wine trade but when i remember how the french and the portugal trade stood formerly when i was concerned in them both how the portuguese wines paid above eight pound per ton custom more than the french and that now the french are brought to an equallity i must allow that it is a large step in favor of the portugal trade and what must necessarily leave the said portugal trade in a better condition than it was in before the war  nor can it be possible that what some people say on that head can be true viz that the portuguese will on the breach of this article esteem the peace broke and will prohibit our manufactures the people who argue so discover that they know but little of the portugal trade the increase of the portugal trade is known to all the world and the occasion of it also is known viz the increase of their trade to the brasils this is not only carried on with english goods but with english stocks also and the english merchants of lisbon send great quantities of english goods to the brasils upon account and risqs of the english merchants at london and upon their own accounts or else trust the portuguese merchants with those goods to receive their effects at the return of the fleets from the brasils so that without the help of the english stocks as well as the english goods it would be but a poor trade that is carried on to the brasils  from hence it is easy to see that the danger of prohibiting our woollen manufactures in portugal is of no consequence nor could they carry on the brasil trade or indeed their own trade without our goods nor have they much reason to complain when upon a general settlement of the peace and trade of europe trade should be left to run in the same channel which it used to run in since they are put therein upon an even foot of customs with the french whereas before they paid near   l per ton custom more than the french  i know the portuguese have a treaty in which another kind of proportion is settled and much pains is taken to magnify the sacred obligation of this treaty but such treaties must all as the present treaty is be subject to the determination of parliament otherwise it must be true as the mercator has alleged that we shall give the prerogative a power which it does not pretend to and put it into the hands of a single agent envoy or plenipotentiary to repeal laws and limit the parliament of britain as to what they shall or shall not do and as to what duties they shall or shall not continue if laid on or lay on anew which i acknowledge is an authority destructive of the whole british constitution and inconsistent with the very being of parliament  if a treaty with portugal is made which goes this length it is void in its own nature and is no treaty at all and if the present ministry had made such a treaty with france the parliament would not have been bound by it and indeed could not without giving up the peoples liberties which they are entrusted with  these are indeed but my private thoughts nor do i regard in them what has been said by others on this head on either side i say it again all treaties so far as they respect the laying on or taking off of those duties and taxes must be subject to parliamentary authority or else we give up parliaments to the prerogative and revive that fatal exercise of it the dispensing power which i hope never to see done in britain especially by those who espouse the revolution principle  also such treaties ought to be subject to the general treaty for settling the tranquillity of europe and as it has been thought fit to make some alteration in that treaty if the parliament shall confirm those alterations i cannot see that the king of portugal ought to think it unjust because he ought to have considered when he made that treaty whether the persons did not capitulate with him for what they had no power to make good and if by the english constitution they had not power to make it good he ought not to be offended that we do not give up that constitution to oblige him i am sorry to see some people who a few years past showed such commendable zeal for the british constitution be willing now to sacrifice it to a treaty whose conditions made by a private minister exceed the power that either he really had or that they who employed him were able to give him  on the other hand that the king of portugal shall immediately look on the infraction of this treaty as an insult and a breach of the peace and the like and should thereupon prohibit our manufactures of every kind which indeed is prohibiting commerce with us and consequently declaring war this i cannot persuade my self of for this would be an open defiance and i am satisfied the king of portugal has too much sense of the equity of things to break with england on that account or if he should have so little wit england may find ways and means to reduce the portuguese to reason and to resettle the trade again to our satisfaction or else portugal is represented to be a much more potent prince than i take him to be the king of portugal if the debate about the peace between him and spain continue is like to stand in too much need of the councils and assistance which britain is in condition to yield him i say too much to suffer him to break with britain on so trivial an occasion  i cannot but think our people give too much weight to the portuguese in this case and make the portugal nation seem to carry a greater poise in the balance and trade of europe than their circumstances allow making england so much obliged to the portuguese as to be afraid of their prohibiting our trade as if they were not at all concerned to have their wine their oil and their fruit shut out of england although they know if it should be so they are quite undone  i insist the less on this because i see it in debate by other hands but i must own i cannot but wonder to see people lay as it were the whole stress of their arguments upon a treaty with portugal which if it should be granted to be so sacred would be a dreadful precedent for this nation in giving up our parliament our privileges and our constitution to the power of the ministry and enable them to tie up the parliaments hands by whatever little bargains they may make abroad pretending that they the court have agreed that it shall be so and so  i would calmly entreat such men to reflect a little how oddly it would sound in the ears of all the ancient patriots of the revolution and the defenders of english liberty if they were now alive to have a minister of state stand up in the house of commons when a moneybill was before them and say mr speaker we cannot lay any farther duty on such and such goods from portugal for her majesty has made a treaty to the contrary and mr speaker her majesty commands you to lay such and such higher duties upon and not to take off such and such duties from french goods for a treaty is made that it shall be so  let us but compare this with the language of our constitution to be found in magna charta sir ed coke bracton and all the writings of our best lawyers and see whether this is not laying the axe to the root of parliaments and sapping the foundations of the english liberty and all this to give a sanction to a treaty which stands in no need of it and which if the worst comes to the worst ends in the imaginary resentment of a power who is in no manner of condition to quarrel with us this is a step i confess i never expected to see taken in britain and it is really a melancholy thing to see our people willinger to give up their liberties and their parliaments than the court to take the surrender  i shall make no farther reflections on this case we are to be very thankful that our liberties are fixed and very careful that we do not undermine them with our own hands  if the present ministry had taken mr methuen for their precedent and quoted my lord n  for their authority and had absolutely stipulated with the king of france to take off such and such duties etc as by the ninth article of this present treaty is expressed and had not left it to the determination of the parliament to whom it belongs what would these people have said then and how might the ministry have referred them back to the portugal treaty for their justification  these things clear up to me the objection against the treaty of commerce which is drawn from the portugal treaty i do not by this resolve the question whether it is proper to break in upon this portugal treaty in order to make the present treaty effectual let no man mistake or strain my words beyond what i lay down as my express meaning i shall speak to that by it self but i say this with respect to the whole treaty with portugal which i am not at all backward to declare my opinion of and the reasons for it viz that i think it cannot be justified those who made it ought if they had been living to have answered for it  i come back to the main subject and to my reasons as above why i always was of the opinion that we ought to have kept open our trade with france viz because we could get by the trade and that we ought to trade with every nation we can get money by  i think i need spend no time to prove the latter viz that we ought to trade with every nation we can get money by we are a nation which depends upon our commerce and our whole prosperity wealth and subsistence depends upon it the landed interest not excepted whose rents would soon be reduced to such a condition as to starve the landlords as well as the tenants a few of higher dimensions than ordinary excepted if our commerce should fail this commerce is supported and maintained principally by our woollen manufacture which is so considerable and essential to it that should we have no more a free export or a vent abroad for our manufactures the import we make from abroad would so overballance us from all parts of the world that we should immediately be exhausted of all our specie and the other produce of our country would scarce feed us for this reason nothing but a blindness which no nation but ours was ever possessed with would have led us to be accessory to the stopping the exportation of our own manufactures as has been done by prohibitions of trade whether to france or to any other part of the world  i know it has been objected that if we had not the french would to which i answer then the french should it was not our business to have done it first to prohibit our own goods because if we did not the french would is dying for fear of death and like a man hanging himself because he is in danger of being condemned to be hanged  our business had been to have loaded the french goods here with such duties as might have secured their importations from hurting us and to have left our woollen manufacture free to be carried to france or any where else as long as ever they would have bought a piece of them and if they must have been prohibited it had been the king of frances business to have prohibited them not ours it is our business to sell our woollen manufactures to every body in the world that would buy them because the produce of our land the labor of the poor the consumption of foreign imported goods which are the returns of them is all carried on by it and depends upon it in short we ought to trade with every nation we can gain by because the gain of our trade is the essential article on which the wealth of the nation depends  having laid down this foundation it follows to prove that we can and may gain by the trade to france this must be proved by proving that the vallue of our exportation to france with its appendices and additional circumstances shall exceed the vallue of our imports from france and this is proved by two circumstances which attend our trade now which did not attend it before the war   the several kinds of manufactures which we are now masters of and make either wholly or in part among our selves which we formerly imported from france   the loading the other goods which we shall import from france with such heavy duties as must ntcessarily lessen their consumption   there are other reasons to be given of less moment but these are the two main reasons which will prove our imports to be very considerably abated  there was no other reason ever given or indeed could be given why we should not trade with france but this that we imported such unreasonable quantities of their goods that infinitely overballancd what they took from us whether this was so or not is not my question i have spoken of that before but whether it shall be so for the future  let any man inform himself how much in a probable calculation of things that consumption of french goods will be lessened by the quantities of their several manufactures which we make here and if he will be just he will find them very considerable  they are under a very great mistake who think the wine and the brandy are the only considerable articles which weighed down the scale of trade to the french side there were several single articles which very much exceeded the wine trade  the accounts which those who argue against this trade show to the world and which are published in print make the linen imported from france into england amount to  00000 pound and they tell us the lockrams and dowlass alone amounted to by the same account three hundred and sixty thousand pounds the wrought silks imported in one year they make to amount to three hundred thousand pounds whereas by the same account the french wine is made to amount to but     00 pounds and the brandy amounts to but  0000 pounds the paper they say amounts to  0000 pounds and the like  i am not examining here whether these accounts are true are not it is manifest they are not if they are false then they will not make out the balance which they are brought to prove if they are true they will confirm the argument i am upon for these great and capital articles are all in a manner destroyed and cannot be recovered though the treaty now in suspense should take place  the silk trade is gone the importations of one part viz alamodes and lustrings is entirely stopped the weavers themselves gave it up before the house of commons the duty which is upon them and which must continue upon them is l        per c weight and is so great as utterly destroys the trade not a piece can be imported to any advantage and take away the profit of a trade you take away trade there cannot a piece be sold here but what must be run on shore by stealth and if we cannot prevent that it will be our own fault  the other part of the silk trade is reduced by two things   by the improvements which our own weavers have made in the broadweaving trade which since the encouragement given them by prohibiting the wearing of east india silk is so very great that the french can never outdo them   by the duty of    s per pound weight which is still to remain upon the french silks even by this treaty under both which circumstances the importation of french wrought silks will be very low i know it is calculated in a public paper to amount to between forty and fifty thousand pounds a year but i have reason to believe and am confirmed in my judgment by men of experience in that trade that it will be very little except what they may endeavor to get in privately by stealing the duty which as i say above if we cannot hinder it will be our own fault  i might give many reasons to prove that the importation of linen from france which is the princpal article of their importations will likewise be cut short and after having hinted the encouragement given to the linen manufacture in ireland the very great quantity of course tabling made in lancashire westmoreland durham and yorkshire the thin diapers and other linen brought now free of duty from scotland and the more than usual quantity of course linen made in several parts of england besides this i say itmay be observable that whereas they say we imported  0000 pieces of lockrams and dowlass from france in a year there has not been imported one sixth part of that quantity one year with another of hambro dowlass or of all the other kinds of cloth which have been supposed to answer to the uses which the french linen was applied to this must evedently demonstrate that the gross of the quantity is made at home  the undertakers of the manufacture of sailcloth in england and scotland may answer for me how much they shall abate the importation of vitre pertree and noyels canvass with which we used to be supplied from france for making of sails and if they may be credited they pretend to be able to make the whole quantity to which purpose if the present duties on the french are not high enough and will not give them an advantage of the french sufficient to encourage and support their work on their representing the same to the parliament no doubt they may have farther and higher duties laid on from which the parliament are not at all limited or restrained by this treaty  i might go on to speak of other articles as of the paper the increase of distilling the making of glass and several other things all which join to lessen our demand of goods from franee by the finding ways to supply the consumption at home but i think these are sufficient to answer for an abatement so considerable as would make the argument good seeing i am assured by those whose judgment and experience i esteem better than my own that we shall not import in each of those two heads viz the silk and the linen so much by a prodigious sum as they have given an account of to have been formerly imported  the laying on high duties and those duties lessening the consumption of other goods is the next article and might take up some of our time here but i find it is spoken to by other hands the thing is so natural none can deny it there cannot be the same quantity of brandy imported when it is to pay upwards of  0 l per ton custom as would be or was when it paid but  0 s although the distilling of malt spirits were not to be spoken of the like of the wines  these are the reasons on one part why i think it will for ever be true that we may trade with france to our advantage viz that their importations to us cannot be so great by a very great sum as they usually were in the days of king charles ii and king james ii  i come now to the exportation of english goods to france and i must acknowledge that i go in this part upon a foundation which is to me very satisfactory though perhaps not discerned by every one that considers it  our manufactures which formerly were loaded in france with extravagant high duties and at last with a total prohibition are now to be freely imported into france paying no other duties than as by the tariff of      which is about ten per cent and with a small exception to the woollen clothes and clothserges which are to pay as by the tariff of       this must let in our manufactures into france in a full stream and open a door for a greater consumption of them in france than ever was before and this i say is the reason on the other side why i pretend to prove we shall now be gainers by the french trade for if the only exception against the trade is that of their overballancing our export if then i prove that their export to us shall now lessen and our export to them shall now increase so that we shall for the future overbalance them then my argument must be good viz that we ought to trade with them  it is brought as an objection and it is all the objection that can be brought in the case viz that the french make all our manufactures now as well as we do and therefore will not want ours any more nay so warm are some people to have this believed that they affirm though i doubt without evidence that they make as good cloth in france as we do and as good serges and perpets etc and in such quantities to as that they can supply all the world nay and supply us to if we will give them leave  these gentlemen beg the question very peremptorily and demand that we should strangely take them upon trust but the matter of fact has never yet been proved and this is not an age to believe men on their words in things of such a nature when parties bias men so much to strain their principles as we see is the case every day  it has been asked in public by one paper and i must ask it here it is so natural it cannot be strange if every man we talk with should ask it  where is this fine cloth and good woollen manufacture that the french make where do they hide it how comes it to pass that none of the gentlemen who come over hither have any of it on let the french ambassador be a test of this or any other french man that comes over look on their clothes their liveries their coaches the french ambassador cannot take it for an affront that we say an english servant to a private gentleman would have thought himself very ill used to have been clothed in such trappings how course how rusty the black how spungy how nappy and rough the clothes how ill made how worse dressed and how worst of all the wool of the clothes they appeared at first in the english colchester bays would have looked better than some of them looked if these are the manufactures they boast of i shall never fear but when our woollen clothes stuffs serges and other goods come among them at reasonable rates for the customs and duties they will make their own way and show the french that they are not able to make our manufacture to any perfection  it is said by those who object against it that they have our wool and have gotten workmen from hence and their people work cheaper than ours can do and why should they not make our manufactures as good as we do  this i desire to explain upon a little and i shall leave my opinion to the judgment of those who are impartial if any such are left among us as for those who will not judge impartially who will have it be as they would have it be and that will admit no argument but their own positive affirming a thing these sheets shall not meddle with them nothing but experience can deal with such and they are never convinced till they are made ashamed  as to the french getting wool from england it is too true that they get great quantities of wool both from england and ireland ever have done so and i doubt ever will do so how to have it prevented i do not undertake to say it is like the distemper of the gout in the body which every body has a medicine for and no body can cure  as to getting workmen from england i will not say but that may be true also though we have not seen it proved take that with you too traitors to their country are always to be had who for a morsel of bread will do any thing and as there is no law to punish them and they are out of reach also we must always be content  but neither of these can come into the partyquestion the government can no more hinder men going over to france to teach the clothworkers how to dress their cloth than they can hinder men going to list in foreign armies the new ministry can no more hinder the exporting of wool than the old ministry could i believe they would willingly hearken to any means that would be effectual and so would the last ministry have done but both have been tired with the quacking of projectors who have always worried innocent men connived at rogues and left the disease worse than they found it  but i shall undertake to prove two things here that shall confound all this notion   that neither the workmen or the wool will effectually answer for making our woollen manufacture   that neither the french or any nation in the world do or can work cheaper than the english both can and do  from these principles i insist upon it that the french cannot make our woollen manufactures so as to prevent the sale of ours when a trade shall be opened by taking off the duties as by the tariff of      but that on the contrary our goods coming among them shall be so much better and in proportion to that goodness so much cheaper that they shall in time destroy all their undertakings of woollen manufacture and increase the consumption of ours on this account joined to what i have said before it is that i say we may gain by the french trade and is therefore another reason why we ought to trade with them  the original or foundation of the manufacture is the wool the first step to the working this wool is the sorting combing carding and preparing the wool the first to wit the sorting the wool requires judgment and experience in the master clothier who must know what kind of wool is proper for every manufacture from hence we find that in the clothing countries they throw by a great quantity of their wool as not proper for their work and this is carried out of those countries to the worsted works and to the comber again in the stuffmaking countries the wool which is not proper for them is picked out and laid by and carried out of their countries to the clothiers and the like of other manufactures  this judgment perhaps may be carried over to france by such vagabond bankrupt clothiers and combers as were not able to show their heads at home necessity may tempt such to go abroad as to the carding combing and preparing the wool when sorted that is a road which any one may teach them and which they perhaps may not want to learn so that this is not the point  the next article is the spinning and give me leave to say this as it is the essential so it is the inimitable part of our manufacture and the french are utterly unable to do this and we are unable to teach them they are so far from being able to imitate the various sorts of spinning which is now practiced in england that really we cannot imitate our selves there is so much evidence in this truth and it is so well known and so proved by experience that i freely appeal to all the manufactures of great britain for the proof of it  the spinning generally speaking is the work of the women and children it is learned from mother to daughter as birds learn to sing cocks to crow and little children to speak viz by immediate imitation the manner is carried from one to another by that aptness which is in the young of every creature to follow the old and becomes a natural habit like a tone in the speech which is peculiar to this or that county which they who use it know not how to alter and they that do not know not how to imitate  thus you may know the people who are born and bred in the several parts of this kingdom by the shibboleth of the place they come from they cannot conceal it nor can a man born in another part of the country mimick them so but that he will easily be known to be a counterfeit this is plain in the people of norfolk and suffolk east devon somerset wilts and dorset west lancashire northwest yorkshire durham and northumberland north scotland wales and several other parts  in like manner every way the same in its kind and introduced the same way viz by a mere habit and that not to be altered by themselves or imitated by others is the manufacture of spinning naturalized to the people of the several parts of england according to the several countries they have been taught to work in nay even in the same countries the spinning differs as the several manufactures which this or that part of the county are employed in differs  the consequence of this is essential to the manufacture whence proceeds the variety of our sorts of goods which appears not at all according to the nature of the wool but according to the different places where it is wrought the reason of which is the spinning and nothing else  a proof of this is easily known by this experiment take the spinning of one county and carry it to be wrought into another county and for another kind of goods than it uses to be wrought in the defect shall presently appear in the goods although for the goods it was spun for it was the best of its kind that could be  nay take the spinning of one town and carry it to another town where the same kind of goods are made and it shall work into that same sort of the kind which were made in the town from whence it came how comes it to pass that no place in england can make the bays but colchester the says but sudbury the serges but devonshire the kerseys but hallifax the fine whites but gloucester and worcestershire the tamies but coventry the cantaloons but at bristol  nay of these goods how come the several species to differ so from one another why cannot the men of bocking make as good bays as at colchester why are the shaloons in northamptonshire better than those in the west why the devon kersies better than the yorkshire and that these towns and countries though they have or may have the same wool are not able with all their skill to imitate or come up to one another  it is manifest that it is all in the spinning whatever the difference is it is hard to determine but that such a difference is i affirm and i appeal to all the manufacturers in england for the truth of it and this difference runs through the whole operation of the manfacture that follows it like an error in the first concoction which is never mended in the second so an error or a peculiar way in the first spinning is never corrected afterward but as is the yarn such is the stuff let it be of what kind it will  now this i say is impossible to be carried into france the people there spin and perhaps may spin finer than ours and i believe they do but unless they spin the same kind of thread for the same kind of manufacture that we do they can no more imitate ours than one of our towns or counties can imitate another  for example take a woman that has been bred to spin for the making of flannel suppose from shropshire and carry her into essex and let her see how they spin as much as she will and try as much as she can she shall no more spin good yarn for making a piece of bays or to sudbury she shall no more spin for their work than the spinners there can for her flannel she can no more alter her hand effectually than she can shake off her shropshire dialect from her tongue and learn to whine and talk as they do in suffolk  how many attempts of this kind have been made in england viz to transplant the manufacture of one county into another and we have very rarely found it practicable if then one county cannot imitate another if one town cannot imitate another nay in some goods one manufacturer cannot imitate another though they have all the same materials too how should another nation imitate us  and what is the reason that we find such struggling such envying such quarrelling among our manufacturers like tittle parties in the trade to get one anothers spinners away and to get this or that town spinning away but because the goodness of a manufacture always depends upon the goodness of the spinning how comes this or that clothiers goods to be known at blackwellhall and to be enquired for by his name and by his mark and to sell better than his neighbors and the like of other goods but that he has better spinners than his neighbors  i might dwell upon this prove and explain it by many arguments and examples but i believe every one who has any experience of trade will grant it  if then i say we cannot imitate one another in our manufactures where we have plenty of all materials choice of the wool and experienced workmen only by reason of the difference and difficulty of the spinning how shall a foreign nation adapt their spinning to our manufacture a nation that have a great scarcity of wool and must mix several kinds and the wool of several nations together that have a scarcity of all other materials and above all must take such wild and untaught spinners as they can get  nor will it argue in this case to say they can have spinners from hence for i affirm the best spinner in england cannot teach another to spin as she spins if ever the learner had spun any thing before but if she teaches it must be young children from five year and upwards or some that had never touched a wheel  when this is done this teaching spinner can teach only to spin as she spun her self be it for whatsoever species of manufacture she was brought up to and i dare say that the nation can very rarely show a spinner that can spin very well a yarn for more than one kind of manufacture so that by this rule the french must get spinners over to teach their people distinguished by their work for every kind of manufacture we make  this is a reason why the french cannot come up to our manufacture and a reason which i flatter my self cannot be answered  there is yet another thing which affects indeed some of our manufactures only but so many of them and that so considerable a part  viz our clothing that i believe it renders it inimitable in any other part of the world and this is the water i have not time to enlarge upon this but let the men of stroud water in gloucestershire be the standard and let us see any other part of this nation come up to them and then we may suggest that other nations may also do it  this would take up a tract by it self to explain and to examine the reasons why one kind of water should be better than another for dressing milling washing as well as dying and why though the dutch or french were able to fix brighter and better colors than we can yet the wool it self shall not work so kindly the nap of the cloth rise so well nor the shearer work so close with the dressing in one water as it shall in another and for this reason the clothiers in some parts carry their goods many miles to these or those fulling mills when there are others nearer home  i am so near the close of this tract that i cannot enlarge but i come to another case in our manufacture wherein i find we are run down by a vulgar error which however at this time is made mighty use of and makes more noise than is for our reputation especially as it comes out of our own mouths and this is that the french people work cheaper than we nay so great is the assurance which our people speak it with that they are not slack to say that they can work cheaper by four pence in a shilling  i am bold to say such discourse is enough to convince any man that understands manufacturing that the people who speak it either say it without knowledge or against knowledge i am afraid it is the latter  could the poor in france work cheaper than the english by a groat in a shilling could the spinner the weaver the carder the dresser the dyer etc perform all those works which are at the beginning of the manufacture fourpence in a shilling cheaper than the english the clothier that finishes it would be able to sell it eight pence in the shilling cheaper when it was finished for that difference in the first work would double in the price of the whole cloth and so the clothes which the english could not sell under twelve shillings per yard at market the french would sell at four shillings per yard and of consequence must of necessity have long ago had all the trade of the world  as this though but a short hint is sufficient to expose the falsehood of that suggestion so i shall lay one thing down as a certain truth which i know to be true of my own certain knowledge in many cases and offer to prove by good evidence in others and i shall leave it to farther enlargement if i am called to speak to it again the assertion is this in short  that set the goodness and quantity of their work against their wages and no nation in the world works cheaper than the english  let no man suggest that this cannot be made out my name is to this book i will make it good and at any reasonable hazard i offer to prove it beyond the power of all the cavils of the world take it in any or all the branches or parts of the woollen manufacture i repeat it again in other words set the goodness of the performance and the quantity of work done against the wages no manufacturers in the world have their work done cheaper or for for less wages than the english  i do not deny but in diligence they may outdo us i know the english poor are not so forward to work as the french and perhaps when the english have earned their money hardly they may spend it lightlier than others and be as poor as any of them  i know that if you higher a frenchman by the day he shall come at less wages  i know if the french man works for himself he shall sit to it more hours  but then the english day man shall do more work in less time  or the english day man shall make better work  and the englishman that works for himself shall perform as much in less time than the frenchman or make his work deserve more wages  i appeal to spittle fields for the truth of this in part and even to the french manufacturers there themselves  had i room here i should produce experiments which i have made of the english manufacturing against frenchmen dutchmen scotsmen and others i can prove in them all that we work much cheaper than any people in the world allow weight for inches as the jockies call it and i am not at all partial to my own country in it neither but i cannot enlarge upon this subject  conclusion these are my reasons why i think we are sure to gain by the french trade and i have set them down with as much clearness and impartiallity as i can and although the treatment i receive from the world at this time might be justly allowed to move me i have done it calmly and without any of the rudeness which these things are now debated with yet i cannot but say that i am injuriously dealt with in these matters every man has a right to think of these things as his reason experience and judgment dictates and i do not know any law that forbids him making that opinion public  but i must complain of a treatment which i confess i never saw given to any man but my self in this nation i am treated by the writers of the town as if it was criminal in me to give my opinion because it differs from theirs and with the utmost fury and scurtillity i am treated as one that had lost my english liberty and ought not to have freedom of speech allowed me  when other people publish pamphlets and papers which argue against these men these answer them upon me they adventure upon the mere guess at language to call me the author of any thing they do not like though oftentimes i not only have not been the author but the first knowledge i have had of the thing has been when i have seen my self insolently treated for writing it  i laid down the review because my thoughts of things did not agree with the present opinion of those people for whom i had so much respect that i was weary of differing with them and in the last which i published i hinted my design of going abroad to be out of the reach of this clamor as soon as public obligations would allow me i am fallen upon by the scurrilous writer of the flyingpost as a cheat because i am not gone abroad and yet he knows i am under bail not to stir and that running from my bail has not been any part of my practice  whether i am concerned or no i am daily insulted and told that i am not to be treated with decency have the lie given me in print by men that do not think fit to let me know their names or to give me leave to ask them whether they will do it to my face or no  persecution has been condemned by all sides as an unchristian practice but if causeless slander be not a cruelty worse than death and the persecution of the tongue be not the worst kind of persecution let any impartial man judge  under all this treatment i arm my self with patience and desire to return these men no evil for their evil i have ruined my family in the service of the people who i find now so angry and because i could not desert them suffered all that the rage of their enemies could inflict and i have lived to see those very people reproach me with that suffering and that fidelity which they once acknowledged was a service to them is it seems now my infamy whether my suffering merited their thanks at that time i do not determine but sure it could not merit thanks then and their reproach now i appeal to themselves  but be all these things as he shall direct who governs the world and god be praised these men are not to be my judges at last in the mean time if i am not allowed to give my opinion in things which no law prescribes me in where then is justice where charity where english liberty and how do these men show themselves tyrants even of the worst kind who would deprive a man of his liberty of speech because he does not say what they approve of  it is my satisfaction that i am hitherto pursuing no end but what i firmly believe to be the true interest of my country and i am fully persuaded that even the people who are at this time so warm will in a few years be convinced they are in the wrong and be ashamed of those men who now endeavor to inflame and exasperate us one against another in the mean time i have here given my reasons for my present opinion relating to the trade with france which i have done rather as a testimony to future times of the foundation upon which my said opinion is grounded and to answer the calumnies of those people who malign and without provocation insult me than from any prospect i have that the soundest reasoning will allay the ferment which the parties among us have unhappily put the nation into  i make no question in its proper time to clear my self likewise from the charge of having changed sides in other matters and to bring some people to acknowledge they do me injustice in the treatment they now give me but the ferment is too great for reason to take place and i am content to suffer the injury till it shall please him that guides the world to give me an occasion to do my self justice  but in matters of trade i think now is the time to speak  a trade with france or no trade with france is now the question i have first to remove scandal proved to you what my opinion was of the french trade formerly and what i said then about it and now i have offered my present opinion if then what i say now of it is no more than what i said formerly it will hardly pass with any reasonable man that i am changed unless to change and to be the same be proved to be one part of speech  god deliver this kingdom from the dreadful consequences which our blessed savior says must follow a nation divided against it self  finis
