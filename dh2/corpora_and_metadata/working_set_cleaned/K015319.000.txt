the true method of reducing ruptures and retaining them in the abdomen and in the navel  together with testimonies to the merits of mr brands elastic truss and several authenticated cases of the most extraordinary cures  to which is added a postscript  by robert brand inventor of the elastic truss and elastic navel bandage and trussmaker to his majestys r hospital at greenwich  london printed for the author and sold by him at his house no    longacre  sold also by s bladon in paternosterrow and messrs richardson and urquart at the royal exchange  mdcclxxi  to mr hunter sir since it is principally to you i am obliged for my knowledge in the reduction of ruptures i cannot with so great propriety dedicate the following sheets to any other person added to this the consideration of that generous friendliness so predominating in men of frank natures which you have on many occasions exercised toward me prompts me to snatch the opportunity of confessing my gratitude at the same time i am happy that not the most censorious caviller can pretend this address is founded on interested motives  i have nothing to ask of the world but candor  from you sir i am assured of meeting with it in the most refined sense  i am sir with the most unfeigned respect your much obliged and very obedient servant long acre robert brand  the true method of reducing ruptures etc my truss is only intended for the benefit of such ruptures in the groin and scrotum as there is a possibility of returning again into the abdomen though i make others of a different construction according to the situation of the part from whence it proceeds and other circumstances that may attend it and in particular a new invented elastic bandage for a rupture in the navel for the invention of which i am in part obliged to dr allen of dalwich college  before i give any directions how to apply my truss it may be proper to say something with regard to the safest and easiest manner of reducing the intestine when fallen down and the following is the method i have always practiced with great success  i must too premise that i have some hopes my readers will not entertain a less favorable opinion of me if i avoid the pomposity of some persons who have wrote on this subject if i do not endeavor to raise my merit on the sound of a word and torture language for newfangled and varying names merely because the symptoms of the disorder are triflingly different  if the rupture then be much enlarged or painful it will be of great service to the patient before the reduction is attempted to take a gentle cooling purgative such as a decoction of tamarinds with sena or a solution of salts and manna and if he is of a plethoric or full habit of body to let a moderate quantity of blood will be proper and at the same time the parts should be fomented with a piece of flannel wrung out of a warm decoction of emollient herbs such as chamomile flowers mallows etc  after these preparations you should proceed in the following manner lay the patient upon his back in such a posture that his buttocks may be considerably higher than his head as by that means the bowels that are within the belly will fall more toward the breast and not only give way to what is to be returned but be of some assistance to the reduction then you must examine carefully as to the situation of the testicles and if you find they are forced up toward the sides of the scrotum by the size of the rupture you must be very cautious not to squeeze them in your attempt if you find them compressed at the bottom of the scrotum you must with the forefinger and thumb of one hand separate them from the ruptured part and with the same fingers of the other hand take hold of the upper part that is next the ring of the muscles or place from whence the rupture comes out and work it gently in in the same manner as you observe women do with a cows teats when they milk her by observing this method you will never be apt to strain the rings of the muscles nor hurt the intestine so as to occasion an inflammation of any of these parts  as to the application of the truss it will be more convenient to put it slack round the patients body before he is laid down as by his getting up after the reduction there might be some risque of the bowel falling down again take hold of each end of the spring and open it wide enough to receive his body sideways and after you have got the bowel fairly reduced apply the cushion of the trss upon the rings or orifice from whence the bowel came out it must have a gentle hold of the upper part of the os pubis or sharebone but take care it is not placed too high or too low the spring will be a direction which should come round the os ilium and close to the juncture of the thighbones and touch the rump just here the clift of the buttocks begins which parts are called by the anatomists the great trochanter of the thighbones and the middle of the os sacrum the truss must be made so tight as to make it sit close otherwise it will neither do its office nor be easy to the wearer  always keep under the cushion four fold of old coarse linen which will keep the part cool and easy and prevent the cushion from being spoiled by the moisture of the skin it will be a great addition to the truss if for six or seven weeks or longer that is to say till the patient has completed his cure which if he has youth on his side may possibly be in two months of which indeed i have seen some instances but then the patient has been very observant of the rules prescribed him the parts are bathed with very cold water every night and morning which may be done conveniently in the following manner take a piece of large linen cloth fold it up pretty thick so as to be about six or seven inches square a few stitches may be put into it to keep the folds together dip it into a basin of cold water but that you may not wet the truss loose it and lay the pad or cushion that was in the groin up to the navel out of the way of the water then squeeze and apply it to the scrotum and groin and as it loses its coldness dip it in the water again and again which should be continued for half an hour at a time it is most convenient this cold bathing should be performed when the patient is naked in bed it is necessary that the patients breeches should be very long in the thighs so as to allow the waistband to come high up on the pelvices above the truss for if it bear thereon it will add so much to the pressure which will make it very uneasy  i must here advise my reader that in examining any thing like a rupture he does not mistake a swelling of the spermatic chord or in the groin for one as by handling any thing of that kind roughly he may not only give the patient an exquisite deal of pain but do great mischief if it is really a rupture gentle means without being in too great a hurry will answer best a very gentle pressure of the fingers in an erect posture will sometimes cause it to disappear but if this should fail lay your patient on his back then rub your fingers upwards and downwards obliquely from the os ilium to the os pubis this is to be continued for a considerable time but if it should not remove it and it still continues to the touch as at first the patient must continue in the same situation and have the part fomented and the above operation again performed after which should it still continue hard it is certainly no rupture when a surgeon measures a patient for a truss he is to take it round very close to the juncture of the thigh bone to the os ilium which is the proper place for the truss to be wore then sending the number of inches that the measure contains to the trussmaker he never can make an error but he must too be informed on which side the rupture is whether it is double or whether it is only in the groin or in both groins so as to descend as low on one side as the testicles   i have been frequently shocked at the cruelty with which i have seen surgeons use their patients merely by mistaking a swelling for a rupture  on these occasions i have remonstrated  but as i was not bred a surgeon my counsel was treated with contempt although they quickly found their attempts in that way were in vain  it may not here be improper to observe that my knowledge in these matters took its first rise from being afflicted with a rupture myself i tried all the different kinds of trusses that have been used and recommended by surgeons for many years back but found the best of them subject to some inconveniency however as i was originally a mechanic i went to work with an intention to avoid the inconveniences of those i had used and after trying several different new forms i at last hit upon that which i now offer to the public and has given so much satisfaction to all who have used it as to any farther knowledge i have of ruptures i am obliged to some gentlemen of the faculty particularly dr hunter and dr livingston also to dr barry for the books he recommended to my perusal when put you in mind how ridiculous the surgeons of former times appear in this more enlightened age in having rejected friar jaquess new method of cutting for the stone for no other reason but because he was not a regular bred surgeon i hope no gentleman of the faculty will condemn my truss till he can prove its having any deficiency and has compared it very narrowly with others that continue in use the recommendation of those who have experienced its benefit which some thousands in the dominions of britain france italy germany holland and portugal have done would perhaps be sufficient but that many people who are subject to any disorder of that kind are fond of concealing it and consequently will never mention any thing of my truss however in my being constituted trussmaker to his majestys royal hospital at greenwich even when mr alexander reid first surgeons mate of chelsea hospital mr william blackey of the college of surgeons at paris and mr eddison bedsteadmaker of hanoverstreet longacre with a letter of recommendation signed by a great number of regularbred surgeons amongst whom i wish mr hawkins had not been one some of them too the most eminent in the profession in trusses in london were candidates in opposition to me cannot fail to give the public a just idea ofits merit these gentlemen it is well known did stand a fair trial with me every day almost for two months before the physicians and surgeons of the royal hospital made their report of the candidates different merits on which i was appointed elastic trussmaker by the honorable board of directors of his majestys royal hospital  i think it would be here an unpardonable offense to posterity not to inform my readers that to this day a surgeon of the greatest eminence recommends a shoemaker to all his ruptured patients to make the trusses for them though i am very certain he does not know iron from steel when it is made out of the common sizes of the bars thereof this i have from jobbingsmiths some of whom the seller has employed ever since he was converted from a shoemaker into a trussmaker it is this eminent surgeon and this shoemaker that counselor brand at mays hill greenwich means in his letter therefrom to me which is hereafter inserted for the use of the public amongst others sent me together with certificates of the efficacy of my trusses above all others made use of  shortly after i had invented my elastic truss i had an opportunity of sending some of them to mr ranby principal serjeantsurgeon to his majesty in consequence of which i received the following letter  to robert brand cutler in aberdeen sir some time ago i believe about the time you mention a soldier left two trusses at my house and in a day or two afterward took them away i understood from my servant that he was the maker of them they appeared to me to vary a little from the common ones however when you come up in june bring some with you which if upon trial answer better than those used now you will certainly meet with encouragement  i am your most obedient servant j ranby chelsea college april  0       that i bought one of these trusses from the bearer robert brand cutler and that it has done better with me than one i had from england or one i had made in this place is in justice and gratitude to his merit  attested at aberdeen may  0th      by j ogleby minister at aberdeen   i shall only add which is indeed truth that this truss is so very convenient that i can walk and do every thing else as freely with it as if i had no ailment at all  j o   in justice and gratitude to robert brand trussmaker in aberdeen i acknowledge that i have had a rupture for these five years that about that time i was an invalid doing garrison duty at the island of guernsey i had a truss purchased at london for me by mr rose the kings receiver in the island which i wore but with great pain for the space of four years i then got a truss which came from chelsea hospital but with no better success until about a month ago i purchased one from mr brand being a single truss and fitted for the right side which has answered the intent by giving me no pain in my walking keeps up the rupture and without the encumbrance of a thighstrap is attested to be truth by me this  0th day of may       alexander forbes aberdeen  the above declaration is attested by me john dye of tilligrieg one of his majestys justices of the peace for the county of aberdeen  john dye j p aberdeen may  0       i doctor thomas livingston physician to the infirmary at aberdeen do hereby certify that robert brand cutler in this city has bestowed great pains and attention in contriving a new construction of rupturetrusses which for ease as well as prevention of the disease seems to answer better than the ordinary trusses formerly in use and it consists with my particular knowledge that many people have used them with great benefit and satisfaction  attested by thomas livingston aberdeen june         in january      the following memorial was presented to the edinburgh society for the encouragement of arts etc by mr barclay their secretary  my lords and gentlemen i humbly beg leave to represent to you that ruptures are unfortunately too common perhaps the fourth part of mankind labor under them in old age and as to women who have had children if half of them escape accidents of this kind it is a miracle  being originally when i say originally i would be understood that it was the first trade i followed and i am not i ought not to be ashamed of saying though i practiced it some years with great sucess i was not regularly bred even to that nor any other trade whatever a cutler and surgeons instrumentmaker and having been for many years afflicted with a rupture which greatly incommoded me in the necessary functions of life i had recourse to the various trusses and bandages made use of for relieving that misfortune both from london and paris but finding them very incommodious as well as ineffectual i applied myself with great attention to the improvement of those necessary contrivances and after many years repeated trials and many years experience have at last happily succeeded and so greatly improved the steel truss as to make it answer every desirable purpose for the curing as well as palliating that troublesome disorder which numbers as well as myself have experienced both here and in london to authenticate which assertion letters should it be thought necessary can be produced from patients resident at both places  the great advantages which my trusses have in consequence of this improvement above others are as follow  first by an elastic spring peculiar to themselves they are accommodated equally well to persons of every age and size so that two different sizes is the only requisite for making them fit every person of above two years of age and the same circumstance likewise makes them more proper for exportation than any hitherto invented  secondly they do not require that troublesome and incommodious appendage a thighstrap so commonly used in other bandages  thirdly they by the elasticity abovementioned maintain a constant equal and uniform pressure on the part only affected and imitate the kind pressure of the hand in all its degrees in all the different attitudes of the body whereby the parts making the rupture are so constantly kept from coming down that an opportunity is given to the relaxed and ruptured parts through which they descend to recover their former state and thereby prove to the patient a radical cure  four thly i can afford to sell the abovementioned trusses at as low a price as the other trussmakers in britain sell their iron trusses without any other property to them than dignifying them with the names of steel and spring trusses  these and other advantages too tedious to mention convince me that this improvement when generally known will prove a very great benefit to a very great part of mankind and therefore i persuade myself that should it meet with your approbation i shall not fail of sharing that encouragement and generosity which so highly dignifies your honorable society  i am my lords and gentlemen with the most profound respect your most obedient servant robert brand true copy aberdeen jun          in consequence of the presentation of the foregoing memorial i received the following letter  to robert brand cutler and trussmaker in aberdeen sir you here have the report dr monro gives the society of arts on the back of your memorial which i returned this day to mr barclay who said it would make nothing as to premium after his respectful compliments to the honorable society dr monro says the trusses mr brand presents is no new invention as there is of the same kind and same materials used by most surgeons in europe for many years past the only essential circumstance is the circular steel spring is more strict than those in common use which makes them sit easier on the patient and better fit persons of different sizes he adds that this last is scarce worth observation as each person ought to have his measure taken in the most accurate manner march  th       your most obedient servant john pirrie edinburgh march  th       p s a few days after i delivered your memorial to mr barclay he called at my house and told me the society had pitched on dr monro to examine into the merits of your trusses which the doctor very readily assented to and that i must carry them to him directly which i accordingly did on opening the box taking them out and showing them to the doctor he said they were made in the same manner as mr auchinlec here makes them i said there was a great difference but still the doctor insisted there was none on this his son stepped into another room and brought one of auchinlecs making out and on comparing them together he confessed there was a difference  had he suffered as much pain with trusses as i have done he would sooner have seen it  when persons of confined ideas and who have not the advantages of education fall into an error there is an excuse ready for them the gross mistakes of a man of letters are unpardonable dr monros misapprehension indeed seems wilful could any thing be more uncandid than his declaration that my trusses and mr auchinlecs were alike  could any thing be more mean than the hardstraind acknowledgement that there was some difference in his report he says that my truss differs from others only in the circular steel spring being more strict than those in common use which makes them sit easier and better fit persons of different sizes but this ease and this convenience it seems are not worth thinking of because each person ought to have his measure taken in the most accurate manner  here is philosophy  i frequently send trusses to the east and west indies  were dr monro living i would ask him if i should make a voyage every time i receive an order   here follow several testimonies to the merits of my truss which without further ceremony the reader will i believe accept  to mr brand in great peters street westminster sir the machine you last left with me does its office very well and sits easy  your humble servant j b greenwich august  th       to mr brand in great peters street westminster mr brand after a variety of trusses i have made use of from different persons recommended to me by a surgeon of great character in town which did not do their office yours that i have now on and have worn constantly nine or ten weeks not only fully answers its purpose of keeping the gut up but sits very easy and is attended with little or no trouble  j brand counselor at law greenwich sept   th       on the recommendation of dr hunter i made use of mr brands elastic truss to a youth about seven years of age who had been afflicted with a scrotal rupture for two or three years i had used in the course of that time several ineffectual means without success yours he wore with great ease and entirely prevented any return of the disorder  witness my hand this   th day of feb      w tailor late surgeon of the dockyard at woolwich a new surgeon of greenwich hospital   these are to certify that i have seen mr brands bandages for ruptures and that from the several opportunities i have had for them find they answer better than any other i have had occasion to use  w norton navy surgeon strand june  d       this is to certify that i have frequently recommended mr robert brand trussmaker whose bandages always gave great satisfaction to my patients and to me  r bromfield m d gerardstreet july   th       these are to certify that i have seen and carefully examined the elastic bandages for ruptures made by mr robert brand of peterstreet westminster trussmaker and am of opinion that they are neat and strong in their construction very ingenious in their contrivance and more peculiarly adapted to several purposes of a truss than any other bandage i have ever seen  given under my hand this   th day of july      st martinslane c kelly m d   having made use of the trusses made by mr brand on some patients afflicted with ruptures i think it no more than a piece of justice due to his ingenuity to acknowledge that they have succeeded very well in fulfilling the intention for which they were applied nor have i ever seen any trusses which i should prefer to them  w hewson surgeon now in argyle buildings oxford road july          these are humbly to certify the governors of the royal hospital at greenwich that i have seen several instances of ruptures where the patients have unsuccessfully made use of several operators trusses which were painful and uneasy to them and afterward being advised to use mr brands elastic ones they found speedy ease and no pain therefrom and for that reason in my opinion his deserves the preference of all other trusses  t poole surgeon of the royal navy savoy august          i havb seen some instances where mr brands elastic trusses have been successful where others have failed  e barry m d now in bath august  0th       i have seen some instances where mr brands elastic trusses have been successful where others have failed therefore i think they deserve peculiar notice  f pinkston surgeon st albansstreet august   th       these are to certify that i recommended a patient to mr brand who had been afflicted from his infancy with an inguinal rupture and had tried all means for a cure with the different sorts of trusses without success giving him great pain in wearing them so that he was often obliged to leave them off and his rupture would as often come down but after applying mr brands truss he found to his great satisfaction that he could wear it with great ease and declared himself much obliged to the ingenious author of such a truss from which he had found so much relief  as witness my hand hugh crawford m d leicesterfields august   th       in the case referred to by this gentleman on reducing the rupture if great care was not taken to divide the testicle from it the latter would follow the former into the belly  this is to certify that i have often examined and seen applied mr brands steel trusses and i do imagine that they are better adapted for the cure of ruptures than any i have seen  john hunter surgeon now in jermyn street august          i hereby certify that after having recommended various sorts of trusses to my patients i can find none so easy to the wearers or so well adapted to the relief of their disorders as the elastic trusses made by mr brand of petersreet westminster  c hale surgeon parliamentstreet august          to mr robert brand trussmaker to his majestys royal hospital at greenwich at his house in st martinslane near charing cross london sir the generosity and humanity with which you treated me demand the most grateful acknowledgments and nothing gives me more concern than to think that necessity should oblige me to leave london without being able to pay you as my friend was not in town and the ship going away therefore i must entreat you to be patient for a short time and you shall have no cause to complain in the interim i send you my note for  l  0s payable in six months after date though the sum i owe you is only  l  s and as i shall make a remittance by the return of the ship from south carolina to mr edward upton in paternosterrow i shall desire him at the same time to take up the note permit me to assure you sir that i shall spare no pains to recommend your trusses in south carolina and in the mean time please to pay my compliments to your good spouse and son  sir i am with the greatest respect your much obliged humble servant g spencer deal july  0th       mr spencer was a gentleman of the clergy and had a living in north america being afflicted with a very large femoral rupture he applied to several for relief without any success among whom was the ingenious mr blackey of paris who applied a truss that was adapted for a groin rupture on his femoral rupture however i made a proper truss for him and applied it which i had no sooner done and he finding that it would do its office than he desired me to take it off i asked him why he said because he had not money sufficient about him to pay for it and that his friend was not in town i told him i had no doubt of the money for i believed him a gentleman on which we parted and i never faw nor heard from him till i received the letter inserted  he faithfully remitted the money and i received it  to mr robert brand sir a short time since i desired my brother to call on you for an elastic steel truss for a patient i have here during the time he has used it has found the greatest benefit have reason to think he will get a perfect cure by persevering in the use of it this morning as he was applying it as usual the part broke as you see which beg you to get mended and send to the bearer for conveyance to  sir your most humble servant william robbins axminster february          postscript having received several letters containing the most illiberal abuse in consequence of the publication of the preceding pages some of which i have reason to suppose were written by counselor brands see page  0 surgeon of character i think it necessary to declare that i never intended nor indeed could i form an idea that the treatise in question should give the smallest offense to any gentleman of the faculty my sole object was  the relief of my fellow creatures and the instruction of the ignorant in that which it is necessary they should know  besides improving their practice i have a right to the thanks of the faculty for pointing out the most efficacious cure of a malady from which they are by no means exempt  and which the most eminent of them have had no little trouble to remove  and i sincerely wish i could not say with truth that numbers have within these few years lost their lives after having paid very considerable sums for pretended assistance and ineffectual advice it is interest then alone that prevents these cavillers from doing justice to my performances and which prompts them to cheat the disordered of assistance  i am acquainted with surgeons who have been many years in practice and who have assured me they never had an opportunity of reducing a rupture or of applying a truss  a midwife too who has been upwards of twenty years in practice lately declared to me that to her knowledge she never had delivered a woman that had a rupture either in the groin or navel  yet have i applied bandages on a variety of both   notwithstanding the true method of applying trusses or reducing ruptures is a matter of the utmost importance in the treatment of that malady and in the highest degree conducive to the ease of the patient i am bold to say that in all the treatises i have perused both ancient and modern and they are not a few i never met with any thing like a clear instruction to that purpose  something curious though by no means advantageous may be collected from a book lately published  the author i think dignifies his name with master of arts and surgery member of the royal academy of surgery at paris demonstrator in the school of st come surgeon for ruptures of the hospitals of hotel dieu the invalids and incurables of the city of paris and of all the military hospitals in france a process is there advised for making an ointment of a solution of gold pearls to be used for assisting the reduction of strangulated ruptures  when this ingenious and most expensive preparation is completed it will probably be as efficacious as the same quantity of clay in the same manner applied  i hoped in the treatises above hinted at to have found something that would at least have been capable of improvement in the true method of applying trusses and the reducing ruptures  on the contrary they contain merely long and unsatisfactory details of the manner in which the ancient surgeons commonly burnt the ruptures of their patients and destroyed the flesh of those parts to the bone with a view of avoiding the more necessary application of trusses  this is one proof among many that surgeons never encouraged trusses although it is universally acknowledged that it is impossible a cure can be perfectly obtained without such an assistant  the pain attending the wearing of some trusses it must be acknowledged has prevented many persons from adhering to the most salutary method of cure but such neglect is often attended with the most dreadful consequences it being no uncommon thing to meet persons in the street whose guts partly falling into their breeches exhibit a deplorable and pitiable spectacle  and here it may not be improper to inform the reader of the encouragement i received from the faculty on my arrival in london which was in june      mr ranby being the only gentleman of the profession i had the honor of knowing i waited upon him and by his desire afterward attended the gentlemen of st georges hospital with the countenance of such a gentleman as mr ranby whose name and letter to me at aberdeen i had the liberty to use i could not but form the most pleasing hopes of convincing some of the first surgeons in england of the merit and utility of my trusses  but i was disappointed i found though they were men of learning they were not men of candor  mr bromfield said he believed they might do mr gataker said he could see nothing more in my trusses than in any other however while i was one day attending a person then under the care of mr hawkins he informed me that he had long been an outpatient of that hospital and had trusses from every trussmaker in town but that none of them would keep his rupture up and that since he had been under mr hawkinss care he had procured him a truss from a person in bartholomew close which would by no means keep up his rupture though he had been to the maker twenty times to have it altered who told him his rupture would never be well till he had it cut i looked upon this as an opportunity offered me by providence of at once doing a service to a fellow creature and bringing conviction of the use of my elastic trusses to those who had ignorantly or interestedly denied their merits i brought the youth to my lodgings and there applied a truss on him my honest endeavors had the desired effect and in about three months he obtained a complete cure  lest any of my readers should doubt the truth of this relation i desire to inform them that the name of the abovementioned youth is john pellerst whose uncle of the same name lives in downestreet near hydepark corner and i believe that something relative to this affair will be found in the books of st georges hospital from the beginning of april      to the end of august in the same year  to this case i have only to add that notwithstanding this ample proof of the merits of my truss i cannot charge mr hawkins with recommending a single patient to me though he has often confessed my trusses were more efficacious than those of any other person he had knowledge of  in mr potts treatise on ruptures second edition sec   page    that gentleman says the cure of a rupture is either perfect called also radical or imperfect which is called palliative this distinction which he says is just and true and founded both on reason and experience has frequently been misunderstood by the generality of mankind and has therefore been the cause of much undeserving censure on the practitioners of surgery he adds the truth is that though the events are extremely different yet the chirurgical means which are made use of in either case are exactly the same viz the reduction of the protruded parts and retention of them when so reduced by proper bandages  i wish mr pott had given the address of his proper bandagemaker as dr smellie did of his proper midwifery instrumentmaker i could never find those bandages at the shoemakers nor at the rupturecurers who has his name distinguished in the court and city register for       convinced at least of their politeness in thus dignifying a man who has little pretension to public favor i had no doubt but that the compilers or compilers directors had complimented me with a similar appellation  but i was again mistaken i found in page     my desert would procure me barely the title of plain trussmaker  i wish some of those persons whom this rupturecurer has assisted would persuade me out of a notion that it is death which generally performs the cure for this worthy gentleman i am assured that those trusses said to be of his making are too painful even for a horse to wear he prides himself i am told on employing the same persons who did business for my predecessor  as a proof of the absurdity of building on anothers supposed reputation when i was appointed trussmaker to greenwich hospital i could not find one in twenty of the ruptured men in that place who could wear the trusses made by my predocessor and those who did wear them were so miserably fretted and galled on their hips and loins that they were obliged to attend the surgeon every morning to have their wounds dressed so that by my appointment i had the pleasure not only of relieving the diseased men from the misery they suffered by the iron trusses before made use of but prevented the surgeons from being troubled with the like complaints and saved the expenses of the house  being about twentyeight years since afflicted with a rupture i consented to become a patient to messrs woodward and hunt and from a strict attention to their method i am enabled to give the reader some idea of it the first object then with them was to examine the patient  with respect to his circumstances if he would part freely with his money they first applied a linen bandage and shortly after informed him that was not sufficient of itself to perform the cure and that they must call in the assistance of proper medicines with which they would furnish him at one guinea per month  and in this way did they cajole me out of fourteen guineas and my rupture was greatly worse at the years end than when first i became their patient  i am here induced to relate a story which cannot be contradicted and which will serve sufficiently to expose the fallacy of trifling and vain pretenders a gentleman of  0 years of age who has been afflicted many years with a rupture and who has worn a truss of my making for upwards of these five years which rendered his rupture though by no means curable of little trouble to him was very lately persuaded to apply to mr l a surgeon for a complete cure he accordingly waited on that gentleman to know if he would take his case in hand and what the expense would be mr l told him he had no doubt of effecting a cure even if he was eighty years old and as he was only a tradesman he believed he could do it for about  0 guineas but that the patient must wait on him every morning this the gentleman informed him was a thing he could not do and the surgeon therefore consented to call upon him  next morning mr l dressed in a suit of black velvet drove in his chariot to his patients the tradseman reflecting that this appearance of grandeur was not kept up at a small expense determined to make a sure bargain and accordingly told the surgeon  sir before we proceed to business let me know exactly what the expense of this cure will be and if no cure  no pay  at this the surgeon started like a guilty thing and turning on his heel whipped into his chariot and drove home  no doubt sufficiently mortified at the disappointment  i have only to remark that if every afflicted person would endeavor to make as certain a bargain as my patient intended to do with the abovementioned impudent assertor the velvet suits of such pettifoggers in genius would soon be rusty and their chariots without a wheel  i am acquainted with many persons of both sexes who have been patients to mr l and they all agree that the following is his method of operation first he applies a bandage as woodward and hunt used to do the patient must then attend on him once a day for so many times as he shall appoint and at these times he applies a brush dipped in something which he calls an astringent when he is tired of brushing he pronounces a complete cure which should the patient presume to doubt he is capable of behaving in the most insolent manner which he justifies by the affront offered to his knowledge  and should their spirit on the occasion equal his impudence which is barely possible he will even go so far as to threaten a prosecution for defamation to corroborate this fact it is well known that about seven years ago this same mr l obtained a verdict of eighty pounds from a surgeon of eminence and another of an hundred pounds from a gentleman in the same profession equally respectable for a pretended defamation and has since been at the point of being pilloried for his malpractices on his ruptured patients  i must here beg leave to introduce a passage from mr potts treatise on ruptures p     the histories of prior cabriere bowls sir thomas renton dr littlejohn etc etc to be found in dionis houston and other writers will furnish to the reader an idea of the practice and performances of some who have stood at the head of those bold promisers  this is a subject in which mankind are much interested and on which a good deal might be said but as an honest endeavor to save the afflicted from the hands of those who have no character to lose and whose only point is money might from one of the profession be misconstrued into malevolence and craft i will not enter into it but shall conclude by wishing that they who have capacity to judge of these matters which are as much the object of commonsense as any other kind of knowledge would not suffer themselves to be deluded by the impudent assertions of any charlatan whatever but determine in this as they do in many other things that is by the event  there is a sentence in sacred writ which naturally strikes me on the present occasion  out of thy own mouth will i condemn thee  let the reader join the above quotations and think for himself  i snall only say that i sincerely wish counselor brands surgeon of character would reflect on the very excellent opinion of mr pott before he receives his fee merely for approving what the shoemaker has done or preparing the way for what he is to do  with respect to myself without a vain pretense to a thorough knowledge of surgery it is my boast that a studious application long experience and above all a strict adherence to the principles of my readers i hope will not accuse me of ostentation when i remark that from the  th of november    0 to the   st of january      i have given away trusses to persons who were incapable of purchasing them to the amount of   l  s  attestations of the truth of which from the overseers etc of the different parishes to which they belong are ready to be produced to those who shall desire to see them a greater sum i believe than is dispensed to the poor afflicted with ruptures from all the hospitals except greenwich and chelsea in the same period of time humanity have fixed me in the midst of a most extensive practice that there are persons who bear me illwill i have no doubt but i have the consolation that in this case those who are my enemies are the enemies of society  i despise the reflections thrown out against me on account of my former professions such reflections are at once a proof of ill manners and ill principles the good and the sensible will acknowledge that it is as possible for a soldier to attain a knowledge of the true method of reducing ruptures and applying trusses as it was for friar jacques to discover the proper manner of cutting for the stone for a friar to instruct the world in the use of gunpowder or a soldier to invent the important and useful art of printing from a conviction that the pupils in the different hospitals in town seldom had an opportunity of seeing a rupture and from a desire to render a knowledge of its proper treatment more general i very lately gave them a public invitation to see me perform the operation of reducing ruptures and the retention of them when so reduced by applying trusses which is the only remedy at all ages and in all states of reducible ruptures at the same time i provided a number of cases some of which were acknowledged by mr hunter to be the most singular he remembered to have met with  however this good disposition in me could not escape censure  an undistinguishing haughtiness construed it an affront  and i was informed that if i persisted in that practice it would greatly offend the faculty to exculpate myself from a design to give offense i shall only refer to the feelings of every candid reader and say that i meant a service to the world in conclusion i shall subjoin a few cases and for the present take my leave  wishing those who condemn from ignorance more knowledge  those who asperse from malevolence more goodnature  cases on the  0th of january one of the inpensioners of greenwich hospital applied to me in the surgery of that place for a truss for a double rupture upon examining him i sound the rupture single only and in the right groin in the left groin the testicle lying in an oval figure across the orifice where a rupture generally descends and no appearance of the scrotum on the left side of the penis this most extraordinary situation was occasioned he informed me by a fall across the gunnel of a boat about twelve months ago when the truss was properly applied the bandage did not in the smallest degree compress the testicle opposite to the rupture and i have the satisfaction to say that there is now the greatest probability of a palliative cure being effected those who doubt the authenticity of this relation are entreated to refer to the cheque book which is kept in the surgery of the abovementioned hospital  on the  th of november last a poor man recommended by mr benjamin morris overseer of the poor of st luke middlesex came to me for assistance he said that about ten months before that time he felt something in his groin which was not then attended with any pain however it by degrees increased and increasing grew very painful and much larger and that very often it made him so sick that it would occasion him to throw up what he had eaten and was often incapable of working for his bread  for that when he was in an upright posture his rupture would sometimes fall down with that violence as to burst open the codpiece of his breeches i applied a truss and the last time i saw him which was the   th of january last he informed me that ever since i applied the truss to his rupture it had not fallen down once nor had he lost a days work any person who shall doubt this may be satisfied of the truth of the case by applying to mr morris abovementioned or at my house where they will be shown a letter of thanks from the patient himself whose desire it is the same may be publicly seen  thomas west a young man about twenty applied to me on the   th of december last for relief in the case of a rupture which he had had ever since he was fourteen years of age it was at the time mentioned increased to the size of eight inches circumference from the testicle above the os pubis i reduced it all and applied a truss thereon at the same time informing him in what manner he should proceed to obtain a perfect cure in about ten days he came to me again said he had been very punctual in the observation of my directions and that he was completely cured notwithstanding he had used all manner of common exercises he then pulled off his truss coughed and blowed his nose in a violent manner and said there was no occasion for wearing the truss any longer i asked him if wearing it gave him any pain he replied no and i ordered him not to leave it off for a few months  this extraordinary case will be authenticated by applying to mr west lighterman in king street deptford who is the patients brother  about two years and a half ago a lad of twelve years of age was brought to me by mr macguire perukemaker of hedgelane for the cure of a rupture when i examined him i found the rupture which was in the right groin prodigiously large with the testicle at the lower extremity of it the left testicle was confined in the abdomen and had been so ever since he could remember by the proper application of my elastic truss he obtained a radical cure in about nine months the right testicle at that time remaining in its proper and natural state in the scrotum i then told him he might lay the truss aside in a few months after mr macguire brought the boy to me again said his rupture was extremely bad and that he must have another truss  on examining him so far from having a rupture his right testicle had followed the rupture into the abdomen and with the left remains in that state to this day and what is still more remarkable there is not the smallest appearance of the scrotum although the penis remains in its natural state  finis
