the mans bewitched or the devil to do about her a comedy as it is acted at the newtheatre in the haymarket by her majestys servants  by susanna centlivre  london printed for bernard lintott between the two templegates in fleet street  to his grace william duke of devonshire lord steward of her majestys household lord in air north of trent lord lieutenant of the county of derby and one of her majestys most honorable privy council etc may it please your grace the muses were ever ambitious of being distinguished by shrouding themselves under the patronage of the greatest men in all ages not made so by titles or preferment but such whose innate principles of honor truly supported those their prince had crowned them with from hence sprung my presumption of laying the following scenes at your graces feet since the world must allow that all those virtues which complete a perfect good as well as great man are centered in the duke of devonshire the loyalest subject the tenderest husband and the kindest master that ever monarch wife or servant had briliant graces but such as do not shine in every man of quality from such patriots what may not britain hope nay what might not she command were all her sons as fervent for her interest and discharged their respective trusts with that fidelity and due regard to the public good as your grace has ever done in yours then the hated name of faction would be heard no more and the scandalous wounds of hotheaded parties healed which is the only way to secure this island from foreign insults and establish peace more firmly than armies though vast as xerxes led can do  to attempt your graces character is the superior business of a masculine pen and not to be reached by mine but since my husband has the honor to serve her majesty under the command of your grace as he did the late king of glorious memory under that of your noble father i could not be prevailed upon to alter my resolution of prefixing your graces name in the front of this poem at once to show my gratitude and my ambition and if when your graces minds unbended from the care and business of the state it finds the way in some leisure hour to divert your grace and the author meet your pardon for this liberty my wishes are all answered as i hope my prayers will be that your grace may enjoy a perfect health free from pain in mind and body and see as many flourishing happy new years as your best and dearest friends can desire and every one add fresh honors to those that are so deservedly worn by your grace at present which are the earnest wishes of  my lord your graces most obedient and most devoted humble servant susanna centlivre  the preface i should not have troubled my courteous reader with a preface had i not lain under the necessity of clearing my self of what some people have been pleased to charge me with viz of being the author of a paper called the female tattler consequently of a paragraph in that of the   th instant relating to this comedy though i think no reasonable person will believe i could be guilty of so much folly though vanity is said to be the darling vice of womankind yet nothing but an idiot would express themselves so openly and i hope the world will not think me guilty of printing what i must blush to read nor imagine it wrote even by any friend of mine for two reasons first the grossness of the flattery secondly the injury it must of course do me in the run of my play by putting those people out of humor whose action was to give life to the piece i suppose these reasons are sufficient to convince the judicious part that i was no ways concerned in those reflections but own i was treated with all the seeming civility in the world till the second night of my comedy i willingly submitted to mr cibbers superior judgment in shortning the scene of the ghost in the last act and believed him perfectly in the right because too much repetition is tiresome indeed when mr estcourt sliced most of it out i could not help interposing my desires to the contrary which the rest readily complied with and i had the satisfaction to see i was not deceived in my opinion of its pleasing this passage i happened to mention among my acquaintance for it is natural to have a kind of a tender for our own productions but especially if they have the good fortune to divert others now if from this the author of the tattler gathered his account i am guilty of speaking but not designedly for who they are that write that paper or how distinguished i am perfectly ignorant and declare i never was concerned either in writing or publishing any of the tattlers  i never had the vanity to think much less to publish that any thing i am capable of doing could support the stage though i have had the good fortune to please or to find the town willing to be pleased though at present it seems a certain author has entered a caveat against all plays running to a sixth night but his own though an opera interferd with this comedy yet it brought above forty pounds the second night which showed it had some merit for i have known many a play kept up that failed of half that money the second night now by the rules of the house it ought to have been played on but who can secure the life of a play when that of a man is often sacrificed to the malice of parties this play met with a kind reception in general and notwithstanding the disadvantages it had to struggle with by raising the prices the first day and the nearness of christmas it would have made its way to a sixth night if it had had fair play mistake me not i do not mean from the representation for i must do the players reason had i searched all the theaters in the world i could not have selected a better company nor had more justice done me in the action though they have not dealt honorably by me in my bargain for they ought not to have stopped the run upon any pique whatever it is small encouragment to write for the stage when the actors according to the caprice of their humors mangre the taste of the town have power to sink the reputation of a play for if they resolve not to act it the town cannot support it  well if there is any merit in suffering wrongfully i shall find my account in it one time or other in the mean while i entreat the female tattler to be witty no more at my expense i desire i may not be ranked in the number of those that support the stage since the stage is become a noun substantive and resolves to show it is able to stand by itself  prologue by a gentleman spoken by mr wilks our female author trembling stands within her fear arises from anothers sin one of her sex has so abused the town that on her score she dreads your angry frown though i dare say poor soul she never writ lampoon or satyr on the box or pit a harmless humrous play is her extent of wit though bickerstaffs vast genius may engage and lash the vice and follies of the age why should tender delia tax the nation stickle and make a noise for reformation who always gave a loose her self to inclination scandal and satyrs thrown aside to day and humor the sole business of our play beaux may dress on to catch the ladies hearts and good assurance pass for mighty parts the citts may bring their spouses without fear we show no wife that is poaching for an heir nor teach the use of fine gause handkercheir cowards may huff and talk of mighty wonders and jilts set up  for twenty thousand pounders our author even though she knows full well is so goodnatured she forbears to tell what colonels lately have found out the knack to muster madam still by ned or jack to keep their pleasures up a frugal way they give her  subalterns subsistence for her pay in short what ever your darling vices are they pass untouched in this nights bill of fare but if all this cannot your good nature wake though here and there a scene should fail to take yet spare her for the busiebodys sake epilogue spoken by mrs oldfield written by mr cibber a porter delivers a letter just as she is going to speak what is this a billetdeaux from hands unknown it is new to send it thus before all the town but since the poor mans passions so agog i will read it out by way of epilogue reads madam permit a wretch to let you know that he is no more in statu quo my ruin from this night commences unless your smiles refund my senses for with one thrust of cupids dart you have whipped your slave quite through the heart therefore i beg you cast your eye over boxes pit and gallery in pity of my pains and doubt and try if you can find me out  poor soul he seems indeed in dismal plight let us see it cannot be sure from the upper flight no no  that is plain  for  none of them can write nor can i think it from the middle fell for i am afraid  as few of them can spell beside their haggling passions never gain beyond the passagewalking nymphs of drury lane and then the pits more stocked with rakes and rovers than any of these senseless whining lovers the backs of the boxes too seem mostly lined with souls whose passions to themselves confined i sort i cannot perceive amongst all you sparks the wretch distinguished by these bloody marks but since the town has heard your kind commands sir the town shall even be witness of my answer first then beware you prove no spark in red with empty purse and regimental head that thinks no woman can refuse tengage in it while loves advanced with offered bills on agent that swears he will settle from his joys commencing and make the babe the day he is born an ensign nor could i bear a titld beau that steals from fasting spouse her matrimonial meals that modish sends next morn to her apartment a civil howdeye  far alas from the heart meant then powdered for the ensuing days delights bows through his crowd of duns and drives to whites nor could i like the wretch that all night plays and only takes his rest on winning days that sets up from a lucky hit his rattler then is traced from his orignal  in the tattler to tell you all that are my fixed aversion would tire the tongue of malice or aspersion but if i find amongst all one generous heart that deaf to stories takes this stages part that thinks that purse deserves to keep the plays whose fortunes bound for the support of operas that thinks our constitution here is justly fixed and now no more with lawyers brawls perplexed he i declare shall my whole heart receive and what is more strange i will love him while i live drammatis personae men sir jeffry constant mr bowman father to captain constant captain
