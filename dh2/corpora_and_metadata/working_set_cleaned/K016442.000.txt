please which is more than most poets can say   player as we live by the muses it is but gratitude in us to encourage poetical merit wherever we find it the muses contrary to all other ladies pay no distinction to drels and never partially mistake the pertness of embroidery for wit nor the modesty of want for dullness be the author who he will we push his play as far as it will go so though you are in want i wish you success heartily   beggar this piece i own was originally writ for the celebrating the marriage of james chariter and moll lay two most excellent balladsingers i have introduced the similes that are in all your celebrated operas the swallow the moth the be the ship the flower etc besides i have a prison scene which the ladies reckon charmingly pathetick as to the parts i have observed such a nice impartiality to our two ladies that it is impossible for either of them to take offense i hope i may be forgiven that i have not made my opera throughout unnatural like those in vogue for i have no recitative excepting this as i have consented to have neither prologue nor epilogue it must be allowed an opera in all its forms the piece indeed has been heretofore frequently

money is gone one or other of the ladies will hang him for the reward and there is forty pound lost to us for ever   mrs peach you know my dear i never meddle in matters of death i always leave those affairs to you women indeed are bitter bad judges in these cases for they are so partial to the brave that they think every man handsome who is going to the camp or the gallows  air iii cold and raw etc if any wench venuss girdle wear though she be never so ugly lillies and roses will quickly appear and her face look wondrous smuggly beneath the left ear so fit but a cord a rope so charming a zone is the youth in his cart has the air of a lord and we cry there es an adonis   but really husband you should not be too hardhearted for you never had a finer braver set of men than at present we have not had a murder among them all these seven months and truly my dear that is a great blessing   peach what a dickens is the woman always a whimpring about murder for no gentleman is ever looked upon the worse for killing a man in his own defense and if business cannot be carried on without it what would you have a gentleman do   mrs peach if i am in the wrong my dear you must excuse me for nobody can help the frailty of an overscrupulous conscience   peach murder is as fashionable a crime as a man can be guilty of how many fine gentlemen have we in newgate every year purely upon that article if they have wherewithal to persuade the jury to bring it in manslaughter what are they the worse for it so my dear have done upon this subject was captain macheath here this morning for the banknotes he left with you last week   mrs peach yes my dear and though the bank has stopped payment he was so cheerful and so agreeable sure there is not a finer gentleman upon the road than the captain if he comes from bagshot at any reasonable hour he has promised to make one this  and me and bob booty at a party of quadrille pray my dear is the captain rich   peach the captain keeps too good company ever to grow rich marybone and the chocolatehouses are his undoing the man that proposes to get money by play should have the education of a fine gentleman and be trained up to it from his youth   mrs peach really i am sorry upon pollys account the captain in has not more discretion what business has he to keep company with lords and gentlemen he should leave them to prey upon one another   peach upon pollys account what a plague does the woman mean  upon pollys account   mrs peach captain macheath is very fond of the girl   peach and what then   mrs peach if i have any skill in the ways of women i am sure polly thinks him a very pretty man   peach and what then you would not be so mad to have the wench marry him gamesters and highway men are generally very good to their whores but they are very devils to their wives   mrs peach but if polly should be in love how should we help her or how can she help herself poor girl i am in the utmost concern about her  air iv why is your faithful slave disdained etc if love the virgins heart invade how like a moth the simple maid still plays about the flame if soon she be not made a wife her honors signed and then for life she is  what i dare not name    peach look ye wife a handsome wench in our way of business is as profitable as the bar of a temple coffeehouse who looks upon it as her livelihood to grant every liberty but one you see i would indulge the girl as far as prudently we can in any thing but marriage after that my dear how shall we be safe are we not then in her husbands power for a husband has the absolute power over alla wifes secrets but her own if the girl had the discretion of a court lady who can have a dozen young fellows at her ear without complying with one i should not matter it but polly is tinder and a spark will at once set her on a flame married if the wench does not know her own profit sure she knows her own pleasure better than to make herself a property my daughter to me should be like a court lady to a minister of state a key to the whole gang married if the affair is not already done i will terrify her from it by the example of our neighbors   mrs peach mayhap my dear you may injure the girl she loves to imitate the fine ladies and she may only allow the captain liberties in the view of interest   peach but it is your duty my dear to warn the girl against her ruin and to instruct her how to make the most of her beauty i will go to her this moment and sift her in the mean time wife rip out the coronets and marks of these dozen of cambric handkerchiefs for i can dispose of them this afternoon to a chap in the city   scene v mrs peachum never was a man more out of the way in an argument than my husband why must our polly forsooth differ from her sex and love only her husband and why must pollys marriage contrary to all observation make her the less followed by other men all men are thieves in love and like a woman the better for being anothers property  air v of all the simple things we do etc a maid is like the golden oar which has guineas intrinsical in it whose worth is never known before it is tried and impressed in the mint a wifes like a guinea in gold stamped with the name of her spouse now here now there is bought or is sold and is current in every house    scene vi mrs peachum filch mrs peach come hither filch i am as fond of this child as though my mind misgive me he were my own he has as fine a hand at picking a pocket as a woman and is as nimblefingerd as a juggler if any unlucky session does not cut the rope of thy life i pronounce boy thou will be a great man in history where was your post last night my boy   filch i played at the opera madam and considering twas neither dark nor rainy so that there was no great hurry in getting chairs and coaches made a tolerable hand on it there seven handkerchiets madam   mrs peach colored ones i see they are of sure  from our warehouse at redriff among the seamen   filch and this snuff box   mrs peach set in gold a pretty encouragement this to a young beginner   filch i had a rare tug at a charming gold watch pox take the tailors for making the fobs so deep and narrow it stuck by the way and i was forced to make my escape under a coach really madam i fear i shall be cut off in the flower of my youth so that every now and then since i was pumpt i have thoughts of taking up and going to sea   mrs peach you should go to hockley in the hole and to marybone child to learn valor these are the schools that have bred so many brave men i thought boy by this time thou had lost fear as well as shame poor lad how little does he know as yet of the oldbarly for the first fact i will insure thee from being hanged and going to sea filch  come time enough upon a sentence of transportation but now since you have nothing better to do even go to your book and learn your catechism for really a man makes but an ill figure in the ordinarys paper who cannot give a satisfactory answer to his questions but hark you my lad dont tell me a lie for you know i hate a liar do you know of any thing that has past between captain macheath and our polly   filch i beg you madam dont ask me for i must either tell a lie to you or to miss polly for i promised her i would not tell   mrs peach but when the honor of our family is concerned    filch i shall lead a sad life with miss polly if ever she come to know that i told you besides i would not willingly forefeit my own honor by betraying any body   mrs peach yonder comes my husband and polly come filch you shall go with me into my own room and tell me the whole story i will give thee a most delicious glass of cordial that i keep for my own drinking   scene vii peachum polly polly i know as well as any of the fine ladies how to make the most of my self and of my man too a woman knows how to be mercenary though she has never been in a court or at an assembly we have it in our natures papa if i allow captain macheath some trifling liberties i have this watch and other visible marks of his favor to show for it a girl who cannot grant some things and refuse what is most material will make but a poor hand of her beauty and soon be thrown upon the common  air vi what shall i do to show how much i love her etc virgins are like the fair flower in its luster which in the garden enamels the ground near it the bees in play flutter and cluster and gaudy butterflies frolic around but when once plucked it is no longer alluring to covent garden it is sent as yet sweet there fades and shrinks and grows past all enduring rots stinks and dies and is trod under feet    peach you know polly i am not against your toying and trifling with a customer in the way of business or to get out a secret or so but if i found out that you have played the fool and are married you jade you i will cut your throat hussy now you know my mind   scene viii peachum polly mrs peachum air vii oh london is a fine town mrs peachum in a very great passion our polly is a sad slut nor heeds what we taught her i wonder any man alive will ever rear a daughter for she must have both hoods and gowns and hoops to swell her pride with scarfs and stays and gloves and lace and she will have men beside and when she is dressed with care and cost alltempting fine and gay as men should serve a cowcumber she flings herself away our polly is a sad slut etc   you baggage you hussy you inconsiderate jade had you been hanged it would not have vexed me for that might have been your misfortune but to do such a mad thing by choice the wench is married husband   peach married the captain is a bold man and will risque any thing for money to be sure he believes her a fortune do you think your mother and i should have lived comfortably so long together if ever we had been married baggage   mrs peach i knew she was always a proud slut and now the wench has played the fool and married because forsooth she would do like the gentry can you support the expense of a husband hussy in gaming drinking and whoring have you money enough to carry on the daily quarrels of man and wife about who shall squander most there are not many husbands and wives who can bear the charges of plaguing one another in a handsome way if you must be married could you introduce nobody into our family but a highwayman why thou foolish jade thou will be as illusd and as much neglected as if thou had married a lord   peach let not your anger my dear break through the rules of decency for the captain looks upon himself in the military capacity as a gentleman by his profession besides what he has already i know he is in a fair way of getting or of dying and both these ways let me tell you are most excellent chances for a wife tell me hussy are you ruined or no   mrs peach with pollys fortune she might very well have gone off to a person of distinction yes that you might you pouting slut   peach what is the wench dumb speak or i will make you plead by squeezing out an answer from you are you really bound wife to him or are you only upon liking pinches her   polly oh screaming   mrs peach how the mother is to be pitied who has handsome daughters locks bolts bars and lectures of morality are nothing to them they break through them all they have as much pleasure in cheating a father and mother as in cheating at cards   peach why polly i shall soon know if you are married by macheaths keeping from our house   air viii grim king of the ghosts etc polly can love be controlled by advice will cupid our mothers obey though my heart were were as frozen as ice at his flame twould have melted away when he kissed me so closely he pressed twas so sweet that i must have complied so i thought it both safest and best to marry for fear you should chide     mrs peach then all the hopes of our family are gone for ever and ever   peach and macheath may hang his father and motherinlaw in hope to get into their daughters fortune   polly i did not marry him as it is the fashion cooly and deliberately for honor or money but i love him   mrs peach love him worse and worse i thought the girl had been better bred oh husband husband her folly makes me mad my head swims i am distracted i cannot support myself  oh faints   peach lee wench to what a condition you have reduced your poor mother a glass of cordial this instant how the poor woman takes it to heart   polly goes out and returns with it ah hussy now this the only comfort your mother has left   polly give her another glass sir my mama drinks double the quantity whenever she is out of order this you see fetches her   mrs peach the girl shows such a readiness and so much concern that i could almost find in my heart to forgive her  air ix o jenny o jenny where have thou been o polly you might have toyd and kissed by keeping man off you keep them on polly but he so teased me and he so pleased me what i did you must have done     mrs peach not with a highwayman  you sorry slut   peach a word with you wife it is no new thing for a wench to take man without consent of parents you know it is the frailty of woman my dear   mrs peach yes indeed the sex is frail but the first time a woman is frail she should be somewhat nice methinks for then or never is the time to make her fortune after that she has nothing to do but to guard herself from being found out and she may do what she pleases   peach make your self a little easy i have a thought shall soon set all matters again to rights why so melancholy polly since what is done cannot be undone we must all endeavor to make the best of it   mrs peach well polly as far as one woman can forgive another i forgive thee  your father is too fond of you hussy   polly then all my sorrows are at an end   mrs peach a mighty likely speech in troth for a wench who is just married   air x thomas i cannot etc polly i like a ship in storms was tossed yet afraid to put in to land for seized in the port the vessels lost whose treasure is counterband the waves are laid my dutys paid o joy beyond expression thus safe ashore i ask no more my allis in my possession     peach i hear customers in aother room go talk with em polly but come to us again as soon as they are gone  but hark ye child if it is the gentleman who was here yesterday about the repeatingwatch say you believe we cannot get intelligence of it till tomorrow for i lent it to suly straddlo to make a figure with it tonight at a tavern in drury lane if the other gentleman calls for the silverhilted sword you know beetlebrowd jemmy has it on and he does not come from tunbridge till tuesday night so that it cannot be had till then   scene ix peachum mrs peachum peach dear wife be a little pacified dont let your passion run away with your senses polly i grant you has done a rash thing   mrs peach if she had had only an intrigue with the fellow why the very best families have excused and huddled up a frailty of that sort it is marriage husband that makes it a blemish   peach but money wife is the true fullers earth for reputations there is not a spot or a stain but what it can take out a rich rogue nowadays is fit company for any gentleman and the world my dear has not such a contempt for roguery as you imagine i tell you wife i can make this match turn to our advantage   mrs peach i am very sensible husband that captain macheath is worth money but i am in doubt whether he has not two or three wives already and then if he should dye in a session or two pollys dower would come into dispute   peach that indeed is a point which ought to be considered  air xi a soldier and a sailor a fox may steal your hens sir a whore your health and pence sir your daughter rob your chest sir your wife may steal your rest sir a thief your goods and plate but this is all but picking with rest pence chest and chicken it ever was decreed sir if lawyers hand is feed sir he steals your whole estate   the lawyers are bitter

polly like other women sir upon the industry of my husband   mrs peach what is the wench turned fool a highwaymans wife like a soldiers has as little of his pay as of his company   peach and had not you the common views of a gentlewoman in your marriage polly   polly i dont know what you mean sir   peach of a jointure and of being a widow   polly but i love him sir how then could i have thoughts of parting with him   peach parting with him why that is the whole scheme and intention of all marriage articles the comfortable estate of widowhood is the only hope that keeps up a wifes spirits where is the woman who would scruple to be a wife if she had it in her power to be a widow whenever she pleased if you have any views of this sort polly i shall think the match not so very unseasonable   polly how i dread to hear your advice yet i must beg you to explain yourself   peach secure what he has got have him peachd the next sessions and then at once you are made a rich widow   polly what murder the man i love the blood runs cold at my heart with the very thought of it   peach fie polly what has murder to do in the affair since the thing sooner or later must happen i dare say the captain himself would like that we should get the reward for his death sooner than a stranger why polly the captain knows that as it is his employment to rob so it is ours to take robbers every man in his business so that there is no malice in the case   mrs peach ay husband now you have nicked the matter to have him peachd is the only thing could ever make me forgive her   air xii now ponder well ye parents dear polly oh ponder well be not severe so save a wretched wife for on the rope that hangs my dear depends poor pollys life     mrs peach but your duty to your parents hussy

the sake of intelligence we must take other measures and have him peachd the next session without her consent if she will not know her duty we know ours   peach but really my dear it grieves ones heart to take off a great man when i consider his personal bravery his fine stratagem how much we have already got by him and how much more we may get methinks i cannot find in my heart to have a hand in his death i wish you could have made polly undertake it   mrs peach but in a case of necessity  our own lives are in danger   peach then indeed we must comply with the customs of the world and make gratitude give way to interest  he shall be taken off   mrs peach i will undertake to manage polly   peach and i will prepare matters for the oldbailv   scene xii polly now i am a wretch indeed

with such ill company and herd with gamesters   matt see the partiality of mankind  one man may steal a horse better than another look over a hedge  of all mechanics of all servile handycraftsmen a gamester is the vilest but yet as many of the quality are of the profession he is admitted amongst the politest company i wonder we are not more respected   mac there will be deep play tonight at

brocade  that i see is disposed of   peach to mrs diana trapes the tallywoman and she will make a good hand on it in shoes and slippers to trick out young ladies upon their going into keeping    lock but i dont see any article of the jewels   peach these are so well known that they must be sent abroad  you will find them entered under the article of exportation  as for the snuffboxes watches swords etc  i thought it best to enter them under their several heads   lock seven and twenty womens pockets complete with the several things therein contained all sealed numbered and entered   peach but brother it is impossible for us now to enter upon this affair  we should have the whole day before us  besides the account of the last half years plate is in a book by it self which lies at the

macheath in a day or two shall be our own again  air v down in the north country etc lock what gudgeans are we men every womans easy prey though we have felt the hook again we bite and they betray the bird that has been trapt when he hears his calling mate to her he flies again he is clapped within the wiry grate     peach but what signifies catching the bird if your daughter lucy will set open the door of the cage   lock if men were answerable for the follies and frailties of their wives and daughters no friends could keep a good correspondence together for two days  this is unkind of you brother for among good friends what they say or do goes for nothing   enter a servant serve sir here is mrs diana trapes wants to speak with you   peach shall we admit her brother lockit   lock by all

long acquainted with the flavor of those lips  have not i mrs dye   trapes fill it up  i take as large draughts of liquor as i did of love  i hate a flincher in either  air vi a shepherd kept sheep etc in the days of my youth i could bill like a dove fa la la etc like a sparrow at all times was ready for love fa la la etc the life of all mortals in kissing should pass lip to lip while we are

chap  for all my ladies are very fond of mourning   peach why look ye mrs dye  you deal so hard with us that we can afford to give the gentlemen who venture their lives for the goods little or nothing   trapes the hard times oblige me to go very near in my dealing  to be sure of late years i have been a great sufferer by the parliament  three thousand pounds would hardly make me amends  the act for destroying the mint was a severe cut upon our business  till then if a customer stepped out of the way  we knew where to have her  no doubt you know mrs coaxer  there is a wench now till today with a good suit of clothes of mine upon her back and i could never set eyes upon her for three months together  since the act too against imprisonment for small sums my loss there too has been very considerable and it must be so when a lady can borrow a handsome petticoat or a clean gown and i not have the least hank upon her and of my conscience nowadays most ladies take a delight in cheating when they can do it with safety   peach madam you had a handsome gold watch of us the other day for seven guineas  considering we must have our profit  to a gentleman upon the road a gold watch will be scarce worth the taking   trap consider mr peachum that watch was remarkable and not of very safe sale  if you have any black velvet scarfs  they are a handsome winterwear and take with most gentlemen who deal with my customers  it is i that put the ladies upon a good foot it is not youth or beauty that fixes their price the gentlemen always pay according to their dress from half a crown to two guineas and yet those hussies make nothing of bilking of me  then too allowing for accidents  i have eleven fine customers now down under the surgeons hands  what with fees and other expenses there are great goingsout and no comingsin and not a farthing to pay for at least a months clothing  we run great risques  great risques indeed   peach as i remember you said something just now of mrs coaxer   trap yes sir  to be sure i stripped her of a suit of my own clothes about two hours ago and have left her as she should be in her shift with a lover of hers at my house she called him up stairs as he was going to marybone in a hackney coach  and i hope for her own sake and mine she will persuade the captain to redeem her for the captain is very generous to the ladies   lock what captain   trap he thought i did not know him  an intimate acquaintance of yours mr peachum  only captain macheath  as fine as a lord   peach tomorrow dear mrs dye you shall set your own price upon any of the goods you like  we have at least half a dozen velvet scarfs and all at your service will you give me leave to make you a present of this suit of nightcloaths for your own wearing  but are you sure it is captain macheath   trap though he thinks i have forgot him no body knows him better i have taken a great deal of the captains money in my time at a secondhand for he always loved to have his ladies well dressed   peach mr lockit and i have a little business with the captain  you understand me  and we will satisfy you for mrs coaxers debt   lock depend upon it  we will deal like men of honor   trap i dont enquire after your affairs  so whatever happens i wash my hands on it  it has always been my maxim that one friend should assist another  but if you please  i will take one of the scarfs home with me it is always good to save something in hand   scene vii newgate lucy jealousy rage love and fear are at once tearing me to pieces how i am weatherbeaten and shattered with

you cannot think me so happy as to be the object of your jealousy  a man is always afraid of a woman who loves him too well  so that i must expect to be neglected and avoided   lucy then our cases my

so very whimsical in both sexes that it is impossible to be lasting  but my heart is particular and contradicts my own observation   polly but really mistress lucy by his last behavior i think i ought

either hanged or transported   play why then friend this is a downright deep tragedy the catastrophe is manifestly wrong for an opera must end happily   beg your objection sir is very just and is easily removed for you must allow that in this kind of drama it is no matter how absurdly things are brought about  so  you rabble there  run and cry a reprieve  let the prisoner be brought back to his wives in triumph   play all this we must do to comply with the taste of the town   beg through the whole piece you may observe such a similitude of manner in high and low life that it is difficult to determine whether in the fashionable vices the fine gentlemen imitate the gentlemen of the road or the gentlemen of the road the fine gentlemen  had the play remained as i at first intended it
