transparent  it is very common in ponds and rivers the animal is blackish brown and has two red capillary horns this fish emits a fine scarlet humor if a grain of salt of any kind or a little pepper or ginger be put into the mouth of the shell it emits this fine scarlet humor all the year especially in april and september dr lister gives a full account of it he says this scarlet humor may be readily got and in great quantity if a large parcel of these shells be wrapped up in a cloth bag sprinkling over it a little salt then the scarlet liquor will ouze plentifully the coloring part of this humor immediately subsides if sprinkled with powdered alum and the rest of it remains like clear water the coloring part may be strained through a filtering paper but the elegance of its color is lost and it changes into a dull unpleasant rusty brown moreover if mired with vinegar spirit of wine deliquated vegetable salts or common salt dissolved this elegant scarlet color perishes in the same manner as when mixed with alum neither can this liquor be kept by itself pure and unmixed for in vain did the doctor strive to preserve it in narrow mouthed bottles or phials perfectly well closed and with oil or honey thrown over it thus this color is of so fugitive a nature that no acid or astringent has been found sufficient to preserve the elegance of its tint dr lister further recites some observations and experiments he made on this scarlet fluid to discover whether it was a humor of the body or to be got by laceration or incision as blood a saliva from the throat or stomach or a particular humor contained in certain vessels or parts but the nicety and difficulty of the experiments rendered it impossible for him to determine it preciely da costa page           the helix nana

quoted is so very indifferent and devoid of true character that were we not in possession of the specimen he represents it would be difficult to ascertain it in the general description he says the outside is a little uneven but not rugged nor of a leaved or flakey structure as the common oyster he adds that the ridges are longitudinal about the thickness of a thread very numerous irregular and run one into another but toward the bottom always furcate or divide this description is accurate but does not accord with the figure in which the longitudinal ridges appear of a flakey structure or like laminae and not numerous irregular threadlike striae as in the shell we have selected several characteristic specimens of this species in the annexed plate  this shell is thick strong and nearly opake it is usually about an inch in diameter the valves unequal the under one being very concave the upper one flattish within it is of a livid green and rather glossy the hinge broad deep somewhat

our thanks are due for the specimens figured in the annexed plate we have seen it since in the collection of william pilkington esquire whitehall who recently found it in the river near hungerford in

figure however of it occurs in gualteris index testacrum conchyliorum tab   fig c c but has been referred to by professor gmelin in his edition of the systema naturae of linnaeus for tellin cornea though it evidently differs from the latter in shape which linnaeus considers as one of the most certain criteria whereby species are to be distinguished gualtieri mentions the shells alluded to as musculus fluviatilis striatus subflavus pellucidus which is a vague and imperfect description and by no means sufficient to show in what respect it differs from t cornea the difference consists chiefly in the t rivalis being of a more oblique and subovated form and in having the hinge near one end t cornea is somewhat globose and in particular has the hinge and beaks placed in a more central manner  dr maton has generally found tellina rivalis on chalky parts of the bed of the river avon and in rivulets communicating with it near salisbury but has never seen it in any considerable abundance he conceives that if diligently sought after it may be discovered in most rivers and streams which are inhabited by tellina cornea   plate lxv helix zonaria striped snail generic character

result of his remarks appear at least satisfactory to us  these smaller ones says da costa are the young shells but always with them are found old ones of double or treble the size in every other

border round the mouth greatly turned outward very broad flat thick milk white and the sinuosities jags or teeth within are large white and very conspicuous some are bidentated and most of these old ones have eleven and some even twelve spires  from these circumstances authors run into confusion by making the different growths different species the accurate and judicious lister himself has formed
