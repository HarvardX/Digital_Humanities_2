russel street covent garden mdcclxvi  advertisement hogarths marriagealamode has before furnished materials to the author of a novel published some years ago under the title of the marriageact but as that writer persued a very different story and as his work was chiefly designed for a political satire very little use could be made of it for the service of this comedy  in justice to the person who has been considered as the sole author the party who has hitherto lain concealed thinks it incumbent on him to declare that the disclosure of his name was by his own desire reserved till the publication of the piece  both the authors however who have before been separately honored with the indulgence of the public now beg leave to make their joint acknowledgements for the very favorable reception of the clandestine marriage  prologue written by mr garrick spoken by mr holland poets and painters who from nature draw their best and richest stores have made this law that each should neighbourly assist his brother and steal with decency from one another tonight your matchless hogarth gives the thought which from his canvas to the stage is brought and who so fit to warm the poets mind as he who pictured morals and mankind but not the same their characters and scenes both labor for one end by different means each as it suits him takes a separate road their one great object marriagealamode where titles deign with cits to have and hold and change rich blood for more substantial gold and honored trade from interest turns aside to hazard happiness for titled pride the painter dead yet still he charms the eye while england lives his fame can never die but he who struts his hour upon the stage can scarce extend his fame for half an age nor pen nor pencil can the

next to one another at dinner and your long walks together in the evening  for my part if i had not been in the secret i should have known you were a pair of loviers at least if not man and wife as    fanny see there now again pray be careful   betty well  well  nobody hears me  man and wife  i will say so no more  what i tell you is very true for all that    lovewell calling within william   betty

however if you choose it it is nothing at all to me  as you sow you must reap  as you brew so you must bake  i will even slip down the backstairs and leave you together exit   fanny alone i see i see i shall never have a moments ease till our marriage is made public new distresses crowd in upon me every day the solicitude of my mind sinks my spirits preys upon my health and destroys every comfort of my life it shall be revealed let what will be the consequence   enter lovewell lovew my love  how is this  in tears  indeed this is too much you promised me to support your spirits and to wait the determination of our fortune with patience  for my sake for your own be comforted why will you study to add to our uneasiness and perplexity   fanny oh mr lovewell the indelicacy of a secret marriage grows every day more and more shocking to me i walk about the house like a guilty wretch i imagine myself the object of the suspicion of the whole family and am under the perpetual terrors of a shameful detection   lovew indeed indeed you are to blame the amiable delicacy of your temper and your quick sensibility only serve to make you unhappy  to clear up this affair properly to mr sterling is the continual employment of my thoughts every thing now is in a fair train it begins to grow ripe for a discovery and i have no doubt of its concluding to the satisfaction of ourselves of your father and the whole family   fanny end how it will i am resolved it shall end soon  very soon  i would not live another week in this agony of mind to be mistress of the universe   lovew do not be too violent neither do not let us disturb the joy of your sisters marriage with the tumult this matter may occasion  i have brought letters from lord ogleby and sir john melvil to mr sterling  they will be here this evening  and i dare say within this hour   fanny i am sorry for it   lovew why so   fanny no matter  only let us disclose our marriage immediately   lovew as soon as possible   fanny but directly   lovew in a few days you may depend on it   fanny tonight  or tomorrow morning   lovew that i fear will be impracticable   fanny nay but you must   lovew must why   fanny indeed you must  i have the most alarming reasons for it   lovew alarming indeed for they alarm me even before i am acquainted with them  what are they   fanny i cannot tell you   lovew not tell me   fanny not at present when all is settled you shall be acquainted with every thing   lovew sorry they are coming  must be discovered  what can this mean  is it possible you can have any reasons that need be concealed from me   fanny do not disturb yourself with conjectures  but rest assured that though you are unable to divine the cause the consequence of a discovery be it what it will cannot be attended with half the miseries of the present interval   lovew you put me upon the rack  i would do any thing to make you easy  but you know your fathers temper  money you will excuse my frankness is the spring of all his actions which nothing but the idea of acquiring nobility or magnificence can ever make him forego  and these he thinks his money will purchase  you know too your aunts mrs heidelbergs notions of the splendour of high life her contempt for every thing that does not relish of what she calls quality and that from the vast fortune in her hands by her late husband she absolutely governs mr sterling and the whole family now if they should come to the knowledge of this affair too abruptly they might perhaps be incensed beyond all hopes of reconciliation   fanny but if they are made acquainted with it otherwise than by ourselves it will be ten times worse and a discovery grows every day more probable the whole family have long suspected our affection we are also in the power of a foolish maidservant and if we may even depend on her fidelity we cannot answer for her discretion  discover it therefore immediately lest some accident should bring it to light and involve us in additional disgrace   lovew well  well  i meant to discover it soon but would not do it too precipitately  i have more than once sounded mr sterling about it and will attempt him more seriously the next opportunity but my principal hopes are these  my relationship to lord ogleby and his having placed me with your father have been you know the first links in the chain of this connection between the two families in consequence of which i am at present in high favor with all parties while they all remain thus wellaffected to me i propose to lay our case before the old lord and if i can prevail on him to mediate in this affair i make no doubt but he will be able to appease your father and being a lord and a man of quality i am sure he may bring mrs heidelberg into good humor at any time  let me beg you therefore to have but a little patience as you see we are upon the very eve of a discovery that must probably be to our advantage   fanny manage it your own way i am persuaded   lovew but in the mean time make yourself easy   fanny as easy as i can i will  we had better not remain together any longer at present  think of this business and let me know how you proceed   lovew depend on my care but pray be cheerful   fanny i will   as she is going out enter sterling sterling heyday who have we got here   fanny confused mr lovewell sir   sterling and where are you going hussy   fanny to my sisters chamber sir exit   sterling ah lovewell what always getting my foolish girl yonder into a corner  well  well  let us but once see her elder sister fastmarried to sir john melvil well soon provide a good husband for fanny i warrant you   lovew would to heaven sir you would provide her one of my recommendation   sterling yourself eh lovewell   lovew with your pleasure sir   sterling mighty well   lovew and i flatter myself that such a proposal would not be very disagreeable to miss fanny   sterling better and better   lovew and if i could but obtain your consent sir    sterling what you marry fanny  no  no  that will never do lovewell  youre a good boy to be sure  i have a great value for you  but cannot think of you for a soninlaw  there is no stuff in the case no money lovewell   lovew my pretensions to fortune indeed are but moderate but though not equal to splendour sufficient to keep us above distress  add to which that i hope by diligence to increase it  and have love honor    sterling but not the stuff lovewell  add one little round o to the sum total of your fortune and that will be the finest thing you can say to me  you know i have a regard for you  would do any thing to serve you  any thing on the footing of friendship  but    lovew if you think me worthy of your friendship sir be assured that there is no instance in which i should rate your friendship so highly   sterling psha psha that is another thing you know  where money or interest is concerned friendship is quite out of the question   lovew but where the happiness of a daughter is at stake you would not scruple sure to sacrifice a little to her inclinations   sterling inclinations why you would not persuade me that the girl is in love with you  eh lovewell   lovew i cannot absolutely answer for miss fanny sir but am sure that the chief happiness or misery of my life depends entirely upon her   sterling why indeed now if your kinsman lord ogleby would come down handsomely for you  but that is impossible  no no  twill never do  i must hear no more of this  come lovewell promise me that i shall hear no more of this   lovew hesitating i am afraid sir i should not be able to keep my word with you if i did promise you   sterling why you would not offer to marry her without my consent would you lovewell   lovew marry her sir confused   sterling ay marry her sir  i know very well that a warm speech or two from such a dangerous young spark as you are will go much farther toward persuading a silly girl to do what she has more than a months mind to do than twenty grave lectures from fathers or mothers or uncles or aunts to prevent her  but you would not sure be such a base fellow such a treacherous young rogue as to seduce my daughters affections and destroy the peace of my family in that manner  i must insist on it that you give me your word not to marry her without my consent   lovew sir  i  i  as to that  i  i  i beg sir  pray sir excuse me on this subject at present   sterling promise then that you will carry this matter no further without my approbation   lovew you may depend on it sir that it shall go no further   sterling well  well  that is enough  i will take care of the rest i warrant you  come come let us have done with this nonsense  what is doing in town  any news upon change   lovew nothing material   sterling have you seen the currants the soap and madeira safe in the warehouses have you compared the goods with the invoice and bills of lading and are they all right   lovew they are sir   sterling and how are stocks   lovew fell one and an half this morning   sterling well  well  some good news from america and they will be up again  but how are lord ogleby and sir john melvil when are we to expect them   lovew very soon sir i came on purpose to bring you their commands here are letters from both of them   sterling let me see  let me see  slife how his lordships letter is perfumed  it takes my breath away  opening it and french paper too with a fine border of flowers and flourishes  and a slippery gloss on it that dazzles ones eyes  my dear mr sterling  reading  mercy on me his lorship writes a worse hand than a boy at his exercise  but how is this  eh  with you tonight  reading  lawyers tomorrow morning  tonight  that is sudden indeed  where is my sister heidelberg she should know of this immediately  here john harry thomas calling the servants hark ye lovewell   lovew sir   sterling mind now how i will entertain his lordship and sir john  well show your fellows at the other end of the town how we live in the city  they shall eat gold  and drink gold  and lie in gold  here cook butler calling what signifies your birth and education and titles money money that is the stuff that makes the great man in this country   lovew very true sir   sterling true sir  why then have done with your nonsense of love and matrimony youre not rich enough to think of a wife yet a man of business should mind nothing but his business  where are these fellows john thomas calling  get an estate and a wife will follow of course  ah lovewell an english merchant is the most respectable character in the universe slife man a rich english merchant may make himself a match for the daughter of a nabob  where are all my rascals here william exit calling   lovewell alone so  as i suspected  quite averse to the match and likely to receive the news of it with great displeasure  what is best to be done  let me see  suppose i get sir john melvil to interest himself in this affair he may mention it to lord ogleby with a better grace than i can and more probably prevail on him to interfere in it i can open my mind also more freely to sir john he told me when i left him in town that he had something of consequence to communicate and that i could be of use to him i am glad of it for the confidence he reposes in me and the service i may do him will ensure me his good offices  poor fanny it hurts me to see her so uneasy and her making a mystery of the cause adds to my anxiety  something must be done upon her account for at all events her solicitude shall be removed exit   scene changes to another chamber enter miss sterling and miss fanny miss sterling oh my dear sister say no more this is downright hypocrisy  you shall never convince me that you dont envy me beyond measure  well after all it is extremely natural  it is impossible to be angry with you   fanny indeed sister you have no cause   miss sterling and you really pretend not to envy me   fanny not

lukewarm professions of esteem for me and the whole family i have heard of flames and darts but sir johns is a passion of mere ice and snow   mrs heidel oh fie my dear i am perfectly ashamed of you that is so like the notions of your poor sister what you complain of as coldness and indiffarence is nothing but the extreme gentilaty of his address an exact pictur of the manners of qualaty   miss

and goodbreeding  nobody knows the qualaty better than i do   miss sterling in my mind the old lord his uncle has ten times more gallantry about him than sir john he is full of attentions to the ladies and smiles and grins and leers and ogles and fills every wrinkle in his old wizen face with comical expressions of tenderness i think he would make an admirable sweetheart   enter sterling

thorough repair  this way if your lordship pleases   lord ogle going stops what steeples that we see yonder the parish church i suppose   sterling ha ha ha that is admirable it is no church at all my lord it is a spire that i have built against a tree a field or two off to terminate the prospect one must always have a church or an obelisk or a something to terminate the prospect you know that is a rule in taste my lord   lord ogle very ingenious indeed for my part i desire no finer prospect than this i see before me leering at the women  simple yet varied bounded yet extensive  get away canton pushing away canton i want no assistance  i will walk with the ladies   sterling this way my lord   lord ogle lead on sir  we young folks here will follow you  madam  miss sterling  miss fanny i

unbosom  i know you are faithful lovewell and flatter myself you would rejoice to serve me   lovew be assured you may depend on me   sir john you must know then notwithstanding all appearances that this treaty of marriage between miss sterling and me will come to nothing   lovew how   sir john it will be no match lovewell   lovew no match   sir john no   lovew you amaze me what should prevent it   sir john i   lovew you wherefore   sir john i dont like her   lovew very plain indeed i never supposed that you was extremely devoted to her from inclination but thought you always considered it as a matter of convenience rather than affection   sir john very true i came into the family without any impressions on my mind  with an unimpassioned indifference ready to receive one woman as soon as another i looked upon love serious sober love as a chimaera and marriage as a thing of course as you know most people do but i who was lately so great an infidel in love am now one of its sincerest votaries  in short my defection from miss sterling proceeds from the violence of my attachment to another   lovew another so so here will be fine work and pray who is she   sir john who is she who can she be but fanny the tender amiable engaging fanny   lovew fanny what fanny   sir john fanny sterling her sister  is not she an angel lovewell   lovew her sister confusion  you must not think of it sir john   sir john not think of it i can think of nothing else nay tell me lovewell was it possible for me to be indulged in a perpetual intercourse with two such objects as fanny and her sister and not find my heart led by insensible attraction toward her  you seem confounded  why dont you answer me   lovew indeed sir john this event gives me infinite concern   sir john why so  is not she an angel lovewell   lovew i foresee that it must produce the worst consequences consider the confusion it must unavoidably create let me persuade you to drop these thoughts in time   sir john never  never lovewell   lovew you have gone too far to recede a negotiation so nearly concluded cannot be broken off with any grace the lawyers you know are hourly expected the preliminaries almost finally settled between lord ogleby and mr sterling and miss sterling herself ready to receive you as a husband   sir john why the banns have been published and nobody has forbidden them it is true but you know either of the parties may change their minds even after they enter the church   lovew you think too lightly of this matter to carry your addresses so far  and then to desert her  and for her sister too  it will be such an affront to the family that they can never put up with it   sir john i dont think so for as to my transferring my passion from her to her sister so much the better  for then you know i dont carry my affections out of the family   lovew nay but prithee be serious and think better of it   sir john i have thought better of it already you see tell me honestly lovewell can you blame me is there any comparison between them   lovew as to that now  why that  that is just  just as it may strike different people there are many admirers of miss sterlings vivacity   sir john vivacity a medley of cheapside pertness and whitechapel pride  no  no  if i do go so far into the city for a weddingdinner it shall be upon turtle at least   lovew but i see no probability of success for granting that mr sterling would have consented to it at first he cannot listen to it now why did not you break this affair to the family before   sir john under such embarrassed circumstances as i have been can you wonder at my irresolution or perplexity nothing but despair the fear of losing my dear fanny could bring me to a declaration even now and yet i think i know mr sterling so well that strange as my proposal may appear if i can make it advantageous to him as a moneytransaction as i am sure i can he will certainly come into it   lovew but even suppose he should which i very much doubt i dont think fanny herself would listen to your addresses   sir john you are deceived a little in that particular   lovew you will find i am in the right   sir john i have some little reason to think otherwise   lovew you have not declared your passion to her already   sir john yes i have   lovew indeed  and  and  and how did she receive it   sir john i think it is not very easy for me to make my addresses to any woman without receiving some little encouragement   lovew encouragement did she give you any encouragement   sir john i dont know what you call encouragement  but she blushed  and cried  and desired me not to think of it any more  upon which i pressed her hand  kissed it  swore she was an angel  and i could see it tickled her to the soul   lovew and did she express no surprise at your declaration   sir john why faith to say the truth she was a little surprised  and she got away from me too before i could thoroughly explain myself if i should not meet with an opportunity of speaking to her i must get you to deliver a letter from me   lovew i  a letter  i had rather have nothing    sir john nay you promised me your assistance  and i am sure you cannot scruple to make yourself useful on such an occasion  you may without suspicion acquaint her verbally of my determined affection for her and that i am resolved to ask her fathers consent   lovew as to that i  your commands you know  that is if she  indeed sir john i think you are in the wrong   sir john well  well  that is my concern  ha there she goes by heaven along that walk yonder do you see i will go to her immediately   lovew you are too precipitate consider what you are doing   sir john i would not lose this opportunity for the universe   lovew nay pray dont go your violence and eagerness may overcome her spirits  the shock will be too much for her detaining him   sir john nothing shall prevent me  ha now she turns into another walk  let me go breaks from him i shall lose her  going turns back be sure now to keep out of the way if you interrupt us i shall never forgive you exit hastily   lovewell alone sdeath i cannot bear this in love with my wife acquaint me with his passion for her make his addresses before my face  i shall break out before my time  this was the meaning of fannys uneasiness she could not encourage him  i am sure she could not  ha they are turning into the walk and coming this way shall i leave the place  leave him to solicit my wife i cannot submit to it  they come nearer and nearer  if i stay it will look suspicious  it may betray us and incense him  they are here  i must go  i am the most unfortunate fellow in the world exit   enter fanny and sir john fanny leave me sir john i beseech you leave me  nay why will you persist to follow me with idle solicitations which are an affront to my character and an injury to your own honor   sir john i know your delicacy and tremble to offend it but let the urgency of the occasion be my excuse consider madam that the future happiness of my life depends on my present application to you consider that this day must determine my fate and these are perhaps the only moments left me to incline you to warrant my passion and to entreat you not to oppose the proposals i mean to open to your father   fanny for shame for shame sir john think of your previous engagements think of your own situation and think of mine  what have you discovered in my conduct that might encourage you to so bold a declaration i am shocked that you should venture to say so much and blush that i should even dare to give it a hearing  let me be gone   sir john nay stay madam but one moment  your sensibility is too great  engagements what engagements have even been pretended on either side than those of familyconvenience i went on in the trammels of matrimonial negotiation with a blind submission to your father and lord ogleby but my heart soon claimed a right to be consulted it has devoted itself to you and obliges me to plead earnestly for the same tender interest in yours   fanny have a care sir john do not mistake a depraved will for a virtuous inclination by these common pretenses of the heart half of our sex are made fools and a greater part of yours despise them for it   sir john affection you will allow is involuntary we cannot always direct it to the object on which it should fix  but when it is once inviolably attached inviolably as mine is to you it often creates reciprocal affection  when i last urged you on this subject you heard me with more temper and i hoped with some compassion   fanny you deceived yourself if i forbore to exert a proper spirit nay if i did not even express the quickest resentment of your behavior it was only in consideration of that respect i wish to pay you in honor to my sister and be assured sir woman as i am that my vanity could reap no pleasure from a triumph that must result from the blackest treachery to her going   sir john one word and i have done stopping her  your impatience and anxiety and the urgency of the occasion oblige me to be brief and explicit with you  i appeal therefore from your delicacy to your justice  your sister i verily believe neither entertains any real affection for me or tenderness for you  your father i am inclined to think is not much concerned by means of which of his daughters the families are united  now as they cannot shall not be connected otherwise than by my union with you why will you from a false delicacy oppose a measure so conducive to my happiness and i hope your own  i love you most passionately and sincerely love you  and hope to propose terms agreeable to mr sterling  if then you dont absolutely loath abhor and scorn me  if there is no other happier man    fanny hear me sir hear my final determination  were my father and sister as insensible as you are pleased to represent them  were my heart for ever to remain disengaged to any other  i could not listen to your proposals  what you on the very eve of a marriage with my sister i living under the same roof with her bound not only by the laws of friendship and hospitality but even the ties of blood to contribute to her happiness  and not to conspire against her peace  the peace of a whole family  and that my own too  away away sir john  at such a time and in such circumstances your addresses only inspire me with horror  nay you must detain me no longer  i will go   sir john do not leave me in absolute despair  give me a glimpse of hope falling on his knees   fanny i cannot pray sir john struggling to go   sir john shall this hand be given to another kissing her hand no  i cannot endure it  my whole soul is yours and the whole happiness of my life is in your power   enter miss sterling fanny ha my sister is here rise for shame sir john   sir john miss sterling rising   miss sterling i beg pardon sir  you will excuse me madam  i have broke in upon you a little unopportunely i believe  but i did

but    miss sterling oh dear sir john dont put yourself to the trouble of an apology the thing explains itself   sir john it will soon madam  in the mean time i can only assure you of my profound

sterling a further sum of seventy thousand    enter sir john melvil sterling ah sir john here we are  hard at it  paving the road to matrimony  first the lawyers then comes the doctor  let us but dispatch the longrobe we shall soon set puddingsleeves to work i warrant you   sir john i am sorry to interrupt you sir  but i hope that both you and these gentlemen will excuse me  having something very particular for your private ear i took the liberty of following you and beg you will oblige me with an audience immediately   sterling ay with all my heart  gentlemen mr sergeant you will excuse it  business must be done you know  the writings will keep cold till tomorrow morning   flower i must be at warwick mr sterling the day after   sterling nay nay i shall not part with you tonight gentlemen i promise you  my house is very full but i have beds for you all beds for your servants and stabling for all your horses  will you take a turn in the garden and view some of my improvements before dinner or will you amuse yourselves on the green with a game of bowls and a cool tankard  my servants shall attend you  do you choose any other refreshment  call for what you please  do as you please  make yourselves quite at home i beg of you  here  thomas harry william wait on these gentlemen  follows the lawyers out bawling and talking and then returns to sir john and now sir i am entirely at your service  what are your commands with me sir john   sir john after having carried the negotiation between our families to so great a length after having assented so readily to all your proposals as well as received so many instances of your cheerful compliance with the demands made on our part i am extremely concerned mr sterling to be the involuntary cause of any uneasiness   sterling uneasiness what uneasiness  where business is transacted as it ought to be and the parties understand one another there can be no uneasiness you agree on such and such conditions to receive my daughter for a wife on the same conditions i agree to receive you as a soninlaw and as to all the rest it follows of course you know as regularly as the payment of a bill after acceptance   sir john pardon me sir more uneasiness has arisen than you are aware of i am myself at this instant in a state of inexpressible embarrassment miss sterling i know is extremely disconcerted too and unless you will oblige me with the assistance of your friendship i foresee the speedy progress of discontent and animosity through the whole family   sterling what the deuce is all this i dont understand a single syllable   sir john in one word then  it will be absolutely impossible for me to fulfill my engagements in regard to miss sterling   sterling how sir john do you mean to put an affront upon my family what refuse to    sir john be assured sir that i neither mean to affront nor forsake your family  my only fear is that you should desert me for the whole happiness of my life depends on my being connected with your family by the nearest and tenderest ties in the world   sterling why did not you tell me but a moment ago that it was absolutely impossible for you to marry my daughter   sir john true  but you have another daughter sir    sterling well   sir john who has obtained the most absolute dominion over my heart i have already declared my passion to her nay miss sterling herself is also apprized of it and if you will but give a sanction to my present addresses the uncommon merit of miss sterling will no doubt recommend her to a person of equal if not superior rank to myself and our families may still be allied by my union with miss fanny   sterling mighty fine truly why what the plague do you make of us sir john do you come to market for my daughters like servants at a statutefair do you think that i will suffer you or any man in the world to come into my house like the grand signior and throw the handkerchief first to one and then to the other just as he pleases do you think i drive a kind of african slave trade with them and    sir john a moments patience sir nothing but the excess of my passion for miss fanny should have induced me to take any step that had the least appearance of disrespect to any part of your family and even now i am desirous to atone for my transgression by making the most adequate compensation that lies in my power   sterling compensation what compensation can you possibly make in such a case as this sir john   sir john come come mr sterling i know you to be a man of sense a man of business a man of the world i will deal frankly with you and you shall see that i do not desire a change of measures for my own gratification without endeavoring to make it advantageous to you   sterling what advantage can your inconstancy be to me sir john   sir john i will tell you sir  you know that by the articles at present subsisting between us on the day of my marriage with miss sterling you agree to pay down the gross sum of eighty thousand pounds   sterling well   sir john now if you will but consent to my waving that marriage    sterling i agree to your waving that marriage impossible sir john   sir john i hope not sir as on my part i will agree to wave my right to thirty thousand pounds of the fortune i was to receive with her   sterling thirty thousand do you say   sir john yes sir and accept of miss fanny with fifty thousand instead of fourscore   sterling fifty thousand  pausing   sir john instead of fourscore   sterling why  why  there may be something in that  let me see fanny with fifty thousand instead of betsey with fourscore  but how can this be sir john  for you know i am to pay this money into the hands of my lord ogleby who i believe  between you and me sir john  is not overstocked with ready money at present and threescore thousand of it you know is to go to pay off the present encumbrances on the estate sir john   sir john that objection is easily obviated  ten of the twenty thousand which would remain as a surplus of the fourscore after paying off the mortgage was intended by his lordship for my use that we might set off with some little eclat on our marriage and the other ten for his own  ten thousand pounds therefore i shall be able to pay you immediately and for the remaining twenty thousand you shall have a mortgage on that part of the estate which is to be made over to me with whatever security you shall require for the regular payment of the interest till the principal is duly discharged   sterling why  to do you justice sir john there is something fair and open in your proposal and since i find you do not mean to put an affront upon the family    sir john nothing was ever farther from my thoughts mr sterling  and after all the whole affair is nothing extraordinary  such things happen every day  and as the world has only heard generally of a treaty between the families when this marriage takes place nobody will be the wiser if we have but discretion enough to keep our own counsel   sterling true true and since you only transfer from one girl to the other it is no more than transferring so much stock you know   sir john the very thing   sterling odso i had quite forgot we are reckoning without our host here there is another difficulty    sir john you alarm me what can that be   sterling i cannot stir a step in this business without consulting my sister heidelberg  the family has very great expectations from her and we must not give her any offense   sir john but if you come into this measure surely she will be so kind as to consent    sterling i dont know that  betsey is her darling and i cannot tell how far she may resent any slight that seems to be offered to her favorite niece  however i will do the best i can for you  you shall go and break the matter to her first and by that time that i may suppose that your rhetoric has prevailed on her to listen to reason i will step in to reinforce your arguments   sir john i will fly to her immediately you promise me your assistance   sterling i do   sir john ten thousand thanks for it and now success attend me going   sterling harkee sir john   sir john returns sterling not a word of the thirty thousand to my sister sir john   sir john oh i am dumb i am dumb sir going   sterling you remember it is thirty thousand   sir john to be sure i do   sterling but sir john  one thing more sir john returns my lord must know nothing of this stroke of friendship between us   sir john not for the world  let me alone let me alone offering to go   sterling holding him  and when every thing is agreed we must give each other a bond to be held fast to the bargain   sir john to be sure a bond by all means a bond or whatever you please exit hastily   sterling alone i should have thought of more conditions  he is in a humor to give me every thing  why what mere children are your fellows of quality that cry for a plaything one minute and throw it by the next as changeable as the weather and as uncertain as the stocks  special fellows to drive a bargain and yet they are to take care of the interest of the nation truly  here does this whirligig man of fashion offer to give up thirty thousand pounds in hard money with as much indifference as if it was a china orange  by this mortgage i shall have a hold on his terrafirma and if he wants more money as he certainly will  let him have children by my daughter or no i shall have his whole estate in a net for the benefit of my family  well thus it is that the children of citizens who have acquired fortunes prove persons of fashion and thus it is that persons of fashion who have ruined their fortunes reduce the next generation to cits exit   scene changes to another apartment enter mrs heidelberg and miss sterling miss sterling this is your gentlelooking softspeaking sweetsmiling affable miss fanny for you   mrs heidel my miss fanny i disclaim her with all her arts she never could insinuat herself into my good graces  and yet she has a way with her that deceives man woman and child except you and me niece   miss sterling o ay she wants nothing but a crook in her hand and a lamb under her arm to be a perfect picture of innocence and simplicity   mrs heidel just as i was drawn at amsterdam when i went over to visit my husbands relations   miss sterling and then she is so mighty good to servants  pray john do this  pray tom do that  thank you jenny  and then so humble to her relations  to be sure papa  as my aunt pleases  my sister knows best  but with all her demureness and humility she has no objection to be lady melvil it seems nor to any wickedness that can make her so   mrs heidel she lady melville compose yourself niece i will ladyship her indeed  a little creepin cantin  she shall not be the better for a farden of my money but tell me child how does this intriguing with sir john correspond with her partiality to lovewell i dont see a concatunation here   miss sterling there i was deceived madam i took all their whisperings and stealing into corners to be the mere attraction of vulgar minds but behold their private meetings were not to contrive their own insipid happiness but to conspire against mine  but i know whence proceeds mr lovewells resentment to me i could not stoop to be familiar with my fathers clerk and so i have lost his interest   mrs heidel my spurrit to a t  my dear child kissing her  mr heidelberg lost his election for member of parliament because i would not demean myself to be slobbered about by drunken shoemakers beastly cheesemongers and greasy butchers and tallowchandlers however niece i cannot help diffuring a little in opinion from you in this matter my experunce and sagucity makes me still suspect that there is something more between her and that lovewell notwithstanding this affair of sir john  i had my eye upon them the whole time of breakfast  sir john i observed looked a little confounded indeed though i knew nothing of what had passed in the garden you seemed to sit upon thorns too but fanny and mr lovewell made quite anotherguess sort of a figur and were as perfet a pictur of two distressed lovers as if it had been drawn by raphael angelo  as to sir john and fanny i want a matter of fact   miss sterling matter of fact madam did not i come unexpectedly upon them was not sir john kneeling at her feet and kissing her hand did not he look all love and she all confusion is not that matter of fact and did not sir john the moment that papa was called out of the room to the lawyermen get up from breakfast and follow him immediately and i warrant you that by this time he has made proposals to him to marry my sister  oh that some other person an earl or a duke would make his addresses to me that i might be revenged on this monster   mrs heidel be cool child you shall be lady melvil in spite of all their caballins if it costs me ten thousand pounds to turn the scale sir john may apply to my brother indeed but i will make them all know who governs in this fammaly   miss sterling as i live madam yonder comes sir john a base man i cannot endure the sight of him i will leave the room this instant disordered   mrs heidel poor thing well retire to your own chamber child i will give it him i warrant you and by and by i will come and let you know all that has past between us   miss sterling pray do madam  looking back  a vile wretch exit in a rage   enter sir john melvil sir john your most obedient humble servant madam bowing very respectfully   mrs heidel your servant sir john dropping a halfcurtsy and pouting   sir john miss sterlings manner of quitting the room on my approach and the visible coolness of your behavior to me madam convince me that she has acquainted you with what past this morning   mrs heidel i am very sorry sir john to be made acquainted with any thing that should induce me to change the opinon which i could always wish to entertain of a person of quallaty pouting   sir john it has always been my ambition to merit the best opinion from mrs heidelberg and when she comes to weigh all circumstances i flatter myself    mrs heidel you do flatter yourself if you imagine that i can approve of your behavior to my niece sir john  and give me leave to tell you sir john that you have been drawn into an action much beneath you sir john and that i look upon every injury offered to miss betty sterling as an affront to myself sir john warmly   sir john i would not offend you for the world madam but when i am influenced by a partiality for another however illfounded i hope your discernment and good sense will think it rather a point of honor to renounce engagements which i could not fulfill so strictly as i ought and that you will excuse the change in my inclinations since the new object as well as the first has the honor of being your niece madam   mrs heidel i disclaim her as a niece sir john miss sterling disclaims her as a sister and the whole fammaly must disclaim her for her monstrus baseness and treachery   sir john indeed she has been guilty of none madam her hand and heart are i am sure entirely at the disposal of yourself and mr sterling  enter sterling behind and if you should not oppose my inclinations i am sure of mr sterlings consent madam   mrs heidel indeed   sir john quite certain madam   sterling behind so they seem to be coming to terms already i may venture to make my appearance   mrs heidel to marry fanny  sterling advances by degrees   sir john yes madam   mrs heidel my brother has given his consent you say   sir john in the most ample manner with no other restriction than the failure of your concurrence madam  sees sterling  oh here is mr sterling who will confirm what i have told you   mrs heidel what have you consented to give up your own daughter in this manner brother   sterling give her up no not give her up sister only in case that you  zounds i am afraid you have said too much sir john apart to sir john   mrs heidel yes yes i see now that it is true enough what my niece told me you are all plottin and caballin against her  pray does lord ogleby know of this affair   sir john i have not yet made him acquainted with it madam   mrs heidel no i warrant you i thought so  and so his lordship and myself truly are not to be consulted till the last   sterling what did not you consult my lord oh fie for shame sir john   sir john nay but mr sterling    mrs heidel we who are the persons of most consequence and experunce in the two fammalies are to know nothing of the matter till the whole is as good as concluded upon but his lordship i am sure will have more generosaty than to countenance such a perceeding  and i could not have expected such behavour from a person of your quallaty sir john  and as for you brother    sterling nay nay but hear me sister   mrs heidel i am perfetly ashamed of you  have you no spurrit no more concern for the honor of our fammaly than to consent    sterling consent  i consent  as i hope for mercy i never gave my consent did i consent sir john   sir john not absolutely without mrs heidelbergs concurrence but in case of her approbation    sterling ay i grant you if my sister approved  but that is quite another thing you know  to mrs heidelberg   mrs heidel your sister approve indeed  i thought you know her better brother sterling  what approve of having your eldest daughter returned upon your hands and exchanged for the younger  i am surprised how you could listen to such a scandalus proposal   sterling i tell you i never did listen to it  did not i say that i would be governed entirely by my sister sir john  and unless she agreed to your marrying fanny    mrs heidel i agree to his marrying fanny abominable the man is absolutely out of his senses  cannot that wise head of yours foresee the consequence of all this brother sterling will sir john take fanny without a fortune no  after you have settled the largest part of your property on your youngest daughter can there be an equal portion left for the eldest no  does not this overturn the whole systum of the fammaly yes yes yes you know i was always for my niece betseys marrying a person of the very first quallaty that was my maxum and therefore much the largest settlement was of course to be made upon her  as for fanny if she could with a fortune of twenty or thirty thousand pounds get a knight or a member of parliament or a rich commoncouncilman for a husband i thought it might do very well   sir john but if a better match should offer itself why should not it be accepted madam   mrs heidel what at the expense of her elder sister oh fie sir john  how could you bear to hear of such an indignaty brother sterling   sterling i nay i shall not hear of it i promise you  i cannot hear of it indeed sir john   mrs heidel but you have heard of it brother sterling you know you have and sent sir john to propose it to me but if you can give up your daughter i shall not forsake my niece i assure you ah if my poor dear mr heidelberg and our sweet babes had been alive he would not have behaved so   sterling did i sir john nay speak  bring me off or we are ruined apart to sir john   sir john why to be sure to speak the truth    mrs heidel to speak the truth i am ashamed of you both but have a care what you are about brother have a care i say the lawyers are in the house i hear and if every thing is not settled to my liking i will have nothing more to say to you if i live these hundred years  i will go over to holland and settle with mr vanderspracken my poor husbands first cousin and my own fammaly shall never be the better for a farden of my money i promise you exit   manent sir john and sterling sterling i thought so i knew she never would agree to it   sir john sdeath how unfortunate what can we do mr sterling   sterling nothing   sir john what must our agreement break off the moment it is made then   sterling it cannot be helped sir john the family as i told you before have great expectations from my sister and if this matter proceeds you hear yourself that she threatens to leave us  my brother heidelberg was a warm man a very warm man and died worth a plumb at least a plumb ay i warrant you he died worth a plumb and a half   sir john well but if i    sterling and then my sister has three or four very good mortgages a deal of money in the three percents and old south sea annuities besides large concerns in the dutch and french funds  the greatest part of all this she means to leave to our family   sir john i can only say sir    sterling why your offer of the difference of thirty thousand was very fair and handsome to be sure sir john   sir john nay but i am even willing to    sterling ay but if i was to accept it against her will i might lose above a hundred thousand so you see the balance is against you sir john   sir john but is there no way do you think of prevailing on mrs heidelberg to grant her consent   sterling i am afraid not  however when her passion is a little abated  for she is very passionate  you may try what can be done but you must not use my name any more sir john   sir john suppose i was to prevail on lord ogleby to apply to her do you think that would have any influence over her   sterling i think he would be more likely to persuade her to it than any other person in the family she has a great respect for lord ogleby she loves a lord   sir john i will apply to him this very day  and if he should prevail on mrs heidelberg i may depend on your friendship mr sterling   sterling ay ay i shall be glad to oblige you when it is in my power but as the account stands now you see it is not upon the figures and so your servant sir john exit   sir john melvil alone what a situation am i in  breaking off with her whom i was bound by treaty to marry rejected by the object of my affections and embroiled with this turbulent woman who governs the whole family  and yet opposition instead of smothering increases my inclination i must have her i will apply immediately to lord ogleby and if he can but bring over the aunt to our party her influence will overcome the scruples and delicacy of my dear fanny and i shall be the happiest of mankind exit   act iv scene i a room enter sterling mrs heidelberg and miss sterling sterling what will you send fanny to town sister   mrs heidel tomorrow morning i have given orders about it already   sterling indeed   mrs heidel positively   sterling but consider sister at such a time as this what an odd appearance it will have   mrs heidel not half so odd as her behavior brother  this time was intended for happiness and i will keep no incendaries here to destroy it i insist on her going off tomorrow morning   sterling i am afraid this is all your doing betsey   miss sterling no indeed papa my aunt knows that it is not  for all fannys baseness to me i am sure i would not do or say any thing to hurt her with you or my aunt for the world   mrs heidel hold your tongue betsey  i will have my way  when she is packed off every thing will go on as it should do  since they are at their intrigues i will let them see that we can act with vigur on our part and the sending her out of the way shall be the purlimunary step to all the rest of my perceedings   sterling well but sister    mrs heidel it does not signify talking brother sterling for i am resolved to be rid of her and i will  come along child to miss sterling  the postshay shall be at the door by six oclock in the morning and if miss fanny does not get into it why i will and so there is an end of the matter bounces out with miss sterling   mrs heidelberg returns mrs heidel one word more brother sterling  i expect that you will take your eldest daughter in your hand and make a formal complaint to lord ogleby of sir john melvils behavior  do this brother show a proper regard for the honor of your fammaly yourself and i shall throw in my mite to the raising of it if not  but now you know my mind so act as you please and take the consequences exit   sterling alone the devils in the woman for tyranny  mothers wives mistresses or sisters they always will govern us  as to my sister heidelberg she knows the strength of her purse and domineers upon the credit of it  i will do this  and you shall do that  and you must do the other or else the fammaly shall not have a farden of  mimicking  so absolute with her money  but to say the truth nothing but money can make us absolute and so we must even make the best of her   scene changes to the garden enter lord ogleby and canton

withal extremely goodnatured and would do any thing to recommend himself to a lady  do you open the whole affair of our marriage to him immediately it will come with more irresistible persuasion from

receiving your commands and the satisfaction of confirming with my tongue what my eyes perhaps have but too weakly expressed  that i am literally  the humblest of your servants   fanny i think myself greatly honored by your lordships partiality to me but it distresses me that i am obliged in my present situation to apply to it for protection   lord ogle i am happy in your distress madam because it gives me an opportunity to show my  beauty to me is a religion in which i was born and bred a bigot and would die a martyr  i am in tolerable spirits faith aside   fanny there is not perhaps at this moment a more distressed creature than myself affection duty hope despair and a thousand different sentiments are struggling in my bosom and even the presence of your lordship to whom i have flown for

you have a powerful advocate in my breast i assure you  my heart madam  i am attached to you by all the laws of sympathy and delicacy  by my honor i am   fanny then i will venture to unburthen my mind  sir john melvil my lord by the most misplaced and mistimed declaration of affection for me has made me the unhappiest of women   l ogle how madam has sir john made his addresses to you   fanny he has my lord in the strongest terms but i hope it is needless to say that my duty to my father love to my sister and regard to the whole family as well as the great respect i entertain for your lordship curtseying made me shudder at his addresses   l ogle charming girl  proceed my dear miss fanny proceed   fanny in a moment  give me leave my lord  but if what i have to disclose should be received with anger or displeasure    l ogle impossible by all the tender powers  speak i beseech you or i shall divine the cause before you utter it   fanny then my lord sir johns addresses are not only shocking to me in themselves but are more particularly disagreeable to me at this time as  as  hesitating   l ogle as what madam   fanny as  pardon my confusion  i am entirely devoted to another   l

us return madam to the highest luxury of exalted minds  a declaration of love from the lips of beauty   fanny the entrance of a third person has a little relieved me but i cannot go through with it  and yet i must open my heart with a discovery or it will break with its burden   l ogle what passion in her eyes i am alarmed to agitation aside  i presume madam and as you have flattered me by making me a party concerned i hope you will excuse the presumption that    fanny do you excuse my making you a party concerned my lord and let me interest your heart in my behalf as my future happiness or misery in a great measure depend    l ogle upon me madam   fanny upon you my lord sighs   l ogle there is no standing this i have caught the infection  her tenderness dissolves me sighs   fanny and

rather tell our story this moment to all the house and run the risque of maintaining you by the hardest labor than suffer you to remain in this dangerous perplexity  what shall i sacrifice all my best hopes and affections in your dear health and safety for the mean and in such a case the meanest consideration  of our fortune were we to be abandoned by all our relations we have that in our hearts

prudence you will be heard and we shall be discovered  i am satisfied indeed i am  excuse this weakness this delicacy  this what you will  my minds at peace  indeed it is  think no more of it if you

impudence   lord ogle the mystery thickens lady of the bedchamber to betty open the door and entreat sir john melvil for these ladies will have it that he is there to appear and answer to high crimes and misdemeanors  call sir john melvil into the court   enter sir john melvil on the other side sir john i am here my lord   mrs heidel heyday   miss sterling astonishment   sir john what is all this alarm and confusion there is nothing but hurry in the house what is the reason of it   lord ogle because you have been in that chamber have been nay you are there at this moment as these ladies have protested so dont deny it    traverse this is the clearest alibi i ever knew mr sergeant   flower luce clarius   lord ogle upon my word ladies if you have often these frolicks it would be really entertaining to pass a whole summer with you but come to betty open the door and entreat your amiable mistress to come forth and dispel all our doubts with her smiles   betty opening the door madam you are wanted in this room pertly   enter fanny in great confusion miss sterling you see she is ready dressed  and what confusion she is in   mrs heidel ready to pack off bag and baggage  her guilt confounds her    flowers silence in the court ladies   fanny i am confounded indeed madam   lord ogle dont droop my beauteous lilly but with your own peculiar modesty declare your state of mind  pour conviction into their ears and raptures into mine smiling   fanny i am at this moment the most unhappy  most distressed  the tumult is too much for my heart  and i want the power to reveal a secret which to conceal has been the misfortune and misery of my  my  faints away   speaking all at once lord ogle she faints help help for the fairest and best of women   betty running to her o my dear mistress  help help there    sir john ha let me fly to her assistance   lovewell rushes out from the chamber lovew my fanny in danger i can contain no longer  prudence were now a crime all other cares are lost in this  speak speak to me my dearest fanny  let me but hear thy voice open your eyes and bless me with the smallest sign of life during this speech they are all in amazement   miss sterling lovewell  i am easy    mrs heidel i am thunderstuck   lord ogle i am petrified   sir john and i undone   fanny recovering o lovewell  even supported by thee i dare not look my father nor his lordship in the face   sterling what now did not i send you to london sir   lord ogle eh  what  how is this  by what right and title have you been half the night in that ladys bedchamber   lovew by that right that makes me the happiest of men and by a title which i would not forego for any the best of kings could give me   betty i could cry my eyes out to hear his magnimity   lord ogle i am annihilated   sterling i have been choked with rage and wonder but now i can speak  zounds what have you to say to me  lovewell you are a villain  you have broke your word with me   fanny indeed sir he has not  you forbad him to think of me when it was out of his power to obey you we have been married these four months   sterling and he shall not stay in my house four hours what baseness and treachery as for you you shall repent this step as long as you live madam   fanny indeed sir it is impossible to conceive the tortures i have already endured in consequence of my disobedience my heart has continually upbraided me for it and though i was too weak to struggle with affection i feel that i must be miserable for ever without your forgiveness   sterling lovewell you shall leave my house directly  and you shall follow him madam to fanny   lord ogle and if they do i will receive them into mine look ye mr sterling there have been some mistakes which we had all better forget for our own sakes and the best way to forget them is to forgive the cause of them which i do from my soul  poor girl i swore to support her affection with my life and fortune  it is a debt of honor and must be paid  you swore as much too mr sterling but your laws in the city will excuse you i suppose for you never strike a balance without errors excepted   sterling i am a father my lord but for the sake of all other fathers i think i ought not to forgive her for fear of encouraging other silly girls like herself to throw themselves away without the consent of their parents   lovew i hope there will be no danger of that sir young ladies with minds like my fannys would startle at the very shadow of vice and when they know to what uneasiness only an indiscretion has exposed her her example instead of encouraging will rather serve to deter them   mrs heidel indiscretion quoth a a mighty pretty delicat word to express disobedience   lord ogle for my part i indulge my own passions too much to tyrannize over those of other people poor souls i pity them and you must forgive them too come come melt a little of your flint mr sterling   sterling why why  as to that my lord  to be sure he is a relation of yours my lord  what say you sister heidelberg   mrs heidel the girls ruined and i forgive her   sterling well  so do i then  nay no thanks  to lovewell and fanny who seem preparing to speak there is an end of the matter   lord ogle but lovewell what makes you dumb all this while   lovew your kindness my lord  i can scarce believe my own senses  they are all in a tumult of fear joy love expectation and gratitude i ever was and am now more bound in duty to your lordship for you mr sterling if every moment of my life spent gratefully in your service will in some measure compensate the want of fortune you perhaps will not repent your goodness to me and you ladies i flatter myself will not for the future suspect me of artifice and intrigue  i shall be happy to oblige and serve you  as for you sir john    sir john no apologies to me lovewell i do not deserve any all i have to offer in excuse for what has happened is my total ignorance of your situation had you dealt a little more openly with me you would have saved me and yourself and that lady who i hope will pardon my behavior a great deal of uneasiness give me leave however to assure you that light and capricious as i may have appeared now my infatuation is over i have sensibility enough to be ashamed of the part i have acted and honor enough to rejoice at your happiness   lovew and now my dearest fanny though we are seemingly the happiest of beings yet all our joys will be dampt if his lordships generosity and mr sterlings forgiveness should not be succeeded by the indulgence approbation and consent of these our best benefactors to the audience   finis epilogue written by mr garrick characters of the epilogue lord minum mr dodd colonel trill mr vernon sir patrick mahony mr moody miss crotchet mrs  mrs
