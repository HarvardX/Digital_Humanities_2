odes on various subjects       euripides in alceste by joseph warton b a of oriel college oxon  london printed for r dodsley at tullys head in pall mall and sold by m cooper in paternoster row mdccxlvi  advertisement the public has been so much accustomed of late to didactic poetry alone and essays on moral subjects that any work where the imagination is much indulged will perhaps not be relished or regarded the author therefore of these pieces is in some pain least certain austere critics should think them too fanciful and descriptive but as he is convinced that the fashion of moralizing in verse has been carried too far and as he looks upon invention and imagination to be the chief faculties of a poet so he will be happy if the following odes may be looked upon as an attempt to bring back poetry into its right channel  odes on various subjects ode i to fancy o parent of each lovely muse thy spirit over my soul diffuse over all my artless songs preside my footsteps to thy temple guide to offer at thy turfbuilt shrine in golden cups no costly wine no murdered fatling of the flock but flowers and honey from the rock o nymph with looselyflowing hair with buskined leg and bosom bare thy waist with myrtlegirdle bound thy brows with indian feathers crowned waving in thy snowy hand an allcommanding magic wand of power to bid fresh gardens blow midst chearless laplands barren snow whose rapid wings thy flight convey through air and over earth and sea while the vast various landscape lies conspicuous to thy piercing eyes o lover of the desert hail say in what deep and pathless vale or on what hoary mountains side midst falls of water you reside midst broken rocks a rugged scene with green and grassy dales between midst forests dark of aged oak never echoing with the woodmans stroke where never human art appeared nor even one strawrooft cott was reared where nature seems to sit alone majestic on a craggy throne tell me the path sweet wanderer tell to thy unknown sequestered cell where woodbines cluster round the door where shells and moss oerlay the floor and on whose top an hawthorn blows amid whose thicklywoven boughs some nightingale still builds her nest each evening warbling thee to rest then lay me by the haunted stream wrapped in some wild poetic dream in converse while methinks i rove with spenser through a fairy grove till suddenly awoke i hear strange whispered music in my ear and my glad soul in bliss is drowned by the sweetlysoothing sound me goddess by the right hand lead sometimes through the yellow mead where joy and whiterobd peace resort and venus keeps her festive court where mirth and youth each evening meet and lightly trip with nimble feet nodding their lillycrowned heads where laughter roselipd hebe leads where echo walks steep hills among listening to the shepherds song or sometimes in thy fiery car transport me to the rage of war there whirl me over the hills of slain where tumult and destruction reign where mad with pain the wounded steed tramples the dying and the dead where giant terror stalks around with sullen joy surveys the ground and pointing to the ensanguind field shakes his dreadful gorgonshield then guide me from this horrid scene to higharcht walks and alleys green where lovely laura walks to shun the fervors of the midday sun the pangs of absence o remove for thou can place me near my love can fold in visionary bliss and let me think i steal a kiss while her ruby lips dispense luscious nectars quintessence when youngeyd spring profusely throws from her green lap the pink and rose when the soft turtle of the dale to summer tells her tender tale when autumn cooling caverns seeks and stains with wine his jolly cheeks when winter like poor pilgrim old shakes his silver beard with cold at every season let my ear thy solemn whispers fancy hear o warm enthusiastic maid without thy powerful vital aid that breathes an energy divine that gives a soul to every line never may i strive with lips profane to utter an unhallowed strain nor dare to touch the sacred string save when with smiles thou bidst me sing o hear our prayer o hither come from thy lamented shakespeares tomb on which thou love to sit at eve musing over your darlings grave o queen of numbers once again animate some chosen swain who filled with unexhausted fire may boldly smite the sounding lyre who with some new unequalled song may rise above the rhyming throng over all our listening passions reign overwhelm our souls with joy and pain with terror shake with pity move rouse with revenge or melt with love o deign to attend his evening walk with him in groves and grottos talk teach him to scorn with frigid art feebly to touch the unrapturd heart like lightning let his mighty verse the bosoms inmost foldings pierce with native beauties win applause beyond cold critics studied laws o let each muses fame increase o bid britannia rival greece ode ii to liberty o goddess on whose steps attend pleasure and laughterloving health whitemantled peace with olivewand young joy and diamondsceptred wealth blithe plenty with her loaded horn with science bright eyed as the morn in britain which for ages past has been thy choicest darling care who made her wise and strong and fair may thy best blessings ever last for thee the pining prisoner mourns deprived of food of mirth of light for thee pale slaves to galleys chained that ply tough oars from morn to night thee the proud sultans beauteous train by eunuchs guarded weep in vain tearing the roses from their locks and guineas captive kings lament by christian lords to labor sent whipped like the dull unfeeling ox inspired by thee deaf to sond natures cries stern brutus when romes genius loudly called gave her the matchless filial sacrifice unable to behold her power enthralled and he of later age but equal fame dared stab the tyrant though he loved the friend how burnt the leonidas spartan with warm patriotflame in thy great cause his valorous life to end how burst gustavus from the swedish mine like light from chaos dark eternally to shine when heaven to all thy joys bestows and graves upon our hearts  be free  shall coward man those joys resign and dare reverse this great decree submit him to some idolking some selfish passionguided thing abhorring man by man abhorred around whose throne stands trembling doubt whose jealous eyes still roll about and murder with his reeking sword where trampling tyranny with fate and black revenge gigantic goes hark how the dying infants shriek how hopeless age is sunk in woes fly mortals from that fated land though rivers roll over golden sand though birds in shades of cassia sing harvests and fruits spontaneous rise no storms disturb the smiling skies and each soft breeze rich odours bring britannia watch  remember peerless rome her hightowrd head dashed meanly to the ground remember freedoms guardian grecias doom whom weeping the despotic turk has bound may never thy oakcrownd hills rich meads and downs fame virtue courage property forgot thy peaceful villages and busy towns be doomed some deathdispensing tyrants lot on deep foundations may thy freedom stand long as the surge shall lash thy seaencircled land ode iii to health written on a recovery from the smallpox o whether with laborious clowns in meads and woods thou love to dwell in noisy merchantcrouded towns or in the temperate brachmans cell who from the meads of ganges fruitful flood wet with sweet dews collects his flowery food in bath or in montpelliers plains or rich bermud s balmy isle or the cold north whose furclad swains never saw the purple autumn smile who over alps of snow and deserts drear by twinkling starlight drive the flying deer o lovely queen of mirth and ease whom absent beauty banquets wine wit music pomp nor science please and kings on ivory couches pine natures kind nurse to whom by gracious heaven to sooth the pangs of toilsome life it is given to aid a languid wretch repair let paleeyd grief thy presence fly the restless demon gloomy care and meagre melancholy die drive to some lonely rock the giant pain and bind him howling with a triple chain o come restore my aching sight yet let me not on laura gaze soon must i quit that dear delight oerpowerd by beautys piercing rays support my feeble feet and largely shed thy oil of gladness on my fainting head how nearly had my spirit past till stopped by metcalfs skilful hand to deaths dark regions wide and wast and the black rivers mournful strand or to those vales of joy and meadows blessed where sages heroes patriots poets rest where maro and musaeus sit listening to miltons loftier song with sacred silent wonder smit while monarch of the tuneful throng homer in rapture throws his trumpet down and to the briton gives his amaranthine crown ode iv to superstition hence to some convents gloomy isles where cheerful daylight never smiles tyrant from albion haste to slavish rome there by dim tapers livid light at the still solemn hours of night in pensive musings walk over many a sounding tomb thy clanking chains thy crimson steel thy venomed darts and barbarous wheel malignant fiend bear from this isle away nor dare in errors fetters bind one active sreeborn british mind that strongly strives to spring indignant from thy sway thou badst grim molochs frowning priest snatch screaming infants from the breast regardless of the frantic mothers woes thou ledst the ruthless sons of spain to wondering indias golden plain from deluges of blood where tenfold harvests rose but lo how swiftly art thou fled when reason lifts his radiant head when his resounding awful voice they hear blind ignorance thy doting sire thy daughter trembling fear retire and all thy ghastly train of terrors disappear so by the magi hailed from far when phoebus mounts his early car the shrieking ghosts to their dark charnels flock the fullgorgd wolves retreat no more the prowling lionesses roar but hasten with their prey to some deepcavernd rock hail then ye friends of reason hail ye foes to mystrys odious veil to truths high temple guide my steps aright where clarke and woolaston reside with lock and newton by their side while plato sits above enthroned in endless light ode v to a gentleman upon his travels through italy while i with fond officious care for you my chorded shell prepare and not unmindful frame an humble lay where shall this verse my cynnthio find what scene of art now charms your mind say on what sacred spot of roman ground you stray perhaps you cull each valleys bloom to strew over virgils laurelld tomb whence often at midnight echoing voices sound for at that hour of silence there the shades of ancient bards repair to join in choral song his hallowed urn around or wander in the cooling shade of sabine bowers where horace strayed and often repeat in eager thought elate as round in classic search you trace with curious eye the pleasing place  this fount he loved and there beneath that oak he sat how longs my raptured breast with you great raphaels magic strokes to view to whose blessed hand each charm the graces gave whence each fair form with beauty glows like that of venus when she rose naked in blushing charms from oceans hoary wave as often by roving fancy led to smooth clitumnus banks you tread what awful thoughts his fabled waters raise while the lowthoughted swain whose flock grazes around from some steep rock with vulgar disregard his mazy course surveys now through the ruined domes my muse your steps with eager flight pursues that their cleft piles on tybers plains present among whose hollowwinding cells forlorn and wild romes genius dwells his golden scepter broke and purple mantle rent often to those mossy mouldering walls those caverns dark and silent halls let me repair by midnights paly fires there muse on empires fallen state and frail ambitions hapless fate while more than mortal thoughts the solemn scene inspires what lust of power from the cold north could tempt those vandalrobbers sorth fair italy thy vineclad vales to wast whose hands profane with hostile blade thy storyd temples dared invade and all thy parian seats of attic art defaced they weeping art in fetters bound and gored her breast with many a wound and veiled her charms in clouds of thickest night sad poesy muchinjurd maid they drove to some dim convents shade and quenched in gloomy mist her lamps resplendent light there long she wept to darkness doomed till cosmos hand her light relumd that once again in lofty tasso shone since has sweet spenser caught her fire she breathed once more in miltons lyre and warmed the soul divine of shakespeare fancys son nor she mild queen will cease to smile on her britannias muchloved isle where these her best her favorite three were born while the author of the pleasures of imagination thereon warbles grecian strains or polished dodington remains the drooping train of art to cherish and adorn ode vi against despair farewell thou dimpled cherub joy thou rosecrownd eversmiling boy wont thy sister hope to lead to dance along the primrose mead no more bereft of happy hours i seek thy luteresounding bowers but to yon ruined tower repair to meet the god of groans despair who on that ivydarkend ground still takes at eve his silent round or sits yon newmade grave beside where lies a frantic suicide while laboring sighs my heart strings break thus to the sullen power i speak  haste with thy poisoned dagger haste  to pierce this sorrowladen breast  or lead me at the dead of night  to some seabeat mountains height  whence with headlong haste i will leap  to the dark bosom of the deep  or show me far from human eye  some cave to muse in starve and die  no weeping friend or brother near  my last fond faultring words to hear twas thus with weights of woes oppressed i sought to ease my bruised breast when straight more gloomy grew the shade and lo a tall majestic maid her limbs not delicately fair robust and of a martial air she bore of steel a polished shield where highlysculpturd i beheld socrates the athenian martyr smiling stand the baleful goblet in his hand sparkled her eyes with lively flame and patience was the seraphs name sternly she looked and stern began   thy sorrows cease complaining man  rouse thy weak soul appease thy moan  soon are the clouds of sadness gone  though now in griefs dark groves you walk  where griesly fiends around you stalk  beyond a blissful city lies  far from whose gates each anguish flies  take thou this shield which once of yore  ulysses and alcides wore  and which in later days i gave  to regulus and raleigh brave  in exile or in dungeon drear  their mighty minds could banish fear  thy heart no tenfold woes shall feel  twas virtue tempered the rough steel  and by her heavenly fingers wrought  to me the precious present brought ode vii to evening hail meekeyd maiden clad in sober gray whose soft approach the weary woodman loves as homeward bent to kiss his prattling babes he jocund whistles through the twilight groves when phoebus sinks behind the gilded hills you lightly over the misty meadows walk the drooping daisies bathe in honeydews and nurse the nodding violets slender stalk the panting dryads that in days fierce heat to inmost bowers and cooling caverns ran return to trip in wanton eveningdance old sylvan too returns and laughing pan to the deep wood the clamorous rooks repair light skims the swallow over the watery scene and from the sheepcotes and freshfurrowd field stout plowmen meet to wrestle on the green the swain that artless sings on yonder rock his supping sheep and lengthening shadow spies pleased with the cool the calm refreshful hour and with hoarse hummings of unnumberd flies now every passion sleeps desponding love and pining envy everrestless pride an holy calm creeps over my peaceful soul anger and mad ambitions storms subside o modest evening often let me appear a wandering votary in thy pensive train listening to every wildlywarbling throat that fills with farewell notes the darkning plain ode viii to a fountain imitated from horace ode xiii book iii ye waves that gushing fall with purest stream blandusian fount to whom the products sweet of richest vines belong and fairest flowers of spring to thee a chosen victim will i slay a kid who glowing in lascivious youth just blooms with budding horn and with vain thought elate yet destines future war but ah too soon his reeking blood with crimson shall enrich thy pure translucent flood and tinge thy crystal clear thy sweet recess the sun in midday hour can never invade thy streams the labored ox refresh with cooling draught and glad the wandering herds thy name shall shine with endless honors graced while on my shell i sing the nodding oak that over thy cavern deep waves his embowering head ode ix to the nightingale o thou that to the moonlight vale warblest often thy plaintive tale what time the villagemurmurs cease and the still eve is hushed to peace when now no busy sound is heard contemplations favorite bird chauntress of night whose amorous song first heard the tufted groves among warns wanton mabba to begin her revels on the circled green whenever by meditation led i nightly seek some distant mead a short repose of cares to find and sooth my lovedistracted mind o fail not then sweet philomel thy sadlywarbled woes to tell in sympathetic numbers join thy pangs of luckless love with mine so may no swains rude hand infest thy tender young and rob thy nest nor ruthless fowlers guileful snare lure thee to leave the fields of air no more to visit vale or shade some barbarous virgins captive made ode x on the spring to a lady lo spring arrayed in primrosecolourd robe fresh beauties sheds on each enlivened scene with showers and sunshine chears the smiling globe and mantles hill and vale in glowing green all nature feels her vital heat around the pregnant glebe now bursts with foodful grain with kindly warmth she opes the frozen ground and with new life informs the teeming plain she calls the fishes from their ouzy beds and animates the deep with genial love she bids the herds bound sportive over the meads and with glad songs awakes the joyous grove no more the glaring tiger roams for prey allpowerful love subdues his savage soul to find his spotted mate he darts away while gentler thoughts the thirst of blood control but ah while all is warmth and soft desire while all around springs cheerful influence own you feel not amoret her quickening fire to springs kind heat of all a foe alone ode xi to a lady who hates the country now summer daughter of the sun over the gay fields comes dancing on and earth overflows with joys too long in routs and drawingrooms the tasteless hours my fair consumes midst folly flattery noise come hear mild zephyr bid the rose her balmybreathing buds disclose come hear the falling rill observe the honeyloaded be the beechembowerd cottage see beside yon sloping hill by health awoke at early morn well brush sweet dews from every thorn and help unpen the fold hence to yon hollow oak well stray where dwelt as villagefables say an holy druid old come wildly rove through desert dales to listen how lone nightingales in liquid lays complain adieu the tender thrilling note that pants in monticellis throat and handels stronger strain  insipid pleasures these you cry  must i from dear assemblies fly  to see rude peasants toil  for operas listen to a bird  shall arcadia sydneys fables be preferred  to my sagacious alluding to those ladies who have left their novels and romances for the profound study of mr hoyles book on whist hoyle o falsely fond of what seems great of purple pomp and robes of state and all lifes tinsel glare rather with humble violets bind or give to wanton in the wind your length of sable hair soon as you reach the rural shade will mirth the sprightly mountainmaid your days and nights attend she will bring fantastic sport and song nor cupid will be absent long your true ally and friend ode xii on the death of  no more of mirth and rural joys the gay description quickly cloys in melting numbers sadly slow i tune my altered strings to woe attend melpomene and with thee bring thy tragic lute euphranors death to sing fond will thou be his name to praise for often thou heardst his skilful lays isis for him soft tears has shed she placed her ivy on his head chose him strict judge to rule with steady reigns the vigorous fancies of her listening swains with genius wit and science blessed unshaken honor armed his breast bade him with virtuous courage wise malignant fortunes darts despise him even black envys venomed tongues commend as scholar pastor husband father friend for ever sacred ever dear o muchloved shade accept this tear each night indulging pious woe fresh roses on thy tomb i strew and wish for tender spensers moving verse warbled in broken sobs over sydneys hearse let me to that deep cave resort where sorrow keeps her silent court for ever wringing her pale hands while dumb misfortune near her stands with downcast eyes the cares around her wait and pity sobbing sits before the gate thus stretched upon his grave i sung when strait my ears with murmur rung a distant deaf and hollow sound was heard in solemn whispers round   weep not for me embathd in bliss above  in the bright kingdoms blessed of joy and love ode xiii on shooting nymphs of the forests that young oaks protect from noxious blasts and the blue thunders dart o how securely might ye dwell in britains peaceful shades far from grim wolves or tigers midnight roar or crimsoncrested serpents hungry hiss but that our savage swains pollute with murder your retreats how often your birds have undeserving bled linnet or warbling thrush or moaning dove pleasant with gaylyglistring wings or earlymounting lark while in sweet converse in a round you sit on the green turf or in the woodbinebower if chance the thundering gun be heard to grots and caves ye run fearful as when lodona fled from pan or daphne panting from enamored sol or fair sabrina to the flood her snowy beauties gave when will dread man his tyrannies forego when cease to bathe his barbarous hands in blood his subjects helpless harmless weak delighting to destroy more pleasant far to shield their tender young from churlish swains that violate their nests and wandering morn or eve to hear their welcome to the spring ode xiv to solitude thou that at deep dead of night walkst forth beneath the pale moons light in robe of flowing black arrayed while cypressleaves thy brows oershade listening to the crowing cock and the distantsounding clock or sitting in thy cavern low do hear the bleak winds loudly blow or the hoarse deathboding owl or village maistiffs wakeful howl while through thy melancholy room a dim lamp casts an awful gloom thou that on the meadow green or daisyd upland art not seen but wandering by the dusky nooks and the pensivefalling brooks or near some rugged herbless rock where no shepherd keeps his flock musing maid to thee i come hating the tradeful citys hum o let me calmly dwell with thee from noisy mirth and business free with meditation seek the skies this follyfetterd world despise finis
