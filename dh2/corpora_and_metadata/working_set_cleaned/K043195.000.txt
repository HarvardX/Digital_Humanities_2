the redcross knights  a play in five acts  as performed at the theater royal haymarket  founded on the robbers of schiller  by j g holman  london printed and published by eo cawthorn british library no     strand bookseller to her royal highness the princess of wales sold also by messrs richardson royal exchange h d symonds j wallis and w west paternosterrow and j wright piccadilly        advertisement in an avowed alteration of the robbers of schiller it may surprise and disappoint many admirers of that highly celebrated work to find so much of the original displaced for the introduction of new matter i therefore feel it necessary to state my motives for having rather founded a play on schillers than merely adapted the robbers for representation  captivated by its beauties i had no other plan when i first undertook to prepare the work for the stage than to make curtailments and such variations as most dramas require that are not native productions when completed agreeably to this design its performance was prohibited by the licenser i was unable at the time to account for this interdict having carefully expunged all sentiments that appeared to war against establishments and good order i am aware of an objection which has been made to charles de moor the hero of the robbers importing that the grandeur of his character renders him more likely to excite imitation than abhorrence but this objection i have ever considered as unfounded for surely to exhibit a man whose youthful irregularities are the primary cause of his subsequent misery and who driven by desperation to a life of infamy feels the most pungent anguish for his crimes and expects that eternal torments will be his punishment is so far from violating the purest system of ethics that i am at a loss to conceive how a more forcible lesson of morality can be inculcated  on a more dispassionate investigation of the play however i found much to justify the licensers decision compunction for villainy seems the peculiar feature of charles the rest of the robbers combine brutal insensibility of their enormities with the most heroic attachment to their leader this junction of sublime virtue with consummate depravity though it may be found in nature should never be dragged into view  the heroism dazzles the mind and renders it blind to the atrocity  still unwilling wholly to abandon a favorite object i determined on forming a play which should retain as much as possible of the original with the omission of all that could be deemed objectionable this point was only to be accomplished by converting the enterprise of the leading character and his associates from an infamous into an honorable pursuit the history of chivalry naturally suggested itself as abounding with instances of such warlike combinations in the cause of religion and justice spain presented the most eligible scene of action where those associations were so frequent that many of the most glorious victories over the moors were effected solely by bands of knightadventurers and the orders of st jago calatrava alcantara etc owe their origin to such laudable confederacies  by this change in the outline i have been enabled to submit a portion of schillers robbers to an english audience the labor that has attended this alteration must obviously have been considerable as i was compelled to reconcile contradictions to produce the same effects from totally opposite causes in short in the words of my archetype to make angels of criminals  some striking passages of the original which might with consistency have been preserved in this alteration are omitted because already adopted in recent productions i mention this circumstance solely for my own vindication that i may not be accused of a tasteless rejection of beauties there are situations still retained which may remind the audience of what they have seen before these i conceived to be of too much importance to the piece and too forcible in their nature to incur banishment for no fault but having been deemed worthy of imitation  prologue written by mr tailor spoken by mr trueman though famed cervantes in the happiest vein of sportive satire lashed the gallant train who wandered over the world to seek distress to succor innocence and wrongs redress yet those enthusiasts held to ardent youth the bright career of honor and of truth hence with the sage whom virtue must deplore virtue may grieve that chivalrys no more exalted sage whose glowing pen so well the fair desert of chivalry could tell that prop of rank and sex  that generous pride which while it bent obedience dignified  that reverence of the heart that still we find served with the spirit of a freeborn mind  that high disdain of all ignoble strife a states cheap guard  that unbought grace of life the nurse of manly sentiment  the meed as well as source of each heroic deed  that sensibility with honor found which felt a stain as the severest wound which valors noble impulse could inspire without the fierce extreme of savage ire ennobling all it touchd with wondrous charm that void of grossness vice had less of harm such was the wreath departed genius bore to deck a bold romantic race of yore and all who judge them fairly must confess that even their faults were virtues in excess  but it is full time to speak about our play  and hence our author bids me freely say that since the german stage can so delight he brings you something from that stage tonight a work that foreign wits with zeal admire for genuine pathos dignity and fire and should through him its vigor have declined at least its morals will be more refined the heroes there all legal duties scorn and deem that man the prey of man was born but champions now for virtues sacred

determined on my mothers union with him each by a former marriage having a son the compact was that on the failure of more issue ferdinand and myself were mutual heirs a contract well stipulated by my prudent mother as my in heritance is not a twentieth part of the rich lordships of ladesma   bertran how i long to hail you master of these domains spain would not then contain a lord more potent than count roderic de froila   roderic you my good bertran do not only wish me prosperous fortunes but zealously assist me to obtain them they plans to which you have so ably ministered have thus far proved successful our suppression of ferdinands letters to his sather and the calumnies we have contrived so artfully to lower him in his regard have answered to my wish this forgery taking out a letter will i trust do wonders we have every thing at stake to animate exertion you have your love  i my ambition retire the count approaches exit bertran   enter count de ladesma roderic how do you sir alas you look pale  i fear you are not well   ladesma as well as sorrow and old age will let me be   roderic a letter sir is just arrived from lerma   ladesma from my son ferdinand   roderic no sir it appears the hand of your correspondent don veremond   ladesma then it relates to my son read it good roderic   roderic consider sir the intelligence you have of late received has been afflicting very afflicting to a fond father i am therefore alarmed for your healths sake  i beg your pardon  but let me entreat you to hear its contents when you may be better able to bear ill tidings   ladesma oh ferdinand how you rend your fathers heart alas every fresh account i hear forces me a step nearer to the grave   roderic then pardon me sir if i withhold this letter ladesma roderic  from you i experience all the tenderness the best of sons could show me  while my own offspring  ah dear roderic you have compassion on my gray head you wish to spare me but read the letter  let me know the worst   roderic i shall ever hold it my first duty to obey you  in this instance a melancholy duty  but still let us hope that this brings the glad tidings of amendment let us hope it sir reads  your son has filled up the measure of his shame his dissolute conduct with the report of which i have hitherto had the melancholy office of wounding your feelings wears the semblance of purity when compared to his last act of infamy his sovereign  so gracious to him  who had loaded him with honors too mighty for his years even had they been merited by his services  his sovereign he deserted and drew his sword on the part of rebellion   ladesma enough enough  oh oh   roderic our monarch is victorious and the unhappy ferdinand has been brought a prisoner to his injured king who swayed by his attachment to your noble house has spared his forfeited life  but the name of ladesma is stained with treason   ladesma my name my honorable name   roderic unhappy father ladesma oh all my prospects  my golden dreams when he came into life when for the first time i pressed my infant to my bosom did i not call god himself to witness my happiness and now  misery misery   roderic oh that i could give you comfort   ladesma my comfort lies only in the grave yet for thy kindness roderic let me not be ungrateful heaven that has ordained these tears to flow for the crimes of my son has sent me a son in thee   roderic oh my father for father you have have ever been to me let me wipe those tears away i would sacrifice my life to prolong thy days no tie of nature can be more strong more sacred than the bond of duty and affection by which i am devoted to thee   ladesma may heaven bless you for your goodness oh ferdinand what misery have thou heaped on thy aged fathers head   roderic when i reflect on that sir  when i think how he has afflicted you the affection i once bore him is turned to hatred oh sir as you value your peace nay your existence banish him and his vices from your remembrance  renounce for ever this    ladesma renounce my son   roderic oh that such counsel should ever be forced from my lips but how else can your goaded mind have rest how else can be preserved the life most dear to me   ladesma oh ferdinand unfeeling child  but still still my child   roderic think sir  if he be exposed for some time to the pressure of misery is it not probable he will amend will not affliction prove his best physician to rid him of the vices which indulgence nourished what say you sir   ladesma i will write to him that i abandon him to his fate   roderic you will do wisely   ladesma he shall never see my face again   roderic that will be well   ladesma with great emotion till he become another man   roderic right  very right  but  stay sir  one word more i fear your anger may make you express yourself too harshly it would be cruel to drive him at once to despair and on the other hand would he not interpret a letter written by you  as perhaps a sort of pardon would it not be better sir if i should write to him   ladesma do so do so roderic oh it would break my heart to write to him write to him that    roderic it is agreed then   ladesma write to him that a thousand tears of blood  a thousand sleepless nights  but dont roderic dont drive him to despair   roderic come sir will not you retire to your chamber this affects you too much   ladesma write to him that his fathers heart  but dont dont drive him to despair exit   roderic taking up the letter which he let fall on the ground this last forgery has proved a masterpiece ferdinand is banished what follows  desperation that will urge him to acts of danger that may soon make me the rightful heir or grant he lives he lives an outcast and at ladesmas death i seize the power which once obtained supports itself here comes eugenia from her heart too i must banish ferdinand  ay were that heart to break for it   enter eugenia roderic eugenia   eugenia is it you  you here  whom of all mankind i

treated you wrong me go to the father who    eugenia the father ah that father who is the wretched dupe of your base arts  that father who has a son the paragon of honor and yet poor weak deluded man him he renounces at the suggestions of a villain   roderic you wrong me  you wrong me vilely   eugenia wretch i know thee  ay he deserves to be father of a son like thee when stretched on the bed of death he shall extend his feeble hands and seek to grasp for the last time his injured noble ferdinand let him feel thy icy hand thou fiend and shudder at the touch   roderic you rave eugenia  yet spite of your disdain spite of your insults still i love you   eugenia love from thee i ask thy hate  oh i should die with shame while thinking on my ferdinand could i for a moment believe that thou

guzman lanusa gonsalvo ripperda etc ferdinand once more welcome to toledo the rapturous acclamations which hail the return of our sovereign to his capital must give delight to every honest heart and show rebellion the weakness of its efforts against a monarch enthroned so firmly in his peoples love   garcias so wars at an end lie quiet to his sword my good old companion you and i must give over our intimacy well peace may be very desirable to men who have a natural aversion to hard fare and hard blows but to a soldier it is a miserable penance for past sins what am i to do i cannot scribble songs and squall them under a young misss window by moonlight i must therefore now give place to fellows who brandish gooscquills instead of swords and the blood stained banners of mars must bow to the silken streamers of cupid   guzman peace curse on the peace that would confine to earth the flight of an eagle it is war rates the hero here then must i bid adieu to all noble enterprise and seek once more my native peaceful fields   ferdinand i seek those fields with pleasure to serve my sovereign and my country i flew to arms their wrongs are well revenged the soldiers duty is done now then in the shade of my paternal woods and in the arms of my dear betrothed eugenia i court the highest gift of heaven  domestic happiness   garcias but ferdinand have you no dread of disappointment methinks your fathers conduct has been strange he has but ill supplied you with the means to keep the state your rank demands and had not your own high merits drawn on you the regard and favors of your sovereign you could but scantily have borne yourself as the heir of an illustrious house   ferdinand that still has filled me with astonishment since my absence from my father he seems not only to have lost his former fondness for me but almost to have forgotten that i am his son supplies have been assigned me with a niggard hand and the few letters i have received in answer to my warm expressions of respect and love have been filled with sour remonstrances i do not merit and frozen admonitions which i hope i need not   enter lerida lerida news news for you my heroes news that will make all your hearts dance   garcias what is your news lerida   lerida that peace will not continue long the king has signified his intention of marching against the moors so you will all get to work again soon   guzman not very soon i fear the king aims at their total expulsion from spain and such an armament as he willbear against them now we are exhausted with our late wars will require much time to raise   garcias so it appears lerida that your news is like informing a starving man that a twelvemonth hence he is likely to get a dinner   lerida ferdinand i forgot to tell you that spinola

reads guzman while he is reading what now ferdinand you seem petrified  ferdinand lets fall the letter and is going out in distraction garcias where are you going what is the matter ferdinand   ferdinand pointing to the letter there  there  oh lost lost for ever rushes out   guzman what can it mean  takes up the letter and reads unfortunate ferdinand your loyalty has ruined you in your fathers regard the emissaries of don juan de lara and don emanuel have so completely influenced his feeble mind that he is inflamed against you with the most unnatural resentment for the zeal you have testified in the cause of your sovereign against those powerful rebels he commands me to tell you that he sends you his malediction and that you have nothing to expect from him but vengeance these are his very words i grieve to add that what you will deem the bitterest revenge is already effected eugenia your beloved betrothed eugenia has been forced by him into the arms of one of the rebel adherents and borne away by this husband ravisher i know not whither from my soul i pity you  roderick de froila    garcias no wonder ferdinand is so afflicted   lerida why should he be afflicted the whole world is not comprised in his fathers castle and forests and of all the losses in life that of a mistress is soonest supplied   guzman as his friend i lament what causes his misery but were i to consider only his fame i should rejoice at the event which proscribes him from the narrow limits in which his gallant spirit would have been confined and gives him the whole world to range in oh i could point out to you all the path of glory   garcias say on   guzman hear me then if there be a drop of true castilian blood in your veins render yourselves worthy of the rewards of your sovereign of the affections of your countrymen of the admiration of posterity let us form into a glorious band to hurl destruction against the foes of our religion and the spoilers of our country   lerida guzman i honor you   guzman reflect the very ground on which we tread was once usurped by infidels and the proud crescent waved on the towers of toledo what drove them from the very heart of spain to their now narrow confines the lance of glorious chivalry let them behold in us that spain has still her champions of the cross  her soldiers of religion and humanity   garcias guzman the project is worthy of you with all my soul i am yours   lerida now why did not this grand idea dawn on my mind it is very strange for i have a brain famous for creating giant enterprises   garcias well second the endeavor with your hand and heart and praise the superior genius which got the start of your giant conceptions   lerida superior genius ha ha you are given to raillery garcias no no  a lucky hit that is all i allow superior genius ha ha   guzman but my friends one important point remains  a leader for this enterprise   lerida ay ay there you spoke to the purpose indeed we must have a chief  a man of talents great reach  a politic head standing with his arms across wise crafty   guzman if there were any hope that he would consent   lerida perhaps he may  difficult as it is to guide the ship when buffeted by winds and waves and however cumbrous may be the weight of a diadem  speak it out boldly  i say perhaps he may be prevailed on   guzman it will be all childrens play if he is not our leader without ferdinand we are a body without a head lerida turns away peevishly   enter ferdinand ferdinand men men false treacherous crocodiles your eyes are water your hearts are iron kisses on your lips and poniards in your bosom whatever malice can invent i have learned to bear i could smile were my enemy to carouse on my hearts blood but when a fathers love becomes a furys hate  oh then must every fiber of the tortured frame be racked to anguish and despair   guzman ferdinand hear me   ferdinand i loved him with such unbounded affection i would have sacrificed a thousand lives for him and yet without one pang of nature he can consign me to endless misery   guzman not so my friend he is the instrument of your glory he snatches you from dishonorable inactivity and impels you to the course of heroism hear me ferdinand you are chosen the leader of an enterprise which will immortalize our names shall our swords which have borne destruction to our countrys foes rust in indolence while that country needs their use while moorish robbers ravage our fertile plains and fellow countrymen and fellow christians are made the slaves of infidels   ferdinand guzman i thank thee yes the wrongs and miseries of spain shall rouse me from remembrance of my own my poor eugenia one tear to thy loss and thy distress and now i am all my countrys come fellow warriors hasten to take the sacred vows of chivalry and when its holy badge adorns your bosoms the infidels shall prove we wear the ensigns of religions soldiers not for vain ornament nor empty form but as the zealous active ministers of heaven be it our glorious duty to redeem our altars from unbelieving impious violators to release the groaning captive from the gloomy dungeon where he lies body and mind in shackles forced even to suppress the prayer he would offer to his god and all his torments aggravated by hearing hourly blasphemies against the being he adores think what delight will fill your souls to snatch the sufferer from such wretchedness and lead him to christian temples and his native home   guzman ours is indeed a course of glory   ferdinand come then my brethren  champions of heaven and of your country now let the proud oppressor tremble he shall find the prayers of helpless innocence are not put up to heaven in vain wherever we meet him he who has wronged the virtuous is our foe and if he dare to mock religion by the name of christian while his deeds defy its sacred laws he is worse than infidel that wretch who has the mandate of his god to love his neighbor as himself and yet will injure him what punishment can be for him too mighty  yet hold  let us remember an equal mandate of that god is to be merciful   chorus to arms to arms each breast inspiring glory leads us to the field our country calls our aid requiring against pagan foes the sword to wield the righteous cause by heaven is blessed hallowed the arm that shields the oppressed the red cross let our symbol be and victory crown our

my happiness could put it into my master don ferdinands head to turn knight errant i would willingly make that man a present to old lucifer who first invented the nonsense of chivalry just as if people had not quarrels enough of their own but they must run about thrusting forward their stupid skulls to get the raps that were intended for others for my part i think it quite bad enough to fight when one is forced to it without running here and there like mad insisting that there shall not be such a thing as a battle on the face of the earth but they must come in for a share of it we were far enough out of the way of these cursed moorish fellows if we could but have been contented to sleep in a whole skin but nothing would serve my master and his mad comrades but poking themselves just under their black noses oh lord oh lord  i cannot look at that great huge city stuffed full of infidels but i tremble all over however the constant fright they keep me in has one good effect it has certainly lowered my appetite and that is very convenient considering knight errant adventurers are generally on short commons   enter lerida and lanusa lerida well now you who have so mighty an
