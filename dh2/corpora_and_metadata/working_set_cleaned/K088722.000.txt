an excursion to the lakes in westmoreland and cumberland august       london printed for j wilkie no    in st pauls churchyard and w goldsmith no    paternoster row  mdcclxxiv  an excursion etc when ever i have read the descriptions given by travelers of foreign countries in which their beauties and antiquities were lavishly praised i have always regretted a neglect which has long attended the delightful scences at home the monuments of antiquity dispersed over this island are many and various some of them arose in the remotest ages and point out to us the revolutions and history of our own kingdom a degree of knowledge which ought to stand first in importance with every englishman  these sentiments gave rise to a summers excursion the pleasures of which i have endeavored to communicate to the reader in the following pages  the first requisites for a pleasure jaunt are companions of suitable taste and curiosity and conveniences for the journey  they increase every enjoyment and make every scene which presents itself more agreeable  these were not wanting  thus circumstanced we were conducted to bows in yorkshire to which place i shall first attempt engaging the attention of the reader  bows is of great antiquity in which is all its merit  the country around it is meanly cultivated its habitations are melancholy and what alone claims the attention of a traveller is the ruin of a castle supposed by some to have been of roman construction but by others to be the turris de arcubus built by allan first earl of richmond in the conquerors time it is situated on the old roman way which leads from cathrick or the ancient cateractonium  this castle is fiftythree feet high is built of hewn stone of excellent workmanship forming a square of equal sides of eightyone feet each the windows are irregular and the walls which are cemented with lime mixed with small flints are near five feet in thickness  it is now much defaced the outward casing having been stripped off in many places within it appears to have been divided into several apartments one of the lower divisions of which was supported by a central pillar from whence a roof of arches has arisen the groins still projecting from the walls  this castle is situated on the brink of a hill declining swiftly to the southward at whose foot runs the river greta  it is surrounded with a deep ditch on the south side of which is a plain or platform apparently calculated for the use of the castle  on the eastern point of this platform we were shown the site and remains of a bath with its aqueduct which are now totally in ruins and grown over with weeds and brambles  on a late enclosure of some common lands belonging to bows an ancient aqueduct was discovered which had conveyed the water from a place called levar or levy pool near two miles distant from the castle which was sufficient at once to supply the garrison with fresh water and also the baths  a few scanty meadows border the river greta and cultivation seems to awake in ignorance over the adjoining lands where the plough share begins to make the traces of industry on the skirts of the desert camden who wrote in the latter part of the reign of queen elizabeth and of the   th century speaking of this place says bows which also is written bowgh was then a little village where in preceding ages the earls of richmond had a pretty castelet the customs of thorough toll and their furcas which was the power of executing criminals in old times it was called in antonins itinirarie levatrae and lavatrae the distance and site thereof by the high street which is here evidently apparent do prove it but what greatly confirms the antiquity of it is an ancient large stone in the church used by the romans for an altar with the following inscription upon it to the honor of hadrian the emperor imp caesari divi traiani parthici maxfilio divi nervae nepoti traiano hadria no aug pont maxim  cos i  pp  coh iiii f  io sev this fragment was also there dug up   nol cae frontinus coh i thrac whilst virius lupus ruled as lieutenant general and propraetor of britain under severus the emperor the first cohort of the thracians laid here in garrison for whose use he rebuilt and restored the bath or hotas appears by the following inscription which was removed from hence to cunnington the house of sir robert cotton dae for tune virius lupus leg aug pr pr balineum vi ignis exust  um coh i thrac  um rest  ituit curante val fron  tone praef  eq alae vetto here i must correct their error who by falsely copying this inscription read balingium for balineum and thence form an opinion that the name of the place was balingium but upon a close attention to the engraving it is evidently balineum which word the learned know was used for balneum in the declining state of the roman empire a band of the exploratores with their captain kept their station here under the command of the general of britain as appears out of the notice of provinces where it is called lavatres but as such baths as thse were also called in latin lavacra some critic will pronounce that this place was named lavacra but i would rather presume it took its name from a little river running near to it which i have heard is called lavar  as for the later name of bows considering the old town had been burnt to the ground as all the inhabitants report i should think it arose upon that occasion for that which is burnt in the old british language is called boeth     an other occasion besides what is mentioned by camden may have given the modern name of bows as this place was granted by william the conqueror to one of his attendant adventurers  the ancient monuments said by camden to be in the church of bows are not now to be discovered neither are there any other antiquities there which can afford any light to the history of the place we have the authority of an ancient ms belonging to the dissolved monastry of st marys in york for the name arising from the following occasion  allanus niger comes richmondie unus fundatorum hujus monasterii iste allanus niger frater ducis britanie intravit angliam in exercitu willimi conquestoris cui dictus willimus contulit pro servicio suo dominum and comitatum richmond et postea idem allanus primus com richmondie in defensionem tenentium suorum comitatus predict contra expugnationes hominum de westmoreland et cumberland rebellantium contra dictum conquestorum ac cum gospatrico duce northumbrie adherentium regi scotarum edificavit sibi turrim do arcubus in quo constituit guillamum consanguineum suum praefectum super  00 sagittarios et dedit ei scutum proprium cum armis britanie et tres arcus desuper et unum bundellum sagittarum pro capitali insigne suo ipse guillarmus exinde nuncupatus fuit guillarmus de arcubus     from bows proceeding toward westmoreland we were respited from the sad scene of barrenness to which we were obliged to pass by some infant enclosures and attempts toward cultivation  the climate the dreary vicinage of mountains and the inclement skies seem to deny industry her natural rewards  at length spittle presents its solitary edifice to the view behind which stainmore arises whose heights receive the burden of both eastern and western storms  as we advanced a dreary prospect was extended to the eye the hills are clothed in heath and all around is a scene of barrenness and deformity  the lower grounds are rent with torrents which descend impetuously from the steeps in winter and chasms which are harrowed on the sides of the hills yawn with ragged rocks or black and rotten earth  here and there some scattered plots of grass variegate the prospect where a few sheep find pasturage and now and then a little rill is seen in the deep dell which as it flows with disconsolate meandrings is tinged with the sable soil through which it passes  no habitation for mankind appears on either side but all is wilderness and horrid waste over which the wearied eye travels with anxiety camden says here begins to rise that high hilly and solitary country exposed to wind and rain which because it is stoney is called in our native language stanemore all around is nothing but a wild desert unless it is an humble hostelrie rather than an inn in the midst of it called spittle on stanemore to entertain travelers     at the door of the turnpike house on stainmore stands a cylindrical stone which seems to have been a roman guide post but the inscription is so obliterated that it cannot now be made out when we approached roy cross mentioned by camden near to it is a fragment of a cross which we call rere cross the scots roy cross or kings cross which cross hector boethius the scottish writer records to have been erected as a mestone to bound england and scotland at the time that william the conqueror granted cmberland unto the scots on condition that they should hold it of him as his tenants and not attempt any thing which should be prejudicial to the crown of england    which is now the boundary stone dividing yorkshire from westmoreland we perceived it stood within the remains of a large entrenchment defended by banks of earth ten paces wide through which the present turnpike road now passes its form is an oblong square extending from north to south with two openings on every side of the square immediately opposite to each other defended by a mound of earth placed right in the front of each pass now rising from the plane about five perpendicular feet which is near the height of the entrenchment in its highest part   the eastern side is two hundred and seventy paces in length the openings on the sides are ten paces wide the moles which defend the same are thirtysix paces in circumference and stand ten paces from the outward edge of the entrenchment the ascent of the adjoining ground on this side is gradual for near half a mile   the northern end is two hundred and fortynine paces in length with two openings therein defended by moles of earth similar to those on the eastern quarter and as the ground here is flat for a considerable distance so this part of the entrenchment was by nature rendered inaccessible from the north by a deep morass   the western side is similar to those before described being two hundred and seventyeight paces in length standing on a swift descent which falls without intermission for half a mile or upwards   the southern end is in length one hundred and eightyone paces has its openings and moles as before described but stands on the brink of a precipice of considerable height  on the highest ground within the entrenchment is a large mound of earth of a square figure arising from the plane near three perpendicular feet and in circumference fiftythree paces  we have no account of this entrenchment in history and are left to conjecture to what people it might belong  as it lies on the roman road it strikes one with an apprehension that it was of roman original but the singularity of the passes and mounds which guard them do not correspond with their usual mode of fortifying a camp though the interior mound may be well esteemed the praetorium from the conflicts between the northern english and the normans after the conquest and preceding williams ceding cumberland to the scots this place may be conceived to have been a camp of one of those powers  as we traveled from hence for several miles all around was one continued scene of melancholy  the hills increasing in height the valleys deepning and growing more desolate  the wind sounded amongst the rocks whilst a heavy vapor in some parts clouded their summits in others driving rain was seen streaming along the dells and shrowding their gloomy recesses  the wearied mind of the traveller endeavors to evade these objects and please itself with the fancied images of verdant plains of streams and happy groves to which we were approaching  whilst we were thus engaged unexpectedly the scene opened and from such a horrid wild gave us a prospect as delightful as the other was disgusting  over a rugged and rocky foreground we looked upon stainmoredale in front her verdant meadows cheared the eye her sweet sequestered cottages her grassy plains and little shades of sycamores seemed enchanting as their beauties were enhanced by the deformity from which they had escaped on the right hand a mountain arises emersing its gray head and naked brow in clouds the sides are barren rocks in whose chinks here and there a few shrubs are seen clinging and cast a teint of green to variegate the stormbleached precipice  on a wild and forlorn situation in an opening on the side of a mountain hellbeck hall is discovered covered with trees the place seems calculated for discontent and hidden from all that is cheerful in the world is befitted to a mind of disappointment and despair all its prospect is barrenness the voice of water falls of breezes mourning in the branches of the copse or hissing on the fissures of the rock its music dayexcluding shadows make it gloomy and overhanging vapors damp and dreary   yet hellbeck has its beauties  it contrasts with the vale beneath where the far outstretching plain reaches to the very bounds of cumberland whose lofty mountains were seen from our then station tinged with blue vapors and mixing their summits with the sky  in the fore ground lays brough whose ancient castle formerly the seat of pembrokes affords a noble object around which rich meadows dressed in the brightest green and fresh verdure after mowing plots of ripening corn sparkling sheets of water seen through the trees which deck their margins the windings of each brook little groves of ash and sycamore fantastically dispersed and intermixed with villages and cots form the beauties of the vale on this hand extending toward kirbv steven on that to dufton and in front as far as penrith beacon  as we begun to descend the hill toward brough and leave stainmores desert we passed near an ancient roman fortification called maiden castle  the roman road has led immediately through it it forms a square and has been built of stone  each side of this square is forty paces in length and is defended by outworks the nearest being a small ditch with a breastwork of large stones set erect and the outward one a ditch and mound of earth  this place has been of great strength in former times from its natural situation commanding the pass from brough  the ascent on the side opposite to brough is very steep for upwards of a mile to the south it is inaccessible by reason of the precipice on whose brink it stands and toward the north the ground is every where rugged and mountainous camden writes that a little lower upon the romans high street there stood a little fort of the romans built four square which at this day they call maiden castle from whence as the borderers reported the way went with many windings in and out as far as caer vorrau in northumberland     the night was spent at brough  fatigue gives a relish beyond what the sons of ease can possibly experience in the midst of their luxury beds of down are only conscious of anxiety and weariness to restless ambition and greatness the peasant breathing health from his labors sleeps emparadised on his bed of contentment and chaff  brough is now divided into two small mean towns the one called church brough the other market brough separated by a little brook which falls into the river eden  husbandry is very little advanced here the management of grass land is the farmers whole excellence the meadows being kept in good order and very wealthy  the inhabitants are ignorant of men and manners but subtle and crafty  on parties of pleasure time should never be limited  to ride post through a country is too much the custom of travelers by which they can reap no more than a general idea of it  the speculalative traveller is never confined to roads times or seasons but as the circumstances exciting his curiosity lay either to the right or left he pursues the objects of his attention without regard to hours or rules  the pleasantness of the morning called us very early from brough  the dawn advanced with a deep calm  the clouds broke from the hills and drew their gray veil from the face of morning revealing her in blushes  all the valley lay wrapped in stillness  care and industry had not departed from their nights recesses  the ear was hushed and all around seemed to be the region of tranquillity  ere it was long various sounds grew on the sense and the living landscape gave us new pleasures where the busy cottagers were all abroad in the several occupations of the field  as we pursued our journey at an opening of the road to the left we viewed the ruins of brough castle in former times this was a formidable fortress and said to be of roman construction the building to the eastern side is semicircular and seems to be of modern architecture but to the west there remains a noble tower apparently of great antiquity and built in the form and style of other roman edifices in the north of england the whole castle stands on a very considerable eminence arising swiftly from the plain and by its outworks shows it to have been a place of great strength  in the beginning of the last century it was repaired by the countess of pembroke who made it her residence this appeared by an this inscription was in all respects similar to one put up on a like occasion by the countess of pembroke on skipton castle which runs as follows this skipton castle was repaired by the lady anne clifford countess dowager of penbroke dorse and montgomery baroness clifford westmoreland and vesey lady of the honor of skipton in craven and high sheriffess by inheritance of the county of westmoreland in the years      and      after the main part of it had lain ruinous ever since december      and the january following when it was then pulled down and demolished almost to the ground by the command of the parliament then sitting at westminster because it had been a garrison in the then civil wars in england  isaiah cha    ver     gods name be praised   inscription that lately stood over the south entrance which also described that it had suffered by fire and laid in ruins above a century preceding the stone which contained this inscription some few years ago fell down and was destroyed  as the sun advanced he gave various beauties to the scene  the beams streaming through the divisions in the mountains showed us their due perspective and striped the plain with gold  the light falling behind the castle presented all its parts perfectly to us  through the broken windows distant objects were discovered  the front ground laid in shadows camden describing this country says here eden does as it were make stay with his stream to give meeting unto other petty rivers upon one of which scarce two miles from eden itself stood verterae a town of ancient memory mentioned by antonine the emperor and the book of notices in which it is said that in the declining age of the roman empire a roman captain with a band of the directores were stationed there but now the town is decayed and become a small poor village defended by a little fortress and the name turned into burgh for it is commonly called burgh under stanmore for in the late emperors time little castles suited to warfare and furnished with stores of corn began to be called burgs i have read nothing singular of that burg but that in the beginning of the norman government the northern english conspired here against william the conqueror that this burg was verterae i dare venture to affirm because its distance from lavatrae on the one side and from brovonacam on the other being reduced into italian miles exactly agrees with antonines numbers and further by reason of the roman high street as yet apparent by its ridges lead this way to brovonacum by aballaba    on the left the prospect was shut in by a range of craggy mountains on whose steeps shrubs and trees were scattered  to the right a fertile plain was extended surmounted by distant hills over their summits the retiring vapors as they fled the valley dragged their watery skirts and gave a solemn gloom to that part of the scene behind the building the lofty promontary of wilbore fell lifted its brow tinged with an azure hue and terminated the view  half mankind know nothing of the beauties of nature and waste in indolence and sleep the glorious scene which advancing morning presents  as we past on the varied prospect kept attention exerted  at the distance of a mile from brough the village of warkup to the left affords an agreeable view  warkup hall shrouded with a rich wood of sycamores overtops the village the verdure of the meadows with some extensive fields of yellow corn contrasted by the hills of pasture grounds which lay on the southern side brown with the summer heat and tufted with brushwood gave a pleasing variety whilst the morning beam breaking aslant upon the valley and glistening on the brook with the blue teints of smoke that arose from the hamlets painted the rural scene  we were furnished with ideas which still rendered the prospect more pleasing as they reminded us of the social spirit of the owner of warkup in whose life hospitality and benevolence are truly characterised  the valley now growing more extensive increased its varieties and pleased us with a new scene of advancing cultivation and husbandry the large tracts of ground which we past along were lately common but are now dividing and forming into enclosures  at the sixth milestone we stopped to admire the singularity of the view to the right where a range of mountains arising from the extensive plain over which we were traveling stretched to the westward and afforded a romantic and noble scene the nearest hills with rocky brows and barren cliffs raised their gray fronts above the brushwood which girted them in the midst whilst their feet in hasty slopes descended into the vale in pasturage further retiring from the eye the mountain called cross fell with a front of naked stones overtops all the adjoining hills being said to exceed the mountain of skiddow one hundred and ten perpendicular feet in height  further extending westward the chain of mountains lay in perspective till they died away upon the sight and in azure hue seemed to mix with the sky whilst at the foot of this vast range of hills three smaller mounts of an exact conic form running parallel beautified the scene being covered with verdure to their crowns the nearest called dufton pike was shadowed by a passing cloud save only the summit of its cone which was touched by a beam that pointed it with gold  the second pike was all enlightened and gave its verdure to the prospect as if mantled with velvet  the third laid shadowed whilst all the range of hills behind were struck with the sunshine showing their cliffs their caverns and their dells in strange and grotesque variety and giving the three pikes a picturesque projection on the landscape  as if nature delighted to charm the eye of man she at this time cast an accidental beauty over the scene the small clouds which chequered the sky as they passed along spread their flitting shadows on the distant mountains and seemed to marble them a beauty which i do not recollect has struck any painter and which has not been described even by the bold hand of the immortal pousin the most exquisite fancy of a painter could not have devized a more pleasing variety of light and shadow than what was cast upon this prospect  appleby to which we now approached though placed on a very elevated situation was concealed from our view till we arrived within half a mile when from the hill which we had ascended it gave us an agreeable surprise on the brink of a lofty eminence fronting toward the east at whose foot runs the river eden the castle presented itself the steep on whose brow this noble edifice is erected is richly clothed with wood save only where a rugged cliff of a red hue breaks through the trees and gives an agreeable variety to the landscape  the front of the castle which presented itself is irregular and antique but loses great share of its beauty by the joints of the building being whitened and bedaubed with lime over this front the top of a fine square tower is discovered whose corners arise in turrets the landscape to the left is richly wooded  to the right it is divided by hanging gardens which adjoin to the town overtopped with the dwellings the pavillions belonging to the house of john robinson esquire with the parterres and sloping plots of grass ground modernize a scene which condemns all factitiousness of taste and by the simplicity and elegance nature presents to us on the adjoining lands reproves the distortions which she receives from dull right lines and angles  but whilst i censure fashion i revere the owner of the mansion whose excellencies are too eminent to want the travellers applause  as we approached the bridge and cast our eyes up the valley we were delighted with the happy assemblage of woods and meadows which form the little vale where the eden flows through the thronging branches the water was seen in many places reflecting a tremulous beam and sparkling in the suns rays  over the valley red cliffs and rocks on this hand appear projecting through the trees on that is seen the lofty front of the castle  the prospect from the terrace which is under the eastern front of the castle is very beautiful  to the right the river eden forms a winding lake for the distance of half a mile whose banks are clothed with lofty hanging woods descending in a swift but regular sweep to the brink of the stream below us the water murmured over a wear where a mill added to the pleasing sounds on the left red cliffs and precipices arise perpendicular from the water over whose brows oaks and ashes hanging render their aspect more romantic by the solemn shade  on the ground above the public road leading to appleby winds up the hill on whose sides some cottages are scattered whilst all behind mountains form the distant ground shadowed with clouds camden writes that aballaba of which mention is made in the book of notices has hitherto kept the ancient name so well that it proves itself beyond a doubt for we call it short appleby instead of aballaba it is memorable for its antiquity and situation in the romans time the aurelian maures kept a station there its site is pleasant as it stands almost encompassed by the river eden but it is so slenderly inhabited and the buildings are so simple that were it not for its antiquity from whence it deserved to be accounted the chief town of the shire and to have sessions and assize kept in the castle which is the common goal for malefactors it would be little better than a village all its beauty lies in one broad street which from north to south rises with an easy ascent of the hill     whilst we stayed here enjoying this sweet scene i could not forbear pointing out to my companion a little tenement which stood opposite to us near to the brink of the river where the fairest maid resides that graces edens banks  stately and tall she seems the lilly of edens garden whilst she is fair and meek as lillies too in her countenance beauty is graced with intelligence and in her behavior innocence is mixed with politeness  the garden grounds around appleby castle are without ornament and are calculated for use only on the western side detached from the rest of the edifice is a very lofty square tower which the people call caesars tower and which from its form appears to be roman  the corners form a projection of near a foot from the plane of each front and rise above the rest of the building in square turrets now covered with lead the remaining part of the top being embrasured  there are two small windows on each front near the middle of the building parallel to each other this tower is defended by an outward wall forming a kind of crescent at the distance of about twelve paces now remaining near twenty feet in height strongly sustained on the outside by butrasses erected on an eminence thirty paces in ascent and defended by a deep ditch without  the quarter fronting to the castle lies open to the area which is enclosed by a wall continuing from the points of the crescent  the great hall is worthy the observation of travelers there being enclosed in a case in the wainscot a fine piece of portrait painting of the pembroke family ornamented with their pedigree and historical notes of their lives and achievements  a stranger is from thence conducted through an adjoining room where the ragged remains of embroidered furniture give you a most deplorable idea of decaying magnificence and the vanity of pride when the doors of a closet being suddenly thrown open you are startled from your reverie by the shaking of armor and the sight of a complete suit trembling in every joint  this armor is preserved with great attention as having been worn by the last earl of westmoreland who has been a man of very small stature  the arms are richly embossed and inlaid with gold  in its ichnography this castle is not much unlike to the ruins of brough the towers being detached from the main edifice and placed to the west  appleby castle is one of the seats of the earl of thanet but of late years has been much neglected by the family  lord thanet is hereditary sheriff of the county of westmoreland and is entitled to many noble privileges there some of which in this age of liberty and cultivation are rather oppressive his free chase in particular  the great possessions of the countess of pembroke in this country came into the thanet family in the following manner  john earl of thanet succeeded his mother margaret countess of thanet as baron of clifford westmoreland and vesey in the year      and in the year      he also succeeded his cousin the lady aliathea sole daughter and heir of james earl of northampton by his first wife the lady isabella his mothers sister whereby he became possessed of the whole inheritance of his grandmother the countess of pembroke collings peerage   the town of appleby chiefly consists of one wide continued street hanging upon the swift decline of a hill in a direction north and south the castle terminating it on the summit the church at the foot  the situation is delightful in the summer season but in the winter very cold the natural disadvantages of its site being increased by the great searcity of coal to supply which want wood and peats are chiefly used as fuel  the meadows and pasture grounds are beautiful but there is little tillage it having been a received opinion for ages past that grain would not ripen or come to perfection so near the moors and mountains from whence a continued moist vapor is borne into the valley which blights the corn in its blossom or prevents it filling or maturing but this absurdity is declining through experience which has taught the inhabitants that the want of knowledge in agriculture was all the defect  this is a very ancient borough and by prescription sends two members to parliament  it is the county town but is not blessed with a situation for trade  the markets are not populous the country adjoining by reason of its extensive wastes and uncultivated lands being thinly inhabited  this is a corporation town and is governed by a mayor aldermen and common council  the late conflicts in political matters have enriched the inhabitants the contested election for this borough having bestowed upon the burgage owners many thousands of pounds  the place where the judges of assize sit in judgment on criminals is very antique and remarkable  by the arms placed on one of the corner pillars it appears to have been erected by the pembroke family  it is situate in the marketplace fronting to the north is opened on the sides by a rude balustrade and in the front is supported by pillars so that it may be truly said the judge sits dispensing justice in the forum  the buildings in this place are chiefly ancient some few modern houses of red free stone which have a remarkable fine effect are interspersed near the summit of the hill stands an obelisk a pillar of the ionick order arising on some few steps on the base of which is cut this remarkable inscription  preserve your liberties maintain your rights it seems to be placed there as a public satire on the conduct of the burgage owners and to say hither and no further the conflagration of public virtue advanced  as it had its origin in the contested elections it excites a smile of derision on the countenance of the traveller to whose mind it renews the odious ideas of the corruptions of this age  in the midst of the town to the disgrace of the corporation stands a filthy slaughterhouse and shambles  there is a school amply endowed belonging to this place in the upper part of this place says camden stands the castle aloft almost wholly environed by the eden at the foot of the town stands the church near to which is a school founded by robert langton and miles spencer doctors of laws reginald bainbrig is the present master a learned man who governs the same with great applause  it was not for nothing that william of newborough called this town and burgh princely holds where he writes that william king of scots surprised them a little before the time he was himself taken prisoner at anwick which king john afterward having recovered gave to robert vipoint in consideration of his singular services to him and the state    before the door of the schoolhouse some roman altars are placed amongst these antiquities one reginald bainbrig has given a memorial of his folly to posterity by some inscriptions in antique characters to celebrate his own memory in which at least his latin inelegance qui docuit hic might have been spared  the road which we pursued from appleby for several miles gave us great pleasure the valleys through which the river eden runs are singularly beautiful their woody banks and level meads afforded a variety of landscapes particularly below crackenthorp  we passed by kirby thore where no remains of ancient roman grandeur spoken of by camden are now to be found  acorn bank the seat of william norton esquire and temple sowerby laid also in our way of which we were told nothing memorable but that there remained to this day a pecuniary mulct paid to the lord of the manor in lieu of his custom with each bride within his jurisdiction  it is an extraparochial place and from its ancient owners the knights templars enjoyed many privileges which are now obsolete  we passed whinfield park an extensive forest the property of the earl of thanet where we had the pleasure of viewing a large tract of ground lately enclosed from the park growing corn nothing can give greater satisfaction to the eye of the traveller than to behold cultivation and industry stretching their paces over the heath and waste the forest and the chase  population must follow and riches ensue  in whinfield the remains of an ancient oak of prodigious size is shown to strangers called three brother tree a name arising from the concealment of three brethren within its cavity  on the way side a shattered trunk of an oak called white heart tree is seen a cotemporary perhaps of the other though inferior in size  the monument of elapsed centuries and the effigy of old age stretching forth its withered limbs on one side and on the other a scanty foliage and poor remnant of life this tree is nine yards and two feet in circumference  a stone pillar erected by the side of the road next attracted our attention near to which was placed a stone table the stalk of the pillar is sexagon the top of it square on the sides of this square are represented in several quarterings the arms of the pembrokes a south dial and the following inscription  this pillar was erected anno domini      by the right honble ann countess dowager of pembroke etc daughter and sole heiress of the right honble george earl of cumberland for a memorial of her last parting in this place with her good and pious mother the right honble mary countess dowager of cumberland the  d of april      in memory whereof she also left an annuity of  l to be distributed to the poor of the parish of brougham every  d day of april for ever upon the stone table here hard by laus deo  we quitted the high road in order to pass by brougham castle a spacious ruin situate on the banks of the river yeoman  that we might enjoy the prospect to advantage we crossed over the river and made a sweep round the mill which stands almost opposite to brougham from thence the view opened upon us delightfully   the mill with its streams lay on the fore ground to the left  a beautiful and shining canal formed by the river yeoman margined with shrubs laid spreading to the right  in front the streams which fell over the wear made a foaming cascade immediately on the opposite brink of the channel arises brougham castle  three square towers projecting but yet connected with the building form the front  from thence on either side a little wing falls back some paces to the north east a thick grove of planes and ashes blocks up the passage and the gateway  to the south west the walls stretch out to a considerable distance along a sine grassy plain of pasture ground terminated by a tower one of the outposts of the castle  in the center of the building arises a lofty square tower frowning in gothic strength and gloomy pomp  the shattered turrets which had formed the angles and the hanging gallery which had communicated with each were grown with shrubs and waving brambles  the sun beams which struck each gasping loup and bending window discovered the inward devastation and ruin and touched the whole with admirable coloring and beauty to grace the landscape fine groups of cattle were dispersed on the pasture and through the tufts of ash trees which were irregularly dispersed on the back ground distant mountains were seen skirting the horizon  the lower apartment in the principal tower is still remaining entire being covered with a vaulted roof of stone consisting of eight arches which as they spring from the side walls are supported and terminate on a pillar in the center  the apartment mentioned to have been in bows castle was assuredly of the same architecture as appears from the remains of the groins still projecting from the walls there together with part of the elevation of the centric pillar camden says the roman way goes straight into the west by whinfield a large park shaded by trees hard by brovoniacum standing twenty italian miles or seventeen english miles from verterae as antonine notes it who has also called it brocovum the book of notices styles it broconiacum which expresses that a company or band of defensores were stationed here time has consumed the beauty and buildings of this town yet the name remains almost uncorrupted for it is called at this day brougham     having now entered the county of of cumberland and passing on behind carlton the seat of james wallace esquire the eye wandered with delight over a fine cultivated country from whence we had a distant view of the rich valley of lowther decked with noble and extensive woods  as we approached to penrith the mountains and piles of rocks which stand on hullswater afforded an august scene  and at the termination of the road the ruins of penrith castle presented themselves  the genius the virtue and industry of the owner of these rich lands which we were then passing arose to our thoughts  the benevolent mind must ever be touched with pleasure when the meritorious man is rewarded in this world for his excellence  penrith is an agreeable town situate on the easy decline of a hill to the southward  it is unchartered being governed by the steward of the honor and a jury  a confiderable manufactory of cotton and linen checks is carried forward here  the houses in general are well built and the inhabitants are facetious and polite  the name of this place is derived from the color of the hills near it penroeth being in the ancient british language a red hill  here we met with the utmost civility every one we addressed showing themselves ready to give us all the information in their power of what was curious in the country  our first excursion from penrith was to mount the steep hill on which the beacon is placed upwards of a mile to the northward of the town  the labor was great by which we ascended this mount but the view from thence amply rewarded our fatigue  the beacon house is a square building of stone and is happily situated for the purpose of alarming the country in times of public danger as it commands a very extensive vale   the northern window of the beacon kouse affords a prospect of cross fell with the pikes of dufton together with a chain of mountains extending from east to west near thirty miles which on the western point sink in the spacious plain where the city of carlisle lies the utmost bounds of this view are formed by a ridge of scotch mountains  some faint appearance of st marys church marks to the eye the site of carlisle   the eastern window presented to us a view of the country we had passed bounded by the hills of stainmore and the lofty promontary of wilborefell above kirby stephen with its neighboring mountains   the south window returned to us the view of brougham castle with its plains of pasture ground  the spreading woods of lowther intermixed with rich cultivated lands form the rising grounds  some parts of the lake of hullswater are seen whilst the mighty rocks and mountains which hemn in the lake lift up their heads in rude confusion and crown the scene   the western window affords a new and not less pleasing prospect  the town of penrith lay before us and here and there the river yeoman showed its windings through its woods  the hill which rises above the town is crowned with the awful remains of a royal fortress  time has despoiled its grandeur but its honors still survive to its noble owner the duke of portland who therewith holds the honor of penrith formerly a royal franchise  beyond these objects amongst a range of mountains at the distance of eighteen miles skiddow is seen with his majestic front surmounting all the high lands that terminate the view   the whole prospect from the beacon hill as you turn every way presents you with a vast theater upwards of one hundred miles in circumference circled with stupendous mountains  common justice requires that in whatever station of life merit is discovered it should receive a degree of praise proportioned to its excellence  from this universal principle which benevolence delights to cherish i must not pass in silence the deserts of our penrith host  the common conduct of publicans prepossesses the mind of the traveller when he enters an inn with the unfavourable idea that your host is an unfeeling extortioner impertinent curious and imposing  whoever shall visit penrith either on business or pleasure will find the keeper of the white swan the very reverse  a man above his rank in sentiments above his fellows in propriety of manners his house commodious and clean his provisions excellent and his attendance prompt and not impertinent  our second excursion from penrith was by lowther to the lake of hullswater  we passed the village of clifton memorable for the skirmish on the   th day of december      between the duke of cumberlands forces and the rebels  on the approach to clifton from lowther the way which the dukes forces advanced lies clifton moor a spacious common descending with an easy slope toward the village  on the western side of this moor the road is situate within twenty yards of the enclosures which are fenced by hedges and stone walls from whence the rebels begun firing on the dukes horse and made some slaughter  to the east the land descends to some swamps with small enclosures at the foot of which is a narrow dark lane passable for no more than one horseman at a time near this place general honeywood received those marks of savage barbarity which had nearly cost him his life  a little detached from the village stands a cottage where the rebel captain hamilton with some others had concealed themselves this being discovered one of the dukes hussars with great dexterity attacked the house and riding round it fired several shot in at the window which did some execution and obliged hamilton to show himself when there began a single combat between two equally expert in horsemanship and the use of arms in which hamilton was taken prisoner after giving and receiving many wounds   a train of melancholy sentiments flowed in upon the mind on passing the ground rendered famous to posterity by battles and slaughter  when rebellion adds its horrid die to darken the retrospection the soul recoils at the sad and unnatural scene and tears start from the eye to weep the sins of fell ambition and the pride of man  we visited the present works of sir james lowther to which he is pleased to give the name of the village the buildings of which are of stone handsomely sashed and covered with blue slate  our approach was at the eastern end where the work there proceeding formed a crescent behind which the other buildings are thrown in squares  the design on which the proprietor is building this beautiful place is to entertain a number of linen manufacturers the erections being calculated for that purpose with proper apartments for the directors and governors of such a work  by the appearance of the place it seems as if it would be capable of receiving a thousand artists  the utility and greatness of this project are too manifest to require the travellers animadversions enough it is to say that such works under the auspiecs of such men give the observer infinite pleasure the distances between the rich and poor in this luxurious and proud age have been too distinctly maintained  the wealth and felicity of this nation depends upon the intimate connection between property and trade  where opulence is diffused in works to bless the industrious poor in projects to promote manufactory and arts panegyric is silenced by that inward approbation and esteem which leads the mind to regard such virtue in the character of the rich man with reverence   we passed along from this agreeable scene to a place called the college from its having been formerly the residence of the preceptors of the lowther family where our admiration was enlarged by the princely works there carried on at the sole expense of sir james we obtained admission to inspect the carpet manufactory which is there conducted in the manner of the goblines  it is not possible to convey any competent idea of the beauty of this work by description  the shag thrown up on the face of the carpeting is about half an inch in thickness which renders it so durable that a new erected mansion would not outstand such furniture the colors are disposed with the utmost taste and judgment in representation of natural flowers as delicate easy and just as the works of the pencil  we were so fortunate as to see in the looms some carpets of peculiar beauty the one was wrought on a coppercoloured ground scattered with sprigs of flowers the other was on a violet ground  the roses and convolvulus the jesmines and carnations were exquisite  they looked like fresh pulled flowers thrown upon velvet their disposition was in the happiest taste and the colors were given to form the most agreeable changes and variety  the master of this work in an open and polite manner conducted us not omitting one circumstance which he apprehended could add to our pleasure in the inspection  the spinning for this work is done by children from the foundling hospital  tears of pleasure gushed upon the eye to behold these poor orphans who would otherwise perhaps have been totally lost to the world and to themselves thus by so excellent a charity saved from the hands of destruction and vice rendered useful members of society and happy in their industry and innocence   the carpet manufactory is carried on solely for sir jamess pleasure and not for sale we were informed that some little time ago a piece of this work was presented to her majesty  passing from the college we desended the banks of the river lowther whose woody scenes are every where picturesque and pleasing   in this path how long soever the wanderer roves each step shall wake fresh beauties each short point present a different picture new and yet the same masons garden     the beauties of the prospect at askam bridge engaged our attention  the water descending over a rockey channel fell in irregular and foaming streams  the little plain above was dressed in the brightest green the lofty banks on every hand were clothed with stately oaks save only where a bold promontary which overhung the road where we had passed showed its rocky brow from out the shade which crowned its threatening front  a gentleman who was so obliging as accompany us in this days excursion conducted our rout with great judgment  from lowther he caused us to ascend the hills which bordered upon hullswater so that the lake was totally concealed from us in our approach till we were just upon it   having attained the summit with no small degree of patience and fatigue it opened suddenly upon our view presenting to us a sheet of water of the form of an s nine miles in extent and greatly above a mile in width  as we looked upon it from a great eminence we could discern all its bays its shores and promontaries and in the extensive landscape take in a vast variety of objects thrown together with all that beauty which wood and water lawns rising sweeps of corn villas villages and cots surmounted by immense mountains and rude cliffs can form to the eye  the country to the right for many miles was variegated in the finest manner by enclosures woods and villas amongst which graystock dacre and delmain were seen whilst to the left nothing but stupendous mountains and rude projecting rocks presented themselves to the sight vying with each other for grandeur and eminence  we descended to the village of pooley and from thence by a winding road on the margin of the lake passed on for near a mile to a small inn where we left our horses  we were accommodated on the water with one of the barges belonging to the duke of portland which have been sent there by his grace for pleasuring  a strong south breeze rendered the lake so rough that the surf broke over the bow whilst the swell gave us motion almost equal to that felt at sea  my companion suffered no small mortification by this accident at it incommoded him much in drawing views of this admirable scene  we were obliged to coast it up the lake to keep as much under the wind as possible the labor being very great to make any way with four boatmen at the oars   as we took the boat there stood to our right a mountain almost perfectly circular covered with verdure to the crown arising swiftly from the edge of the water many hundred feet in height and shadowing us from the sun  to the left the lake spread out its agitated bosom whitened with innumerable breakers much above a mile in breadth whose opposite shore in one part ascended gradually with cultivated lands from the village of pooley skirting the hills over which some scattered wood was happily disposed in irregular groves and winding lines whilst all above the brown heath reached the summits  this land adjoined to a mountain much superior in height to that upon our right rising almost perpendicular from the lake with naked cliffs on its rugged side through the gray rocks was torn a passage for a rivulet whose waters fell precipitate with a mighty noise into the deep below  the ground more distant which was seen still upwards over an expanse of water not less than four miles consisted of lofty rocks and bold promontaries here and there showing naked and stormbleached cliffs and in other places scattered over with the spring of young oaks arising from the stoves of trees which the ax had lately slain  we could not forbear lamenting the loss of so great an ornament to this romantic scene as a forest of timber trees hanging on these declivities must have been from this and every other point of view on the lake  as we passed along having doubled two small capes we fell into a bay under the seat of john robinson esquire of water mellock  from the very margin of the lake in this part the grass ground ascended gradually in an easy slope where were dispersed in an agreeable irregularity pretty groves of ash there  many a glade is found the haunt of wood gods only where if art ever dared to tread twas with unsandald feet printless as if the place was holy ground masons garden     above which the easy inclining hills showed us yellow fields of corn overtopped by the white front of a venerable mansion more noted for its hospitality than for the elegance of its structure   the pleasantness of this bay the verdure of the newmown meads with the shade of the grove induced us to take our noontide repast there   whilst we sat to regale the barge put off from shore to a station where the finest echoes were to be obtained from the surrounding mountains  the vessel was provided with six brass cannon mounted on swivels  on the discharge of one of these pieces the report was echoed from the opposite rocks where by reverberation it seemed to roll from cliff to cliff and return through every cave and valley till the decreasing tumult gradually died away upon the ear   the instant it had ceased the sound of every distant waterfall was heard but for an instant only for the momentary stillness was interrupted by returning echo on the hills behind us where the report was repeated like a peal of thunder bursting over our heads continuing for several seconds flying from haunt to haunt till once more the sound gradually declined  again the voice of waterfalls possessed the interval  till to the right the more distant thunder arose upon some other mountain and seemed to take its way up every winding dell and creek sometimes behind on this side or on that in wondrous speed running its dreadful course  when the echo reached the mountains within the line and channel of the breeze it was heard at once on the right hand and left at the extremities of the lake  in this manner was the report of every discharge reechoed seven times distinctly   at intervals we were relieved from this entertainment which consisted of a kind of wondrous tumult and grandeur of confusion by the music of two french horns whose harmony was repeated from every recess which echo haunted on the borders of the lake  here the breathings of the organ were imitated there the bassoon with clarinets  in this place from the harsher sounding cliffs the cornet  in that from the wooded creek amongst the caverns and the trilling water falls you seemed to hear the sosttoned lute accompanied with the languishing strains of enamoured nymphs whilst in the copse and grove was still retained the music of the horns  all this vast theater seemed to be possessed by innumerable aerial beings who breathed celestial harmony   as we finished our repast from a general discharge of the guns we were roused to new astonishment for although we had heard with great surprise the former echoes this exceeded them so much that it seemed incredible for on every hand the sounds were reverberated and returned from side to side so as to give us the semblance of that confusion and horrid uproar which the falling of these stupendous rocks would occasion if by some internal combustion they were rent to pieces and hurled into the lake  during the time of our repast the wind was hushed and the lake which on our first entrance was troubled and foaming now became like a shining mirror reflecting reversed mountains and rocks groves meads and vales  the water was so transparent that we could perceive the fish and pebbles at the depth of six or eight fathom  we now doubled a woody promontary and passing by the foot of gobery park ascended into the narrow part of the lake leaving the grassy margins and the scattered copse which had bordered the water as we past by water mellock now all around us being one scene of mountains which hemmed us in arising with awful and precipitate fronts  here the white cliffs raised their pointed heads there the shaken and rifted rocks were split and cavated into vast shelves chasms and dreary cells which yawned upon the shadowed lake whilst other steeps less rugged were decked with shrubs which grew on every plain and chink their summits being embrowned with sunparched moss and herbage   the scene was nobly awful as we approached to starbury crag  at every winding of our passage new hills and rocks were seen to overlook those which had but the minute before been new upon our prospect the clouds hung heavily upon the mountains rolling in gloomy volumes over their heads in some places dragging their ragged skirts along the sides of the steeps giving them a deep and melancholy shade in others admitting the sun beams which illuminated the winding dells with a greyish light   we saw within some little distance of the shore a sulphurine spring  we were sorry to find this valuable gift of nature remained unanalized and neglected by the neighboring gentlemen it appeared to be much of the nature of harrowgate spaw and is said to have shown excellent medicinal qualities to those who have used it   the fishermen belonging to mr robinson were so obliging as to make us two draughts but we were not fortunate enough to take any very large fish  we drew trout perch and skelley which last is a kind of fresh water herring all of which were of excellent flavor  they sometimes take a trout peculiar to this water of thirty pounds weight and upwards and eels of eight or nine pounds   after a voyage of upwards nine miles we returned passing down the center of the lake we had again arrived opposite to the woody promontary which joins to the extreme of the cultivated lands of water mellock when the view down the lake opened upon us   the meadows the groves the mountains and the rocks which environed the lake were disposed in the most picturesque order bending around the margin of an expanse of water of five miles over  the lands of water mellock now laid at a distance to the left surmounted by some small conic hills the heights of gobery park that ranged westward and terminated by the grassy mountain at whose foot we passed upon ourentrance  these sweetly intermingled groves corn fields and meads gently inclining to the lake where they sunk on the grassy margin or stretched into easy promontaries now lay in the happiest arrangement  to the right were the rocky steeps down which the foaming cataract was hurried from whence the upstretching enclosures upon gradual declinations formed the more distant hills above which from hanging groves that overlooked each other some blue rocks crowned with brown heath appeared  at the extreme of this sine crescent stood mount dunmorlet of a most beautiful conic form covered from its skirts to the crown with oaks ashes and firs fortunately mingled at whose foot the single arch of pooley bridge the outlet of all this mighty lake appeared bending over a little valley where some few cottages were scattered over which at the extremity of the dale penrith beacon formed a pleasing obelisque  the beauties of this scene were increased by the reflection given in the water where the deep green hue was seen to mix with the olive and the gray of the adjoining objects whilst the back ground seemed to decline in faintest purple variegated with the deep crimson streaks of an evening sky   we hung upon our oars some time reluctant to quit this prospect and enjoying the music of the horns  the exquisite softness and harmony which the echoes produced here were not to be described  the music seemed to issue from some resounding temple which stood concealed behind the mountains where the most solemn and delicate symphony was heard as if reverberated from the brazen dome or marble colonades and as the breeze at intervals grew softer one might imagine the voices of a thousand choiristers had filled the lengthened chorus   it happened fortunately for us that the sun some short time before setting shone out serene  we made a little turn to look back upon the dark and rocky scene which we had passed when the vapor which had for some time almost covered the mountains with a gloomy veil appeared to roll up upon the breeze like a mighty curtain and withdrew opening gradually to the eye the pompous theater  no sooner were these cumbrous volumes lifted above the summits of the western hills than the horizontal rays broke in upon the mountains the grass on these heights which had been parched and turned of a russet hue received the light in a delicate manner becoming a rich shade to the bright gold teints with which the sun beams passing through the evening vapor struck the cliffs as the slantway rays pierced each valley and interstice of the mountains here beaming over a whole hill there tinging the tops of rocks and catching the edges of the precipice with the luster of burnished gold whilst the deep shades of every vale each dell chasm and cave heightened the coloring above  in the water we traced all this picturesque scene inverted the long and deep shadows thrown from the mountains over the lake made the objects which were thus illumined be most beautifully reflected on this mirror of sable   here the mind was touched with pious and reverential thoughts which alone delight in silence whilst contemplation dwells on the mighty author of such wondrous works to whom it is acceptable that the heart of man seeking him in such scenes as these should pay that adoration which no language can express   approaching night rouzed us from our rhapsodies the clouds above our heads were deeply tinged with crimson and the whole lake as we proceeded on our voyage seemed to glow with a fine carnation  as the sun still descended the vapors which hung with a gray hue over the hills now assumed a flame color and seemed to wind up a multitude of glowing streams in the most grotesque figures whilst all below was sinking from the eye into a solemn confusion  the whole range of mountains appearing as if on fire the images of ovid immediately occurred to my memory  caucasus ardet ossaque cum pindo majorq ambobus olimpus aeriaeque alps and nubifer apenninus   we regained the little inn at the foot of dunmorlet where our horses waited for us and returned toward penrith delighted with our voyage in our conversation enumerating the wondrous and enchanting scenes to which we had been present till we reached delmain the seat of j hazell esquire  the rich woods which are spread around this mansion together with its handsome stonebuilt front gave us expectation whilst we saw it in the morning at a distance that it would be still more pleasing on a nearer view but we could not forbear turning our eyes away in disappointment when we perceived the approach and court kept no better than a stableyard  a little ramble took place in the ensuing morning  in our way we were shown the tenement in which by the great tempest some few years ago miss bolton and her female friend were overwhelmed in the ruins of their house  over whose untimely monument even piety lets fall a tear and resignation bows to heaven with sights whilst hope in holy whispers tells that innocence and virtue called from hence become angelic   we viewed the ruins of penrith castle  it is said to have arose on the foundations of a roman fortress the traces of which are not now to be discovered  the buildings form a square and are situate on a rising ground surrounded with a ditch  the site toward the town is much more elevated than on any of the other quarters  this front consists of the remains of an angular tower to the east which now stands separated from the rest by the falling of the walls the center which projects a little from the plane of the front is hastening to decay presenting to the eye broken chambers passages and stairs  this part of the building is still connected with the western angular tower an open hanging gallery forming the communication  below this gallery a large opening is made by the falling of the building forming a rude arch through which and the broken walls to the east the interior parts of the ruin are perceived in a picturesque manner  nothing remains within but part of a stonearched vault which by its similitude to places of the like nature which we had formerly seen we conceived to have been the prison  from thence we went to view a place by the inhabitants called arthurs round table near to yeoman bridge and within about half a mile from penrith  this is said to be of great antiquity but there is no tradition when by whom or for what purpose it was made camden writing of penrith says not far from the confluence of eimot and lowther where is seen that round trench of earth which the country people term arthurs round table stands penrith which is if you interpret it out of the british language the read head or hill for the soil and stones there are of a reddish color but commonly cailed perith a little town of no great trade fortified on the west side with a castle of the kings which in the reign of king henry the sixth was repaired out of the ruins of a roman fort near to it called mayburgh the town is graced with a large church the marketplace is spacious with a markethouse of timber ornamented by bears at a ragged staff which was the device of the earls of warwick  in former times it belonged to the bishops of durham but when bishop anthony beck grew haughty with his too great riches king edward the first as we find in durham book took from him penrith with other places  for the use of this town william strickland bishop of carlisle at his own cost caused an aqueduct to be made out of peterrill  near to which was plumpton park a large tract of ground which the kings of england in old times used as a forest for wild beasts but king henry the eighth disparked it and wisely appointed it for the habitations of men as being in the marches near where the kingdoms of england and scotland adjoined just by this place i saw many remains of a decayed town which from its vicinity is called old penrith i for my part would judge it to be petreanie  it is said of the order of knights of the round table that it was instituted by king arthur to the end there might be no question about precedence and to teach heroic minds not to be ambitious of place but merit      it is cut in a little plain near to the river of an exact circular figure save to the eastern and western sides an approach is left on the common level of the plain  the trench which is cast up and by which it is formed is near ten paces wide the soil which has been thrown up on the outward side forms a kind of theater  the approaches are ten paces wide and the whole circle within the ditch is one hundred and sixty paces in circumference  we were induced to believe this was an ancient tilting ground where in days of chivalry tournaments had been held the approaches would answer for the career and the circle seems sufficient for the champions to show their dexterity in justing and horsemanship the whole circus being capable of receiving one thousand spectators without the ditch  it does not appear probable that this has been an intrenchment or fortified camp it being too small for such purposes and more particularly it is overlooked by an adjoining rising ground from whence it might be annoyed by missile weapons  some places similar in form have been esteemed camps fortified by the danes  at about half a mile distance we viewed a place called maybrough  this is a hill which arises gradually on every side about one hundred and forty paces from the level of the lands below forming the lower section of a regular cone  the ascent is on every side grown with oaks and ashes and seems to have been covered with wood for ages though no very ancient trees remain standing yet the relics left by the ax evince it  the summit of the hill is fenced round save only an opening to the east of twelve paces wide  the fence is very singular being composed of an immense quantity of loose pebble stones which seem to have been gathered from the river by their quality and the similarity there is between them and the gravel of the bed of the yeoman  no kind of mortar appears to have been used here the stones laid uncemented and in a heap which at the foot is near twenty paces wide rising to an edge in height at this day about eight feet from the level of the interior plain  here and there time has scattered a few trees and brushwood over the pebbles but in other places they are loose and naked both on the outside and inside of the fence  the space within is a fine plain of meadow ground exactly circular of  00 paces diameter  inclining a little to the westward from the center a large mass of unhewn stone is standing erect placed with the smaller end in the earth on which some little ash trees have taken their growth by striking their roots into the natural fissures of the stone  this stone is in circumference near its middle twentytwo feet and some inches and in height eleven feet and upwards it is a species of the free stone and has been gathered from the surface and not won in any quarry or bed of stone  the inhabitants in the neighborhood say that within the memory of man two other stones of similar nature and placed in a kind of angular figure with the stone now remaining were to be seen there but as they were hurtful to the ground had been destroyed and removed   the traditional account given of this place is in no wise to be credited that it was a roman theater where criminals had been exposed to wild beasts and that those stones were placed for the refuge and respite of the combatant in his unhappy conflict   the name of maybrough induced us to believe that this had been a british fortification and that the name was a corruption of maiden burg a title given to many fortresses which were esteemed impregnable and which were boasted never to have known a conqueror  but the large stone placed within the plain and those said to have been defaced within the memory of man confounded this conjecture and prompted us to an idea that the whole was a druidical monument and the name of it mayberie antiquarians have frequently confounded bury for berie  the one implying the tomb of some great or remarkable personage the latter berie being the name of a plain or vale surrounded with groves and forests and held sacred by the ancient britons  lord coke  or maleberge maleberge mons placiti  a hill where the people assembled at a court like our assizes which by the scots and irish are called parley hills     the elevated plain the surrounding woods and this strange rude pillar render it probable that this was a temple of the druids where under the solemn shade of the consecrated grove they had exercised their religious rites and taught the multitude and also held those convocations in which they determined the rights of the people and administered public justice  perhaps when they were driven out of mona and fled before the roman sword they might fortify their sacred places and gather their people into such strong holds to resist the power which had avowed their extirpation  we viewed the church of penrith in the afternoon a handsome new building of red free stone well galleried and ornamented in the modern style  the pillars are remarkable being one single stone the following inscription on a stone placed in the wall is singular ad mdxcviii ex gravi peste que regionibus hisce incubuit obierunt apud penrith    0 kendal   00 richmond   00 carlisle      posteri avortite vos et virite ezekiel   th        the plague raged in london in the thirtysixth year of queen elizabeths reign  in the churchyard is a very remarkable monument apparently of great antiquity  two pillars are placed in a direction east and west distant from each other fifteen feet  at the sides of the tomb two stones are placed with an edge upwards of a kind of semicircular form  these side stones do not at present show any marks of the sculptor though some have conjectured they represented boars  the pillars are of one piece formed like the ancient spears and about ten feet in height  the shafts are round for about seven feet high above which they run into a square and appear to have terminated in a point where the square point commences there are the remains of a narrow belt of ornamental frize work  the stones are so much hurt by time that it is not possible to ascertain whether the upper parts of these pillars have been adorned with figures or born any inscription  i must beg leave to dissent from the opinion of those who have presumed this was the tomb of some of the warwicks and as their reason allege these were the representations of bears and a ragged staff the device of that family i am induced to believe this is rather the monument of some british hero of distinction the custom of placing pillars at the head and foot of sepulchers is very ancient i have seen it mentioned in many of our historians that in the time of richard the first the bones of arthur the famous king of britain were said to have been found at glastonbury in an old sepulcher to denote which stood two pillars one at the head the other at the feet on which some inscription had been cut but could not then be read  in the notes to a book entitled the history of the rebellion      this monument is mentioned and said to be set up in memory of a famous old warrior sir ewen caesarius of great strength who was renowned for his exploits in inglewood forest in the destruction of wild boars  in our next excursion from penrith we past by the ancient seat of the musgraves called eden hall at the distance of three miles a stone structure built in the taste of the time of the charless  every part of the river eden which we visited was picturesque and beautiful pretty lawns and meadows and here and there fine hanging groves were dispersed on its banks whilst the borders of the channel were beautified with rocks and the stream flowed in meandrings or cascades camden tells us that eden having given eimot entertainment he turns his course northward by both the salkelds watering as he goes several obscure villages and fortresses amongst which at the less salkeld there are erected in form of a circle seventyseven stones every one ten feet high and a special one by itself before them at the very entrance rises fifteen feet in height this stone the common people dwelling near the place call long meg and the rest her daughters within this ring or circle are heaps of stones under which they say lie interred the bodies of men slain in battle and indeed there is reason to think that this was a monument of some victory there achieved for no man could conjecture that they were erected in vain     near to little salkeld on the summit of a large hill inclining a little toward the north we had the pleasure of seeing a large and perfect druidical monument called by the country people meg and her daughters   a circle of three hundred and fifty paces circumference is formed by massy stones most of which remain standing upright  these are sixtyseven in number of various qualities unhewn or touched with any tool and seem by their form to have been gathered from the surface of the earth  some are of blue and gray limestone some of granite and some flints  many of them which were standing measured from twelve to fifteen feet in girt and ten feet in height others were of an inferior size  at the southern side of this circle at the distance of seventeen paces from its nearest member is placed an upright stone naturally of a square form being a red freestone with which the country about penrith abounds  this stone is placed with one of its angles toward the circle is near fifteen feet in girt and eighteen feet high each angle of its square answering to a cardinal point  in the most contiguous part of the circle four large stones are placed in a square form as if they had constructed or supported the altar and toward the east west and north two large stones are placed a greater distance from each other than any of the rest as if they had formed the entrances into this mystic round  what creates great astonishment to the spectator is that no such stones or any quarry or bed of stones are to be found within a great distance of this place and how such massy bodies could be moved in an age when the mechanical powers were little known is not to be conceived   whilst we stood admiring this place the following thoughts occured to my memory   mark yon altar  this wide circus skirted with unhewn stone they awe my soul as if the very genius of the place himself appeared and with terrific tread stalked through this drear domain  know that thou stands on consecrated ground the mighty pile of magicplanted rock thus ranged in mystic order marks the place where but at times of holiest festival the druid leads his train masons charactacus  my ideas wandered in the fields of imagination over the druids sacrifice of the milkwhite steers consecrated by the misletoe  i reflected on the trembling enthusiastic multitudes who here perhaps had assembled to hear the priestly dictates touching government and moral conduct  to learn the druids arrogant philosophy and superstitions and cherish an implicit faith of the immortality of mans intellectual spirit though in transmigration to reptiles and beasts of prey  perhaps here princes submissively have stood to hear the haughty druid exlaim  thou art a king a sovereign over frail men i am a druid servant of the gods such service is above such sovereignty masons charactacus    in the number of stones camden was mistaken as they are only sixtyseven in all he took many of his northern remarks from hearsay only from whence he was liable to the errors discovered in him  as to the heaps of stones within the circle which he was told covered those slain in fight there is not the least appearance of any such thing  since the monuments of mona now anglesie have been so learnedly visited and defined there is not the least reason to doubt this at salkeld is a druidical monument from its similarity to those remaining there  near to a place called ninechurches we visited two caves the one hollowed in the rock of a circular form with seats cut in its sides the roof being supported in the midst by a rude pillar of mason work this is called the giants cave  the other cave is also circular with a stone table in the midst  there is no tradition to lead one to conjecture by whom these caves were made  their antiquity is greatly to be doubted they seem as if they had been the work of some religious for retirement but the name of no such person remains to us   we also visited a place called force mill near to great salkeld where a cave was said to be the object of travelers curiosity  here we found some seats cut under the shelves of a rock commanding a romantic view upon the river eden but no otherwise remarkable  the falls of the river the hanging rocks rich meadows and hills clothed with wood presented us with prospects which amply repaid the disappointment our curiosity sustained  we lamented to see such extensive wastes and uncultivated lands adjoining to so beautiful a place as penrith whose situation must necessarily circumscribe its trade  the women of this country are remarkably beautiful  the bold uintelligent stare the fluttering inconsistet pertness and lisping nonsense so characteristic of the sex in southern counties are here totally neglected for intelligent looks clothed in modesty and politeness united with simplicity of manners  we had the pleasure of seeing some botanical paintings executed by miss calvin of this place which in delicacy of coloring and taste in the disposition of the foliage and flowers together with the justness of the work may vie with any painting of that kind in europe  to the honor of lady mary lowther this young lady is under her patronage by whom it is not to be doubted her extraordinary merit will be made known to the world   this place owns another very remarkable genius mr fawell who though blind from his infancy can perform any piece of musical composition on the harpsicord having the piece set by wooden pins in a board after the manner of a cribbage board which after perusing by the feeling of his fingers from the strong retention of his memory he performs with great accuracy  the way from penrith to keswick though a good turnpike is yet very dull and tedious for during the course of eighteen miles we met with nothing to amuse till we arrived near the place  the mountains we passed are of various figures and some very lofty and as we still advanced nearer to keswick they straitened the valley in which we rode   we now gained a view of the vale of st johns a very narrow dell hemmed in by mountains through which a small brook makes many meandrings washing little enclosures of grass ground which stretch up the risings of the hills  in the widest part of the dale you are struck with the appearance of an ancient ruined castle which seems to stand upon the summit of a little mount the mountains around forming an amphitheatre  this massive bulwark shows a front of various towers and makes an awful rude and gothic appearance with its lofty turrets and its ragged battlements  we traced the galleries the bending arches the butrasses  the greatest antiquity stands characterized in its architecture  the inhabitants near it assert it is an antediluvian structure   the travelers curiosity is rouzed and he prepares to make a nearer approach when that curiosity is put upon the rack by his being assured that if he advances certain genii who govern the place by virtue of their supernatural arts and necromancy will strip it of all its beauties and by enchantment transform the magic walls upon his approach  the vale seems like the habitation of such beings  its gloomy recesses and retirements look like the haunts of evil spirits  there was no delusion in the report we were soon convinced of its truth  for this piece of antiquity so venerable and noble in its aspect as we drew near to it changed its figure and proved no other than a shaken massive pile of rocks which stand in the midst of this little vale disunited from the adjoining mountains and have so much the real form and resemblance of a castle that they bear the name of the castle rocks of st johns   the delusion afforded us matter of laughter till we descended toward the vale of keswick  the town of keswick lying in a deep valley was not to be seen till we were within a very little distance  as we descended the hill a fine prospect opened upon us  the hills on the right of the road are very grand enclosures of meadow and pasture take up about onethird of the ascent the creeks are every where grown with wood which climbs up shade above shade and their crowns are covered with herbage and heath beneath us laid a plain of about three miles diameter diversified with plots of corn agreeably mingling with the meadows and here and there little cops of ashes  the lake of basnet which has nothing remarkable to engage the travellers attention but a long canal of water terminated the plain to the right the lake of keswick to the left around which mountains piled on mountains made an awful circle and seemed to shut them in from all the world   keswick is but a mean village without any apparent trade  the houses are homely and dirty  there is a town house in the market place said to be erected out of the ruins of lord darnwaters mansion but of the most uncouth architecture  there are very indifferent accommodations here for travelers  nothing is more disagreeable to people who wish to see every thing that is curious in a place they visit than to meet with a drunken soporiferous innkeeper whose small share of natural intelligence is totally absorbed and who has nothing remaining of human but his distorted image and his impertinence  such was our host at keswick  from a short description of the beauties of keswick which was written by the late ingenious dr brown and which we had then in our hands we were impatient to enter upon the lake and thought every delay irksome which kept us from the enchanting scene dr browns letter printed at newcastle in the year      in my way to the north from hagley i passed through dovedale and to say the truth was disappointed in it when i came to buxton i visited another or two of their romantic scenes but these are inferior to dovedale they are but poor miniatures of keswick which exceeds them more in grandeur than i can give you to imagine and more if possible in beauty than in grandeur  instead of the narrow slip of valley which is seen at dovedale you have at keswick a vast amphitheatre in circumference above twenty miles instead of a meagre rivulet a noble living lake ten miles round of an oblong form adorned with variety of wooded islands the rocks indeed of dovedale are finely wild pointed and irregular but the hills are both little and unanimated and the margin of the brook is poorly edged with weeds morass and brushwood but at keswick you will on one side of the lake see a rich and beautiful landscape of cultivated fields rising to the eye in fine inequalities with noble groves of oak happily dispersed and climbing the adjacent hills shade above shade in the most various and picturesque forms on the most opposite shore you will find rocks and cliffs of stupendous height hanging broken over the lake in horrible grandeur some of them a thousand feet high the woods climbing up their steep and shaggy sides where mortal foot never yet approached on these dreadful heights the eagles build their nests a variety of waterfalls are seen pouring from their summits and tumbling in vast sheets from rock to rock in rude and terrible magnificence while on all sides of this immense amphitheatre the lofty mountains rise round piercing the clouds in shapes as spiry and fantastic as the very rocks of dovedale to this i must add the frequent and bold projection of the cliffs into the lake forming noble bays and promontories in other parts they finely retire from it and often open in abrupt casms or clefts through which at hd you see rich and cultivated vales and beyond these at various distance mountains rising over mountains among which new prospects present themselves in mist till the eye is lost in an agreeable perplexity where active fancy travels beyond sense and pictures things unseen   were i to analyze the two places into their constituent principles i should tell you that the full perfection of keswick consists of three circumstances beauty horror and immensity united the second of which is alone found in dovedale of beauty it has little nature having left it almost a desert neither its small extent nor the diminutive and liveless form of the hills admit magnificence but to give you a complete idea of these three perfections as they are joined in keswick would require the united powers of claude salvator and poussin the first should throw his delicate sunshine over the cultivated vales the scattered cots the groves the lake and wooded islands the second should dash out the horror of the rugged cliffs the steeps the hanging woods and foaming waterfalls while the grand pencil of poussin should crown the whole with the majesty of the impending mountains  so much for what i would call the permanent beauties of this astonishing scene were i not afraid of being tiresome i could now dwell as long on its varying or accidental beauties i would sail round the lake anchor in every bay and land you on every promontory and island i would point the perpetual change of prospect the woods rocks cliffs and mountains by turns vanishing or rising into view now gaining on the sight hanging over our heads in their full dimensions beautifully dreadful and now by a change of situation assuming new romantic shapes retiring and lessening on the eye insensibly losing themselves in an azure mist i would remark the contrast of light and shade produced by the morning and evening sun the one gilding the western and the other the eastern side of this immense amphitheatre while the vast shadow projected by the mountains buries the opposite part in a deep and purple gloom which the eye can hardly penetrate the natural variety of coloring which the several objects produce is no less wonderful and pleasing the ruling nts in the valley being those of azure green and gold yet ever various arising from an intermixture of the lake the woods the grass and corn fields these are finely contrasted by the gray rocks and cliffs and the whole beightened by the yellow streams of light the purple hues and misty azure of the mountains sometimes a serene air and clear sky disclose the tops of the highest hills at others you see clouds involving their summits resting on their sides or descending to their base and rolling among the valleys as in a vast furnace  when the winds are high they roar among the cliffs and caverns like peals of thunder then too the clouds are seen in vast bodies sweeping along the hills in gloomy greatness while the lake joins the tumult and tosses like a sea but in calm weather the whole scene becomes new the lake is a perfect mirror and the landscape in all its beauty islands fields woods rocks and mountains are seen inverted and floating on its surface i will now carry you to the top of a cliff where if you dare approach the ridge a new scene of astonishment presents itself where the valley lake and islands seem lying at your feet where this expanse of water appears diminished to a little pool amidst the vast immeasurable objects that surround it for here the summits of more distant hills appear above those you have already seen and rising behind each other in successive ranges and azure groups of craggy and broken steeps form an immense and awful picture which can only be expressed by the image of a tempestuous sea of mountains  let me now conduct you down again to the valley and conclude with one circumstance more which is that a walk by still moon light at which time the distant waterfalls are heard in all their variety of sound among these enchanting dales opens a scene of such delicate beauty repose and solemnity as exceeds all description       we hasted thither and from cockshoothill took a general survey of the lake which though inferior in size to hullswater is yet very different in its beauties and afforded us many delightful scenes  the water which still bears the name of dernwater though embodied in so great a lake said to be ten miles in circumference was transparent as crystal and shining as a mirror over whose surface five fine islands were dispersed the nearest in view was covered with yellow corn the rest clothed in wood the hills are lofty arising on every side from the margin of the lake   here the mountains were in some parts covered with grass in others heath there the rocks were grown with shrubs and brush wood which hung in their apertures and creeks  little valleys of cultivated land presented themselves in the openings and windings of the mountains and small enclosures and groves of oaks stretched up the precipitate ascents of every hill from the brink of the water save only at the head of the basin where the mountains were more rugged and romantic  we hurried to the boat that we might enjoy the pleasures of this place in their greatest perfection  the general view was magnificent and beautiful but we wanted to take each pleasing scene apart  the following verses are taken from dr daltons descriptive poem in the continuation of dodsleys collection vol i   to natures pride sweet keswicks vale the muse will guide the muse who trod the enchanted ground who sailed the wondrous lake around with you will haste once more to hail the beauteous brook of borrodale from savage parent gentle stream be thou the muses favorite theme o soft insinuating glide silent along the meadows side smooth over the sandy bottom pass resplendent all through fluid glafs unless upon thy yielding breast their heads the painted lillies rest to where in deep capacious bed the widely liquid lake is spread let other streams rejoice to roar down the rough rocks of dread lodore rush raving on with boisterous sweep and foaming rend the frighted deep thy gentle genius shrinks away from such a rude unequal fray through thine own native dale where rise tremendous rocks amid the skies thy waves with patience slowly wind till they the smoothest channel find soften the horrors of the scene and through confusion flow serene horrors like these at first alarm but soon with savage grandeur charm and raise to noblest thoughts your mind thus by thy fall lodore reclined the cragged cliff impending wood whose shadows mix over half the flood the gloomy clouds with solemn sail scarce lifted by the languid gale over the cappd hill and darkened vale the ravening kite and bird of jove which round the aerial ocean move and floating on the billowy sky with fullexpanded pinions fly their fluttering or their bleating prey thence with deathdooming eye survey channels by rocky torrents torn rocks to the lake in thunder born or such as over our heads appear suspended in the mid career to start again at his command who rules fire water air and land i view with wonder and delight a pleasing though an awful sight for seen with them the verdant isles soften with more delicious smiles more tempting twine their opening bowers more lively flow the purple flowers more smoothly slopes the border gay in fairer circle bends the bay and last to fix our wandering eyes thy roofs o keswick brighter rise the lake and lofty hills between where giant skiddow shuts the scene supreme of mountains skiddow hail to whom all britain sinks a vale lo his imperial brow i see from foul usurping vapors free twere glorious now his side to climb boldly to scale his top sublime and thence   my muse these flights forbear nor with wild raptures tire the fair hills rocks and dales have been too long the subject of my rambling song   we ordered the boatmen to coast round the nearest island called vicars island containing about six acres of corn land on the eastern side of which a few sycamores formed a little grove covering a hovel which varied the hue with a rich green and gave to the whole a picturesque appearance  here we found a sweet shade whilst we hung upon our oars to listen to the sound of the waterfalls which struck the ear from every side with an agreeable solemnity   now we had the valley to the right opening upon our view and extending a rich plain toward the northwest three or four miles in breadth  the strips of corn and little groves scattered here and there gave the most pleasing variety when contrasted with the verdure of the mown meads struck by the rays of the morning sun and happily opposed to the adjoining mountains  in this vale the church with some seat houses showed their white fronts over which the mountains arising to the right were stupendous and gloomy as they stood covered with clouds  there skiddow raised his head and with a peaked brow overlooked saddleback and cawseypike together with a chain of mountains stretching away toward the northwest whilst on the other hand the hills and rocks which stand upon the basnetwater form the other wing of an lofty avenue of mountains which extend into the distant plains   we were told by a person we met with at keswick that skiddow from the plane of the lakes surface is three thousand four hundred and fifty feet in perpendicular height but as we had no means of proving the truth of this calculation must leave it to others to aseertain since this work was in the press the ingenious mr walker of manchester who was in a course of lectures on natural philosophy at stockton upon tees favored me with the following remarks on the altitude of skiddow barometer at whitehaven    0 feet fell same day in ascending the mountain     by table    0 stood on the top at      by angle from the lake of bassenthwaite to the top of skiddow    0      we coasted the right hand side of the lake where the hills gradually retiring from its margin rise to their summits covered with herbage here we had a view of the little valley of newland which winds about the feet of the mountains and with the finest verdure from the small enclosures of grass ground refreshes the eye which had labored with upstretched looks over the vast heights that on every side shut it in  there cattle and sheep were seen pasturing some little cottages were dispersed amongst the hedgerow ashes whilst the shadows of the hills suffered the sunshine to fall only in strips over the vale   we landed at st herberts island camden writing of keswick says the darwent having his first beginning in borodale a vley hemmed in with crooked hills creeps between the mountains    which contains about five acres of land now covered with young trees famous for being the residence of st herbert a priest and confessor who to avoid the intercourse of man and that nothing might withdraw his attention from unceasing mortification and prayer chose this island for his abode  the scene around him was adapted to his gloomy ideas of religion  he was surrounded by the lake which afforded him fish for his diet  on every hand the voice of waterfalls excited the solemnest strains of meditation  rocks and mountains were his daily prospect where barrenness and solitude seemed to take up their eternal abode  from the situation of this place nature had given three parts of the year to impetuous hurricanes and storms the fourth alone provided for the rest  here this recluse erected an hermitage the remains of which appear to this day being a building of stone formed into two apartments the outward one about twenty feet long and fifteen broad the other of narrower dimensions  he was a cotemporary with st cuthbert and as the legends of that time say by the prayers of that saint obtained a joint or equotemporary death with him in the year of our lord six hundred and eightyeight   the passion for solitude and a recluse life which reigned in the days of this saint and was cherished by the monastic school although at first sight may appear to us uncouth and enthusiastic yet when we examine into those times our astonishment will cease whilst we consider the estate of those men who under all the prejudices of education were living in an age of ignorance vassalage and rapine and we shall rather applaud than condemn a devotee who disgusted with the world and the sins of men consigns his life to the service of the deity in retirement  we may suppose we hear the saint exclaiming with the poet  blessed be that hand divine which gently laid my heart at rest beneathed this humble shed the worlds a stately bark on dangerous seas with pleasure seen but boarded at our peril here on a single plank thrown safe on shore i hear the tumult of the distant throng as that of seas remote or dying storms and meditate on scenes more silent still pursue my theme and fight the fear of death here like a shepherd gazing from his hut touching his reed or leaning on his staff eager ambitions fiery chase i see i see the circling hunt of noisy men burst laws enclosure leap the mounds of right pursuing and pursued each others prey as wolves for rapine as the fox for wiles till death that mighty hunter earths them all young    i fell into a reverie and begun to mutter thus to myself  it seems unnatural for man to deny himself of the aid and consolation which are derived from society and to contemn the sweets of friendship  the poet says poor is the friendless master of a world young   when we talk of friendship in general the friendship of the world we are amusing ourselves with a superficial view where objects are so grooped and colors fall in such a happy assemblage that all is beautiful and delighting  but when greater curiosity or necessity demands a strict survey of the several images which formed this pleasing prospect you find on their separation that they lose that excellence which their union or their distance maintained  there is little of true friendship on this stage to enhance the value of life  the corruptions of the age have contaminated it and scarce any thing more is left than the name  when it is even found with consanguinity it is a rare essence at which men stand agape  i have known examples where genius and merit have dawned upon a youth surrounded with opulent friends who have stood gazing on him like statues of stone without stretching forth a hand to save him from poverty whilst the fine gifts that providence had endowed him with languished in fetters which by their patronage might have been brought forth and saved even by the crumbs which fell from the rich mans table  i doubted not the eye of heaven regarded their insensibility with kindling wrath and to reward the sacrilege deprived them of every enjoyment with which the finer feelings of the soul bless mankind and left them nothing but the animal economy and the disgraced image of humanity   i had shown some distortions in my agitation through this whispered soliloquy but uttering these last words with a degree of vehemence arising on the progress of my ideas my companion catched me by the arm and roused me saying the boatmen already think they have got a passenger that is frantic and express by their looks their wishes to be rid of us camden writes that at newlandside and elsewhere copper mines were discovered by thomas shurland and daniel hotchstatter a german of auspurge in our days and yet the same were known before as appears by the close rolls of king henry the third upon the discovery of these mines there was a memorable case in law between queen elizabeth and thomas piercie earl of northumberland in whose lordship they were found but by reason of the queens prerogative and veins of gold and silver discovered therein they were adjudged to the crown  here black lead is also found  derwent after its passage through these hills spreads itself into a large lake bid terms it praegrande stagnum wherein are three islands eminent above the water  the one has an house of the ratcliffs a family of knights degree the second is inhabited by the dutch mineral men and the third is thought to be that where bid wrote that st herbert lived an hermitical life on the very skirt of this vale in a pleasant soil encompassed with dewy hills and sheltered toward the north by that high mountain skiddow lies keswick a little town which king edward the first made a market by the application of sir thomas of dernwater lord of the place from whom it lineally descended to the family of the ratcliffs  as for the mountain skiddow it rises up to such a height with two heads like to parnassus and with a kind of emulation looks on scruffel hill before it in annandale in scotland that from these two mountains as the misty clouds rise or fall the people of the country make their prognostications of the change of weather and have this proverb if skiddow has a cap scruffel wots weel of that       but to return to our hermit there is no history of his life and actions to be met with or any tradition of his works of piety or miracles preserved by the inhabitants of the country   we now pursued our voyage by a noble woody scene where brandelow park arising from the edge of the lake with stately young oaks extends its groves over two round hoes or eminences and behind them after covering a little intervening valley rises on the side of a mountain to a considerable height and forms a woody amphitheatre fringed with some small strips of corn which grow under its skirts whilst all above are stupendous hills and rocks  the strait boles of the trees together with the verdure of the ground under their shadow which was perceived a great depth in the grove by reason of the distance at which the trees stood from each other formed an uncommon and solemn scene which being again represented by the reflection of the water seemed like enchanted haunts where driads met with naids in the happy regions of the genius of the lake   we arrived at the borders of manisty meadow a flat of a few acres at the foot of the mountains where we anchord our boat to enjoy the pleasures of the situation  to the left the nearest object was a wooded island edged with rocks behind which brandelow park and oaken groves dressed in the deepest green covered the hills which arose immediately from the margin of the lake and from thence stretched up the foot of catbells mountain which laid so near to us that it required the eye which viewed its summit to be turned upwards directly to heaven  on our right at the distance of about one hundred yards laid another small island on whose rocky margin brush wood and willows hung fantastically above whose thickets the distant shores were seen where the mighty cliffs of falcon and wallow crags projecting showed their grotesque and tremendous brows in a lofty line of rocks beneath the feet of which a strip of cultivated lands and woods shot forth a verdant promontory which sunk gradually into the lake  in the center of this view after stretching the eye for the distance of three miles over a basin of the clearest and smoothest water spreading its bosom to the noontide sun is a large mount called castlehead rocks rising in a cone and covered with oak wood behind which a lofty mountain raised its brown brow dressed in heath and sunburned herbage exceeded only by skiddow covered with blue vapor and capped with clouds which terminated the prospect   hullswater gives you a few but noble and extensive scenes which yield astonishment whilst keswick abounds with variety with wilder and more romantic prospects   after passing bank park a rocky and barren promontory on which a few scattered trees looked deplorably aged and torn we entered a fine bay where the mountains rise immediately out of the lake here standing perpendicular there falling back in ruinous and rude confusion as being piled heap on heap from the convulsions of chaos in the beginning and in other parts shelving and hanging over the lake as if they threatened an immediate fall  the whole forming a stupendous circus   to describe this view is difficult as no expression can convey an idea of the subject where the wild variety consists only of various features of the same objects rocks and mountains forming and constituting the parts of this massive theater  in the front of this romantic scene a small mount presents itself covered with herbage small from the mighty stature and gigantic members of the other parts of the prospect  overlooking this mount stands a round rock pushing his mountainous brow into the clouds on the summit of the mount sweetly contrasted by the gray rocks behind there grows with peculiar picturesque beauties a single ancient oak  the lake beneath was a perfect mirror  over which the giant oak himself a grove flings his romantic branches and beholds his reverend image in the expanse below masons garden     on each hand the cliffs and mountains are strewed over with bushes and shrubs down whose sides small streams of water trill like so many threads of silver giving a delicate mixture to the greyness of the rocks over which they passed and which in many places arise perpendicular and are rent into a thousand rude columns as if they had been torn by thunderbolts in other places they are of a tamer aspect and compacted in one solid mass stand with firmness as the pillars of the antediluvian world  where the hills were separated little vales filled with wood or narrow winding dells of grass ground twist around their feet and give a happy variegation to the view  in some places clefts in the rocks afforded a prospect into a valley behind in others the overhanging cliffs formed rude arches and apertures through which distant mountains were discovered  behind all were mountains piled on mountains where the clouds rolled in heavy volumes giving a gloominess to those regions of confusion and barrenness which rendered the luster of the shining lake and the streams of light which fell upon the rocks waterfalls and shrubs brighter and more pleasing  here  even in the dull unseen unseeing dell  shall contemplation imp her eagle plumes the poet here shall hold sweet converse with his muse the curious sage who comments on great natures ample tome shall find that volume here  for here are caves where rise those gurgling rills that sing the song which contemplation loves here shadowy glades where through the tremulous foliage darts the ray that gilds the poets daydream masons garden     in the cliffs in this part of the lake eagles build their nests far removed above the reach of gunshot and undisturbed by men for no adventurous foot ever dared to assail their lofty habitation in the sight of the cottager hither they bring the spoils of the fold or the field to feed their young superior to the wrath of the injured   on these shores a salt spring of very salubrious quality is found but like the sulpher spring of hullswater is neglected   we next visited a very extraordinary phenomenon an island about forty yards in length and thirty in breadth grown over with rushes reeds grass and some willows  we would have landed upon it but as the water was said to be forty fathom deep in that place and the attempt rather hazardous we desisted and had not the means of inquiring particularly into its nature  this island arose about four perpendicular feet above the surface of the water on which it floated  from its magnitude we were not able with one boat to try whether it would move from the perpendicular line of its then station or whether it was bound to and connected with the bottom of the lake by the roots of any aquatic plants which appeared upon its surface  the boatmen told us that it had not floated for two years before and that it is seen at many seasons by reason of the clearness of the water a great way from the surface in its action of rising or subsiding as it frequently descends to and rests upon the bottom of the lake but it never shifts its station  this change of floating or sinking cannot be effected by any greater or less quantity of water in the lake at any one season for on enquiry we found in the rainy seasons the lake is very little increased in height its outlets receiving the additional water as fast as it flows in   we now pushed up the river which feeds the lake and anchored near a little but pleasant habitation called lochdoor or lodore a place perfectly adapted for the abode of a recluse and much preferable to st herberts island lying open to the southern sun sheltered from the north by mighty mountains which almost overhang it and fronting to the widest part of the basin it commands a view of the several islands manisty meadows and brandelow parks with their oaken groves hanging from the ascent of the mountains shade above shade  catbells and the adjoining crags surmounting all   we were landed on a plain of meadow ground which descended to the edge of the water over which we passed to an adjoining wood at the foot of the rocks behind the lodore house  after winding through several passes in these groves and thickets we gained a situation where we were delighted with the noble objects which presented themselves to our view   around us was spread a grove formed of tall young oaks ash and birch trees which gave an agreeable coolness and shade  above the trees with uplifted looks to the right we viewed a mountain of rock called shepherds crag forming a rude circular mass shelving from the foot toward its crown in a spiral form on every plane of which and every step that hung upon its sides herbage and shrubs grew fantasticly whilst the very summit wore a verdant cap of grass  to the left there arose a perpendicular gray cliff said to be a thousand feet in height from the lake rent into innumerable fissures and standing like massive columns in rude arrangment to support the seeming ruins of a shattered tower grown white with storms and overlooking shepherds crag some hundred feet  in the opening between these stupendous rocks the river pours its whole stream forming a grand cascade near two hundred perpendicular feet high  as the channel is rugged the water makes a sheet of foam and roars amongst the caverns and the cliffs so that you are deprived of hearing any thing beside its tumult  reaching the wood where the descent is less precipitate it winds amongst the trees some times showing itfelf and at others totally concealed whilst it serpentines toward the lake  the spray which is dashed around the rocks and carried upon the breeze where ever it meets the rays of the sun through the openings of the cliffs takes the colors of the rainbow   one would conceive thompson had this cataract in his eye when he wrote his seasons smooth to the shelving brink a copious flood rolls fair and placid where collected all in one impetuous torrent down the steep it thundering shoots and shakes the country round at first an azure sheet it rushes broad then whitening by degrees as prone it falls and from the loud resounding rocks below dashed in a cloud of foam it sends aloft a hoary mist and forms a ceaseless shower nor can the tortured wave here find repose but raging still amid the shaggy rocks now flashes over the scattered fragments now aslant the hollowed channel rapid darts and falling fast from gradual slope to slope with wild infracted course and lessned roar it gains a safer bed and steals at last along the mazes of the quiet vale   on turning from this grand spectacle the greatest beauties of this lake are thrown into one prospect  the ground whereon we stood was rugged and rocky shadowed with trees  looking over a rich bosom of wood below us lay the lodore meadows where groops of cattle were dispersed and by the shore some carpenters were repairing their boats a circumstance which enlivened the scene  the shining lake laid in one smooth plane reflecting the azure sky chequered with clouds over which the vicars island yellow with corn and the woody islands were fortunately arranged  the mountains whose feet were trimmed with wood lay in long perspective to the left  castlehead with its embowered cone and lords island arising from the opposite shore intervened between us and the vale of keswick which laid on the back ground colored with all the beauteous tinctures of summer over which the awful skiddow with his inferior race of mountains frowned in azure majesty and closed the scene   here were all those beauties of coloring which the late dr brown described the natural variety and coloring which the several objects produce is no less wonderful than pleasing the ruling teints of the valley being those of azure green and gold yet ever various arising from an intermixture of the lake the woods the grass and corn fields these are finely contrasted by the gray rocks and cliffs and the whole heightened by the yellow streams of light the purple hues and misty azure of the mountains   in this prospect one finds all the order and beauty of coloring mentioned by mason  vivid green warm brown and black opake the foreground bears conspicuous  sober olive coldly marks the second distance thence the third declines in softer blue or lessening still is lost in faintest purple    claude in his happiest hour never struck out a finer landscape it has every requisite which the pencil can demand and is perhaps the only view in england which can vie with the sublime scenes from which that painter formed his taste  we now returned to our boat an sailing within some little distance of the shore had a view of the waterfall where the beauties of the lake to the south east lay in a pleasing perspective  we looked over a small part of the basin from whence to the left a stupendous mountain of rock arose on whose skirts and in the rents and clefts of whose sides trees and shrubs climbed almost to the very summit  before us laid the wood from which we had lately passed under whose shade lodore house and enclosures were seen inclining toward the lake above which the lofty precipice the waterfall and shepherds crag were seen in all their variety of beauties whilst all beyond the mountains formed a crescent enclasping a sheet of water of two miles circuit  mountain behind mountain and rock behind rock fell here in fine perspective and brought to our minds those astonishing scenes which characterize the pencil of salvator   we passed from hence in our return to keswick by the coast where we were shown a cliff that projected over the lake called eves crag from its bearing some similitude to a female colossian statue  we next passed wallow crag in which a large opening is formed by the parting of the rocks bearing the name of ladys rake from the escape which lady dernwater made there by climbing these horrid and stupendous heights with such jewels and valuables as she could secure when her unfortunate lord was apprehended for a traitor  we now reached lords island containing some few acres covered with wood where are the remains of a mansion of the dernwater family formerly this was only a peninsula but when the place was made the residence of the radcliffs and dernwaters it was severed from the main land by a ditch over which was thrown a drawbridge  this must have been a beautiful retirement  travelers cannot behold the ruins of this place without yielding a sigh for the sins of the world and bewailing the dire effects which attend on ambition and the crimes of princes   we visited a druidical monument within about two miles of keswick situate to the south of the road which we had passed from penrith   this monument is placed on a plain formed on the summit of a hill around which the adjoining mountains make a solemn circle  it is composed of stones of various forms natural and unhewn they seemed to have been collected from the surface but from what lands it is impossible to conjecture most of them being a species of granite  these stones are fifty in number and are set in a form not exactly circular the diameter being thirty paces from east to west and thirtytwo from north to south at the eastern end a small enclosure is formed within the circle by ten stones making an oblong square in conjunction with the stones of that side of the circle seven paces in length and three in width within in this place we conjectured the altar had been erected  at the opposite side a single square stone is laid at the distance of three paces from the circle  possibly this may have been broken off and is only the foot of such a column as long meg in the salkeld monument which may have been used to bind the victims to  the stones forming the outward line are some of them standing erect others fallen and the same observation is to be made as to the appearance of entrances as at salkeld  the stones here are of various sizes some of the largest of those which are standing being near eight feet in height and fifteen feet in circumference   a clergyman whose property the pasture ground is in which this monument stands and with whom we gained an acquaintance during our stay at keswick told us he was determined to destroy the place as it prejudiced his ground so that perhaps by these sacrilegious hands the curious will shortly be deprived of this valuable piece of antiquity  a late descovery has been made of large quantities of black lead a mineral peculiar to this country and no where else to be found in europe amongst the gravel and earth on the shore of vicars island  whether it has lodged there by the floods or how otherwise been collected is not known but so valuable the discovery was thought that it occasioned an enquiry by what means the whole lake might be drained conceiving that from this specimen immense wealth would be obtained by such an undertaking   the fish of this lake are trouts pike eels and perch  the romantic scenes upon the lake induced us to take a boat at night under the favor of the moon which was near the full  we began our voyage soon after the moon was risen and she had illumined the top of skiddow but from the intercepting mountains had not within the ascent of an hour reached the lake  we were surrounded with a solemn gloom  the stilness of the evening rendered the voice of the waterfalls tremendous as they in all their variety of sounds were reechoed from every cavern  the summits of the rocks began to receive the rising rays and seemed to be crowned with turrets of silver from which the stars departed for their nightly round  as the light advanced objects arose to view as if surging on the first morning from chaos  the water was a plain of sable sprinkled over with gems reflected from the starry firmament  the groves which hung upon the feet of the mountains were hid in darkness and all was one grave and majestic circle of shadow   till the moon rising in cloudy majesty at length aparent queen unveiled her peerless light and over the dark her silver mantle threw miltons paradise lost     when the long protracted shadows of the mountains cast on the bosom of the lake showed the vastness of those masses from whence they proceeded and still as the moon arose higher in the horizon the distant objects began to be illumined and the whole presented us with a noble moonlight piece delicately touched by the hand of nature and far surpassing those humble scenes which we had often viewed in the works of the flemish painters   mists began to arise on the lake and by reason of the air which bore them aloft being confined and eddying within this deep circle they were whirled round and carried upwards like a column which so soon as it approached the rays of the moon had a most wonderful appearance and resembled a pillar of light   i recollect that maupertuis describing the lake and mountain of niemi in lapland speaks of a phenomenon of the like nature which the people called haltios and which they esteemed to be the guardian spirits of the place  be these as they might we may venture to assert no druid no st herbert no genius had a more glorious ascension   the moons mild beams now glistned on the waters and touched the groves the cliffs and islands with a meekness of coloring which added to the solemnity of the night and these noble and romantic objects struck us with reverence and inspired the mind with pious sentiments and ejaculations  it was observable that by day we were incessantly communicating our raptures and surprise on each new wonder that opened to our view  we now enjoyed them in silence   every bay and each promontary assumed an appearance very different from what it had by day light  the little dells which wind around the feet of the mountains as they were shadowed by interposing objects or silvered by the moon afforded most enchanting scenes where we might have wandered with delight through the whole night   where the lake narrows and runs up in a creek toward borodale the rocks looked horrible almost shutting us in from the face of heaven which could be beheld only by looking immediately upright the cliffs were struck with scanty gleams of light which gained their passage through the interstices of the hills or chasms in the rocks and served only to discover their tremendous overhanging fronts their mighty caverns where the water struck by our oars made a hollow sound their deformed and frowning brows the hanging shrubs with which they were bearded their sparkling waterfalls that trilled from shelf to shelf the whole half seen and half concealed leaving imagination at large to magnify the images of their grandeur and horrible magnificence  the pursuit which engaged us the next morning was to gain the summit of skiddow which by the winding pass we were obliged to make afforded a laborious ascent of five miles  the prospect which we gained from this eminence very well rewarded our fatigue  to the south east we had a view over the tops of mountains one succeeding to or overlooking the other a scene of chaos and mighty confusion this was the prospect which dr brown described by the image of a tempestuous sea of mountains  below us laid the lake with all the beauties of its margin together with the vale of keswick and the waters of basnet as if delineated on a chart  to the south the hills toward cockermouth though less rugged and romantic than those toward the south east were yet no less stupendous  to the north west we had the prospect of a wide and barren heath extending its plains to carlisle and terminated by the mountains of scotland  to the north east we regained the prospect of that spacious circus in which penrith stands the queen of the vale overtopped by cross fell which forms the most distant back ground   the air was remarkably sharp and thin compared with that from which we passed in the valley and respiration seemed to be performed with a kind of asthmatic oppression   whilst we remained upon the mountain over the hills which lay between keswick and cockermouth dense and dark vapors began to arise and in a little time as they advanced upon a south west wind concealed from us those heights which we had viewed half an hour before clear and distinct  our guide was very earnest with us to quit the mountain as he prognosticated a storm was collecting and we should be in danger of being wet or in hazard of losing our way in the heavy vapor which he assured us would soon cover skiddow  the circumstance was too singular to be left by people curious in their observations on natural events we desired our guide would take care of himself and leave us to our pleasure but the good attendant had a due sense of our impropriety in wishing to be left there and determined to abide by us  the clouds advanced toward us with accelerated speed  a hollow blast sounded amongst the hills and dells which lay below us and seemed to fly from the approaching darkness  the vapor rolled down the opposite valley of newland and appeared to tumble in mighty sheets and volumes from the brow of each mountain into the vale of keswick and over the lakes   whilst we stood to admire this phenomenon the mighty volumes of clouds which we beheld below us gradually ascended and we soon found the summit of skiddow totally surrounded whilst we on every side looked down upon an angry and impetuous sea heaving its billows as if boiling from the bottom we were rejoicing in this grand spectacle of nature and thinking ourselves fortunate in having beheld so extraordinary an event when to our astonishment and confusion a violent burst of thunder engendered in the vapor below us stunned our sense being repeated from every rock and down every dell in the most horrid uproar at the same time from the agitation of the air the mountain seemed to tremble  at the time of the explosion the clouds were instantaneously illuminated and from innumerable chasms sent forth streams of lightning  our guide laid upon the earth terrified and amazed in his ejaculations accusing us of presumption and impiety  danger made us solemn indeed we had no where to fly for safety no place to cover our heads to descend was to rush into the very inflammable vapor from whence our perils proceeded to stay was equally hazardous for now the clouds which had received such a concussion by the thunder ascended higher and higher enveloping the whole mountain and letting fall a heavy shower of rain  we thought ourselves happy even under this circumstance to perceive the storm turning northwestward and to hear the next thunderclap burst in the plain beyond basnet water  a like event has frequently happened to travelers in the heights of the alps from whence the thunder storms are seen passing over the countries beneath them   the echoes from the mountains which bordered keswick lake from newland from borodale from lodore were noble and gave a repetition of the thunderclaps distinctly though distant after an intermission of several seconds tremendous silence   the rain which still increased formed innumerable streams and cascades which rushed from the crown of skiddow saddleback and cawseypike with a mighty noise but we were deprived of the beauty of these waterfalls by the intercepting vapor which was not to be penetrated by the eye more than a few yards before us   we descended the hill wet and fatigued and were happy when we regained our inn at keswick which we now esteemed a paradise although we had despised it before for its dirtiness and inconvenience  we took leave of our slovenly and besotted host and pursued our rout from keswick to ambleside a stage of eighteen miles   for romantic mountainous and wild scenes this stage affords the finest ride in the north of england the whole road lying in a narrow and winding dell confined by a stupendous range of mountains on either hand  in some places the vale is not wider than merely to admit the road in other places it opens in little valleys and again is shut in various forms  we passed near the rocks of st johns which on nearer view lost most of their grotesque appearance and as we winded by the feet of these lofty hills creeks filled with wood afforded us many pretty though narrow landskips through which little rills arising on the sides of the mountains poured down their hasty and gurgling waters  the rain which had fallen the day before improved the beauties of the place  the cascades were innumerable and their figures various  at one point of view we took in nine cascades falling from eminences seven or eight hundred feet perpendicular height  where some of them fell from the very brows of the hills they appeared as strings of silver but descending further spread into sheets of foam and before they reached the middle of the hills tumbled headlong from precipice to precipice with a confused noise  every turn of the road and every valley gave us a new scene  the prospects were ever changing and diversified  at length we reached a narrow lake called layswater where the vale widened  scattered trees and some little enclosures adorned its margin and here and there a cottage  we rode by the side of this lake for the distance of two miles so far it stretched along the vale on every hand enjoying little rural scenes which renewing to us a succession of pastoral images which we had collected from the poets in our early years when the young mind was charmed with romance and the most fantastic ideas of rural innocence retirement and love   neither did these images pass in the imagination only for in this sequestered vale we met with a female native full of youth innocence and beauty  simplicity adorned her looks with modesty and hid her downcast eye virgin apprehension covered her with blushes when she found herself stayed by two strangers and as she turned her eyes for an instant upon us they smote us with all the energy of unaffected innocence touched with doubtfulness  her lips which in the sweetest terms expressed her apprehension showed us teeth of ivory and on her full forehead ringlets of auburn flowed carelessly a delicacy of proportion was seen over her whole figure which was easy and elegant as natures self   my companion in a rapture snatched out his pencil and began to imitate but the unaffected impatiency and sweet confusion of the maid overcame our wishes to detain her and we let her pass reluctantly  after this little adventure we jogged on silent and wraped up each in his own cogitations till we began to descend the hill toward the valley of grasmere  we were roused by the unexpected beauties of the scene and as if moved by one thought we stopped gazed at each and smiled before we could condescend to snatch ourselves from the ideal pleasures we had been enjoying  we were each conscious of our situation and at length laughed aloud no otherwise communicating our sentiments but by our looks which sufficiently explained our simpathetic and silent delight  we were charmed with the view of grasmere a retirement surrounded by hills on every hand the vale is about four miles in circumference of meadow and pasture ground  near the middle of this valley is a fine lake beautified with an island  from a mount a little distance from the church we viewed the whole circle delighted with the situation  the fields were full of freshness and verdure the scene was ornamented with a few humble cottages dispersed on the borders of the lake amongst which the sacred fane stood solemnly superior  the hills were here and there graced with a few trees and animated by white flocks of sheep  it seemed to be the vale of peace  we had not passed far from this sweet sequestered scene before we entered ridale where we were again charmed with new retreats and happy retirements   here we found a cultivated vale not equal in width to grasmere but full of pretty enclosures and watered with a lake on which a fine woody island arises  we passed along the windings of this dale till we reached the seat of sir michael fleming  an ancient mansion standing on the opening of the dale on the southern decline of the hills which abound in wood land and front to the lake of windermere  the ground before this seat is prettily diversified with irregular knots of trees situate on natural eminences and scattered with such agreeable wildness and irregularity that they seemed to be the work of nature  the interspaces between these knots of trees were mown in narrow meandring walks camden says at the upper corner of windermere lies the dead carcass as one would say of an ancient city with great ruins of walls and many heaps of rubbish one from another remaining of buildings yet apparent  the fortress was oblong fenced with a ditch and rampart for it took up in length one hundred and thirtytwo else and in breadth eighty  that it had been roman work is evident by the british brick and mortar tempered with pieces of brick small earthen pots cruets or phials of glass by pieces of roman money frequently found there by round stones like to millstones or quernstones of which they formed their columns and by the high roads leading to it  now the ancient name is gone unless one should furmise that it were amboglana of which the book of notices makes mention especially as the modern name is ambleside     at the distance of half a mile opposite to the house are lofty rocks and hanging woods of oak which form the channel of the river that feeds the lake  ambleside is situate on the swift decline of a hill over which many high mountains arise toward the north  the first appearance of our inn induced us to apprehend we should hasten our departure but the assiduous desire of pleasing shown in the conduct of the people counterbalanced their deficiencies  here we met with a gentleman mr penney of penneybridge who was conversant with every curiosity in this country his polite and genteel behavior rendered our stay at ambleside very agreeable  by this gentlemans directions his servant conducted us about a mile up the woody declivity of the hill behind the inn where we saw a most amazing cascade totally different from any thing we had met with upon our tour  making so great an ascent and not having reached a third of the height of this eminence it might be supposed that when we gained the view it would be something extraordinary  the rushing of the waters in the fall sounded through the wood as we approached it and seemed at once as if it was bursting over our heads and tumbling beneath our feet  this was soon reconciled for in a few steps we perceived ourselves to be upon the summit of a cliff which overhung the channel of the stream where an old oak suspended his romantic boughs over the precipice  this was the only opening of the wood or situation where we could look into this tremendous gulf  the river which falls here arises on the very height of the mountains and flows in a very confined channel through an opening of rocks the edges of which were grown with stately trees and thronged with thickets of hazel birch and holley  we could look upwards from the place where we stood for about one hundred perpendicular yards where we saw the river in two streams pouring through the trees  about the midway it united and was again broken by a craggy rock grown with fern and brushwood which threw it into two branches foaming and making a horrid noise but it soon united again and from thence precipitated into a deep and dreary gulf for above sixty yards below the cliff on which we stood from whence it tumbled from rock to rock and dashed through a rough and craggy channel down to the town of ambleside with a mighty sound which shook the air so as to give a sensible agitation to the nerves like the effect of a thunderclap  the whiteness of the fretting waters was beautifully contrasted by the black rocks which formed their passage  it was almost impossible for the steadiest eye to look upon this waterfall without giddiness  its beauties for a painter were noble and various the wood which hung upon the rocks over the stream was of mixed hues the trees projecting from each precipice knotty and grotesque the cliffs were black and fringed with ivy and fern which gave a singular luster to the waterfall  no fancy could exceed the happy assemblage of objects which rendered this view picturesque  the traces of amblesides antiquity are not now to be found  the inhabitants have not preserved any of the roman monuments which were formerly discovered here  from ambleside we went to bownas a small village on the shore of the lake of windermere this was a delightful ride lying within a little distance of the water which was opened to our view as we past through various turnings of the road  the sides of the way are ornamented with woods meadows and pasture ground   the owner of the white lion inn at bownas has a boat on the lake with which we were accommodated  this lake is very different from those we had seen in cumberland being in length about twelve computed miles and not a mile in width in the broadest part  the hills seen around the lake except those above ambleside are humble  the margin of the water is irregular and indented and every where composed of cultivated lands woods and pastures which descend with an easy fall into the lake forming a multitude of bays and promontories and giving it the appearance of a large river in the narrowest parts not unlike to the thames below richmond  on that part where furness fell forms the shore the scene is more rude and romantic  the western side of this lake is in lancashire the eastern in westmoreland  as we sailed down the lake from bownas we had two views which comprehended all its beauties  we rested upon the oars in a situation where looking down the lake we took into the prospect the greatest extent of water  the shore was indented by woody promontories which shot into the lake on each side to a considerable distance  to the right were the hills of furness fell which are the highest that arise immediately from the water consisting chiefly of rocks which though not rugged and deformed have their peculiar beauty being scattered over with trees and shrubs each of which grows separate and distant  the brow of this rock overlooks a pretty penisula on which the ferryboathouse stands concealing its white front in a grove of sycamores  whilst we were looking on it the boat was upon its way with several horse passengers which greatly graced the scene  to the left a small island of a circular form laid covered with a thicket of ash and birch wood beyond which the hills that arose from the lake in gentle ascents to the right were covered with rich herbage and irregular groves  on the left side of the lake enclosures of meadow sweeping gently a way from the water lay bounded by a vast tract of woods and overtopped with hills of moorish ground and heath  the most distant heights which formed the back ground were fringed with groves over which they lifted their brown eminences in various shapes   upwards on the lake we looked on a large island of about thirty acres of meagre pasture ground in an irregular oblong figure  here and there some misshapen oak trees bend their crooked branches on the sandy brinks and one little grove of sycamores shelters a cottage  the few natural beauties of this island are wounded and distorted by some ugly rows of firs set in right lines and by the works now carrying on by mr english the proprietor who is laying out gardens on a square plan building fruit walls and preparing to erect a mansion house there  the want of taste is a misfortune too often attending the opulent  the romantic site of this place on so noble a lake and surrounded with such scenes asked for the finest imagination to have designed the plan of an edifice and pleasure grounds  but instead of that to see a dutch burgomasters palace arise on this place to see a cabbage garth extend its bosom to the east squared and cut out at right angles is so offensive to the eye of the traveller that he turns away with disgust  for pleasure or for ornament a narrow foot path is cut round the margin of the island and laid with white sand resembling the dusty paths of foot passengers over stepney fields or the way along which the owner often has heyed to hackney  i would overlook this misshapen object whilst i viewed the lake upwards with its evirons  the beautiful crags of furness fell over which trees are dispersed in an agreeable wildness form the front ground on the left and by their projection cover the hills which are further advanced toward the head of the lake which makes a curve bearing from the eye  three small woody islands of a fine circular figure and swelling to a crown in their centres arise from out the lake with the deep verdure of their trees giving an agreeable teint to the azure hue the water received from reflection of the serene sky above  over an expanse of water of the length of six miles and near a mile in breadth shining and bright as a mirror we viewed the agreeable variety of the adjacent country  to the right wood lands and meadows in many little peninsulas and promontories descended with easy slopes to the brink of the lake where we viewed bownas church and its cottages arising above the trees beyond which laid the seat of fletcher fleming esquire situate on the brink of the lake and covered on every side with rich wood land  further were cots and villages dispersed on the rising ground  in the front stood ambleside and at the opening of the deep vale of rydale the house of sir michael fleming shielded on either hand by a wing of hanging forests climbing up the steeps of the mountains  the nearest back ground to the right is composed of an eminence called orresthead rising gradually to a point and cultivated to its crown which sweet mount is contrasted by the vicinage of the crags of biscothoe which overtop the extensive wood lands of mr fleming  then troutbeck parks arise where the hills begin to increase in magnitude and form the range of mountains which are extended to keswick diversified with pasturage dells and cliffs looking over which langdon pikes three mountains rising in perfect cones extend their heads surmounted only by the rocky and barren brow of kirstone fell whose cliffs overlook the whole  the lake of windermere differs very much from those of hullswater and keswick  here almost every object in view on the whole lake confesses cultivation  the islands are numerous but small and woody and rather bear a resemblance to the artificial circles raised on gentlemens ponds for their swans  the great island is little better than a bank of sand but is now under the spoiling hand of a deformer  the innumerable promontories are composed of fine meadow ground and ranges of trees  the hills except furness fell and those above ambleside are tame and on every hand a vast expanse of wood land is stretched upon the view  the painters of pousin describe the nobleness of hullswater  the works of salvator rosa express the romantic and rocky scenes of keswick  and the tender and elegant touches of claude loraine and smith pencil forth the rich variety of windermere  the greatest depth of windermere we were told was not more than forty fathom the water abounds in pike trout char eels and perch  the lake whilst we visited it was covered with the boats of fishing parties it being customary for the country people after their hay harvest to make their days of jubilee in that diversion  in the church of bownas is a window of painted glass which was preserved at the dissolution of furness abbey and brought hither  the present remains show that it has contained very fine coloring in its former state  the arms of france and england quartered are well preserved at the top of the window  the design is a crucifixion in figures as large as life by the hands feet and parts remaining it seems to have been of singular beauty  on the dexter side of the crucifixion is st george slaying the dragon on the sinister the virgin mary an uncouth assemblage  beneath are the figures of a knight and his lady kneeling before whom are a group of kneeling monks over whose heads are wrote w hartley tho honson and other names by the breaking of the glass rendered not legible   furness abbey was dedicated to st mary to whom also bownas is inscribed  we went from windermere to kendal camden writes that the southern part of this shire enclosed between the river lone and windermere is said to be fruitful in the valleys but the fells are rough and full of stony ground with rocks which bear no kind of herbage it is called the barony of kendale or candale taking its name from the river can which runs through it over a rocky channel  on the west bank of this river stands kendale a town of very great trade and resort formed by two large streets crossing each other  this is a place famed for excellent clothing and for its remarkable industry  the inhabitants carry forward an extensive trade for woollen goods known in all parts of england  they boast that this place has given title to barons and earls  their barons were the offspring of john talboys of whose race william by consent of king henry the second called himself william of lancaster whose niece and heir married gilbert the son of roger fits raniford by whose daughters after her son william was dead the inheritance descended to peter brus lord of skeleton the second of that surname and unto william lindsay from whom by the mothers side as we learn out of the leiger book of furnesse abbey ingeham lord of coney in france traced his descent by which peter bruss daughter the sister and heir of peter brus the third came this baronie to the rosses of wreke and from them by right of inheritance devolved upon the parrs of whom sir william parr was made lord parr by king henry the eighth  as for the castle the ancient seat of these lords standing over against the town through age and neglect it is falling to decay  there have been three earls of kendale john duke of bedford was advanced to that honor by his brother king henry the fifth  john duke of somerset  and john de foix of that most noble and honorable family of the foix in france whom king henry the sixth for his faithful service in the french wars preferred to that dignity     the road lies chiefly over barren and rocky hills without change or variety to afford any pleasure to the traveller toward the right in the course of the way appeared two openings which showed to us a small bay of the sea but these without any degree of beauty   we descended to the town of kendal rejoiced to change the prospect from barrenness and waste to a rich cultivated vale and a town thronged with industrious inhabitants busied in a prosperous manufactory  kendal stands on the side of a hill facing to the east  as we looked over the buildings from the heights which we were descending we had a view of the ruins of kendal castle seated on the crown of a fine eminence at the distance of half a mile from the town and separated from it by the river kan over which two stone bridges are thrown  the castle is now totally in decay and scarce gives any idea by its present appearance of its ancient strength and grandeur  on the front opposite to the town the remains of bastions are seen at the south east and north west corners whilst all behind consists of confused and ragged walls  the whole has formed a square defended by a ditch  above the town of kendal immediately opposite to the castle is a mole of a very singular form called by the inhabitants castle law hill  above the town some rocks show themselves of the height of seven fathom or near it on which a mount has been thrown up of gravel and earth of an exact circular form arising from the plane on the top of the rock near thirty feet  at the front adjoining to the town is a spacious level on part of which a bowling green is now made  the mole is defended by a deep ditch which extends itself from the brink of the rocks and on the right and left the plane is fortified by an inferior mole or mount this hill though it is much inferior to that described near peurith called maybrough or maleberge and differing from it in many circumstances such as the vallum of pebbles the surrounding groves and druidical pillar yet appeared to us to be one of the ancient parle hills of which the learned spelman gives us this description  collis vallo plerumque munitus in loco campestri ne insidius exponatur ubi convenire olim solebant centuriae aut viciniae inculae ad lites inter se tractandas and terminandas scotis reor grith hail que mons pacificationis cui asyli privilegia concedebantur see maybrough page         the crown of the great mole is flat and has been defended by a breast work of earth and a narrow ditch and from east to west a ditch is struck through the center  the whole circumference of the crown is sixtyone paces  the account given by the inhabitants of this place is that it was cast up for battering the castle  but for this purpose there was no need of so laborious a work it being also much above the level of the castle opposite to which many natural eminences might serve for that end  we passed from kendal to barrowbridge a single house situate in a very narrow deep valley hemmed in on every side by mountains covered with verdure  a fine stream serpentines through the vale and here and there little cottages are dispersed with scanty enclosures of meadow ground over which hangs a narrow wood from the rising of the hills  shut in on every side this is a place calculated for the most solemn retirement  in winter the rays of the sun for several weeks do not touch the vale but only gild the mountains along whose sides the opposite land sends an extensive shadow whose gradations are daily marked by the watchful eye of the peasant longing for returning vegetation   here might the recluse enjoy the pleasures of solitude and sacrifice to virtue  here might he avoid the sins of the world and commune with his own soul  and whilst commenting on the wondrous scene before him  look through nature up to natures god pope   we walked along the banks of the brook that murmured through the pebbles  we strayed over the little meads  we sauntered in every grove charmed with the deepness of the retirement  the pleasures of the scene were enhanced to me by my recollection of past felicity which i had enjoyed from an evening ramble in these sequestered walks  ideas flowed upon my mind replete with delicate sentiments whilst images of a happy complexion possessed reflection and presented to me my family and my beloved infants  joy and affection melted my whole soul and involuntary tears took the silent expression of my tenderness and transport  lost in selfishness i have trespassed upon my reader and covered a page with impropriety i hope the digression may be pardoned  from hence we continued our rout to kirby stephen near which place we visited the ruins of pendragon castle camden says among those hills that famous river eden which ptolemy called huna arising in yorkshire where he flows in a narrow stream increasing by degrees from various rivulets passes by pendragon castle which has nothing remaining from the wasting hand of time but merely its name and an heap of ruins and thence flows by wharton hall the seat of the barons wharton of whom the first was sir thomas wharton advanced to that dignity by king henry the eighth to whom succeeded his son of the same name and after him philip then living    of which the remains of a square tower only are left and that most probably of a modern date for this place was repaired after it had laid in ruins for near two centuries by the countess of pembroke about the time she had restored brough  the situation of this place being in a deep dell on every hand overlooked by mountains from whence it might be annoyed shows it never could be built as a place of strength but rather as a retreat and place of concealment in times of danger  opposite to this place on the other side of the dell is a small intrenchment fortified by a ditch and vallum but of what date or people no account can be obtained  the prince euter pendragon is of doubtful existence but is said to have died by treachery and poison put in a well in the year five hundred and fifteen  we passed by the ancient seat of the wharton family in wharton parks now in decay  melancholy reflections arise on such a view when the traveller must necessarily exclaim with a sigh such are the effects of dissipation and vice  the end
