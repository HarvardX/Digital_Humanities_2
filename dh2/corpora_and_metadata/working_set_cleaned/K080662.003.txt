very severe winters in summer it retires northward to breed continues the whole year in the orknies and has been shot in the hebrides in summer it frequents rivers and lakes and feeds on fish in winter it appears about sandwich with the smew redbreasted merganser and other water birds  it is common in the northern parts of the continent of europe and asia in summer is found in iceland greenland lapland and other arctic regions where it rears it is young but migrates toward the south as the winter season approaches in america also it abandons the more northern parts in winter  length of this bird is twentyeight inches breadth forty weight nearly four pounds  the bird we have figured is generally considered as the male and the dundiver as the female of the same species and among the more respectable naturalists who have held this opinion we must place linnaeus and since his time mr pennant willoughby does not seem inclined to adopt this opinion implicitly he says in the dundiver which we take to be the female of the goosander we found a large labyrinth  so that we will not be very confident that the goosander and dundiver differ no more than in sex orn p      mr latham to whose abilities and attention the science of ornithology is so much indebted has however endeavored to prove not only that they are two distinct species but that the mergus castor of linnaeus is a mere variety the specimen mr latham describes was killed on the coast of suffolk it was no bigger than the smew but agreed in the general color of its plumage with the dundiver except the neck which had a greater mixture of ash color and that it had a pale streak between the nostrils and eye of the dundiver or supposed female of the mergus merganser our present species  mr latham also observes among other minute particulars that the dundiver is ever less than the goosander and individuals of that bird differ greatly in size that in one specimen the crest of the supposed female was longer and fuller than in that thought to be the male a circumstance observed in no other bird that is furnished with a crest for in such the females in many cases have not even the rudiment of one he says also on the authority of dr heysham that the dundiver is infinitely more common in cumberland than the goosander at least ten or fifteen of the first to one of the last and he farther adds in the supplement i have been lately informed by dr heysham that he some time since dissected two dundivers the one weighing about two pounds this proved a female the eggs numerous and appearing very distinct the other bird being much larger weighed full three pounds the crest in this was longer than that of the other and the belly of a bright buff color this proved on dissection a male   plate l

places till may the female lays only one egg but that is of an extraordinary size compared with the bird being three inches long it is of a pale sea green irregularly spotted with black sometimes the ground color is white they build no nest but lay the egg on the bare rock so close to the verge of the precipice that if it is the least disturbed human ability can rarely place it on its former equilibrium if the first egg is destroyed or taken away it lays a second and sometimes a third if the second is missing  these eggs are so eagerly sought after by the inhabitants of the sea coast that they often brave the greatest dangers to find them and not unfrequently sacrifice their lives in the attempt the usual method of taking them is for two persons having a rope tied round the middle of

on the lakes of shropshire they are found in great plenty in the breeding season in the fens in fossdike wash in lincolnshire and in the fens of cambridgeshire and suffolk they feed on worms and insects which they scoop out of the mud and sand and are sometimes observed to wade or swim but always close to the shores  they lay two eggs about the size of those of a pigeon pennant says they are

they are so exquisitely softened neatly speckled and elegantly interspersed and varied with streaks and waves of black that no description can convey a just idea of its beautiful appearance  it has many characters of the swallow tribe klein has placed it in that genus and distinguishes it by its undivided tail from the other species and pennant says it may with justice be called the nocturnal swallow as it differs from the swallows chiefly in the time of its flight the latter being on the wing in the day and the goatsucker only in the evening it agrees in several respects also with the owl tribe its manners are much the same in most countries in europe it retires into some dark recess in forests woods or among rocks and never ventures out in the day time but in very gloomy weather or when disturbed as it can see best in the twilight it comes out in the dusk of the evening and morning and collects its food this it does chiefly on the wing when it finds abundance of moths and other insects stirring in the month of july it is said to live entirely on the dorr beetle or cockchaffer scarabaeus melontha  and from this circumstance charlton has called it the dorrhawk  the notes of this bird are of two kinds the loudest says pennant so much resembles that of a large spinningwheel that the welsh call this bird aderyny droell or the wheel bird and he farther adds it begins its song most punctually on the close of day sitting usually on a bare bough with its head lower than the tail the lower jaw quivering with the efforts the noise is so very violent as to give a sensible vibration to any little building it chances to alight on and emit this species of note the other is a sharp squeak which it repeats often this seems to be a note of love as it is observed to reiterate it when in pursuit of the female among the trees  the male is distinguished from the female by a large oval white spot situated on the inner web of the first three quill feathers and another at the ends of the two exterior feathers of the tail  the bill is alike in both male and female it is short but the gape is remarkably wide it is probably from the structure of the mouth that the ancients supposed this bird sucked the teats of goats in the days of aristotle this ridiculous notion was generally prevalent but among modern naturalists none except scopoli seems inclined to credit such an opinion  the female makes no nest but lays her eggs on the bare ground they are usually two in number of a whitish hue and marbled with brown  this is a very confined genus latham enumerates including his supplementary volume but seventeen species and of these we find only our present subject mentioned as a native of europe it appears to be an inhabitant of every country on the continent but is very sparingly diffused in some parts and no where common it is also said to inhabit africa and asia sonnerat met with one on the coast of coromandel with us it is a bird of passage and arrives about the latter end of may it entirely disappears in the northern parts of the kingdom in august but does not quit the southern parts till september  the size of this species is ten inches and a half

of the grebe of geneva are made into muffs tippets etc in february the skins lose the bright color and in the breeding time the breast is almost bare  mr latham gives a minute account of the plumage of this species in several stages of life he says at first they are perfectly downy and striped especially down the neck with black after this when about half grown the stripes on the neck are less distinct being rather mottled than striped and the under parts though white is clouded with dusky at this period a fullness round the head is observed as the bird advances still further toward perfection the brown and white appears clear and distinct the head becomes much tufted and the horns are a little elongated but we have great reason to believe that the bird does not obtain the full and perfect crest till the second year at least  this species is common in some parts of this country they breed in the meres of shropshire and cheshire and in the east fen of lincolnshire they are called by the country people of this part gaunts  the female lays four white eggs the size of those of a pigeon the nest in which they are deposited like others of the grebe kind are composed of different kinds of water plants such as the stalks of the water lily pond weed etc carelessly put together and left floating on the water among the flags and rushes the old bird feeds on small fish

fish and these it does not take by swimming but hovering in the air with its eye directed into the water it soon discovers it is prey when precipitating like lightning upon it it brings the fish up in its talons and retires to a distance to devour it the italians call it the leaden eagle because it descends with so much violence on its prey and latham has adopted with an  among his synonyms the

it is nest on the ground among reeds and lays three or four white eggs of an elliptical form rather less than those of a hen  ancient writers have asserted that the left foot is subpalmated many respectable naturalists of late years have followed this opinion and indeed the authority of linneus had almost finally sanctioned this error pennant contradicts this opinion and gives a faithful description of the bird and latham has added a very curious and interesting note to his account of it i do not believe says mr latham that there is either bird or quadruped in which each side of the body does not correspond in size and shape in a natural state though the contrary is sometimes seen in the insect tribe he further adds in respect to winged insects it is observed that even the marks of the wings exactly correspond on each side indeed a singular circumstance occurs in one of the blatta or cockroach genus blatta thetcroclita linneus describes this insect cassida petiveriana

small fish marine insects etc it breeds in holes that it digs in the earth or in the deserted burrows of rabbits the female lays from twelve to sixteen eggs of a roundish form and white color these are deposited at the farthest end of the hole and are carefully covered with fine down which the female supplies from her breast the old bird is very careful of her little brood and uses many cunning stratagems to draw the attention of any disturber from her young it is even said that if she cannot favor their escape from danger by that means she will carry them away in her bill or on her back the
